Trump presses for end to Russia-Ukraine war; Zelenskyy willing to step down for peace	As U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated the need to put an end to the war in Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he’d be willing to step down to achieve peace. VOA’s Veronica Balderas Iglesias has the details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-presses-for-end-to-russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-willing-to-step-down-for-peace/7985266.html	2025-02-23T11:13:39-08:00	
Captain America' dives in 2nd weekend, 'The Monkey' boosts Neon's successes	New York — 'Captain America: Brave New World' soared on opening weekend but crashed down in its second go-around with audiences. 'Brave New World,' the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn’t quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%. While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023’s 'The Marvels,' which fell 78%, and 2023’s 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,' which dropped 70%. The Anthony Mackie-led 'Captain America' installment has been slammed by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a 'B-' CinemaScore. 'Brave New World,' which fans had hoped would right the Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre- 'Avengers: Endgame' aura of invincibility. Still, 'Brave New World' has quickly grossed $289.4 million worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks, it will have scant competition through much of March. The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins’ 'The Monkey,' the director’s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, 'Longlegs.' Adapted from a Stephen King short story, 'The Monkey' opened with $14.2 million for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor. The best? 'Longlegs,' which launched with $22.4 million. Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards contender, 'Anora,' by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into next Sunday's Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday. Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of 'The Monkey,' have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on the way. Even if 'The Monkey' doesn’t reach the heights of 'Longlegs' ($126.9 million globally), Perkins and Neon return with 'Keeper' this October. 'The Monkey,' starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low. As it did with 'Longlegs,' Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for 'The Monkey,' along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was held at Los Angeles’ Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings took place at the Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan, cost $10 million to make. Lionsgate’s 'The Unbreakable Boy' opened with a paltry $2.5 million in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is autistic and has brittle bone disease. 'Paddington in Peru,' the third installment of the marmalade-mad bear, fell to third place in its second weekend. It grossed $6.5 million in 3,890 locations, bringing its two-week total to $25.2 million. 'Paddington in Peru' has been most popular overseas, where its collected $150 million thus far. 'Ne Zha 2,' the animated Chinese juggernaut, took in $3.1 million from 800 theaters in its second weekend. In China, the sequel has grossed $1.7 billion this month, setting numerous box-office records. Those totals put 'Ne Zha 2' past 'Inside Out 2' ($1.66 billion) as the highest grossing animated film ever. Top 10 movies by domestic box office With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. 1. 'Captain America: Brave New World,' $28.2 million. 2. 'The Monkey,' $14.2 million. 3. 'Paddington in Peru,' $6.5 million. 4. 'Dog Man,' $5.9 million. 5. 'Ne Zha 2,' $3.1 million. 6. 'Heart Eyes,' $2.9 million. 7. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $2.5 million. 8. 'The Unbreakable Boy,' $2.5 million. 9. 'Chhaava,' $1.5 million. 10. 'One of Them Days,' $1.4 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/captain-america-dives-in-2nd-weekend-the-monkey-boosts-neon-s-successes-/7985262.html	2025-02-23T10:57:49-08:00	
Netanyahu says Israel won't allow Syrian forces 'south of Damascus'	Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will not allow Syria's new army or the insurgent group that led the ouster of former President Bashar Assad to 'enter the area south of Damascus' as his government made clear Israeli forces would stay in parts of southern Syria for an indefinite period. Netanyahu's comments Sunday at a military graduation led to new concerns over the Israeli presence, and sway, in a swath of southern Syria as Damascus' new leaders attempt to consolidate control after years of civil war. 'Take note: We will not allow HTS forces or the new Syrian army to enter the area south of Damascus,' Netanyahu said, referring to Syria's new authorities as well as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main former rebel group. 'We demand the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Suwayda from the forces of the new regime. Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.' There was no immediate response from Syrian authorities. Defense Minister Israel Katz added that Israeli forces will remain on the peak of Mt. Hermon in southern Syria and in a buffer zone 'for an indefinite period of time to protect our communities and thwart any threat.' He said Israeli forces have built two posts on the mountain and another seven in the buffer zone 'to ensure defense and offense against any challenge.' After the fall of Assad in December, Israel seized the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory. The zone was set up under a 1974 ceasefire agreement. Syria's new authorities and U.N. officials have called for Israel to withdraw. Meanwhile, Netanyahu's government has been under pressure to protect Israelis living near border areas in the north. Katz said Israel will 'strengthen ties with friendly populations in the region,' notably the Druze, a religious minority who live in both southern Syria and in Israel's Golan Heights, where Druze navigate their historically Syrian identity while living under Israeli rule. 'We will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria,' Netanyahu said. More broadly, Israeli forces 'will not allow hostile forces to establish themselves and be present in the security zone in southern Syria from here to Damascus. And we will act against any threat,' Katz said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-says-israel-won-t-allow-syrian-forces-south-of-damascus-/7985248.html	2025-02-23T10:32:44-08:00	
Washington, Kyiv near deal for Ukrainian ‘critical minerals’ rights	The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are nearing an agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are 'making progress' in reaching a deal. He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion, although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed. The war hits the three-year mark on Monday. The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European Union. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s 'State of the Union' that he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week. Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the agreement. Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding. Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms made 'no sense' to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015. Zelenskyy said, 'I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe] Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan. And we don't have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like it and thinks that it's unjust. Maybe. I don't know. But here is what this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it's not about the figure. We simply don't see it as a loan.' Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and accused him of starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form of compensation guarantee. Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to 'understand' his position and come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend itself against the Russian invasion. 'I want very much from Trump understanding of each other,' Zelensky said at his news conference, adding: 'Security guarantees from Trump are much needed.' Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for Ukraine's entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to. 'If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready,' Zelenskyy said. 'I can exchange this for NATO [membership], if that condition is there, immediately.' The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading. 'I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,' Trump told U.S. state governors at the White House. 'They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,' Trump said of Ukraine. Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'in total alignment with the way we see things.' Witkoff said the war 'wouldn’t have had to happen' if Ukraine hadn’t been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the war. Witkoff said that eventually 'you’ll see concessions signed by both sides' in a peace deal. Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the Kyiv government. 'The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,' he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors. 'No one will ever sell off these territories,' Peskov said. 'That's the most important thing.' A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia. 'This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,' Peskov told state TV. Russia on Sunday marked Defender of the Fatherland Day — a holiday hailing soldiers and veterans. In a video released by the Kremlin, Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with 'the mission' to defend Russia. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks on Ukraine, which he condemned as 'aerial terror.' Ukrainian officials reported damage in five regions of the country. Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 35 missiles of various types.

France arrests 10 linked to escape of gang leader with Romania set to extradite him	Paris — Police have arrested 10 suspected accomplices of a suspected gangland killer described as France's 'public enemy number one,' the Paris chief prosecutor said Sunday, as Romania prepares to hand him over following his arrest in Bucharest. Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the 10 are alleged to have helped in the escape of Mohamed Amra in an ambush nine months ago in which two prison officers were shot dead and three wounded. Amra, who is accused of gangland murders and drug trafficking, was arrested near a shopping center in Bucharest on Saturday. Romania will hand him over to France within 30 days, his lawyer said after a court hearing in Bucharest. He had vanished after the attack with military-style assault weapons on a prison van carrying him in northern France last May. The brutality of the ambush, which was caught on CCTV, shocked France and Amra instantly became the country's most wanted man. The authorities tasked more than 300 investigators with finding Amra, who is known as 'La Mouche' (The Fly), and has a long history of convictions for violent crimes that started when he was in his early teens. According to a 2024 judiciary report, he started out with aggravated robberies and progressively 'slid towards violence,' eventually entering the world of organized crime. The report found that authorities underestimated for some time just how dangerous he had become. Amra is suspected of pursuing his drug-related activities from his prison cell, and even of ordering hits from detention. Facial recognition, fingerprints Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin on Sunday published an open letter to prison officers, promising them better working conditions. He also vowed the creation of 'prison police' units and a 'high security prison,' in response to concerns that it has become too easy for convicted criminals to continue their business despite being locked up, thanks notably to access to mobile phones. Such a supermax prison, to be completed within months, would keep France's '100 biggest drug traffickers' in complete isolation -- using Italian anti-mafia laws as a model — so that 'a case like Amra's can never happen again,' Darmanin said. At the time of his escape, Amra was facing one charge for attempted murder and another for participation in a gangland killing in the southern city of Marseille, a hub for drug trafficking and gang violence. The Paris prosecutor said in a statement that his 10 suspected accomplices had been detained on Saturday and early Sunday. A police source told AFP that they were arrested for the most part in Rouen and Evreux in northwestern France, and that police seized weapons during raids. 'They are suspected of having helped in the preparation and execution of the escape, and having helped the fugitive to hide,' the prosecutor said. Romanian police said Amra was arrested near a Bucharest shopping center and would be brought before a magistrate who will decide on his extradition to France. After being alerted by their French colleagues, it took Romanian police just 48 hours to locate, identify and capture Amra, the government in Bucharest said. Amra, who rejects the charges against him, had agreed to be returned to France, lawyer Maria Marcu said. 'He respects the decision of the French authorities who want to put him on trial,' she said. Beccuau said Amra, who had changed his appearance and dyed his hair, had been identified through facial recognition tools and his fingerprints. The lawyers for the families of the two agents killed in Amra's escape said they were 'relieved' that he had finally been apprehended.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-arrests-10-linked-to-escape-of-gang-leader-with-romania-set-to-extradite-him-/7985164.html	2025-02-23T08:40:01-08:00	
Rich in cash, Japan automaker Toyota builds city to test futuristic mobility	SUSONO — Woven City near Mount Fuji is where Japanese automaker Toyota plans to test everyday living with robotics, artificial intelligence and autonomous zero-emissions transportation. Daisuke Toyoda, an executive in charge of the project from the automaker's founding family, stressed it's not 'a smart city.' 'We're making a test course for mobility so that's a little bit different. We're not a real estate developer,' he said Saturday during a tour of the facility, where the first phase of construction was completed. The Associated Press was the first foreign media to get a preview of the $10 billion Woven City. The first phase spans 47,000 square meters (506,000 square feet), roughly the size of about five baseball fields. When completed, it will be 294,000 square meters (3.1 million square feet). Built on the grounds of a shuttered Toyota Motor Corp. auto plant, it's meant to be a place where researchers and startups come together to share ideas, according to Toyoda. Ambitious plans for futuristic cities have sputtered or are unfinished, including one proposed by Google's parent company Alphabet in Toronto; 'Neom' in Saudi Arabia; a project near San Francisco, spearheaded by a former Goldman Sachs trader, and Masdar City next to Abu Dhabi's airport. Woven City's construction began in 2021. All the buildings are connected by underground passageways, where autonomous vehicles will scuttle around collecting garbage and making deliveries. No one is living there yet. The first residents will total just 100 people. Called 'weavers,' they're workers at Toyota and partner companies, including instant noodle maker Nissin and Daikin, which manufactures air-conditioners. Coffee maker UCC was serving hot drinks from an autonomous-drive bus, parked in a square surrounded by still-empty apartment complexes. The city's name honors Toyota's beginnings as a maker of automatic textile looms. Sakichi Toyoda, Daisuke Toyoda's great-great-grandfather, just wanted to make life easier for his mother, who toiled on a manual loom. There was little talk of using electric vehicles, an area where Toyota has lagged. While Tesla and Byd emerged as big EV players, Toyota has been pushing hydrogen, the energy of choice in Woven City. Toyota officials acknowledged it doesn't expect to make money from Woven City, at least not for years. Keisuke Konishi, auto analyst at Quick Corporate Valuation Research Center, believes Toyota wants to work on robotic rides to rival Google's Waymo — even if it means building an entire complex. 'Toyota has the money to do all that,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rich-in-cash-japan-automaker-toyota-builds-city-to-test-futuristic-mobility/7985149.html	2025-02-23T08:15:08-08:00	
French authorities detained 4 people after stabbing linked to Islamic extremism	Paris — Four people were in custody Sunday after a deadly stabbing in eastern France that authorities linked to Islamic extremism, according to the national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office. A Portuguese man was killed in the Saturday attack in the city of Mulhouse, near the border with Germany. Seven police officers were wounded, including a parking control agent hospitalized with grave injuries, the prosecutor’s office said. Those detained include the suspected assailant, a 37-year-old Algerian man identified by prosecutors as Brahim A. The interior minister described him as an Islamic extremist with a schizophrenic profile. Two of the suspect's family members and a person who lodged him were also detained, the prosecutor's office said. French President Emmanuel Macron said the government has 'complete determination' to respond to the attack, which he blamed on 'Islamist terrorism.' France has been on high alert for extremist threats. The suspect repeatedly said, 'Allahu Akbar' — 'God is great' in Arabic — during the attack, the prosecutor said. He was armed with a knife and a screwdriver. The suspect arrived in France without papers in 2014 and was arrested and convicted of glorifying terrorism in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau told reporters Saturday night. Police experts had ″detected a schizophrenic profile″ in the suspect, he added. After several months in prison for that conviction, the suspect was confined to house arrest as authorities sought to expel him to Algeria. Retailleau criticized Algeria for resisting the return of criminals France is seeking to deport. The French government will convene a special meeting Wednesday about immigration in the wake of the attack, Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Sunday. They will notably study 19 countries 'where we have the most difficulty in returning people without papers,' Barrot said on Europe-1 radio.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-authorities-detained-4-people-after-stabbing-linked-to-islamic-extremism-/7985132.html	2025-02-23T08:06:38-08:00	
Hundreds of thousands attend the funeral of Hezbollah leader Nasrallah 5 months after his killing	BEIRUT — Hundreds of thousands of people packed into a stadium in Beirut and the streets outside Sunday for the funeral of Hezbollah's former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Nasrallah died after Israel's air force dropped more than 80 bombs on the militant group's main operations room in a southern suburb of the Lebanese capital. His death was a major blow for the Iran-backed militant group and political party that he had transformed into a potent force in the Middle East. Hezbollah is a U.S. designated terrorist group. Nasrallah was one of the group's founders and led it for more than 30 years, enjoying wide influence among Iran-backed groups in the region. He was widely respected in the so-called Iran-led axis of resistance that included Iraqi, Yemeni and Palestinian factions. Nasrallah also became an iconic figure in other parts of the Arab world after Hezbollah fought Israel to a draw in a brutal monthlong war in 2006, but the group's image in much of the region suffered after it intervened on the side of former President Bashar Assad in Syria's civil war. Hezbollah had called on its supporters to attend the funeral in large numbers in what appears to be a move to show that the group remains powerful after suffering major blows during a 14-month war with Israel that left many of its senior political and military officials dead. A Lebanese official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment estimated the crowd size at 450,000. 'This massive crowd confirms that Hezbollah is still the most popular party at the Lebanese level, and as a result, all the talk that Hezbollah is weak or degraded is out of place,' said Ali Fayyad, a lawmaker with the group's political wing, who attended the funeral. Sahar al-Attar, a mourner who traveled from Lebanon's Bekaa Valley for the funeral said,'We would have come even under bullets' to attend Nasrallah's burial. Nasrallah shared the funeral with his cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later. Nasrallah will be laid to rest later Sunday in Beirut while Safieddine will be buried in his hometown in southern Lebanon. Both had temporarily been buried in secret locations. As the coffins were paraded before the huge crowd, men riding on the platforms with them tossed flowers, while some in the crowd tossed clothing articles in the hope they would come in contact with the coffins, believing it would bless them. Outside of the stadium, giant screens were placed along the road leading to the airport, titling the funeral: 'We are committed to the covenant.' Senior Hezbollah official Ali Daamoush told reporters Saturday that about 800 prominent figures from 65 countries would attend the funeral in addition to thousands of individuals and activists from around the world. Iranian parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi were among the officials who arrived at the Lebanese capital's main sports stadium. Lebanon's parliament speaker and representatives of the president and prime minister were also in attendance. The funeral also drew non-official participants from outside of Lebanon, including some from Western countries. Irish activist Tara O'Grady waved the flag of her country and said that she came to Beirut 'to stand with the people of Lebanon and their resistance against the Zionist regime who are brutally continuing to bomb the south of Lebanon.' She likened Nasrallah to Irish early-20th century revolutionary Michael Collins. As O'Grady spoke with The Associated Press, four Israeli warplanes flew at low altitude over Beirut while Nasrallah's coffin was paraded into the stadium. The crowd chanted: 'Death to Israel' and 'at your service, Nasrallah.' Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that the fighter jets flying over the funeral 'send a clear message: Whoever threatens to annihilate Israel and strike Israel — that will be his end.' Hours before and during the funeral, the Israeli military also launched a series of strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. As part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal that ended the war with Israel on Nov. 27, Hezbollah is not supposed to have an armed presence along the border with Israel. The group was dealt another blow with the fall of the Assad family's five-decade rule in Syria in early December, which blocked a main route for the flow of weapons and money from Iran. Its rivals have been calling on it to lay down its weapons all over Lebanon and become a political faction. Nasrallah's successor, Hezbollah's current Secretary-General Naim Kassem, said in a televised speech played at the funeral that 'the resistance is still present and strong in numbers and weapons, and the inevitable victory is coming.' He was not at the stadium. Kassem added that 'Israel must withdraw from the areas it still occupies' in southern Lebanon, referring to five strategic border points where Israeli forces remain. 'We won't allow America to control our country,' he said. 'Israel will not take with politics what they did not take in the war.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-thousands-attend-the-funeral-of-hezbollah-leader-nasrallah-5-months-after-his-killing-/7985124.html	2025-02-23T07:53:26-08:00	
Congo's president says he'll create ‘unity government’ as violence spreads	KINSHASA — Congo's president says he is going to launch a unity government, as violence spreads across the country's east and pressure mounts over his handling of the crisis. On Saturday, in some of his first statements since M23 rebels captured major cities in eastern Congo, President Felix Tshisekedi, told a meeting of the Sacred Union of the Nation ruling coalition not to be distracted by internal quarrels. 'I lost the battle and not the war. I must reach out to everyone including the opposition. There will be a government of national unity,' said Tshisekedi. He didn’t give more details on what that would entail or when it would happen. M23 rebels — the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control and influence in eastern Congo — have swept through the region seizing key cities, killing some 3,000 people. In a lightning three-week offensive, the M23 took control of eastern Congo’s main city Goma and seized the second largest city, Bukavu. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, over 1,000 miles away. Rwanda has accused Congo of enlisting ethnic Hutu fighters responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus. M23 says it’s fighting to protect Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination and wants to transform Congo from a failed state to a modern one. Analysts have called those pretexts for Rwanda’s involvement. On Saturday, Tshisekedi paid tribute to soldiers who were killed and vowed to prop up the army. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-s-president-says-he-ll-create-unity-government-as-violence-spreads/7985125.html	2025-02-23T07:44:17-08:00	
Kremlin hails Putin-Trump dialogue as promising	Moscow — The Kremlin on Sunday hailed dialogue between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin — two 'extraordinary' presidents — as 'promising,' and vowed it would 'never' give up territory seized in eastern Ukraine. Trump broke with Western policy earlier this month by phoning Putin to discuss how to end the Ukraine conflict — a call hailed by Moscow as ending three years of isolation for the Kremlin leader since he launched his full-scale offensive in February 2022. Top Russian and U.S. officials then met in Saudi Arabia last week to discuss a 'restoration' of ties and start a discussion on a possible Ukraine ceasefire — all without the involvement of Kyiv or Europe. 'This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state TV on Sunday. 'That's promising,' he added. 'It is important that nothing prevents us from realizing the political will of the two heads of state.' Trump's overtures to Moscow have triggered alarm in Kyiv and across Europe. But it is unclear whether his moves will be able to bring Moscow and Kyiv closer to a truce. Peskov on Sunday ruled out any territorial concessions as part of a settlement. 'The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,' he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the offensive that were slammed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors. 'No one will ever sell off these territories. That's the most important thing.' 'God willed it' Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with 'the mission' to defend Russia. 'Fate willed it so, God willed it so, if I may say so. A mission as difficult as it is honorable — defending Russia — has been placed on our and your shoulders together,' he told servicemen who have fought in Ukraine. Russia was on Sunday marking Defender of the Fatherland Day — a holiday hailing soldiers and veterans — a day before the three-year anniversary of the start of its full-scale offensive. 'Today, at the risk of their lives and with courage, they are resolutely defending their homeland, national interests and Russia's future,' Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin. Moscow's army had overnight launched a record 267 attack drones at Ukraine, Kyiv's air force said. Among them, 138 were intercepted by air defense and 119 were 'lost.' Ukraine did not say what happened to the remaining 10 but a separate armed forces statement on Telegram said several regions, Kyiv included, had been 'hit.' AFP journalists in the Ukrainian capital heard air defense systems in operation throughout the night. 'Inappropriate remarks' Amid his outreach to Moscow, Trump has also verbally attacked Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy falsely claiming Kyiv started the war and that Zelensky was hugely unpopular at home. The bitter war of words has threatened to undermine Western support for Kyiv at a critical juncture in the conflict. Zelenskyy on Sunday called for the Western coalition that has been helping Kyiv fend off the Russian offensive for the last three years to hold strong. 'We must do our best to achieve a lasting and just peace for Ukraine. This is possible with the unity of all partners: we need the strength of the whole of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all those who want lasting peace,' Zelenskyy said on Telegram. Moscow has reveled in the spat between Trump and Zelensky. 'Zelenskyy makes inappropriate remarks addressed to the head of state. He does it repeatedly,' Peskov said Sunday. 'No president would tolerate that kind of treatment. So his [Trump's] reaction is completely quite understandable.' Scrambling to respond to Trump's dramatic policy reversal, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week to make the case for supporting Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kremlin-hails-putin-trump-dialogue-as-promising-/7985003.html	2025-02-23T04:58:01-08:00	
Russia signs memorandum to build port, oil refinery in Myanmar	Moscow — Myanmar and its close ally Russia signed a memorandum on investment cooperation in a special economic zone in Dawei, including construction of a port and an oil refinery, Russia's Ministry of Economic Development said on Sunday. The document was signed by the head of the Russian ministry, Maxim Reshetnikov, and Myanmar's minister for investment and foreign economic relations, Kan Zaw, during a visit of a Russian delegation to the Southeast Asian country. 'The text of the memorandum contains the basic parameters of several large infrastructure and energy projects that are being implemented jointly with Russian companies in Myanmar,' the Russian ministry cited Reshetnikov as saying in a statement. 'We are talking about projects to build a port, a coal-fired thermal power plant and an oil refinery.' He added that 'oil refining is still the most complex element,' and there was no final decision on construction of a refinery. 'As for the refinery — there is a desire of the Myanmar side to have a refinery. Our companies are still studying the economics of such a project, it is very complicated from the point of view of economic feasibility,' Interfax news agency cited Reshetnikov. According to the Russian ministry, the Dawei special economic zone is a 196 square-kilometer project in the Andaman Sea which is planned to house high-tech industrial zones and transport hubs, information technology zones and export processing zones. Russia has become Myanmar's closest ally since the military coup that overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected civilian government in February 2021. Moscow and Naypyidaw have been discussing a deeper energy cooperation, including Russia's participation in the construction of a gas pipeline to the Myanmar's main city Yangon. Russia has also had plans for a nuclear research reactor in the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-signs-memorandum-to-build-port-oil-refinery-in-myanmar-/7984996.html	2025-02-23T04:06:19-08:00	
Israel delays release of Palestinian prisoners, citing 'humiliating' handovers of hostages	TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel says the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is delayed 'until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies' at handovers of Israeli captives in Gaza. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office early Sunday came as vehicles apparently carrying prisoners left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in. The release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were released Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the Gaza ceasefire's first phase. Israel's announcement abruptly put the future of the truce into further doubt. The Palestinian Authority's commission for prisoners' affairs confirmed the delay 'until further notice.' The Associated Press video, recorded in the West Bank, showed prisoners' families, waiting outdoors in near-freezing weather, apparently dispersing. One woman was shown walking away in tears. The six were the last living hostages expected to be freed under the ceasefire's first phase, with a week remaining in the initial stage. Talks on the ceasefire's second phase are yet to start. The six included three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another taken while visiting family in southern Israel during the October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, that triggered the 16-month war in Gaza. The two others were held for a decade after entering Gaza on their own. Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were released together. Cohen's family and friends in Israel chanted 'Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!' and cheered. 'You're heroes,' Shem Tov told his parents as they later embraced, laughing and crying. 'You have no idea how much I dreamt of you.' His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 17 kilograms (37 pounds). Earlier Saturday, Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38, were freed. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. The Israeli-Austrian Shoham was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife and two children were freed in a 2023 exchange. Later, Israel's military said Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released. The Bedouin-Israeli entered Gaza in 2015. His family had told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia. Israel's government didn't respond to questions about the delay in releasing prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal, with spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanou accusing Netanyahu of 'deliberately stalling.' The hostage release followed a heartrending dispute when Hamas on Thursday handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted with her two young boys. The remains were determined to be those of an unnamed Palestinian woman. Netanyahu vowed revenge for 'a cruel and malicious violation.' Hamas suggested it was a mistake. Israeli forensic authorities confirmed a body handed over Friday was Bibas. Dr. Chen Kugel, head of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said they found no evidence Bibas and her children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as Hamas has claimed. Kugel did not give a cause. Difficult talks likely over the ceasefire's next phase The ceasefire deal has paused the deadliest and most devastating fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, but there are fears the war will resume. Negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase are likely to be more difficult. Hamas had said it will release four bodies next week, completing the truce's first phase. After that, Hamas will hold over 60 hostages — about half believed to be alive. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu, with the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, says he's committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 Hamas terrorists, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million population. The October 7, 2023, terrorist attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died in the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-delays-release-of-palestinian-prisoners-citing-humiliating-handovers-of-hostages-/7984992.html	2025-02-23T03:37:53-08:00	
Vatican: Ailing Pope Francis 'rested during a peaceful night'	ROME — Pope Francis, in critical condition with a complicated lung infection, rested well during a peaceful night following a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions, the Vatican said Sunday. Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni's one-line statement didn't mention if Francis was up or eating breakfast. 'The night passed quietly, the pope rested.' The brief update came after doctors said the 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was in critical condition. On Saturday morning, he suffered a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection. The pope received 'high flows' of oxygen to help him breathe. He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update. The Saturday statement also said that the pontiff 'continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday.' Doctors said the prognosis was 'reserved.' Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. Main threat facing pope is sepsis They have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. Saturday’s blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition called platelopenia or thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal. Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Francis, who has chronic lung disease and is prone to bronchitis in winter, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Speculation that Francis might resign Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious, alert, eating and working. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred. Parolin said such speculation seemed 'useless' when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican. 'On the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumors can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,' Parolin was quoted as saying. 'However, I don’t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven’t heard anything like that.' Holy Year celebrations continue Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Holy Year weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood. In his place, the Holy Year organizer was to celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second consecutive weekend, Francis is skipping his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it. 'Look, even though he’s not [physically] here, we know he’s here,' said Luis Arnaldo Lopez Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico, who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. 'He’s recovering, but he’s in our hearts and is accompanying us, because our prayers and his go together.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-ailing-pope-francis-rested-during-a-peaceful-night-/7984949.html	2025-02-23T00:58:10-08:00	
Encroaching desert threatens to swallow Mauritania's homes, history	CHINGUETTI, MAURITANIA — For centuries, poets, scholars and theologians have flocked to Chinguetti, a trans-Saharan trading post home to more than a dozen libraries containing thousands of manuscripts. But it now stands on the brink of oblivion. Shifting sands have long covered the ancient city's 8th-century core and are encroaching on neighborhoods at its current edge. Residents say the desert is their destiny. As the world's climate gets hotter and drier, sandstorms are more frequently depositing centimeters of dunes onto Chinguetti's streets and in people's homes, submerging some entirely. Tree-planting projects are trying to keep the invading sands at bay, but so far, they haven't eased the deep-rooted worries about the future. Chinguetti is one of four UNESCO World Heritage sites in Mauritania, a West African nation where only 0.5% of land is considered farmable. In Africa — the continent that contributes the least to fossil fuel emissions — only Somalia and Eswatini have experienced more climate change impacts, according to World Bank data. Mauritanians believe Chinguetti is among Islam's holiest cities. Its dry stone and mud mortar homes, mosques and libraries store some of West Africa's oldest quranic texts and manuscripts, covering topics ranging from law to mathematics. Community leader Melainine Med El Wely feels agonized over the stakes for residents and the history contained within Chinguetti's walls. It's like watching a natural disaster in slow motion, he said. 'It's a city surrounded by an ocean of sand that's advancing every minute,' El Wely, the president of the local Association for Participatory Oasis Management, said. 'There are places that I walk now that I remember being the roofs of houses when I was a kid.' He remembers that once when enough sand blew into his neighborhood to cover the palms used to make roofs, an unknowing camel walking through the neighborhood plunged into what was once someone's living room. Research suggests sand migration plays a significant role in desertification. Deserts, including the Sahara, are expanding at unprecedented rates and 'sand seas' are being reactivated, with blowing dunes transforming landscapes where vegetation once stood. 'What we used to think of as the worst case scenario five to 10 years ago is now actually looking like a more likely scenario than we had in mind,' said Andreas Baas, an earth scientist from King's College London who researches how winds and the way they blow sand are changing. More than three-quarters of the earth's land has become drier in recent decades, according to a 2024 United Nations report on desertification. The aridity has imperiled ability of plants, humans and animals to survive. It robs lands of the moisture needed to sustain life, kills crops and can cause sandstorms and wildfires. 'Human-caused climate change is the culprit; known for making the planet warmer, it is also making more and more land drier,' the U.N. report said. 'Aridity-related water scarcity is causing illness and death and spurring large-scale forced migration around the world.' Scientists and policymakers are mostly concerned about soils degrading in once-fertile regions that are gradually becoming wastelands, rather than areas deep in the Sahara Desert. Still, in Chinguetti, a changing climate is ushering in many of the consequences that officials have warned about. Trees are withering, wells are running dry and livelihoods are vanishing. Date farmers like 50-year-old Salima Ould Salem have found it increasingly difficult to nourish their palm trees, and now have to pipe in water from tanks and prune more thoroughly to make sure it's used efficiently. Salem's neighborhood used to be full of families, but they've gradually moved away. Sand now blocks the doorway to his home. It's buried those where some of his neighbors once lived. And a nearby guesthouse built by a Belgian investor decades ago is now half-submerged in a rippling copper-hued dune. Though many have departed, Salem remains, aware that each time a member of the community leaves, their home can no long serve as a bulwark and the rest of the community therefore becomes more likely to be swallowed by the desert. 'We prefer to stay here. If I leave, my place will disappear,' Salem said. Acacia, gum and palm trees once shielded the neighborhood from encroaching dunes, but they've gradually disappeared. The trees have either died of thirst or have been cut down by residents needing firewood or foliage for their herds to feed on. Sandstorms are not new but have become increasingly intrusive, each leaving inches or feet in the neighborhoods on the edge of the city, retired teacher Mohamed Lemine Bahane said. Residents use mules and carts to remove the sand because the old city's streets are too narrow to accommodate cars or bulldozers. When sand piles high enough, some build new walls atop existing structures. 'When you remove the vegetation, it gives the dunes a chance to become more active, because it's ultimately the vegetation that can hold down the sand so it doesn't blow too much,' Bahane said. Bahane has for years taken measurements of the sand deposits and rains and says that Chinguetti has received an annual average of 2.5 centimeters of rainfall over the past decade. As rainfall plummets, trees die, and more sand migrates into town. And with shorter acacia trees submerged in sand, some herders resort to cutting down date palm trees to feed their flocks, further disrupting the ecosystem and date farming economy. The sands also raise public health concerns for the community breathing in the dust, Bahane said. The solution, he believes, has to be planting more trees both in neighborhoods and along the perimeter of town. Such 'green belts' have been proposed on a continent-wide scale as Africa's 'Great Green Wall' as well as locally, in towns like Chinguetti. Mauritania's Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Agriculture as well as European-funded NGOs have floated projects to plant trees to insulate the city's libraries and manuscripts from the incoming desert. Though some have been replanted, there's little sign that it has contributed to stopping the desert in its tracks. It can take years for taproots to grow deep enough into the earth to access groundwater. 'We're convinced that desertification is our destiny. But thankfully, there are still people convinced that it can be resisted,' El Wely, the community leader, said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---mauritania-residents-say-the-desert-is-their-destiny-/7984232.html	2025-02-22T23:44:17-08:00	
Philippine village battles dengue by offering bounties for mosquitos — dead or alive	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos — dead or alive. The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection. At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected. A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal declogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle. 'There was an alarm,' Cernal told The Associated Press. 'I found a way.' Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said. Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases. As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents). 'This is a big help,' Labag said, smiling. 'I can buy coffee.' Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person's fluid levels is seen as critical. Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes. Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it's crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said. Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-village-battles-dengue-by-offering-bounties-for-mosquitos-dead-or-alive/7984215.html	2025-02-22T23:43:32-08:00	
Beauty market targets young at heart in aging Japan	TOKYO — Yoshiko Abe is about to turn 89, but that hasn't stopped her from going to the gym every day and trying the free-of-charge makeup course at her housing complex. 'It was really helpful,' she said, all smiles and glowing after putting on foundation and pink lipstick, something she hadn't done in years. Japan has the largest percentage of older citizens than any other country in the world. More than a quarter of Japan's population is 65 and older, at 36 million people. In about a decade, the ratio will be one in three. No wonder the young-at-heart, like Abe, is a growing target for Japan Inc. The market for older people is estimated to grow to more than 100 trillion yen ($650 billion) in size this year, according to a study by Mizuho Bank. And that business isn't just about remedies for sicknesses and old folks' homes but taps into solid consumerism. The growth of artificial intelligence and robotics also offers promise for such services and gadgetry. Akira Shimizu, professor of business at Keio University, calls them 'cool grandpas and cute grannies' who remain sensitive to trends, including the latest luxury and health products. 'They think about the clothing and makeup that express their style,' he said. From luxury cruises and 'oldies' rock concerts, companies are leveraging the fact that older people these days remain active, go out with friends and on dates, so they want to dress up and look good, said Shimizu. Maintaining one's looks is good physical exercise because it takes hand agility to open cosmetics tubes and draw eyebrows nicely, and massaging the face gets one's saliva glands going, according to Miwa Hiraku, the makeover class instructor from the Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido. Shiseido Co., which started out as a pharmacy in 1872, said that makeup is not just good for your physical well-being but also your soul. The company has been holding free makeup courses for older people across the country. 'Putting on makeup works as a switch to turn on your energy at the start of your day,' said Hiraku, who vows to wear makeup even at 100. 'It's not just about looking beautiful. It's about living a long healthy life.' Yoshihiko Hotta, 85, the only man in the class of about 30 people, didn't try the rouge but happily put on the hand cream and went along with all the exercise routines. While acknowledging he felt some effects of aging like sore legs, he declared with conviction: 'I don't think age is relevant.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/beauty-market-targets-young-at-heart-in-aging-japan/7982895.html	2025-02-22T23:42:51-08:00	
Mystical beliefs fuel Senegal's illegal big cat trade	NIOKOLO-KOBA NATIONAL PARK, SENEGAL — The morning sun slants through the canopy of Senegal's Niokolo-Koba National Park as Sgt. Abdou Diouf and his brigade of rangers march in single file, guns at the ready. They scan the brush for signs of poachers, but today, it seems, the only hunters are the lions themselves, their fresh tracks pressed into the sand. As the sun climbs, a guttural call reverberates across the forest. The rangers pause. 'Lions,' Diouf says. Spanning more than 9,000 square kilometers – double the size of Rhode Island – Niokolo-Koba is the last sanctuary in Senegal for lions, which are critically endangered in West Africa. But even here, they find little respite. Driven by deeply rooted beliefs in the mystical powers of animal skin talismans known as 'gris-gris,' the illegal trade of lion and leopard parts is growing, according to a new report by wild cat conservation group Panthera. Panthera's investigation found lion and leopard parts sold in 80% of markets surveyed, with 63% of artisans reporting increased sales in recent years. For Niokolo-Koba's lions, the impact has been devastating. Despite enhanced protections that doubled the population to around 35 since 2017, helping delist the park as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in danger, an unsustainable average of two cats are still lost to poachers each year. The only other place lions are found in West Africa is in the W-Arly-Pendjari Complex, a border region of Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger, and Panthera estimates there are fewer than 250 adults left in the region. The allure of the gris-gris The gris-gris, prescribed by influential religious leaders called marabouts, are crafted from bits of skin with written prayers or Quranic verses sewn inside. They are widely used across Senegal; police don them for protection, wrestlers for strength, politicians for clout. Average citizens wear them to ward off curses that other people may have put on them for a variety of reasons — matters of romance, perhaps, or jealousy at economic success. Gris-gris are rooted in traditional African faiths that believe vital powers in animals and nature may be unlocked — to harm, to heal, or to protect, said Dr. Cheikh Babou, a history professor and expert in West African Islam at the University of Pennsylvania. With Islam's arrival in West Africa in the eighth century, gris-gris became hybrid objects, melding Quranic verses with the perceived powers of animal parts. 'People started to drink the Quran, to wear the Quran – in the same way that they did with animals,' Babou said. Reverence for the lion makes it a special gris-gris At a market stall in Tambacounda, Ibrahim, a customer who asked that his last name be withheld because the trade of lion parts is illegal, wears several amulets around his waist. Made from hyena, honey badger, goat, fox, jackal, monkey, and lion, each serves a specific purpose. He began wearing them years ago after falling ill; someone had cast a spell on him, he said, so he went to a marabout who prescribed the gris-gris. 'Here in Africa people are very mean,' he said. 'If they see you succeed a little, they will go to the marabout. They don't want to see you in good health.' Traditional African societies are very egalitarian, Babou said – those with wealth are expected to share it. 'Those who don't share break the ethic of communalism. And when you do that, you become a witch.' A gris-gris can offer protection from those looking to retaliate. Among these protective talismans, lion parts hold particular allure. As the national emblem, the image of the lion adorns everything from the country's coat of arms to billboard advertisements, and it serves as namesake for the beloved national soccer team, the Lions of Teranga. 'You cannot prevent a Senegalese person from believing that a lion skin has some kind of power,' said Daouda Ngom, Senegal's minister of Environment and Ecological Transition. Smuggling networks are tough to dislodge This demand has given rise to a complex smuggling network that spans the continent. Likely sourced from East and Southern Africa, the skins travel by public bus and truck along clandestine routes through the Sahel region, evading checkpoints and border security on their journey into Senegal, according to Panthera's report. 'These are well-established networks,' said Paul Diedhiou, the director of Niokolo-Koba National Park. 'Dismantling them requires time, strategy and a lot of professionalism.' Between 2019 and 2024, authorities in Senegal confiscated some 40 lion and leopard skins, according to the Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement (EAGLE) Network, a wildlife law enforcement organization operating across Africa. During that same period, 40 people were arrested for trafficking skins and other parts such as teeth, claws, and skulls. 'These seizures represent only a fraction of the actual trade,' said Cécile Bloch, coordinator of EAGLE Senegal. 'Today, traffickers cut lion skins into thousands of pieces to cross borders more easily and avoid detection in local markets.' Since partnering with Niokolo-Koba in 2016, Panthera has helped strengthen security measures. The conservation group tripled the park's anti-poaching force from 20 to 60 agents, equipping them with vehicles and gear, while investing more than $7 million in infrastructure – including a ranger base with an airstrip, hundreds of camera traps, and new roads and bridges. Lions' fate may depend on convincing marabouts to change Yet the crisis' roots run deeper than poaching. At its heart are the marabouts whose gris-gris prescriptions drive the trade. Those involved often see no contradiction between their prescription or purchase of lion parts and their desire to protect the species, the Panthera report found. As one marabout, Cheikh Camara, put it in an interview with The Associated Press: 'I prescribe the gris-gris to help people get better. It's the poaching that's making the lions go extinct.' At the park's headquarters, the scale of the challenge is clear. A storeroom overflows with confiscated skins — leopards, lions, antelopes, even a crocodile. A rusting phalanx of seized firearms hangs on the wall. 'Sometimes the poachers fire at you,' said Diouf, the sergeant. 'It's very risky.' Such dangers are compounded by Senegal's toothless hunting and wildlife laws, which date to 1986. Recent arrests include a Burkinabe man found with leopard and lion parts who was sentenced to just one month in prison, while a Malian trafficker received the same penalty for smuggling leopard skins. One vendor told AP he can get a little over $3 for a small bit of lion skin that makes a single gris-gris. A belt can go for the equivalent of nearly $80, he said. The Panthera report said an entire lion skin can fetch the equivalent of $1,900 or more. 'The sentences are too short,' said Ndeye Seck, the head of litigation and armament for the parks department. 'We would like to see the hunting and protection of wildlife codes updated.' Ngom, the environment minister who assumed his role early last year, said pushing through tougher laws will be a priority for his team. But the battle to protect Senegal's lions is as much about culture as enforcement, and lasting change will require rethinking the role of gris-gris in modern Senegalese society, Babou said. 'Culture is very powerful,' he said. 'Until you can convince people that there are more effective tools to achieve your goals, then they will continue to believe in it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mystical-beliefs-fuel-senegal-s-illegal-big-cat-trade/7982878.html	2025-02-22T23:42:13-08:00	
Afghan women's radio station to resume broadcasts after Taliban say they're lifting suspension	An Afghan women's radio station will resume broadcasts after the Taliban suspended its operations, citing 'unauthorized provision' of content to an overseas TV channel and improperly using its license. Radio Begum launched on International Women's Day in March 2021, five months before the Taliban seized power amid the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops. The station's content is produced entirely by Afghan women. Its sister satellite channel, Begum TV, operates from France and broadcasts programs that cover the Afghan school curriculum from seventh to 12th grade. The Taliban have banned education for women and girls in the country beyond grade six. In a statement issued Saturday night, the Taliban's Information and Culture Ministry said Radio Begum had 'repeatedly requested' to restart operations and that the suspension was lifted after the station made commitments to authorities. The station pledged to conduct broadcasts 'in accordance with the principles of journalism and the regulations of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, and to avoid any violations in the future,' it added. The ministry did not elaborate what those principles and regulations were. Radio Begum was not immediately available for comment. Since their takeover, the Taliban have excluded women from education, many kinds of work, and public spaces. Journalists, especially women, have lost their jobs as the Taliban tighten their grip on the media. In the 2024 press freedom index from Reporters without Borders, Afghanistan ranks 178 out of 180 countries. The year before that it ranked 152. The Information Ministry did not initially identify the TV channel it alleged Radio Begum had been working with.

Well-off Hong Kong daunted by record deficits	HONG KONG — Hong Kong is facing its toughest fiscal test in three decades following a painful run of mammoth deficits, with experts urging the government to make careful cuts as the economy wobbles. The Chinese finance hub last saw a string of deficits after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s -- but their scale was a fraction of the $32.4 billion shortfall in the 2020-21 fiscal year. Hong Kong has recorded annual deficits exceeding $20 billion in three of the past four years, according to official figures. The city's finance chief, Paul Chan, said Sunday that the deficits were caused by 'multiple internal and external challenges' and that a new budget unveiled on Wednesday will tightly control public spending. While Chan earlier predicted a return to surplus in 'three or so years,' a former government minister told AFP that the situation is 'not just due to economic cycles' spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. 'If you look at Hong Kong versus other economies in the region, for example Singapore, those other economies have done much better,' said Anthony Cheung, who oversaw transport and housing policies. Adding to the headache is the exodus of companies and high-paid workers as the city's international reputation took a hit after Beijing quelled pro-democracy protests and imposed a sweeping national security law in 2020. Singapore and Hong Kong suffered towering deficits in 2020 because of the pandemic, but the former has been able to keep spending relative to income in check as firms shift there from the Chinese city, helping it outperform its fiscal targets. The challenge for Hong Kong is not just to balance its books, but to find fiscal sustainability amid U.S.-China tensions and a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, Cheung said. 'In the past, we assumed that Hong Kong was geopolitically well-positioned. ... Now we have to be more careful about such presumptions.' Plunging land sales Hong Kong is required by its mini-constitution to 'strive to achieve a fiscal balance' -- a holdover from British colonial rule that kept the market mostly free from government intervention. After returning to China in 1997, it kept taxes low and refilled its coffers with the help of land-related revenue, selling land to developers with deep pockets. But last year Hong Kong collected just $2.5 billion that way, from a peak of $21.2 billion in 2018. '[Land-related revenue] by itself has contributed to the majority of the income decline,' said Yang Liu, a financial economist at the University of Hong Kong. 'We have a very inactive land market and declining housing prices. That's one reason that people [don't] trade, so there's no tax [income],' Liu told AFP. Hong Kong still has healthy cash reserves and low government debt compared with most economies around the world. But the prospect of three straight years in the red has fueled public debate on how to spend less. 'All the new initiatives will be under much stronger scrutiny, so [the government} will be a lot more disciplined, a lot more careful,' Liu said. In his upcoming budget speech, the finance chief is set to put the latest deficit at 'under HK$100 billion,' or $13 billion, adjusting for money raised from bond sales. There are calls to roll back a transport subsidy for those aged 60 to 64, which can grow into a major burden on the government as Hong Kong's population ages. Lawmaker Edmund Wong cautioned against pay cuts for civil servants, which he said may cause private-sector employers to follow suit, but urged the government to slim down. 'In the long term, we can greatly reduce the manpower which the government is employing now,' he told AFP. 'Welcoming' image The deficits could prompt Hong Kong to rethink how it makes money, though past discussions on expanding the tax base -- such as a goods and services tax -- went nowhere. The city's low ratio of debt to gross domestic product -- which the government last year put at no more than 13% -- means it can afford to issue bonds to fund huge undertakings, experts say. Officials have signaled they will push ahead with a massive infrastructure project in northern Hong Kong, while backing away from a separate plan to create artificial islands. As tensions flare between the United States and China, Hong Kong is seeking untapped growth potential in the Middle East and Southeast Asia that can translate to government revenue down the line. The city's economic fortunes are ultimately tied to how investors view the city as a regional and global hub, said Cheung, the former minister. 'We have to continue to showcase Hong Kong as a city that welcomes all kinds of views, all kinds of people, so long as they stay within the parameters of the national security legislation,' Cheung said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/well-off-hong-kong-daunted-by-record-deficits/7984933.html	2025-02-22T22:56:59-08:00	
Discontented Germany votes in an election with economy, migration and far-right strength in focus	BERLIN — German voters are choosing a new government in an election Sunday dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe's biggest economy, pressure to curb migration and growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe's alliance with the United States. The center-right opposition is favored to win, while polls point to the strongest result for a far-right party since World War II. Germany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It has been Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S. It will be central to shaping the continent's response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administration's confrontational foreign and trade policy. What are Germans voting for? More than 59 million people in the nation of 84 million are eligible to elect the 630 members of the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, who will take their seats under the glass dome of Berlin's landmark Reichstag building. Germany's electoral system rarely produces absolute majorities, and no party looks anywhere near one this time. It's expected that two or more parties will form a coalition, following potentially difficult negotiations that will take weeks or even months before the Bundestag elects the next chancellor. This election is taking place seven months before it was originally planned after center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting. There's widespread discontent and not much enthusiasm for any of the candidates. Who could take charge? Center-right opposition leader Friedrich Merz's Union bloc has consistently led polls, with 28-32% support in the most recent surveys, and Merz is favored to replace Scholz. Scholz's Social Democrats have been polling between 14% and 16%, which would be their worst postwar result in a national parliamentary election. The far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has been running in second place with around 20% of the vote — well above its previous best of 12.6% in a national election, from 2017 — and has fielded its first candidate for chancellor in Alice Weidel. But other parties say they won't work with it, a stance often known as the 'firewall.' The environmentalist Greens also are running for the top job, with outgoing Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, but have been polling a little behind Scholz's party. Merz has pledged 'stability instead of chaos' after Scholz's three-party coalition collapsed following long-running internal arguments, including over how to revitalize the economy. But it's unclear whether the conservative leader, if he wins, will be able to put together a stable government that does much better. Merz hopes for a two-party coalition but may end up needing a third partner to form a government. The realistic candidates to join a Merz government are Scholz's Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats — who were the smallest partner in Scholz's collapsed government and may not manage to stay in parliament. The Free Democrats and another small party are hovering are hovering at around 5% of the vote, the threshold to qualify for seats in parliament. If they do, there may be no majority for a two-party coalition. What are the main issues? The contenders have made contrasting proposals to turn around the German economy, which has shrunk for the past two years and hasn't managed real growth in much longer. That's going to be a central job for the new government. Migration moved to the forefront of the campaign in the past month following deadly attacks committed by immigrants. Merz vowed to bar people from entering the country without proper papers and to step up deportations if he is elected chancellor. He then brought a nonbinding motion calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany's borders. Parliament approved it by a narrow majority thanks to AfD votes — a first in postwar Germany. Rivals made Merz's attitude toward AfD, which generated protests, an issue. Scholz accused Merz of 'irresponsible gambling' and breaking a taboo. Merz has rejected those accusations, saying that he didn't and won't work with AfD. He has repeatedly and categorically said since that his party will 'never' do so. Mainstream parties have vowed to keep up support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. And after the Scholz government reached a NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, the next administration will have to find a way to keep that going — and likely expand it, in the face of U.S. demands — once a special 100 billion-euro ($105 billion) fund to modernize the military is used up in 2027.	https://www.voanews.com/a/discontented-germany-votes-in-an-election-with-economy-migration-and-far-right-strength-in-focus/7984932.html	2025-02-22T22:39:55-08:00	
New FBI Director Patel will also be named acting head of firearms agency, official says	WASHINGTON — New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department official said Saturday. Patel could be sworn in next week, the official said, putting Patel in charge of two of the Justice Department's largest agencies in an unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau that has long drawn the ire of conservatives. The Justice Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the move before it's announced publicly. White House officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening. Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate approval despite Democrats' concerns about the steadfast Trump ally's plans to radically overhaul the FBI. ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is responsible for enforcing the nation's laws around firearms, explosives and arson. Among other things, it's in charge of licensing federal firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations. The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News. The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF's top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was 'targeting gun owners.' Hicks, who spent more than 20 years as a Justice Department lawyer, said in a social media post that being ATF chief counsel was the 'highest honor' of her career. Conservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores. In an executive order earlier this month, President Donald Trump directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden administration around firearms 'to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.' Gun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a 'known gun rights extremist.' Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his confirmation as FBI director 'a major victory for gun owners and constitutional rights advocates nationwide.' The last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month. He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the politically fraught process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-fbi-director-patel-will-also-be-named-acting-head-of-firearms-agency-official-says/7984917.html	2025-02-22T20:01:31-08:00	
Israel delays release of Palestinian prisoners, citing 'humiliating' handovers of hostages	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — Israel says the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is delayed 'until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies' at handovers of Israeli captives in Gaza. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office early Sunday came as vehicles apparently carrying prisoners left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in. The release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were released Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the Gaza ceasefire's first phase. Israel's announcement abruptly put the future of the truce into further doubt. The Palestinian Authority's commission for prisoners' affairs confirmed the delay 'until further notice.' The Associated Press video, recorded in the West Bank, showed prisoners' families, waiting outdoors in near-freezing weather, apparently dispersing. One woman was shown walking away in tears. The six were the last living hostages expected to be freed under the ceasefire's first phase, with a week remaining in the initial stage. Talks on the ceasefire's second phase are yet to start. The six included three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another taken while visiting family in southern Israel during the October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, that triggered the 16-month war in Gaza. The two others were held for a decade after entering Gaza on their own. Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were released together. Cohen's family and friends in Israel chanted 'Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!' and cheered. 'You're heroes,' Shem Tov told his parents as they later embraced, laughing and crying. 'You have no idea how much I dreamt of you.' His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 17 kilograms (37 pounds). Earlier Saturday, Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38, were freed. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. The Israeli-Austrian Shoham was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife and two children were freed in a 2023 exchange. Later, Israel's military said Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released. The Bedouin-Israeli entered Gaza in 2015. His family had told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia. Accusations of 'stalling' Israel's government didn't respond to questions about the delay in releasing prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal, with spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanou accusing Netanyahu of 'deliberately stalling.' The hostage release followed a heartrending dispute when Hamas on Thursday handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted with her two young boys. The remains were determined to be those of an unnamed Palestinian woman. Netanyahu vowed revenge for 'a cruel and malicious violation.' Hamas suggested it was a mistake. Israeli forensic authorities confirmed a body handed over Friday was Bibas. Dr. Chen Kugel, head of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said they found no evidence Bibas and her children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as Hamas has claimed. Kugel did not give a cause. Difficult talks likely The ceasefire deal has paused the deadliest and most devastating fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, but there are fears the war will resume. Negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase are likely to be more difficult. Hamas had said it will release four bodies next week, completing the truce's first phase. After that, Hamas will hold over 60 hostages — about half believed to be alive. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu, with the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, says he's committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 Hamas terrorists, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million population. The October 7, 2023, terrorist attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died in the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-delays-release-of-palestinian-prisoners-citing-humiliating-handovers-of-hostages-/7984903.html	2025-02-22T18:28:53-08:00	
Pakistan threatens to deport Afghans if US relocation timeline isn’t met	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has warned that thousands of Afghan nationals awaiting relocation and resettlement in the United States will be deported to Afghanistan if their cases are rejected or not processed on time. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar issued the warning during a television interview aired Saturday, noting that the U.S. has promised to relocate the Afghan community in question from Pakistan 'tentatively around September this year.' His office in Islamabad released the interview excerpts. 'If any refugee who was undertaken to be taken by another country after due process —no matter the timeline — if it doesn’t happen and the country refuses, then for us, that will be an illegal immigrant in Pakistan, and we might be forced to send such refugee back to [their] original country, which is Afghanistan,' Dar told Turkey’s TRT national broadcaster. However, the chief Pakistani diplomat expressed Islamabad’s willingness to resolve the issue with Washington, stating that his government is 'examining the situation and will negotiate [accordingly].' Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump halted refugee applications and travel plans until further notice to ensure that refugee entry into the United States aligns with its national interests. The decision has stranded around 45,000 Afghans prepared to fly out of Afghanistan and at least 15,000 qualified refugees currently in Pakistan, according to #AfghanEvac, a coalition that assists Afghans with their relocation and resettlement in the U.S. These individuals were part of Afghan families who fled their country following the Taliban insurgents’ retaking of power in 2021, primarily seeking refuge from potential retribution because of their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces during their nearly two-decade-long presence in Afghanistan. While about 80,000 of these Afghans have since been relocated from Pakistan, officials in Islamabad assert that around 40,000 remain in a state of limbo including around 15,000 in Pakistan destined for the United States. Since launching a crackdown on undocumented foreign migrants in September 2023, Pakistan has forcibly repatriated more than 825,000 undocumented Afghan refugees to their home country, according to the United Nations. The government has recently intensified its crackdown, targeting both documented and undocumented Afghan refugees. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered authorities last month to remove all Afghans from Islamabad and the adjoining city of Rawalpindi by Feb. 28 before arranging for deporting them to Afghanistan along with others subsequently. The targeted population encompasses over 2.5 million Afghans nationwide, comprising lawful refugees, documented economic migrants, and those without legal authorization to remain in Pakistan. Sharif’s directive stipulates March 31 as the deadline for the United States and other countries to process the cases of Afghans awaiting resettlements, thereby preventing their deportation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-threatens-to-deport-afghans-if-us-relocation-timeline-isn-t-met/7984905.html	2025-02-22T18:20:28-08:00	
Macron, Starmer to meet Trump, offer ideas for Ukraine security guarantees	LONDON/PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump's hardening stance toward Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict. The leaders of Europe's two nuclear powers, who will be traveling separately, are expected to try to persuade Trump not to rush into a ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and discuss military guarantees to Ukraine. Macron, who is trying to capitalize on a relationship with Trump built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal weakness to the United States' foes, including China and Iran. 'I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of President (Putin). It's not you, it's not what you're made of and it's not in your interests,' he said in an hourlong question and answer session on social media ahead of Monday's visit to the White House. The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump described as a 'dictator.' That has alarmed Kyiv's European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European politics. Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American University in Paris, said Trump's rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a major shock for the Europeans. 'They could not have expected that somehow within the United States would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would actually challenge Europe's voice in world affairs in such a stark and strong way,' he told Reuters. He said Macron believed he had a 'historic role to play' in going to Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on Ukraine. 'Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this visit is an entirely different matter,' he added. Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a 'temporary pause before Putin attacks again,' will be in Washington on Thursday. Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and Starmer had not 'done anything' to end the war. 'No meetings with Russia!' he said, although he described Macron as 'a friend of mine' and Starmer as 'a very nice guy.' However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to take on a bigger burden for European security. Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to persuade Trump to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials said. Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two diplomats said. They have also been supported in putting together an array of options by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and peacekeepers required, officials said. While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, center around providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said. Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe for international shipping, the official said. Part of the British and French talks center around the possibility of sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial. The options being discussed would center not on providing troops for the frontline or the 2,000-kilometer border which would remain secured by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats and the military official said. Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose a European presence in Ukraine. A French military official said there was little sense in talking numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European troops would also be involved. 'It's not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It's the ability to mobilize and the ability to arrange everything into a package of interoperability units,' the French official said. A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the 'high side.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-starmer-to-meet-trump-offer-ideas-for-ukraine-security-guarantees/7984899.html	2025-02-22T17:57:16-08:00	
Poland pays for Ukraine's Starlink subscription, says its deputy PM	WARSAW, POLAND — Poland said Saturday it has been paying for Ukraine's Starlink subscription and will continue to do so despite sources saying the United States could consider cutting Ukraine's access to the satellite internet system. U.S. negotiators pressing Kyiv for access to Ukraine's critical minerals have raised the possibility of cutting the country's access to Elon Musk's vital Starlink satellite internet system, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Starlink provides crucial internet connectivity to the war-torn country and its military. 'We pay and will continue to pay a subscription fee for satellite internet for Ukraine,' Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said in a post on Musk-owned social media platform X. 'I cannot imagine that someone could decide to terminate a business contract for a commercial service to which Poland is a party,' added Gawkowski, who is also Poland's digital affairs minister. SpaceX, which operates Starlink, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Ukrainian military officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Poland has delivered 20,000 Starlink units to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022, and has been funding their maintenance to support internet connectivity, according to information on the Polish presidency's website. President Andrzej Duda will meet Donald Trump later Saturday during a visit to the United States, amid a widening rift between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that has alarmed Kyiv's European allies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-pays-for-ukraine-s-starlink-subscription-says-its-deputy-pm/7984648.html	2025-02-22T17:43:12-08:00	
Musk orders US federal workers to describe what they did at work last week or get fired	WASHINGTON — Elon Musk, the billionaire head of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), threatened Saturday to fire any federal worker who fails to explain what work they have accomplished during the previous week. The threat, issued in a post on the social media site X, was made just hours after President Donald Trump posted on his own social media network Truth Social that DOGE should get more aggressive in its attempts to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. 'All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,' Musk posted on X. 'Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.' As of Saturday evening, emails were sent to employees at federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others with the subject line, 'What did you do last week?' The email, seen by Reuters, asks employees to reply to the email they have received with five bullet points summarizing 'what you accomplished at work last week' and copy their managers. The email sent from a human resources address gives employees until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday to respond. It is unclear what legal basis Musk has to terminate federal workers if they fail to respond to his request. Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the email Saturday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. However, most agency staff had been ordered not to perform any tasks since early this month, creating a conundrum. The agency is also under a temporary court order not to resume mass firings pending the outcome of legal proceedings. A spokesperson for DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The AFGE, the union representing federal employees, said in a statement it will challenge any 'unlawful terminations.' 'Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump administration have shown their utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people,' said AFGE National President Everett Kelley. The Trump administration's fast-paced and controversial process to reduce government spending by shrinking the federal workforce led by Musk and his young aides at the cost-cutting DOGE has led to haphazard firings that resulted in numerous mistakes and forced several agencies to quickly rehire vital employees, such as those working on nuclear safety, defense and power generation. The first wave of job cuts has targeted workers who are easier to fire, such as employees on the job for less than two years or those who have started new roles within an agency. The indiscriminate firings have led to DOGE terminating people whose jobs are not funded by taxpayers and have begun to anger people across the country who are concerned about a loss of services as well as the impact of federal job losses on local economies. Trump has repeatedly talked about Musk as the functional leader of DOGE, which is not a Cabinet-level department, but the White House said in a court filing earlier this month that Musk had no authority over DOGE and was not an employee of the program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-orders-us-federal-workers-to-describe-what-they-did-at-work-last-week-or-get-fired-/7984891.html	2025-02-22T17:21:48-08:00	
Officer killed after gunman takes hostages at Pennsylvania hospital	YORK, PENNSYLVANIA — A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital's intensive care unit Saturday and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said. Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer was injured in a fall. Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire. 'This is a huge loss to our community,' Barker said at a news conference following the shooting. 'It is absolutely clear, and beyond any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their action using deadly force.' Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for 'a medical purpose involving another individual' and he intentionally targeted the workers there. No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz. The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York Borough Police Department. 'We all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,' West York Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press. Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a 'hero award' in 2021 from Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving enforcement for the state of Colorado. 'I have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do,' his LinkedIn profile said. Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department there said in a statement. At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York Borough Police Department, Linda Shields dropped off roses Saturday and dabbed tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland. 'He was so young,' Shields said of Duarte. 'It makes no sense at all.' Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the attack on police and health care workers 'the act of a coward.' 'Let it not be lost on anyone the act of extraordinary bravery and courage by the health care workers here, by the law enforcement professionals … who ran toward danger to keep people safe,' Shapiro said. UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019 in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York Peppermint Patties in 1940. The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation's most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire’s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child’s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four.

Trump revels in mass federal firings, jeers at Biden before CPAC crowd	OXON HILL, MARYLAND — President Donald Trump said Saturday that 'nobody has ever seen anything' like his administration's sweeping effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of government. Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington, Trump said, 'We're going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come.' The president has spent the opening weeks of his administration arguing that voters in November gave him a mandate to overhaul government while cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border and to extend tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first administration. In a speech that lasted more than an hour, Trump predicted that the Republican Party would defy history, which has shown that a president's party typically struggles during midterm congressional elections. Of Republicans, he said, 'I don't think we've been at this level, maybe ever.' 'Nobody's ever seen anything like this, and nobody's ever seen four weeks like we had,' Trump said, likening his new administration's opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth. Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk to help carry out the firings; Musk vowed Saturday that more might be coming. 'Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,' Musk posted on X, which he owns. 'Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.' Trump also repeatedly said Saturday that he'd carry out harder-line immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed by his administration's mass federal firings. He announced that one agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for International Development, would have its Washington office taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials. 'The agency's name has been removed from its former building,' he said. The president also repeated his previous promises that his administration will scrutinize the country's gold depository at Fort Knox. 'Would anybody like to join us?' he said to cheers from the crowd. 'We want to see if the gold is still there.' 'Donald, don't get angry' But Trump also devoted large parts of his address to last year's presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris — his Election Day opponent. He also mentioned Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who ran for president in 2020. The president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him angry. 'I couldn't stand it,' Trump said, before cautioning himself, 'Donald, don't get angry.' He went on to use an expletive to describe what he thinks of Biden's handling of border security, despite noting that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul language. Trump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying 'I happen to like' him, while adding, 'we've been treated very unfairly by China and many other countries.' President meets with world leaders On the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over Russia's war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and Argentine President Javier Milei, who separately addressed the conference. Trump called Duda 'a fantastic man and a great friend of mine.' He noted that Milei was 'a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.' Duda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending fighting in Ukraine. Those meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is meeting Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a 'dictator' while falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday he acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor. Trump said during his speech, 'I'm dealing with President Zelenskyy. I'm dealing with President Putin' and added of fighting in Ukraine, 'It affects Europe. It doesn't really affect us.' About ending the war in Ukraine, Trump said Saturday, 'I think we're pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal.' Later, the president and first lady Melania Trump were hosting an evening reception and dinner at the White House for the National Governors Association, which was holding their own weekend meetings in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-revels-in-mass-federal-firings-jeers-at-biden-before-cpac-crowd-/7984872.html	2025-02-22T16:37:50-08:00	
6 dead, 78 injured after roof of Peru shopping mall collapses	LIMA, PERU — The collapse of a food court roof at a shopping mall in northwestern Peru killed six people and left at least 78 others injured, the defense minister said Saturday. The heavy iron roof at the Real Plaza Trujillo shopping mall, a city in the La Libertad region, fell Friday night on dozens of people who were at the site. Defense Minister Walter Astudillo said at a news conference that according to the information provided by local firefighters in La Libertad, five people died on site and a sixth at a hospital after the collapse. Astudillo also said that 30 injured people have already been discharged and 48 remain hospitalized. Three remained in critical condition. The minister expressed his condolences to the victims' families. Luis Roncal, head of the local fire department, confirmed that they 'did not find any signs of life' as they monitored with rescue dogs, but said that the search for survivors would continue with more than 100 firefighters and police officers searching through the debris. Dozens of families were in the food court of the shopping mall when the roof collapsed, according to local media reports. The Real Plaza shopping complex in Trujillo, the country's third-largest city, is located about 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of the capital Lima. 'There is a child trapped' under the roof's metal structures, said local government health official Anibal Morillo to broadcaster Panamericana. Interior Minister Juan Jose Santivanez estimated the collapsed roof area was 700 to 800 square meters. 'We need hydraulic cranes to lift part of the roof that has not yet been removed because it is so heavy and to continue rescue operations for those who may be trapped,' the minister told Canal N television channel. According to the Regional Emergency Operations Center, the collapse occurred at 8:41 p.m. local time but was reported about half an hour later. Some information in this report is from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-78-injured-after-roof-of-peru-shopping-mall-collapses/7984708.html	2025-02-22T16:11:18-08:00	
US, Uzbekistan reaffirm commitment to Central Asia security	WASHINGTON — As the Trump administration begins to engage with Central Asia, Uzbekistan has expressed eagerness to expand its strategic partnership, highlighting what it calls its 'enhanced' political dialogue on bilateral and regional issues and security cooperation, including its 'solid connection' with the Mississippi National Guard. The U.S. recently got back its seven Black Hawk helicopters from Uzbekistan that Afghan military pilots had flown there in 2021 while fleeing the Taliban. This transfer and other bilateral exchanges within the last month have underscored Tashkent's role as Washington's key partner in Central Asia, according to U.S. officials. However, analysts see the military relationship as largely transactional and shaped by geopolitical complexities and regional tensions. Talk between diplomats In a phone conversation on February 21 with Uzbek Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated U.S. support for the country's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, according to State Department's spokesperson Tammy Bruce. They discussed a joint effort through the C5+1 diplomatic platform, launched nearly a decade ago between Washington and five Central Asian republics. The Trump administration is interested in using this platform to support 'a more peaceful and prosperous Central Asia.' Saidov described his talk with Rubio as 'candid and productive,' aiming to expand the 'strategic partnership between our nations in all spheres without an exception. Building strong bridges between business communities, increasing trade volume in both directions, ensuring prosperous development in Central Asia.' Cooperation with Pentagon, ties with Mississippi Uzbek Ambassador Furqat Sidikov says his country's forces 'have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Mississippi National Guard in the best ways,' citing joint exercises and Pentagon-sponsored professional exchanges. 'We are a reliable partner of the United States in the region,' Sidikov said at a January 31 embassy reception, pointing to defense reforms and improvements in the Uzbek military's equipment. Mississippi National Guard Adjutant General Major General Bobby Ginn emphasized at the event that since 2012, the partnership has facilitated more than 170 engagements between U.S. and Uzbek soldiers, strengthening disaster response and readiness. 'Uzbekistan's commitment to regional stability and contributions to counterterrorism efforts and border security' demonstrate the power of its armed forced, Ginn said. Davis Florick, the Pentagon's acting principal director for Eurasia, also attending the reception, thanked Tashkent for 'storing' U.S. aircraft and diligently working with the U.S. toward the mutually beneficial solution. He confirmed that the seven Black Hawks were part of a fleet from Afghanistan that, according to multiple sources, included 24 helicopters, among them Mi-17s and UH-60s, and 22 fixed-wing aircraft, most of which were transferred to Uzbekistan last year. Another high-level Pentagon official, Rear Admiral Erin Osborne, speaking at the same gathering, praised Uzbekistan as a 'critical ally' that offered its airspace and an air base during the initial years of the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. The republic was also part of Pentagon's Northern Distribution Network, delivering nonmilitary goods to the international coalition fighting in the neighboring country. Osborne said that mutual trust and understanding were reflected in 'capacity-building initiatives and the sharing of intelligence to counter common threats.' The U.S., she added, is committed to working with Uzbekistan 'to ensure its stability and sovereignty, as well as the stability and sovereignty of the entire Central Asian region.' The Taliban and the Afghanistan factor Even though the transfer of the Black Hawks back to the U.S. was disclosed at the embassy event, Uzbek officials have been tight-lipped about this collaboration to avoid any tension with the Taliban, which has condemned the handovers as an infringement on Afghanistan's sovereignty. The Taliban's Defense Ministry issued a statement denouncing the transfer as 'unacceptable' and demanding the return of the aircraft. Eighteen U.S. aircraft also ended up in Tajikistan in 2021, but Washington and Dushanbe have yet to settle the matter. During a visit to the region in June 2022, U.S. Central Command commander General Michael Kurilla said the aircraft would not be returned to Afghanistan 'because they do not belong to the Taliban … Our hope is to be able to hand over some or all of the aircraft to the Tajik government.' Washington analysts view Uzbekistan as the most active U.S. military partner in the region, comparing it with the activities other republics in Central Asia have with their state partners, specifically Kazakhstan with Arizona, Tajikistan with Virginia, and Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan with Montana. Still, they characterize Tashkent-Washington security relationship as more transactional than strategic. 'The Uzbeks want training and equipment. What do we want from them? A reliable partner in the region,' a former U.S. official with deep experience in Central Asia told VOA. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity for professional reasons. The U.S. has trained Uzbek pilots to operate and maintain the transferred aircraft, but continued congressional funding — amounting to several million dollars — is crucial for sustained cooperation. 'There will be questions from Congress, of course,' the former official said. 'The primary justification so far has been that these assets would help counter extremists from Afghanistan.' Meanwhile, experts in Tashkent support Uzbekistan's cautious approach to the Taliban. As officials have said, Uzbekistan will engage with whoever governs Afghanistan. While it does not officially recognize the Taliban, the administration of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has forged stable diplomatic relations with Kabul, holds significant investment and business agreements with the country, and provides humanitarian aid to the Afghan people. Last summer, Uzbekistan opened a free economic zone in the city of Termez on the border with Afghanistan, inviting neighbors to foster entrepreneurial cooperation. U.S. interests and Central Asian security The U.S. maintains military cooperation agreements with each Central Asian republic, with plans reviewed annually and subject to funding approval. Despite intelligence-sharing efforts, there is no U.S.-Uzbekistan overflight agreement. Tashkent does not allow its territory to be used for strikes on neighboring soil, even against terrorist targets. 'The Trump administration may question this,' said the former U.S. official. 'It complicates the case for cooperation with Uzbekistan because they're centrally located, yet we must fly around them. It's hard to justify what we're getting in return.' For years, the U.S. has also supported regional border security initiatives. 'That's the big program,' the former U.S. official said, but added: 'How many terrorists have we stopped? How many have been disrupted, killed, or captured? Do we have those hard numbers? We are still in the nascent stages of setting up the program.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uzbekistan-reaffirm-commitment-to-central-asia-security/7984698.html	2025-02-22T15:38:35-08:00	
Hundreds of Congolese police join rebels in occupied city	Crowds of Congolese police officers who switched to the M23 rebel group sang and clapped in occupied Bukavu city on Saturday, preparing for retraining under the authority of the rebels who are intent on showing they plan to stick around and govern. The M23 rebels advanced a week ago into eastern Democratic Republic of Congo's second-largest city, which was rocked by looting and unrest as Congolese forces withdrew without a fight. The M23's capture of swaths of eastern Congo and valuable mineral deposits has fanned fears of a wider war and led the United Nations Security Council to demand unanimously Friday that it cease hostilities and withdraw. In Bukavu, there was no sign this call would be heeded. The assembled police, wearing brand new uniforms and black berets, were told they would leave for a few days of training and come back to support the M23 rebels. 'May you come back to us in good shape so that together we can continue to liberate our country,' said Police Commander Jackson Kamba. Around 1,800 police officers have surrendered and were going for retraining with 500 more due to do so, said Lawrence Kanyuka, a spokesperson for the AFC rebel alliance that includes the M23 group. The Congolese government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ongoing crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to escalate, with tensions involving the Congolese government, and the M23 rebel group. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. Several locals expressed skepticism. The M23's arrival in Bukavu 'has paralyzed the entire life of the whole area, even if some activities are resuming in different ways,' said resident Josue Kayeye. 'We cannot applaud anything done by force.' Congolese troops are under pressure on multiple fronts. The town of Minembwe in the mountains of South Kivu and its airfield were captured Friday by a Tutsi militia allegedly allied with the M23, a local official, a military source and a U.N. source said. A few days earlier, its leader, Colonel Makanika, was killed by a Congolese military drone. East African defense chiefs met in Nairobi, Kenya, on Friday to discuss the crisis. An internal report on the meeting, seen by Reuters, showed that the group noted that there was 'no clear picture of the situation on the ground' amid the escalation and M23's occupation of major cities and airports. The group emphasized the need for direct engagement between all parties to the conflict, according to the report. Congo has repeatedly refused to hold talks with M23. The ethnic Tutsi-led M23 is the latest in a string of groups to take up arms in the name of Tutsis in Congo. The M23 and neighboring Rwanda reject allegations from Congo that it is a Rwandan proxy bent on looting the east's reserves of gold and coltan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-congolese-police-join-rebels-in-occupied-city-/7984671.html	2025-02-22T13:49:33-08:00	
Cholera kills 58, sickens 1,300 over 3 days in Sudanese city	CAIRO — A cholera outbreak in a southern Sudanese city killed nearly 60 people and sickened about 1,300 others over the last three days, health authorities said Saturday. The outbreak in the southern city of Kosti was blamed mainly on contaminated drinking water after the city’s water plant stopped due to an attack by a notorious paramilitary group, the Health Ministry said. The group has been fighting the country’s military for about two years. The ministry said in a statement the disease killed 58 people and sickened 1,293 others between Thursday and Saturday. The ministry said it has taken a series of measures to fight the outbreak, including launching a vaccination campaign against cholera in the city. The disease killed more than 600 and sickened over 21,000 others between July and October last year. Cholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and could be fatal if not immediately treated, according to WHO. It’s transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cholera-kills-58-sickens-1-300-over-3-days-in-sudanese-city/7984615.html	2025-02-22T11:06:10-08:00	
1 dead, several police officers wounded in knife attack in France	STRASBOURG, FRANCE — One person died and two police officers were seriously injured in a knife attack in eastern France on Saturday that occurred during a demonstration, the local prosecutor said. Three more officers were lightly wounded in the attack in the city of Mulhouse, carried out by a 37-year-old suspect who is on a terror prevention watchlist, prosecutor Nicolas Heitz told AFP. The list, called FSPRT, compiles data from various authorities on people with the aim of preventing 'terrorist' radicalization. It was launched in 2015 following deadly attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo's offices and on a Jewish supermarket. The suspect attacked local police officers in Mulhouse shouting 'Allahu Akbar' ('God is greatest') Saturday afternoon, France’s national antiterror prosecutors’ unit PNAT said in a statement. A passerby was killed trying to intervene and help police, the prosecutor's office said. One of the seriously wounded police officers sustained an injury to the carotid artery, and the other to the thorax, Heitz said. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was expected to travel to the scene of the attack later Saturday. Police established a security parameter after the attack, which happened shortly before 4 p.m. local time during a demonstration in support of Congo. According to union sources, the suspect, born in Algeria, has been under judicial supervision and house arrest, and under an expulsion order from France. 'Horror has seized our city,' Mulhouse Mayor Michele Lutz said on Facebook. The incident was being investigated as a terror attack, she said, but 'this must obviously still be confirmed by the judiciary.' French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday that the deadly knife attack was 'Islamist terrorism,' after France's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office confirmed it was investigating the case. 'It is without any doubt an act of Islamist terrorism,' Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the annual French farm show, adding that the interior minister was on his way to Mulhouse. The suspect has been arrested, the prosecutor's office said. Some information in this report is from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-several-police-officers-wounded-in-knife-attack-in-france/7984606.html	2025-02-22T10:44:04-08:00	
Sudan's RSF, allied groups to sign charter to form parallel government	Sudan's Rapid Support Forces will sign a charter with allied political and armed groups on Saturday evening to establish a 'government of peace and unity' in territories it controls, signatories al-Hadi Idris and Ibrahim Mirghani told Reuters. The RSF has seized most of the western Darfur region and swathes of the Kordofan region in an almost-two-year war, but it is being pushed back from central Sudan by the Sudanese army, which has condemned the formation of a parallel government. Such a government, which already has drawn an expression of concern from the United Nations, is not expected to receive widespread recognition. Those affiliated with the government say its formation will be announced from inside the country. General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the paramilitary that has been accused of widespread abuses including genocide, was hit with sanctions by the United States earlier this year. The war, which erupted after disagreements between the RSF and the army over their integration during a transition toward democracy, has devastated the country, driving half the population into hunger. According to Idris, among the signatories to the charter and foundational constitution is powerful rebel leader Abdelaziz al-Hilu, who controls vast swathes of territory and troops in South Kordofan state and has long demanded that Sudan embrace secularism. Talks that began earlier this week were hosted in Kenya, drawing condemnation from Sudan and domestic criticism of Kenyan President William Ruto for plunging the country into a diplomatic melee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-rsf-allied-groups-to-sign-charter-to-form-parallel-government/7984593.html	2025-02-22T10:27:02-08:00	
New polio vaccination drive begins in Gaza	JABALIA, GAZA STRIP — A third mass polio vaccination campaign began in Gaza on Saturday, AFP journalists reported, with the aim of delivering the first dose to nearly 600,000 children across the Palestinian territory. Scores of children under the age of 10 received the dose at a mosque in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, where a blistering Israeli military assault last year reduced many buildings to rubble. The vaccination campaign involves multiple U.N. agencies, including the Israeli-boycotted U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees, or UNRWA, and comes at a time when Israel and Hamas are observing a ceasefire that has largely halted the fighting. The United States, United Kingdom and other Western nations designate Hamas as a terror group. The World Health Organization said the campaign aims to vaccinate more than 591,000 children by Feb. 26. 'Over 1,700 UNRWA team members will take part in this campaign,' UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X. 'This campaign follows a recent detection of polio in wastewater, putting the lives of children at risk.' The previous two drives were conducted in late 2024 after the highly contagious disease resurfaced in Gaza for the first time in over 20 years. After more than 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire. Even before the hostilities began, the territory had been struggling under an Israeli-imposed blockade for more than 15 years. Much of the water infrastructure has been destroyed, leaving sewage to stagnate in open pools near densely populated neighborhoods — conditions that contributed to the reemergence of the virus last autumn. The WHO reported on Feb. 19 that traces of poliovirus had again been detected in wastewater samples. Polio is highly contagious and can cause paralysis, primarily affecting children under the age of 5. The disease has been nearly eradicated worldwide. Hoping for a lasting truce, Bassam al-Haou, a resident of Jabalia, brought his daughters to receive the vaccine. 'I also hope for stability for our innocent children so they can remain safe from violence,' he told AFP. The war erupted following Hamas's unprecedented terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. A fragile ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-polio-vaccination-drive-begins-in-gaza/7984585.html	2025-02-22T10:15:59-08:00	
Malian army investigates deaths of civilians blamed on soldiers, Wagner group	BAMAKO, MALI — Mali's army said it is investigating soldiers who were accused by separatist Tuareg rebels of killing at least 24 civilians earlier this week. It is a rare probe of human rights abuses since the military took power in 2020. The Front for the Liberation of Azawad, the Tuareg independence movement in the north of the country, accused soldiers and Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group of intercepting two civilian transport vehicles bound for Algeria from Gao on Monday, and 'coldly executing' at least 24 people among the passengers. The general staff of the Malian armed forces, without referring to the killings, denounced the 'intoxicating campaigns' against the army Wednesday. On Friday, the authorities announced the opening of an investigation into the civilian deaths. Analysts say it's unlikely the investigation would fault the troops or the Russian mercenaries. 'The objective of the investigations is going to be more about countering the allegations against [the army] and Wagner, rather than trying to find any wrongdoing by the latter. The conclusion of the investigation is likely to say that those allegations are false,' said Rida Lyammouri, senior fellow at Policy Center for the New South, a Moroccan think tank. Mali has been in a crisis for more than a decade. In 2020, a military group, riding on popular discontent over attacks by armed jihadi groups, seized power in a coup that toppled the democratically elected president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malian-army-investigates-deaths-of-civilians-blamed-on-soldiers-wagner-group/7984534.html	2025-02-22T09:09:10-08:00	
France says gangster ‘The Fly’ was arrested in Romania	PARIS — Mohamed Amra, a French fugitive known as 'The Fly,' who was freed by gunmen in a brazen attack against a prison van in May, was arrested in Romania on Saturday, the French interior minister said. French police had launched a massive manhunt for the fugitive, whose escape resulted in the deaths of two prison guards and was seized upon by right-wing politicians as evidence that France had lost its grip on drug crime. Three officers were wounded in the attack, which was caught on CCTV and shocked France because of its extraordinary violence. France had tasked more than 300 investigators with finding Amra and had requested an Interpol red notice, hoping for foreign assistance. 'I congratulate all forces which made Mohamed Amra’s arrest in Romania today possible. A warm thank you to Romania for its decisive cooperation,' Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on X. Amra is a 30-year-old from northern France, according to the Paris prosecutor’s office. Police sources said he was involved in drug trafficking and accused of being a major drugs gangland figure. Amra has a long history of convictions for violent crimes that started when he was 15. He was also suspected of ordering hits while in prison. At the time of his escape, Amra was facing two fresh charges, one for attempted murder and another for participation in a gangland killing in the southern city of Marseille on the French Riviera, a hub for drug trafficking and gang violence. But despite the government labelling him 'public enemy number one,' and the deployment of massive means, Amra was not captured as quickly as the authorities had hoped. The Paris prosecutor’s office said he had been convicted of burglary by a court in Evreux on May 10 and was being held at the Val de Reuil prison until his escape on May 14. He had also been indicted by prosecutors in Marseille for a kidnapping that led to a death, it said. On Saturday, the government reacted with relief that the chase was over. 'After a manhunt lasting several months, Amra has been arrested, finally!' Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said on X. President Emmanuel Macron hailed Amra’s capture as 'a formidable success.' Some information in this report is from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-says-gangster-the-fly-was-arrested-in-romania/7984518.html	2025-02-22T08:47:51-08:00	
On eve of elections, Germany faces changing world situation	BERLIN — German politicians made a final scramble for votes Saturday on the eve of key elections in which conservatives hope to win despite the dramatic rise of the far right. Sunday's vote comes at a time of upheaval for Europe and its biggest economy as U.S. President Donald Trump has ended a united Western stance on the Ukraine conflict by reaching out to Russia. Trump's threats of a trade war spell more trouble ahead for Germany, after its economy has shrunk for the past two years, and as it also faces bitter social polarization on the flashpoint issues of immigration and security. Sunday's vote is being held more than half a year ahead of schedule after center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition collapsed in early November. The conservative CDU-CSU alliance, led by Friedrich Merz, has long had a strong lead in opinion polls at around 30%, double that of Scholz's SPD. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has been polling in second place at around 20%, boosted by anger over a spate of deadly knife attacks and car rammings blamed on migrants. Just 10 days before the election, an Afghan man was arrested for ploughing a car through a street rally in Munich, killing a 2-year-old child and her mother and wounding dozens. Germany was again shocked by a stabbing that badly wounded a 30-year-old Spanish man at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial on Friday, although police have not yet spoken about the suspected motive. Two major problems The AfD has had strong support from Trump's inner circle, with tech billionaire Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance speaking out in support of the party. With domestic tensions running high, two far-right demonstrations as well as a counter protest are expected to draw crowds in Berlin on Saturday. In a final TV debate with Scholz on Wednesday, the CDU's Merz called on Germans to give him a strong mandate to 'solve the country's two major problems: migration and the economy.' On Saturday afternoon, Merz will hold a final election rally in Munich alongside Markus Soeder, leader of the CSU, the CDU's sister party in the southern state of Bavaria. Scholz, speaking at his final campaign rally in Dortmund on Friday, stressed his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and defended Germany's commitment to free speech in a pushback against recent comments Vance made in a blistering speech at the Munich Security Conference. Scholz pledged that 'we won't leave Ukraine alone and decide things over their heads, and we will ensure that Ukraine is a country that can choose its own government.' Coalition complications Stephanus Remmert, an SPD supporter at Friday's rally, said he was 'still hopeful' about the election but regretted that some social, climate and economic issues had gotten short shrift during the campaign. 'I hope we don't slide too far to the right and that we can form a strong counterweight to America,' he said. In Berlin, 28-year-old Jonathan Winkler, a video editor, said he was planning to vote for the conservatives despite 'not being a big fan of Merz.' If the polls are correct, Merz will win but then need the support of at least one and possibly two other parties to form a government. The conservative leader has ruled out forming a ruling alliance with the AfD, which leaves his two most likely partners as the SPD and the Greens — who are polling at around 15% and 13% respectively. This would force them into a lengthy negotiating process to rebuild trust after a heated election campaign in which they clashed on migration and how to deal with the AfD, but also on fiscal policy questions. 'Forming a coalition is likely to be very difficult indeed,' said Jacob Ross, a researcher at the German Council on Foreign Relations. 'Nevertheless, it would be in Germany's interest to have people in place in Berlin who are capable of acting as quickly as possible.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-eve-of-elections-germany-faces-changing-world-situation/7984491.html	2025-02-22T08:19:00-08:00

Pope’s doctors say sepsis could threaten his fight against pneumonia	ROME — The Vatican carried on with its Holy Year celebrations without the pope Saturday, as Pope Francis battled pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection that doctors say remains touch-and-go and will keep him hospitalized for at least another week. Francis slept well overnight, Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said in a brief early update Saturday. But doctors have warned that the main threat facing the 88-year-old Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. 'He is not out of danger,' said his personal physician, Dr. Luigi Carbone. 'So, like all fragile patients, I say they are always on the golden scale: In other words, it takes very little to become unbalanced.' Francis, who has chronic lung disease, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Carbone, who along with Francis' personal nurse, Massimiliano Strappetti, organized care for him at the Vatican, acknowledged he had insisted on staying at the Vatican to work even after he was sick 'because of institutional and private commitments.' He was cared for by a cardiologist and infectious specialist in addition to his personal medical team before being hospitalized. Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Rome’s Gemelli hospital, said the biggest threat facing Francis was that some of the germs that are currently located in his respiratory system pass into the bloodstream, causing sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and death. 'Sepsis, with his respiratory problems and his age, would be really difficult to get out of,' Alfieri told a press conference Friday at Gemelli. 'The English say, ‘knock on wood,’ we say ‘touch iron.’ Everyone touch what they want,' he said as he tapped the microphone. 'But this is the real risk in these cases: that these germs pass to the bloodstream.' 'He knows he's in danger,' Alfieri said. 'And he told us to relay that.' Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Jubilee weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood. In his place, the Holy Year organizer will celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second weekend in a row, Francis was expected to skip his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it. 'Look, even though he's not [physically] here, we know he's here,' said Luis Arnaldo Lopez Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. 'He's recovering, but he's in our hearts and is accompanying us because our prayers and his go together.' Beyond that, doctors have said that Francis' recovery will take time and that, regardless, he will have to live with his chronic respiratory problems back at the Vatican. 'He has to get over this infection, and we all hope he gets over it,' said Alfieri. 'But the fact is, all doors are open.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-s-doctors-say-sepsis-could-threaten-his-fight-against-pneumonia/7984382.html	2025-02-22T05:39:00-08:00	
Trump-Putin summit preparations are underway, Russia says	Preparations are underway for a face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin, Russia's deputy foreign minister said Saturday, marking a dramatic shift away from Western isolation of Moscow over its war in Ukraine. Speaking to Russian state media, Sergei Ryabkov said a possible Putin-Trump summit could involve broad talks on global issues, not just the war in Ukraine. 'The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations between our countries, finding ways to resolve the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them,' he said. But he said that efforts to organize such a meeting are at an early stage, and that making it happen will require 'the most intensive preparatory work.' Ryabkov said that U.S. and Russian envoys could meet 'within the next two weeks' to pave the way for further talks between senior officials. Russian and U.S. representatives on Tuesday agreed to start working toward ending the war in Ukraine and improving their diplomatic and economic ties, according to the two countries’ top diplomats, at a high-level meeting in Saudi Arabia that marked an extraordinary about-face in U.S. foreign policy under Trump. After the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the AP that the two sides agreed broadly to pursue three goals: to restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow; to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks; and to explore closer relations and economic cooperation. He stressed, however, that the talks — which were attended by his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian and U.S. officials — marked the beginning of a conversation, and that more work needs to be done. Lavrov, for his part, hailed the meeting as 'very useful.' No Ukrainian officials were present at the meeting, which came as the beleaguered country is slowly but steadily losing ground against more-numerous Russian troops, three years after Moscow launched an all-out invasion of its smaller neighbor. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not accept any outcome from the talks since Kyiv didn’t take part, and he postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for last Wednesday. European allies also have expressed concerns they are being sidelined.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-putin-summit-preparations-are-underway-russia-says/7984365.html	2025-02-22T05:22:44-08:00	
Vietnam’s railway drive raises risk of mismanagement, debt traps, analysts say	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — Analysts are pointing to management and funding issues for Vietnam’s planned north-south, high-speed rail initiative and express concerns over potential 'debt traps' and growing Chinese influence as Beijing funds a railway connecting the two countries. The comments come as Vietnam is expanding its infrastructure by building railways using Chinese and Vietnamese funding, projects that could help the country’s outlook in the long term. As part of the effort, Vietnam’s National Assembly on Feb. 19 gave near-unanimous approval to legislation allowing the country to use Chinese loans for a new $8.3 billion rail link from the port city of Haiphong to China. Nguyen Hong Minh, then the transport minister, announced Vietnam’s plans to use the Chinese loans for the 391-kilometer passenger and freight line from Lao Cai on the Chinese border and passing through Hanoi. 'Vietnam's current railway system is outdated, and the country needs a new system to support its economic development,' Minh, now the construction minister, said, adding that construction is expected to begin this year and be completed by 2030. The National Assembly vote followed its November approval of construction of a high-speed railway connecting Hanoi to the country's southern economic hub, Ho Chi Minh City. That project is Vietnam's most ambitious infrastructure initiative to date and is projected to cost Vietnam $67 billion. Authorities said construction should begin in 2027 and be completed by 2035. Ha Hoang Hop, chair of the Hanoi-based Think Tank Viet Know, told VOA on Feb. 17 that while both projects could modernize the country's transport network and improve its economy, 'public sentiment is cautious.' 'There have been several publicly funded railway and infrastructure projects in Vietnam that have led to public frustration due to delays, cost overruns and poor-quality outcomes,' Hop said. 'Public skepticism is also fueled by fears of debt traps associated with Chinese loans,' he said. Hop cited fear the construction of the high-speed rail project could be dogged by the country's 'historical issues with project management and corruption.' 'There is indeed concern that the north-south, high-speed rail could face similar challenges given the scale and complexity of the project,' Hop said. Mismanagement and corruption Albert Tan, associate professor at the Asian Institute of Management in Manila, told VOA on Feb. 18 that while Vietnam's railway modernization will improve the country's supply chain efficiency, the major problem is corruption. 'The corruption level in Vietnam is so high that when you have that amount of money that the Chinese are pumping in, I'm sure there will always be leakages,' he said. Tan said railway funds ending up in 'someone's pocket' have caused delays and cost overruns for Vietnam's two city Metro lines. In 2021, the Chinese-funded Cat Linh-Ha Dong Metro line began running in Hanoi, five years behind its originally planned opening. The first line of the Ho Chi Minh City Metro, primarily funded by Japan, opened in December 2024, six years behind schedule. Costs ballooned for both Metro lines while under construction and delayed payments to contractors slowed the process. 'Somehow the money doesn't go back to the contractor. Money goes somewhere to other stakeholders,' Tan said. For the north-south, high-speed rail, Hop said the country is planning to rely on domestic funding with capital likely to come in the form of 'government bonds, public investment and possibly some low-interest loans.' 'A $67 billion project will still be a significant challenge requiring careful financial management,' Hop said. Chinese influence Hanoi's decision to pursue domestic funding for its high-speed rail shows the country's drive to 'maintain strategic autonomy,' Hop said. As it looks to Chinese loans for another rail project, though, 'there remains a significant portion of the populace wary of increasing economic dependency on China,' he added. Tran Anh Quan, a Vietnamese social activist currently living in exile, told VOA on Feb. 18 he fears the Chinese-funded railway will leave Hanoi indebted to Beijing and could be a weak point if conflict were to break out between the countries. 'This is definitely a debt trap,' he said. 'Expanding the railway to China would be very dangerous if China attacked Vietnam.' Tan also shared concerns over the 'one-way' flow of money. He said the Chinese loans are likely to be paid to Chinese firms that will 'retain control over construction and maintenance, with little technology transfer to local engineers.' Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, told VOA that Chinese influence in the region is already 'massive.' He said Chinese funding for the Vietnamese railway is in line with Beijing's goal to expand its influence in Southeast Asia. The railway 'fits right into China’s efforts to link the Mekong region, and to connect them to China,' he wrote in an email. Kurlantzick said that in Vietnam's delicate balancing act between Washington and Beijing, China is taking the upper hand as he sees U.S. influence waning with the withdrawal of funding to Vietnam through USAID and weakening public diplomacy more broadly. 'China is by far the dominant economic power in Southeast Asia already, increasingly the dominant security power, and now, with the U.S. giving up its soft power in the region, China will increasingly bolster its soft power in the region, too, making it even more dominant,' Kurlantzick said. Minh Son To, a research assistant focused on Vietnamese and Chinese politics at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, told VOA February 20 Hanoi has looked to Laos with concern after a China-funded high-speed rail threw the country into an 'existential debt crisis.' Still, he said many are eager to see Vietnam develop. 'Any 'China' label is bound to evoke some concern, though I wouldn't overstate that,' he told VOA. 'Vietnamese know that they need development and infrastructure, regardless of where it comes from.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-railway-drive-raises-risk-of-mismanagement-debt-traps-analysts-say/7984359.html	2025-02-22T05:07:53-08:00	
As war rages, Ukraine’s politicians circle presidential ‘electric chair’	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been branded 'a dictator without elections,' but rivals are already circling for his job as expectations mount of a vote later this year. U.S. President Donald Trump’s broadside at Zelenskyy hit a sensitive spot. Presidential elections in Ukraine should have been held in March or April 2024. But they were not — due to Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukraine’s constitution bars elections during martial law, which was imposed by Kyiv just a day after the Kremlin launched its all-out war in February 2022. There are also major security concerns. Packed polling stations would make tempting targets for a Russian military that has repeatedly struck civilian targets, including schools, hospitals and apartment buildings. RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service found people in Kyiv opposed to the idea when it spoke to them on Feb. 20. 'We have Russian-occupied territory where people will not be able to vote and will not be able to make their own choice,' said one woman. 'Who can run a campaign in a time of war?' said another voter. The same day, some 130 Ukrainian civic groups issued a joint statement declaring the impossibility of holding elections under current circumstances. 'Only after the end of the war and the achievement of a stable peace … will it be possible to organize elections freely, fairly, democratically, and accessibly,' they wrote. Nevertheless, presidential hopefuls are already making what appear to be their first cautious moves. There’s expectation in the air that some kind of ceasefire or peace deal will emerge this year, making elections possible within a matter of months. Former President Petro Poroshenko has even given a date, Oct. 26, which he says was revealed by insiders in Zelenskyy’s office and which would coincide with other elections. 'According to the constitution, there should be parliamentary elections at the end of the year. Although they should have taken place two years ago. And at the end of October, we should have had local elections,' he said. Zelenskyy’s party denied any plans for Oct. 26. The president has said elections could take place this year if martial law is lifted — something that would be possible after a deal to stop the fighting. Pro-Russian figures have also started getting active. Yuriy Boyko, who came in fourth in the 2019 election, launched a TikTok campaign in December that echoed Kremlin talking points and earned him an invitation for questioning from Ukraine's Security Service. Sergey Lagondinsky, a member of the European Parliament for Germany’s Green Party who grew up in Russia in Soviet times, wrote recently: 'Putin hates Zelenskyy because he ruined his plans to subjugate Ukraine. And he dreams of getting a pro-Russian candidate after a grueling war.' But many analysts believe the aim of getting a pro-Kremlin puppet elected has little chance after three years of war in which Russian forces have killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. Still, when the election does come, it could be brutal. 'Everyone will be accusing each other of being at fault at the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion,' said Oleh Saakyan, co-founder of the National Platform for Resilience and Cohesion, a civic group. Speaking to Current Time, he predicted a battle of 'veterans against veterans, soldiers against soldiers.' 'The president’s seat right now is an electric chair,' he said. Zelenskyy’s hottest potential challenger has not made any public moves. In fact, he’s not even said he wants to run. Yet former army commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhniy is widely regarded as waiting in the wings from his current position as Ukraine’s ambassador in London. Opinion pollsters are already asking the public what they think — and Zaluzhniy has been coming out on top. But a lot can happen between now and any future polling day. Much will depend on what kind of diplomatic deal is struck, if any, to silence the guns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-war-rages-ukraine-s-politicians-circle-presidential-electric-chair-/7984328.html	2025-02-22T03:59:40-08:00	
2 more Israeli hostages released in Gaza following return of Bibas remains	Two more Israeli hostages were released Saturday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees as part of a ceasefire deal as a body returned from Gaza Friday was confirmed to be that of hostage Shiri Bibas. Tal Shoham, 40, who was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, and Avera Mengistu, 39, who crossed over into Gaza on his own around a decade ago, were handed over to the Red Cross early Saturday in the Gaza city of Rafah. Hundreds of people, including Hamas fighters carrying automatic weapons and wearing military fatigues, balaclavas and Hamas headbands, stood in a rain-soaked square in Rafah as the handover took place. In Tel Aviv, Israelis waving flags and carrying placards with pictures of the hostages watched the release via video and cheered as the two men were paraded on a makeshift stage surrounded by masked armed Hamas fighters. Four other hostages were due to be released later Saturday. Eliya Cohen, 27; Omer Shem Tov, 22; and Omer Wenkert, 23, were taken from a music festival during the Oct. 7, attack. Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, has been held since crossing into the Gaza Strip under unexplained circumstances around a decade ago. The six Israelis are expected to be the last living hostages to be freed during the first phase of the ceasefire. In exchange, Israel is set to release more than 600 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. Saturday’s hostage release followed the return late Friday of the remains of Shiri Bibas. Her body was supposed to be among three others, including two of her children, handed over by Hamas on Thursday. But the Israeli military said the female body was not hers, prompting a warning by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Hamas will 'pay the price' for failing to release Bibas’ remains as prescribed by the peace agreement with Israel. In a video statement, Netanyahu said, 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages — both living and dead — and ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement.' A statement released late Friday by the Bibas family said forensic analysis confirmed Shiri Babas’ remains. 'Last night, our Shiri was returned home,' the family said. Hamas said Bibas' remains appeared to have been mixed up with other human remains taken from rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit the place she was held. Israeli officials said forensic evidence indicated Shiri Bibas and her children were killed by Palestinian militants. Israel and Hamas are in the first phase of a ceasefire that began on Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. Hamas killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel and took about 250 people as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-israeli-hostages-released-in-gaza-following-return-of-bibas-remains/7984302.html	2025-02-22T00:54:26-08:00	
Sri Lanka's first elephant orphanage marks golden jubilee	PINNAWALA, SRI LANKA — Sri Lanka's main elephant orphanage marked its 50th anniversary Sunday with a feast of fruit for the 68 jumbos at the showpiece center, reputedly the world's first care home for destitute pachyderms. The Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage lavished pineapples, bananas, melons and cucumbers on its residents to celebrate the anniversary of their home, which is a major tourist attraction. A few officials and tourists invited to the low-key celebration were served milk rice and traditional sweets while four generations of elephants born in captivity frolicked in the nearby Maha Oya river. 'The first birth at this orphanage was in 1984, and since then there have been a total of 76,' said chief curator Sanjaya Ratnayake, as the elephants returned from their daily river bath. 'This has been a successful breeding program, and today we have four generations of elephants here, with the youngest 18 months old and the oldest 70 years,' he told AFP. The orphanage recorded its first twin birth in August 2021 — a rarity among Asian elephants — and both calves are doing well. Two years before the orphanage was formally established as a government institution in February 1975, five orphaned elephants were cared for at a smaller facility in the southern resort town of Bentota. 'Since the orphanage was set up at Pinnawala in 1975, in a coconut grove, the animals have had more space to roam, with good weather and plenty of food available in the surrounding area,' Ratnayake said. The home requires 14,500 kilos of coconut and palm tree leaves, along with other foliage, to satisfy the elephants' voracious appetites. It also buys tons of fruit and milk for the younger calves, who are adored by the foreign and local visitors to the orphanage, located about 90 kilometers (56 miles) east of the capital Colombo. It is also a major revenue generator for the state, earning millions of dollars a year in entrance fees. Visitors can watch the elephants from a distance or get up close and help scrub them during bath times. Tragic toll The facility lacked running water and electricity at its inception but things improved as it gained international fame in subsequent years, said retired senior mahout K.G. Sumanabanda, 65. 'I was also fortunate to be present when we had the first birth in captivity,' Sumanabanda told AFP, visiting the home for the jubilee celebrations. During his career spanning over three decades as a traditional elephant keeper, he trained more than 60 other mahouts and is still consulted by temples and individuals who own domesticated elephants. Twenty years ago, Sri Lankan authorities opened another elephant home in the south of the island to care for orphaned, abandoned or injured elephants and later return them back to the wild. While Pinnawala is seen by many as a success, Sri Lanka is also facing a major human-elephant conflict in areas bordering traditional wildlife sanctuaries. Deputy Minister of Environment Anton Jayakody told AFP on Sunday that 450 elephants and 150 people were killed in clashes in 2023, continuing an alarming trend of fatalities in the human-elephant conflict. The previous year saw 433 elephants and 145 people killed. Killing or harming elephants is a criminal offence in Sri Lanka, which has an estimated 7,000 wild elephants and where jumbos are considered a national treasure, partly due to their significance in Buddhist culture. But the massacre continues as desperate farmers face the brunt of elephants raiding their crops and destroying livelihoods. The minister was confident the new government could tackle the problem by preventing elephants from crossing into villages. 'We are planning to introduce multiple barriers — these may include electric fences, trenches, or other deterrents — to make it more difficult for wild elephants to stray into villages,' Jayakody told AFP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-feast-of-fruit-as-sri-lanka-s-first-elephant-orphanage-marks-golden-jubilee-/7982865.html	2025-02-22T00:30:27-08:00	
Ancient deity, pet, endangered species: Axolotl is Mexico's most beloved amphibian	MEXICO CITY — Legend has it the axolotl was not always an amphibian. Long before it became Mexico's most beloved salamander and efforts to prevent its extinction flourished, it was a sneaky god. 'It's an interesting little animal,' said Yanet Cruz, head of the Chinampaxochitl Museum in Mexico City. Its exhibitions focus on the axolotl and chinampas, the pre-Hispanic agricultural systems resembling floating gardens that still function in Xochimilco, a neighborhood on Mexico City's outskirts famed for its canals. 'Despite there being many varieties, the axolotl from the area is a symbol of identity for the native people,' said Cruz, who participated in activities hosted at the museum to celebrate 'Axolotl Day' in early February. While there are no official estimates of the current axolotl population, the species Ambystoma mexicanum — endemic to central Mexico — has been listed as 'critically endangered' by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 2019. And though biologists, historians and officials have led efforts to save the species and its habitat from extinction, a parallel, unexpected preservation phenomenon has emerged. Axolotl, which is also the plural form, attracted international attention after Minecraft added them to its game in 2021 and Mexicans went crazy about them that same year, following the Central Bank's initiative to print it on the 50-peso bill. 'That's when the 'axolotlmania' thrived,' Cruz said. All over Mexico, the peculiar, dragonlike amphibian can be spotted in murals, crafts and socks. Selected bakeries have caused a sensation with axolotl-like bites. Even a local brewery — 'Ajolote' in Spanish — took its name from the salamander to honor Mexican traditions. Before the Spaniards conquered Mexico-Tenochtitlan in the 16th century, axolotl may not have had archeological representations as did Tlaloc — god of rain in the Aztec worldview — or Coyolxauhqui — its lunar goddess — but it did appear in ancient Mesoamerican documents. In the Nahua myth of the Fifth Sun, pre-Hispanic god Nanahuatzin threw himself into a fire, reemerged as the sun and commanded fellow gods to replicate his sacrifice to bring movement to the world. All complied but Xolotl, a deity associated with the evening star, who fled. 'He was hunted down and killed,' said Arturo Montero, archaeologist of the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas. 'And from his death came a creature: axolotl.' According to Montero, the myth implies that, after a god's passing, its essence gets imprisoned in a mundane creature, subject to the cycles of life and death. Axolotl then carries within itself the Xolotl deity, and when the animal dies and its divine substance transits to the underworld, it later resurfaces to the earth and a new axolotl is born. 'Axolotl is the twin of maize, agave and water,' Montero said. Current fascination toward the axolotl and its rise to sacred status in pre-Hispanic times is hardly a coincidence. It was most likely sparked by its exceptional biological features, Montero said. Through the glass of a fish tank, where academic institutions preserve them and hatcheries put them up for sale, axolotl are hard to spot. Their skin is usually dark to mimic stones — though an albino, pinkish variety can be bred — and they can stay still for hours, buried in the muddy ground of their natural habitats or barely moving at the bottom of their tanks in captivity. Aside from their lungs, they breathe through their gills and skin, which allows them to adapt to their aquatic environment. And they can regenerate parts of its heart, spinal cord and brain. 'This species is quite peculiar,' said biologist Arturo Vergara, who supervises axolotl preservation efforts in various institutions and cares after specimens for sale at a hatchery in Mexico City. Depending on the species, color and size, the axolotl's prices at Ambystomania — where Vergara works — start at 200 pesos ($10 US). Specimens are available for sale when they reach 4 inches in length and are easy pets to look after, Vergara said. 'While they regularly have a 15-year life span [in captivity], we've had animals that have lived up to 20,' he added. 'They are very long-lived, though in their natural habitat they probably wouldn't last more than three or four years.' The species on display at the museum — one of 17 known varieties in Mexico — is endemic to lakes and canals that are currently polluted. A healthy population of axolotl would likely struggle to feed or reproduce. 'Just imagine the bottom of a canal in areas like Xochimilco, Tlahuac, Chalco, where there's an enormous quantity of microbes,' Vergara said. Under ideal conditions, an axolotl could heal itself from a snake or heron bite and survive the dry season buried in the mud. But a proper aquatic environment is needed for that to happen. 'Efforts to preserve axolotl go hand in hand with preserving the chinampas,' Cruz said at the museum, next to a display featuring salamander-shaped dolls. 'We work closely with the community to convince them that this is an important space.' In addition to being places where axolotl lay eggs, chinampas are areas where pre-Hispanic communities grew maize, chili, beans and zucchini, and some of Xochimilco's current population grow vegetables despite environmental threats. 'Many chinampas are dry and don't produce food anymore,' Cruz said. 'And where some chinampas used to be, one can now see soccer camps.' For her, like for Vergara, preserving the axolotl is not an end, but a means for saving the place where the amphibian came to be. 'This great system [chinampas] is all that's left from the lake city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, so I always tell our visitors that Xochimilco is a living archaeological zone,' Cruz said. 'If we, as citizens, don't take care of what's ours, it will be lost.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ancient-deity-pet-endangered-species-axolotl-is-mexico-s-most-beloved-amphibian-/7982877.html	2025-02-22T00:29:39-08:00

Amid rising worldwide populism, America's premier conservative conference goes global	WASHINGTON — This week, thousands of conservative politicians, activists and influencers convened outside Washington for the Conservative Political Action Conference, the premier annual gathering of the American right. The four-day event, hosted by the American Conservative Union since 1974, features U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, among other high-profile speakers from around the world. Dubbed the 'Woodstock for conservatives,' CPAC was once the go-to event for conservative Republicans and presidential hopefuls, with its presidential straw poll serving as a barometer of grassroots support. However, Trump's political rise in recent years has transformed it into a platform for populism. Driven by the rise of populist movements globally, the conference has ventured overseas in the past decade. It launched its first international conference in Japan in 2017, expanded to Australia, Brazil and South Korea in 2019, then added Hungary, Mexico and Israel in 2022. Argentina joined the fold last year following the election of populist President Javier Milei. The international conferences, CPAC says, serve to 'unite conservatives from all over the world, strengthen the movement, and challenge globalism.' They are also used for public outreach, recruitment and mobilization, according to a recent paper on CPAC by Grant A. Silverman, a research assistant at George Washington University in Washington. CPAC's growing international outreach mirrors a recent surge in far-right populism worldwide. Last year's foreign speakers included Presidents Nayib Bukele of El Salvador and Javier Milei of Argentina, as well as Prime Minister Victor Orbán of Hungary. Here's a look at some of the foreign speakers for this year's CPAC and what they're saying: Javier Milei, Argentine president Milei, wielding a chain saw, electrified the CPAC crowd Thursday when he shared the stage with billionaire Elon Musk and presented Musk, Trump's cost-cutting czar, with his signature campaign prop. 'This is the chain saw of bureaucracy,' Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, shouted, waving the tool. As head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk, who made his first CPAC appearance, is spearheading the Trump administration's massive governmentwide cost-cutting efforts. This marks Milei's third CPAC appearance. The self-styled 'anarcho-capitalist' campaigned in 2023 on shrinking Argentina's government, often brandishing a chain saw at rallies. At last year's Washington conference, he vowed to eliminate unnecessary government agencies, declaring, 'We will not surrender until we make Argentina great again!' Speaking at CPAC Argentina in December, Milei declared that the 'new winds of freedom are sweeping through the world' and called on allies to fight against 'lefties.' 'We must stand together, establishing channels of cooperation throughout the world,' he told the crowd. Jair Bolsonaro, former president of Brazil Brazil's former right-wing president is a CPAC regular. After Bolsonaro lost a reelection bid in 2022, his supporters stormed federal government buildings in an alleged attempt to seize power. Banned from seeking office until 2030, Bolsonaro faces charges of plotting a coup. His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, organizes CPAC Brazil. At last year's conference in Balneario Camboriu, the elder Bolsonaro joined Milei and other right-wing politicians from Latin America to hail conservatism's global rise and expressed hope for Trump's return to office. For his part, Milei used the platform to denounce socialism, saying it restricts liberties and breeds corruption. Robert Fico, prime minister of Slovakia Robert Fico makes his CPAC debut this year. Though he leads a left-wing populist party, he has drawn controversy for his attacks on journalists, immigrants and LGBTQ+ people. In October, he called journalists 'bloody bastards' and threatened new media restrictions. An opponent of same-sex marriage, he has called adoption by gay couples a 'perversion.' During the Ukraine conflict, Fico has opposed European sanctions on Moscow and echoed Moscow's messaging, drawing comparisons to Hungary's pro-Kremlin prime minister. In May, he survived an assassination attempt by a gunman opposed to his stance against military assistance to Ukraine. Mateusz Morawiecki, former Polish prime minister After speaking at CPAC Hungary last year, Morawiecki makes his first U.S. appearance this year. He served as prime minister from 2017 to 2023 and is now a leading figure in the opposition Law and Justice Party. Despite his party's strong support for Ukraine, Morawiecki maintains close ties with Hungary's Orban and Spain's Santiago Abascal, leader of the conservative Vox political party. Abascal is an invited speaker at CPAC. Immigration is a unifying issue for Europe's right-wing populists. At last year's Hungary conference, Morawiecki called Orban his friend and credited his tough response to Europe's 2015 migration crisis with preventing 'chaos' in Europe. Liz Truss, former British prime minister The former Conservative Party leader and prime minister made her second CPAC appearance in a row Wednesday. Calling Britain a 'failed state' ruled by a socialist government, she called for a Trump-style MAGA movement to save it. 'We want a Trump revolution in Britain,' she said to applause, praising Trump's second presidency as 'the golden age of America.' Blaming Britain's decline on unelected bureaucrats, she urged the dismantlement of the 'deep state,' a favorite theme among conference attendees. 'We want Elon and his nerd army of muskrats examining the British deep state,' Truss said. Truss served just 49 days as prime minister and lost her Parliament seat last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-rising-worldwide-populism-america-s-premier-conservative-conference-goes-global/7984267.html	2025-02-21T21:14:46-08:00	
Israel prepares to receive 6 more hostages as fragile ceasefire appears to hold	Israel prepared Saturday to receive six more hostages, the latest exchange to take place under a fragile ceasefire that was threatened this week by the return of a misidentified body. Four of the hostages set to be released Saturday at 8:30 a.m. were taken by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, during its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Another two have been held since long before the war, entering Gaza separately under unexplained circumstances around a decade ago. In exchange, Israel is set to release more than 600 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. The latest exchange is set to take place despite Israeli allegations that hostage Shiri Bibas’ body was not returned to Israel as promised on Thursday. Hamas said that Bibas' remains appeared to have been mixed up with other human remains taken from rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit the place she was held. It said it had handed over Biabas’ body to the Red Cross on Friday. The Red Cross confirmed receiving human remains and said it had transferred them to Israeli authorities. Israeli officials said the remains were taken to a forensics lab for testing. Earlier Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas will 'pay the price' for failing to release the body of Bibas as prescribed by the peace agreement with Israel. In a video statement, Netanyahu said 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages — both living and dead — and ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement.' The bodies of three Israeli hostages and the body of a fourth, unidentified woman, were returned to Israel on Thursday in the latest release under the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Those released Thursday included the youngest captives — infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas. The body of their mother, Shiri Bibas, was also supposed to be released. But the Israeli military said the female body was not Bibas. The body does not belong to any other hostage and remains unidentified, the military said. The Israeli military accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement. 'This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is obliged under the agreement to return four deceased hostages,' the military said in a statement. The Bibas family was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video of the abduction showed Shiri Bibas swaddling the boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. Hamas has said the boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023. Israel never confirmed that claim. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, was also released Thursday. Israel and Hamas are in the first phase of a ceasefire that began on Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. Hamas killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel and took about 250 people as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-prepares-to-receive-6-more-hostages-as-fragile-ceasefire-appears-to-hold/7984263.html	2025-02-21T20:21:36-08:00

In CPAC remarks, White House national security adviser pledges crackdown on Mexican cartels	Politicians, media personalities and conservative activists gathered outside Washington on Friday for the second day of a conference featuring a range of political allies of President Donald Trump. Speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) heralded the Trump administration’s first month in office, with dozens of executive orders that have proposed sweeping changes to a wide range of government policies and positions on international issues. Mike Waltz, the president's national security adviser, told the CPAC audience Friday that the Trump administration’s efforts to end the Ukraine war are certain to include U.S. investments in Ukraine’s mineral assets as part of a plan to recoup some funding for Ukraine’s defense. Earlier this week, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected a proposal that would grant American companies 50% ownership of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, but Waltz on Friday said the Ukrainian leader 'is going to sign' a revised U.S. offer. Waltz also said the Trump administration plans to 'unleash holy hell' on drug cartels. On Wednesday, the State Department designated several Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups. Journalist-turned-politician Kari Lake, whom Trump said in December he would like to see lead Voice of America, spoke about what she sees as the president’s wins in his first month in office, and her views on legacy media. 'Watching what President Trump has accomplished and done in one month is so incredible,' Lake said, referring to actions by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and the State Department to search for corruption and curtail spending, including by ending foreign aid funding. A former TV journalist in Arizona for nearly 30 years, Lake spoke of how she quit journalism because of what she felt was disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. 'We're still surrounded by too many fake journalists out there,' Lake said, adding that she believes the 'purpose of the mainstream media is no longer to inform us, it's to manipulate us.' She criticized Associated Press reporting on government officials and independent bodies who validated the results of the 2020 election, saying, 'They still pretend the 2020 election was the most secure election in all of history.' Lake also said that she is honored that Trump named her to lead VOA, and said she will focus the news agency on producing 'accurate and honest reporting.' 'VOA has been telling America's story to the world for 83 years this Monday. Sometimes the coverage has been incredible and sometimes it's been pitiful,' Lake said. 'We are fighting an information war, and there's no better weapon than the truth, and I believe VOA could be that weapon.' Among those who have called for the network to be cut is Musk. 'We won't become Trump TV,' she said, 'but it sure as hell will not be ‘TDS TV.’ You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, '60 minutes,' The Washington Post and The New York Times.' Trump is expected to address the CPAC gathering on Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-cpac-remarks-white-house-national-security-adviser-pledges-crackdown-on-mexican-cartels/7984247.html	2025-02-21T18:51:49-08:00	
Ukraine marks war’s 3rd anniversary as US support wavers	Uncertainty looms over U.S.-Ukraine relations as Ukraine enters the fourth year of war with Russia. Recent shifts in Washington’s rhetoric have raised fears that Ukraine could be pressured into an unfavorable peace deal -- or be left to confront Russia without U.S. support. While most Ukrainians are now in favor of peace talks, many insist any settlement be on Ukraine’s terms.

UN Security Council demands rebels withdraw from captured Congolese cities	united nations — The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Friday demanding that the M23 rebels in eastern Congo immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from territories they have seized. The council also threatened sanctions on those who prolong the conflict. France, which drafted the text, said it sends a clear message that there is no military solution to the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. 'The priority is to reach an effective, unconditional and immediate ceasefire agreement,' Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said. 'A restoration of dialogue is urgent, with support from mediation at the regional level. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC needs to be respected.' The resolution also calls on the Rwanda Defense Forces to cease their support 'to the M23 and immediately withdraw from DRC territory without preconditions.' Council members accuse the Rwandan Defense Forces of 'direct support' of the M23. Rwanda has repeatedly denied allegations that it supports the rebels. The Security Council also strongly urged the the DRC and Rwanda 'to return without preconditions to diplomatic talks as a matter of urgency' and to implement their existing commitments under two regional mediations known as the Luanda and Nairobi processes. Land grab Thousands of Rwandan-backed M23 rebels continue to seize territory in the mineral-rich eastern part of the DRC with little resistance from the national army. Since mid-December, they have focused on the provinces of North and South Kivu, seizing North Kivu's capital, Goma, in late January and moving to South Kivu's capital, Bukavu, on February 14. The rebels have also taken control of other important towns, including Masisi, Sake and Nyabibwe, and have established 'parallel administrations' in some of the territories they control. On Friday, the head of the U.N. mission in the eastern DRC said the rebels appear to have their sights set on the capital, Kinshasa. 'Very public declarations and statements by AFC/M23, clearly repeated over time and including last week, show that the intent is to go up to Kinshasa,' Bintou Keita, the U.N. special representative of the secretary-general in the DRC, told reporters in a video briefing from Kinshasa. 'It is our understanding, looking at what is going on in North Kivu, but also the onward push towards South Kivu, and we understand they are pushing a bit further to Tanganyika.' Rwanda alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. 'We believe that any outcome that doesn't take Rwanda's security concerns seriously will not offer a sustainable solution to the conflict,' said Rwandan Ambassador Ernest Rwamucyo. 'The security challenges posed by FDLR and its splinter groups are of very serious concern for Rwanda. DRC must be held accountable for its continued preservation of FDLR, embedding it in its army, equipping the FDLR with sophisticated weapons and using it as an ally and fighting force.' In its resolution, the council condemned 'support provided by DRC military forces to specific armed groups, in particular the FDLR,' calling for it to stop. The council also urged the parties to rapidly implement 'the harmonized plan for the neutralization' of the FDLR and the 'disengagement of forces from the territory of the DRC.' Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been caught up in the fighting. The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that it needs $40.4 million to assist 275,000 internally displaced people in eastern DRC and to support a potential influx of 258,000 refugees and returnees going to neighboring countries. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. Congolese Ambassador Zenon Ngay Mukongo welcomed the council's action but said it came late, after weeks of repeated appeals from his government. 'In this particular case, the council's paralysis gave free rein to the illegal occupation of DRC territory by the Rwandan Defense Forces and their supporters in the AFC/M23,' he said, 'in the knowledge that every further day of inaction compromises regional and international peace and security, only strengthens the aggressor, and undermines the United Nations' credibility.' On Thursday, the United States unilaterally imposed sanctions on a senior Rwandan official and a spokesperson for a coalition of armed groups that includes the M23 for fueling violence in the eastern DRC. 'We applaud similar actions taken by other member states aimed at compelling Rwanda to return to the negotiating table and bring this violence to an end,' U.S. envoy Dorothy Shea said. Sierra Leone's envoy offered a lesson to the parties from his country's 11-year civil war in the 1990s. Ambassador Michael Kanu said that at some point the parties realized the conflict would not end on the battlefield and that dialogue was the only viable path to sustainable peace. 'We had to talk with each other in good faith and commit to signing a peace agreement with the necessary political will,' Kanu said. 'Talking to adversaries is hard. Perhaps a taboo for some. But we do not make peace with friends, but with adversaries.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-demands-rebels-withdraw-from-captured-congolese-cities/7984216.html	2025-02-21T17:39:27-08:00	
Trump fires chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump abruptly fired Air Force General CQ Brown as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Friday, sidelining a history-making fighter pilot and respected officer as part of a campaign to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity in the ranks. The ouster of Brown, only the second Black general to serve as chairman, is sure to send shock waves through the Pentagon. His 16 months in the job had been consumed with the war in Ukraine and the expanded conflict in the Middle East. 'I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family,' Trump posted on social media. Trump said he was nominating Air Force Lieutenant General Dan 'Razin' Caine to be the next chairman. Trump acted despite support for Brown among key members of Congress and a seemingly friendly meeting with him in mid-December, when the two were seated next to each other for a time at the Army-Navy football game. Brown had been meeting regularly with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who took over the top Pentagon job just four weeks ago.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-fires-chairman-of-joint-chiefs-of-staff-/7984199.html	2025-02-21T17:01:47-08:00	
AP sues White House officials over denial of access	WASHINGTON — The Associated Press filed a lawsuit against three White House officials on Friday after the news agency was barred from some of U.S. President Donald Trump's events. The AP, in the suit filed in a federal court in Washington, said the denial of access violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and of the press. The White House began blocking AP journalists from the Oval Office 10 days ago over the news agency's refusal to follow Trump's executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the 'Gulf of America.' The ban on AP reporters was later extended to Air Force One. The news group said it was bringing the suit against three Trump administration officials to 'vindicate its rights to the editorial independence guaranteed by the United States Constitution.' 'The White House has ordered The Associated Press to use certain words in its coverage or else face an indefinite denial of access,' the AP said. 'The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,' it said. 'The Constitution does not allow the government to control speech. Allowing such government control and retaliation to stand is a threat to every American's freedom.' The suit names as defendants White House chief of staff Susan Wiles and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich, as well as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. 'We'll see them in court,' Leavitt said during an appearance Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. 'We feel we are in the right. We are going to ensure that truth and accuracy is present at that White House every single day,' she said. In its style guide, the AP noted that the Gulf of Mexico has 'carried that name for more than 400 years.' 'The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen,' it said. 'As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.' Trump called the AP a 'radical left organization' on Thursday and said the new Gulf of America name is 'something that we feel strongly about.' His leveraging of press access underscores the Republican president's long-standing animosity toward traditional news outlets, which he accuses of bias against him. The White House Correspondents' Association has called AP's exclusion from Trump events outrageous. The 180-year-old news agency has long been a pillar of U.S. journalism and provides news to print, TV and radio outlets across the United States and around the world. Voice of America subscribes to The Associated Press, which provides video, audio and written content.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ap-sues-white-house-officials-over-denial-of-access-/7984165.html	2025-02-21T16:19:02-08:00	
Pope's condition not life-threatening, but his life is still in danger, doctors say	Pope Francis' medical team said Friday that his medical condition was not life-threatening, but that the pontiff was not out of danger. 'If the question is, 'Is he out of danger?' the answer is, 'No,' ' Sergio Alfieri, the head of the team of doctors at Rome's Gemelli Hospital taking care of the pope, said. 'But if you then ask us if, at this moment, his life is in danger, the answer is [also], 'No.'' The doctors said Francis was in good spirits and had maintained his sense of humor. Alfieri said when he greeted the pope Friday in the pope's hospital suite as 'Holy Father,' the pope returned the greeting with 'Holy Son.' Francis, the leader of the world's Roman Catholics, was admitted to the hospital last week after a case of bronchitis worsened. At the hospital, he was diagnosed with double pneumonia and a complex bacterial, viral and fungal infection, and doctors placed Francis on a strengthened drug therapy. Francis also has been receiving supplements of oxygen when needed, his doctors said Friday. Alfieri said Francis was not on a ventilator. Alfieri said there was a possibility that germs from Francis' respiratory tract could enter his bloodstream, causing sepsis, but there was currently no evidence that it had happened. Sepsis is a complication of an infection that can lead to organ failure and death. The 88-year-old pontiff has been able to get out of bed and do some work, according to his doctors. They said Francis would remain in the hospital 'at least' through next week. With his hospitalization, there has been speculation about Francis stepping down from his duties as head of the Roman Catholic Church, a post he has held since 2013. His immediate predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, was the first pope in 600 years to resign. In a recent memoir, Francis addressed the possibility of his own resignation if he became incapacitated. He said such a move would be a 'distant possibility,' justified only if he were facing 'a serious physical impediment.' However, in 2022, Francis confirmed he wrote a resignation letter not long after becoming pope. He said it was written in case medical issues prevented him from executing his papal duties. The Catholic faithful around the world have been encouraged to pray for Francis' rapid recovery. On Friday in the Philippines, a hourlong prayer was held for Francis at the Manila Cathedral. Francis celebrated Mass in a Manila park in 2015, drawing a record-breaking crowd of 6 million, according to official estimates. Saturday is the Feast of the Chair of St. Peter, a day commemorating the authority Jesus gave to the pope. Catholics are set to gather outside Gemelli Hospital to pray for Francis' health, according to the Catholic News Agency. Some information for this article came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-s-condition-not-life-threatening-but-his-life-is-still-in-danger-doctors-say/7983943.html	2025-02-21T15:39:19-08:00	
N. Koreans' high casualties in Ukraine blamed on inexperience	washington — North Korean troops that joined Moscow's forces about four months ago in Russia's border region of Kursk are estimated to have suffered considerable casualties in the war against Ukraine, which analysts attribute to their lack of front-line combat experience. Numbers from different sources vary, but more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers are believed to have died or been injured while fighting Ukrainian forces. The South Korean National Intelligence Service cited the figure in mid-January, breaking it down to at least 300 killed and another 2,700 wounded. In an interview published Monday by South Korea's Chosun Daily, Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence, said North Korean troops had suffered about 4,000 casualties. That would be one-third of the 12,000 North Korean soldiers who the U.S. in December estimated had been deployed to the Kursk region. A peace deal is being pushed by the Trump administration to end the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Frontal assaults 'The North Korean military personnel fighting in the Kursk region are being used for frontal assaults without much military support such as artillery and armor and drones, against some of the very best Ukrainian forces,' said Bruce Bennett, senior defense researcher at the Rand Corporation. 'Many of the North Korean forces used by the Russians were trained to be special forces intended to penetrate into the enemy rear and operate there,' he said. 'Their North Korean training was not for frontal assaults, and they appear to not have been trained in Russia very well for such tactics, especially given the evolution of warfare to involve drones and other factors.' If the Russians are using North Korean special operations forces as light infantry units, then 'they are wasting their soldiers' lives' because they are not using the soldiers' special operations training, said David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy. If the Ukrainian forces are 'employing effective combined arms maneuver with integrated fire support, they will inflict tremendous damage against frontal assaults,' he said. Another reason for high casualties among North Korean troops could be 'communications problems if they are working under the command of Russian forces,' Maxwell said. 'The language challenge hinders interoperability and the ability of the Russians to provide support' to the North Koreans. Many of the North Korean troops deployed to Russia are reportedly from the regime's elite special forces unit known as the 11th Corps of the Korean People's Army, also known as the Storm Corps. Headquartered in Tokchon, North Korea, the Storm Corps is trained to infiltrate and sabotage enemy operations and assassinate targets. North Korea began sending troops to Russia in October. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the time that if the forces entered the war, it would be 'a very, very serious issue' affecting not only Europe but also the Indo-Pacific region. The deployment of North Korean troops, in addition to the munitions the country had been sending to Russia since October 2023, represented an escalation of military ties between Pyongyang and Moscow and a dangerous expansion of Russia's war, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said in October. The same month, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun described North Korean troops as 'mere cannon fodder mercenaries' for Russia's 'illegal war of aggression.' Russia has been using so-called meat-grinder tactics to fight Ukraine. The strategy involves mobilizing a large number of troops in a concentrated area of combat to bombard the enemy and break through its defenses. The attackers often suffer a high number of casualties. Escalation of conflict Ukrainian forces first reported encountering North Korean units on Nov. 5 in the Kursk region. Shortly afterward, Russia, reportedly using meat-grinder tactics, suffered a record number of casualties for the month. Russia suffered more than 2,000 casualties on Nov. 28 alone, which helped raise the average daily Russian casualties for the month to a new high of 1,523, according to the Institute for the Study of War, citing an analysis from the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense. Adding to the casualties are the lethal World War I-style combat tactics, such as heavy artillery bombardments and trench warfare, that have made a comeback in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Russians and North Koreans 'are fighting in this horrible, almost World War I-style combat, where all sides, including the Ukrainians, are taking huge casualties' with 'tons of artillery' and 'missiles and rockets and tanks,' said Bruce Bechtol, a professor focusing on East Asia and international security at Angelo State University in Texas. Since the start of the war, Russia is estimated to have incurred more than 860,000 casualties, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported Friday. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and about 380,000 had been injured over that same period. Bechtol, a former intelligence officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency, said North Korean and Russian casualties could have been 'exaggerated,' and it might not be possible to assess exact figures, even after the war ends. In October, neither Moscow nor Pyongyang denied the possibility of North Korean troop deployment to Russia, nor did either fully acknowledge that North Korean soldiers were fighting Ukrainian forces.

Los Angeles mayor ousts fire chief for response to deadly fires	LOS ANGELES — Six weeks after the most destructive wildfire in city history, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass ousted the city's fire chief Friday amid a public rift over preparations for a potential fire and finger-pointing between the chief and City Hall over responsibility for the devastation. Bass said in a statement that she is removing Chief Kristin Crowley immediately. 'Bringing new leadership to the Fire Department is what our city needs,' Bass said in a statement. 'We know that 1,000 firefighters that could have been on duty on the morning the fires broke out were instead sent home on Chief Crowley's watch,' Bass disclosed. She added that the chief refused a request to prepare an 'after-action report' on the fires, which she called a necessary step in the investigation. The Palisades Fire began during heavy winds Jan. 7, destroying or damaging nearly 8,000 homes, businesses and other structures and killing at least 12 people in the Los Angeles neighborhood. Another wind-whipped fire started the same day in suburban Altadena, a community to the east, killing at least 17 people and destroying or damaging more than 10,000 homes and other buildings. Bass has been facing criticism for being in Africa as part of a presidential delegation on the day the fires started, even though weather reports had warned of dangerous fire conditions in the days before she left. In televised interviews this week, Bass acknowledged she made a mistake by leaving the city. But she inferred she wasn't aware of the looming danger when she flew around the globe to attend the inauguration of Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama. She faulted Crowley for failing to alert her to the potentially explosive fire conditions. Crowley has publicly criticized the city for budget cuts that she said made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs. Crowley was named fire chief in 2022 by Bass' predecessor at a time when the department was in turmoil over allegations of rampant harassment, hazing and discrimination.

Thousands fly to Lebanon for funeral of Hezbollah's slain leader	BEIRUT — Nearly five months after Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike, thousands of supporters of the longtime leader of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group have flown into Beirut for his funeral on Sunday. Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27 when Israel's air force dropped more than 80 bombs on Hezbollah's main operations room in southern Beirut. It was the biggest and most consequential of Israel's targeted killings in years. The death of Nasrallah, one of the Iran-backed Shiite group's founders and the organization’s leader of more than 30 years, was a huge blow to the group he had transformed into a potent force in the Middle East. Hezbollah, which the United States and some of its allies have designated a terrorist organization, has suffered significant losses in the latest war with Israel, including the killing of several of its most senior military and political figures. Nasrallah's cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later, will be laid to rest in his hometown in southern Lebanon. The two had temporarily been buried in secret locations. Hezbollah earlier this month announced plans for their official funerals. Crowds are expected to gather Sunday at Beirut's main sports stadium for a funeral ceremony before Nasrallah's interment. Flights from Iraq, where Hezbollah has a huge following among Iraqi Shiites, have been full for days. According to an Iraqi Transportation Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the flights, up to 6,000 people have flown to Beirut recently. Nasrallah, idolized by his supporters and with large followings among the Shiites and the Islamic world, also held the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric's lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. However, Lebanese authorities revoked permission for a passenger plane from Iran, leaving dozens who had wanted to attend the funeral stranded in Tehran and triggering protests by Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon. The ban came after the Israeli army accused Iran of smuggling cash to Hezbollah by way of civilian flights, leading some in Lebanon to allege that their government had caved in the face of a threat from Israel. Some of those who were expected to fly in from Iran were now coming to Lebanon via Iraq. Also, members of Iran-backed groups in the region also were traveling to Beirut to attend Nasrallah's funeral. Kazim al-Fartousi, spokesperson for the Iran-backed Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada group in Iraq, arrived on Friday. He said Nasrallah was 'the father, commander and the book that we read every day to learn about freedom.' Republican U.S. Representative Joe Wilson criticized Lebanese politicians who were planning to attend the funeral. 'Any Lebanese politician who attends the funeral of the murderous terrorist Hasan Nasrallah is standing with the Iranian Regime,' Wilson said on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-fly-to-lebanon-for-funeral-of-hezbollah-s-slain-leader/7983886.html	2025-02-21T14:01:18-08:00	
Man wounded in stabbing at Berlin's Holocaust memorial	berlin — A man was seriously injured in a stabbing at Berlin's Holocaust memorial, police said Friday evening, two days before a watershed national election. Police said they did not know the identity or motive of the male attacker, who was still at large. The investigation was continuing. Video of the scene showed emergency vehicles and heavily armored police lined along one side of the memorial site, a vast field of grey concrete pillars. The memorial is across a street from the U.S. Embassy. 'An as yet unidentified male suspect attacked a person standing here, who was so seriously injured that he had to be taken by the fire brigade to hospital for emergency treatment,' police spokesperson Florian Nath said. The attack occurred around 6 p.m. (1700 GMT). The victim's life was not in danger, and he was being prepared for surgery, Nath said. He added that police did not believe there was any imminent danger to the public. The monument, one of the German capital's most sacred sites, commemorates the 6 million Jews murdered by Adolf Hitler's Nazis during World War II, one of the darkest episodes in human history and a continuing focus of German historical atonement. The area surrounding the monument was sealed off. The national election campaign, in which polls suggest a far-right party could come in second place for the first time in nine decades, has been marred by a series of high-profile attacks. One of those was a stabbing blamed on an Afghan immigrant, which prompted a fraught debate on immigration. Earlier on Friday, an 18-year-old ethnic Chechen was arrested on suspicion of planning an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Berlin, Bild newspaper reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-wounded-in-stabbing-at-berlin-s-holocaust-memorial/7983855.html	2025-02-21T13:36:28-08:00	
Thousands rally in Slovakia to mark the 2018 slayings of an investigative journalist and his fiancee	BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA — Thousands rallied across Slovakia on Friday to mark the seventh anniversary of the slayings of an investigative journalist and his fiancee. The rallies are part of a wave of protests against the pro-Russia policies of populist Prime Minister Robert Fico. People in Slovakia's capital, Bratislava, observed a minute of silence to honor Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova, both age 27. They were shot to death at their home in the town of Velka Maca, east of Bratislava, on Feb. 21, 2018. The killings prompted major street protests unseen since the 1989 anti-communist Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia. The ensuing political crisis led to the collapse of a coalition government headed by Fico. Kuciak had been investigating possible government corruption, among other issues, when he was killed. People applauded the parents of Kuciak and the mother of Kusnirova, who greeted them from the stage. 'I believe that our common fight will be successful,' said Jozef Kuciak, the father of Jan. Marian Kocner, a businessman who had been accused of masterminding the killings, has been acquitted twice. Prosecutors have said they believe Kocner paid the convicted triggerman to carry it out and appealed. The current anti-government protests are the biggest demonstrations since the 2018 slayings. They are fueled by Fico's recent trip to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a rare visit to the Kremlin by a European Union leader since Moscow's all-out invasion of Ukraine began almost three years ago and his recent remarks that Slovakia might leave the 27-nation EU and NATO. 'We've had enough of Fico,' people chanted. The crowds at rallies in 47 towns and cities at home and 16 abroad, according to organizers, demanded Fico's resignation. About 10,000 protesters chanted 'Resign, resign,' at Freedom Square in Bratislava. Fico's views on Russia have sharply differed from the European mainstream. He returned to power last year after his leftist party Smer (Direction) won a parliamentary election in 2023. He has since ended Slovakia's military aid for Ukraine, criticized EU sanctions on Russia and vowed to block Ukraine from joining NATO. He declared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as an enemy after Ukraine halted on Russian gas supplies to Slovakia and some other European customers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-rally-in-slovakia-to-mark-the-2018-slayings-of-an-investigative-journalist-and-his-fiancee-/7983798.html	2025-02-21T12:42:53-08:00	
Nearly 100 cases of measles reported in Texas, New Mexico	The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 90 cases across seven counties, the state health department posted online Friday, and 16 people are hospitalized. In neighboring eastern New Mexico, the measles case count is up to nine, though state public health officials said Thursday there's still no evidence this outbreak is connected to the one in Texas. The West Texas cases are concentrated in eight counties in West Texas. Texas state health department data shows that most of the cases are among people younger than 18. Twenty-six cases are in kids younger than 4 and 51 are in kids 5-17 years old. Ten adults have measles, and three cases are pending an age determination. The Ector County Health Department told the Odessa American its case was in a child too young to be vaccinated. State health officials have said this outbreak is Texas' largest in nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week that cases have been concentrated in a 'close-knit, undervaccinated' Mennonite community — especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled. In New Mexico, all of the cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas. The state health department has said people may have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church, hospital and a pharmacy in Hobbs, New Mexico. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. The vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year. There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation. In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called 'herd immunity.' But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn't include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported. Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinics and screening efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots. New Mexico health officials are also hosting several vaccination clinics in Hobbs next week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nearly-100-cases-of-measles-reported-in-texas-new-mexico/7983785.html	2025-02-21T12:31:09-08:00	
US states push back against possible election security changes	WASHINGTON — Moves by U.S. President Donald Trump to potentially gut programs aimed at supporting election security are not sitting well with key state election officials, who are now asking the Trump administration to reconsider. The National Association of Secretaries of State sent a letter Friday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warning that changes to the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency could endanger future elections. 'Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,' according to the letter, signed by NASS president, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and NASS president-elect, Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson. 'CISA’s prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats,' they added. NASS is a bipartisan group that represents chief election officials from nearly 40 U.S. states. Simon is a Democrat. Watson is a Republican. The letter says that while U.S. elections 'firmly remain a state and local responsibility,' several initiatives from CISA have provided valuable services and allowed for the sharing of critical information for states that choose to participate. It lists cybersecurity services, physical security assessments, information through the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), classified and unclassified intelligence briefings and on-the-ground incident response services as among the programs that NASS members would like to continue. VOA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security about the letter but has not received a response. CISA was formally created in 2018, charged with protecting the country’s critical infrastructure. It has also served as a lead agency on election security. DHS officials announced a review of the agency earlier this month citing what they described as a need for CISA 'to refocus on its mission.' 'The agency is undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and mal-information,' said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. According to DHS, as of mid-February, more than 130 CISA employees had been placed on administrative leave. NASS expressed hope some of the election related programs can be preserved, offering to meet with DHS officials, including Noem. '[We] respect your authority to reassess existing priorities, structures, staffing, and missions,' the NASS letter said. 'We favor continuity of the core resources above and welcome the opportunity as Chief Election Officials to discuss any potential changes or impacts to election security-related services before making a final decision.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-states-push-back-against-possible-election-security-changes-/7983778.html	2025-02-21T12:26:54-08:00	
White House official expects Ukraine to accept mineral deal	President Donald Trump's national security adviser said Friday that he expected Ukraine to accept and sign a proposed deal that would include U.S. investments in its mineral assets to help recoup some U.S. defense funding. The Trump administration had proposed the rare earth mineral deal as part of the larger negotiation toward ending the war in Ukraine. Mike Waltz's comments followed reports that the Trump administration presented Kyiv with a revised version of a minerals agreement after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the initial proposal. Speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington, Waltz said: 'Well, look, here's the bottom line: President Zelenskyy is going to sign that deal. And you will see that in the very short term. And that is good for Ukraine.' Those comments came following a sharp exchange between Trump and Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president, responding to Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine started its war with Russia, said the U.S. president was living in a Russian-influenced 'disinformation space.' Trump countered on his Truth Social platform, calling Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections.' On Friday, Trump referenced his indirect exchanges with Zelenskyy while speaking to a gathering of the Republican State Governors Association at the White House. The president described having 'very good talks with [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin,' and 'not such good talks with Ukraine.' He mentioned how Ukraine talks 'tough' but does not have a lot of bargaining chips. Trump sent Keith Kellogg, his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, to Kyiv for meetings with Zelenskyy on Thursday. Comments following that meeting indicated the relationship had been smoothed over. On his X social media account, Zelenskyy had nothing but positive things to say. 'My meeting with General Kellogg was one that restores hope, and we need strong agreements with the U.S. — agreements that will truly work,' Zelenskyy said. 'I have instructed my team to work quickly and very sensibly.' 'We all need peace — Ukraine, Europe, America and the entire world,' Zelenskyy added. Kellogg, from his X account, reposted Zelenskyy’s comments, and stated, 'Extensive and positive discussions with [Zelenskyy], the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war, and his talented national security team.' Much of the tension this past week involved talks on Ukraine between a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. No Ukrainian or European representatives were present. Rubio later noted that the meeting did not involve any fine points of the deal. Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms that could be more favorable to Moscow. Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine's internationally recognized territory. U.S. Vice President JD Vance told the CPAC meeting Thursday that Trump 'wants the killing to stop' in Ukraine and that 'peace is in the interest of the American people.' Vance said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, 'We're on the cusp of peace.' He did not mention Ukraine's role in settling the conflict, although U.S. officials have said Kyiv and Moscow will both be involved in the settlement and will have to make concessions to achieve peace. European leaders have responded to Trump's recent remarks about Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if the fighting ends. The Kremlin says the plan is a major cause for concern, but Zelenskyy and NATO have welcomed it. Tatiana Vorozhko Koprowicz, Myroslava Gongadze and Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report. Some information came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-official-expects-ukraine-to-accept-mineral-deal-/7983752.html	2025-02-21T12:16:23-08:00	
Suspect found guilty of attempted murder in author Salman Rushdie attack	MAYVILLE, NEW YORK — A New Jersey man was convicted Friday of attempted murder for stabbing author Salman Rushdie multiple times on a New York lecture stage in 2022. Jurors, who deliberated for less than two hours, also found Hadi Matar, 27, guilty of assault for wounding a man who was on stage with Rushdie at the time. Matar ran onto the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where Rushdie was about to speak on Aug. 12, 2022, and stabbed him more than a dozen times before a live audience. The attack left the 77-year-old prizewinning novelist blind in one eye. Rushdie was the key witness during seven days of testimony, describing in graphic detail his life-threatening injuries and long and painful recovery. Matar, sitting at the defense table, looked down but had no obvious reaction when the jury delivered the verdict. As he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs, he quietly uttered, 'Free Palestine,' echoing comments he has frequently made while entering and leaving the trial. His public defender, Nathaniel Barone, said Matar was disappointed but also well-prepared for the verdict. District Attorney Jason Schmidt played a slow-motion video of the attack for the jury Friday during his closing argument, pointing out the assailant as he emerged from the audience, walked up a staircase to the stage and broke into a run toward Rushdie. 'I want you to look at the unprovoked nature of this attack,' Schmidt said. 'I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack. There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted.' Assistant public defender Andrew Brautigan told the jury that prosecutors have not proved that Matar intended to kill Rushdie. The distinction is important for an attempted-murder conviction. 'You will agree something bad happened to Mr. Rushdie, but you don't know what Mr. Matar's conscious objective was,' Brautigan said. Matar had knives with him but no gun or bomb, his attorneys have said previously. And in response to testimony that the injuries were life-threatening, they have noted that Rushdie's heart and lungs were uninjured. Schmidt said while it's not possible to read Matar's mind, 'it's foreseeable that if you're going to stab someone 10 or 15 times about the face and neck, it's going to result in a fatality.' Schmidt reminded jurors about the testimony of a trauma surgeon, who said Rushdie's injuries would have been fatal without quick treatment. He also slowed down video showing Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. Rushdie raises his arms and rises from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them. Rushdie is seen flailing on the ground, waving a hand covered in bright red blood. Schmidt freezes on a frame showing Rushdie, his face also bloodied, as he's surrounded by people. 'We've shown you intent,' Schmidt said. The recordings also picked up the gasps and screams from audience members who had been seated to hear Rushdie speak with City of Asylum Pittsburgh founder Henry Reese about keeping writers safe. Reese suffered a gash to his forehead, leading to the assault charge against Matar. The judge set sentencing for April 23. Matar could receive up to 25 years in prison.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-found-guilty-of-attempted-murder-in-author-salman-rushdie-attack-/7983754.html	2025-02-21T12:12:46-08:00

UN Security Council weighs calling on Rwanda to pull troops from Congo	UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations Security Council will vote Friday to call on Rwanda's military to stop supporting the M23 rebel group in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and immediately withdraw all troops from Congolese territory 'without preconditions.' The M23 has captured the two largest cities in eastern Congo and stoked fears of a wider war. Rwanda denies allegations from Congo and the U.N. that it supports the M23 with arms and troops. It says it is defending itself against Hutu militias which it accuses of fighting alongside the Congolese military. The French-drafted U.N. resolution 'strongly condemns the ongoing offensive and advances of the M23 in North-Kivu and South Kivu with the support of Rwanda Defense Forces (RDF)' and demands that M23 immediately stop its hostilities and withdraw. A council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Russia, China, Britain or France to be adopted. Several diplomats said it is expected to pass. Congo says Rwanda has used the M23 rebels as a proxy to loot its minerals such as gold and coltan, used in smartphones and computers. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on a Rwandan minister and a senior rebel for their alleged role in the conflict. The text also condemns support by Congolese troops 'to specific armed groups, in particular the FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda], and calls for the cessation of such support and for the urgent implementation of commitments to neutralize the group.' Rwanda accuses Congo of fighting alongside the FDLR. The Congolese military has vowed to arrest soldiers who cooperate with the FDLR, but the government has continued to use FDLR fighters as proxies, U.N. experts said in December. The M23 vows to defend Tutsi interests, particularly against ethnic Hutu militias such as the FDLR. The FDLR was founded by Hutus who fled Rwanda after participating in the 1994 genocide that killed close to 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The U.N. draft resolution urges the DRC and Rwanda to return to diplomatic talks to achieve a lasting peaceful resolution. The escalation of a decade-old insurgency has killed several peacekeepers with the U.N. force in Congo, known as MONUSCO. The draft U.N. resolution warns that 'attacks against peacekeepers may constitute war crimes and that planning, directing, sponsoring or participating in attacks against MONUSCO peacekeepers constitutes a basis for sanctions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-weighs-calling-on-rwanda-to-pull-troops-from-congo/7983635.html	2025-02-21T11:56:58-08:00	
Lack of consensus' as G20 meets amid turbulent times	JOHANNESBURG — The two-day Group of 20 foreign ministers meeting wrapped up in Johannesburg on Friday. Aimed at addressing global problems, the talks between the world’s wealthiest countries instead underscored the fault lines in the current geopolitical climate. Despite the warm welcome foreign dignitaries received at the meeting in Johannesburg, hosted by current G20 president South Africa, tensions were apparent before the event even got underway. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced earlier this month he was boycotting the meeting, citing what he called the 'anti-Americanism' on the agenda. These topics included climate change and equality for developing nations. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the discord head on in his opening speech, saying the world was under threat from rising intolerance and wars. 'Yet there is a lack of consensus among major powers, including the G20, on how to respond to these issues of global significance,' Ramaphosa said. Even a planned group photo fell through, though no official explanation was given for its last-minute cancellation. Steven Gruzd, an analyst at the South African Institute of International Affairs, spoke about the challenges the meeting presented. 'South Africa’s had a very difficult job of getting countries that are ideologically very far apart around the same table,' he said. South Africa has been under fire from the new U.S. administration, which accuses the government of land grabs, an accusation South Africa strongly denies. President Donald Trump recently cut financial assistance to the country over the allegations. Washington sent U.S. Embassy Charge d’Affaires Dana Brown in Rubio’s place. The embassy declined VOA’s request for an interview. But there were statements of support for South Africa leading the G20 from several European foreign ministers. Russia and China also sent their top envoys. In his remarks at the meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed his support for South Africa’s G20 presidency. He also noted that, 'the current international landscape is marked by transformation and turbulence.' He added, China will 'work with all parties' on world peace, security and multilateralism. One topic that dominated at the meeting was Ukraine. The foreign ministers gathered days after Trump upended U.S. policy on the war, suggesting Ukraine was to blame for Russia’s 2022 invasion and labeling one-time U.S. ally Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a 'dictator.' Retired U.S. diplomat Brooks Spector said, 'Now that President Trump has effectively ended the general Western consensus on Ukraine, it’s obviously fallen to the European nations to be the primary source of support for Ukraine and its president and in fact its struggle against Russia.' The E.U. has indeed rallied in support of Zelenskyy after Trump’s comments. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, speaking on the sidelines of the meeting, voiced his concerns. 'A capitulation of Ukraine today would set a terrible example for every country in the world that would be under the threat of predation by its bigger neighbor,' he said. 'Is this the world in which we want to live?' However, in his closing remarks South African foreign minister Ronald Lamola put a positive spin on things, saying the meeting had been an overall success and delegates had held 'productive' talks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lack-of-consensus-as-g20-meets-amid-turbulent-times-/7983605.html	2025-02-21T11:54:32-08:00	
Judge cancels New York City mayor’s trial, keeps corruption charges intact	NEW YORK — A federal judge on Friday canceled the corruption trial of New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The judge also appointed counsel to advise him on how to handle the Justice Department's controversial request to drop charges against the Democrat. Judge Dale E. Ho's written order means he won't decide before mid-March whether to grant the dismissal of the case against the mayor of the nation's largest city. At a hearing Wednesday, Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove cited an executive order by President Donald Trump outlining his criminal justice priorities as he defended the request to drop charges. Adams confirmed at the hearing that he accepted that charges could later be reinstated. Critics suggest that the mayor would be required to carry out Trump's plans to round up New Yorkers who are in the country illegally if he wanted to remain free from prosecution. The request is 'virtually unreviewable in this courtroom,' Bove argued. Adams was indicted in September and accused of accepting more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. He faces multiple challengers in June's Democratic primary. He has pleaded not guilty and has insisted on his innocence. On Friday, the judge said he'd appointed Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general and acting U.S. attorney general, as amicus curiae to present arguments on the government's request to throw out the charges. Ho said he wanted all parties and Clement to address the legal standard for dismissing charges, whether a court may consider materials beyond the motion itself and under what circumstances additional procedural steps and further inquiry would be necessary. He also said he wants to know under what circumstances dismissal can occur without the ability to reinstate charges or with the ability to reinstate charges. He scheduled briefs to be filed by March 7 and, if necessary, oral arguments to occur on March 14. Late Thursday, three former U.S. attorneys — from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — submitted a letter urging Ho to 'hear from parties other than the government and the defendant in deciding about the appropriate next steps.' Adams will not be required to attend future hearings, the judge said. That could help mitigate some political damage for Adams as he could avoid being hauled back to court for hearings while he tries to convince the public that the case isn't distracting him from running the city. Adams has sought to project calm as questions over his independence have sparked a political crisis in his administration. This week, four of his top deputies resigned and Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that she had for now decided against removing Adams from office but would instead propose legislation to enhance state oversight of City Hall as a way to reestablish trust with New Yorkers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-cancels-new-york-city-mayor-s-trial-keeps-corruption-charges-intact/7983729.html	2025-02-21T11:53:10-08:00	
German police arrest Russian man over attack plot	BERLIN — German police said Friday they have arrested an 18-year-old Russian man on suspicion of planning a 'politically motivated' attack in Berlin, two days before national elections. The man was detained late Thursday in the state of Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin, police and prosecutors said in a statement. Authorities did not provide further details about the attack plot, but the Tagesspiegel newspaper reported the suspect was Chechen and is believed to have been planning an attack on the Israeli Embassy. The Israeli Embassy could not be reached for comment outside of business hours, while state prosecutors and the Russian Embassy did not immediately respond to written requests for comment from Reuters. German newspaper Bild reported Friday that the investigation had been the result of a tip-off from a foreign intelligence agency. It said the suspect had been trying to leave the country via Berlin's BER airport when he was detained. Riot police and specialist officers were involved in making the arrest, which came after that tip-off, officials said. 'No further details as to the background and motive can be given for the moment to protect the investigation,' they added. The man appeared in court Friday and was remanded in custody. German authorities are on high alert ahead of Sunday's federal elections. Some material in this report is from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-police-arrest-russian-man-over-attack-plot/7983573.html	2025-02-21T10:37:55-08:00	
US Treasury’s Bessent, China’s He trade economic complaints in call	WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent traded policy complaints with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng on Friday, with Bessent telling Beijing to do more to curb fentanyl trafficking and rebalance its economy, and He voicing concerns about President Donald Trump’s new tariffs, the two governments said. The top economic officials from the world’s two largest economies agreed to keep up communications, the Treasury said in a readout of the introductory video call. 'Secretary Bessent expressed serious concerns about the PRC’s counternarcotics efforts, economic imbalances, and unfair policies, and stressed the Administration’s commitment to pursue trade and economic policies that protect the American economy, the American worker, and our national security,' the Treasury said, using the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. Earlier, Chinese state media reported that He expressed concerns to Bessent over U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions on China during the call. The two sides had an 'in-depth' exchange of views on important issues in China-U.S. economic relations, and both agreed to keep communicating on matters of mutual concern, according to a readout released by Chinese state media. He, the lead China-U.S. trade negotiator on the Chinese side, and Bessent recognized the importance of bilateral economic and trade relations, the readout said. More tariffs China and the United States are seeking to manage their relationship as they stand on the precipice of a renewed trade war. Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all Chinese goods in early February, citing China's failure to stanch fentanyl trafficking. Beijing retaliated by imposing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. imports, including energy and farm equipment, and put several companies, including Google, on notice for possible sanctions. Trump has also planned further reciprocal tariffs for all countries that tax U.S. imports, a move that is likely to further escalate global trade tensions. During his election campaign, Trump threatened 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports. Trump said earlier this week he expected Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the U.S., without giving a timeline for such a trip. Bessent said on Thursday he would tell his Chinese counterpart that China needed to rebalance its economy and rely more on domestic consumption for growth and less on investment and exports. 'They are suppressing the consumer in favor of the business community,' Bessent told Bloomberg Television. Similar arguments The U.S. had a $295.4 billion goods trade deficit with China in 2024, down from a peak of $418.2 billion in 2018, the year Trump began imposing new tariffs on some $370 billion of Chinese imports. But last year’s deficit rose $16.3 billion from 2023 as Chinese exporters rushed to beat a new round of Trump tariffs. Bessent’s predecessor, former Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, met several times with He in recent years and lodged similar complaints about China’s state-led economic policies. She argued during a trip to China last year that those policies were leading to excess production capacity that was threatening the viability of firms in the U.S. and other market economies, a warning that laid the groundwork for former President Joe Biden’s steep tariff hikes on electric vehicles, semiconductors and solar products. He and other Chinese officials never accepted U.S. excess capacity assertions, arguing that China’s EV and other key industries are simply more competitive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-s-bessent-china-s-he-trade-economic-complaints-in-call/7983523.html	2025-02-21T10:19:03-08:00	
57% of Ukrainians trust President Zelenskyy, Ukrainian institute says	February 24 marks the three-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with international efforts aimed at ending the conflict in progress. Amid criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by the new Trump administration, research shows the majority of Ukraine’s population trusts Zelenskyy and is not ready to elect a president during war time.

Four scenarios for securing peace in Ukraine	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for a peaceful resolution to Russia’s now three-year war in Ukraine. VOA examined several approaches floated by think tanks recently aimed at achieving a lasting peace to the war. Maximum pressure strategy A plan by the Center for European Policy Analysis, or CEPA, titled 'How to Win: A Seven-Point Plan for Sustainable Peace in Ukraine,' calls for 'a maximum pressure strategy to bring Russia to the negotiating table in good faith.' It proposes that the U.S. and its allies: 'Should provide immediate materiel support to Ukraine without caveats, aiming to wear down Russia’s military and thereby improve Ukraine’s negotiating position.' 'Should increase sanctions on Russian financial institutions and energy sector entities, release frozen Russian assets to support Ukrainian defense and reconstruction and enact secondary sanctions to intensify economic pressure not only on Russia but also on the authoritarian regimes of China, Iran, and North Korea.' CEPA says that 'Ukraine and Europe' must be included in any peace talks with Russia, that the U.S. should support 'a European-led coalition of the willing' to enforce any 'ceasefire line with an international force,' and that 'European allies must make consistent and as rapid as possible progress toward Ukraine’s accession to the European Union.' One of the report’s authors, Catherine Sendak, CEPA’s director for transatlantic defense and security, told VOA’s Ukrainian service that the United States should enter talks with Russia only having 'equipped Ukraine with the strongest possible means' and using its toughest 'diplomatic tools.' She added that the issue of Ukraine’s possible membership in NATO should not be included in talks with Russia. 'To discuss that with a non-NATO member … I don’t believe it is advantageous to any negotiation,' Sendak said, noting that it would give Russia 'veto power, if you will, over … choosing members to join the alliance or not.' Negotiating tactics Josh Rudolph, a German Marshall Fund senior fellow and head of its Transatlantic Democracy Working Group, worked on Russian and Ukrainian policy at the National Security Council during the first Trump administration. Last month, he offered policy recommendations to the current Trump administration on ending the Ukraine conflict. Among them: 'Approach [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from a position of strength. Whereas Putin looked tough and capable at the outset of Trump’s first term, his blunder in Ukraine has left him diminished. … As the dominant partner in this relationship, Trump, not Putin, can set negotiating terms.' 'Know when to walk away. A critical moment in the negotiations will come when Putin refuses to make major concessions. Trump must be prepared to walk away.' 'Combine sanctions with lower oil and gas prices. The best way to make Putin to see that pressing on in Ukraine would spell disaster for his rule is to pressure Russia financially. … Harnessing his warmer relationship with Saudi Arabia than [former President Joe] Biden enjoyed, Trump should flood the fossil fuel market, which would make the sanctions sustainable, starve Russia’s war machine, and generate political stability risks in Moscow.' Rudolph also recommended arming Ukraine 'to the hilt'; giving it 'all $300 billion of Russia’s frozen assets'; making Europe 'pay more for weapons' and provide 100,000 troops as 'peacekeepers'; enabling 'American companies to rebuild Ukraine'; and inviting Ukraine to join NATO should Putin refuse to accept 'reasonable' peace deal terms. Rudolph told VOA that Trump could convince those in the U.S. now skeptical of continuing to arm Ukraine that doing so as part of a peace deal would benefit American workers. '[H]e tells them, OK, now we’ve got a good deal, it’s secured by rare earth [minerals], it has ended the war, and in order to hold it together, we’re going to need to provide a continued stream of good old American-made weapons, which by the way, create all of these American jobs and facilities and factories across red states.' Touting economic benefits In a report titled 'Dollars and Sense: America’s Interest in a Ukrainian Victory,' Elaine McCusker, Frederick W. Kagan and Richard Sims of the American Enterprise Institute looked at the cost of ending support for Ukraine, concluding that this would lead to Ukraine’s defeat and Russia’s advance farther into Europe, forcing the U.S. to surge its presence in Europe. Among the report’s conclusions: 'Supporting Ukraine to victory against Russia is in the best interest of the United States.' 'A world in which Russia prevails would be more dangerous and more expensive for America — requiring an estimated increase of $808 billion in defense spending over five years.' 'Alternatively, an increased and accelerated multinational commitment to Ukraine and the conclusion of the war in the near term would result in a vibrant and free Ukraine with a newly modernized and battle-tested military and a thriving industrial base, which would help stabilize Europe.' In an interview with VOA, Frederick Kagan said a Russian victory in Ukraine would be a victory for Iran, China and North Korea, encouraging adventurism in their respective regions, and allow Russia to rebuild its army by obtaining additional human and material resources within Ukraine. A Russian takeover of Ukraine would send a wave of refugees into Europe, further destabilizing the continent, Kagan said. 'They’ve committed atrocities on the Ukrainian population in the areas they occupy. I would expect that would get worse the further west the Russians move and the more they move into the hardest traditional anti-Russian, pro-Western areas of western Ukraine. The horrors will be unspeakable,' he predicted. He said surged assistance to Ukraine would turn it into a bulwark for European peace and security — a country with a battle-tested army and rapidly developing military industry — thereby allowing the U.S. to focus on other regions. Middle road approach The Heritage Foundation’s 'Project 2025 Presidential Transition Project' includes policy recommendations concerning the Russia-Ukraine war. It noted that the American conservative movement is split over Ukraine — one side supports Kyiv, the other favors walking away — and offered a middle road. Among Project 2025’s recommendations: 'With respect to Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military aid (while European allies address Ukraine’s economic needs); and have a clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.' 'Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland. The conflict has severely weakened Putin’s military strength and provided a boost to NATO unity and its importance to European nations.' 'The next conservative president has a generational opportunity to bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions within the movement and chart a new path forward that recognizes Communist China as the defining threat to U.S. interests in the 21st century.' James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation who is responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, told VOA that it is in the U.S. interest to have a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself. 'For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself, and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine’s occupied by Russia. Now, having said that, are we … way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is ‘absolutely.’' In July, VOA published an interview with retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, serving as Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, that focused on his vision of ending the war in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-scenarios-for-securing-peace-in-ukraine/7983483.html	2025-02-21T09:51:15-08:00	
Motivations, ambitions of Congo’s M23 rebels unclear, analysts say	NAIROBI — A Rwandan government minister and the spokesperson of the M23 rebel group were sanctioned Thursday by the United States for alleged involvement in the recent conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. This comes after M23 fighters on Feb. 16 marched unopposed through Bukavu, three weeks after taking over Goma — eastern Congo’s biggest city. The recent advances made by the group were not surprising, as the DRC, the United Nations and many foreign governments say the fighters are heavily armed and supported by Rwanda, a country with a strong military force, analysts told VOA. Sasha Lezhnev, senior policy adviser at The Sentry, a Washington NGO, who specializes in U.S.-Africa policy on human rights and conflict, cited numerous United Nations investigative reports over the last three years showing that Rwanda is arming and supporting the M23. 'The latest report in December stated that Rwanda had three to four thousand of its own troops in the DRC,' Lezhnev said. While Rwanda denies the allegations, Lezhnev said this crisis would have been preventable if the outside world had not recently taken its eyes off the situation. 'They [Rwanda] started rearming and reorganizing the M23 about four years ago and, back in 2023, the United States brokered an intelligence-sharing agreement and even sanctioned some Rwandan generals for supporting the M23,' Lezhnev said. 'Then Rwanda basically responded, promoting the generals and continuing to escalate the situation, as well as the DRC reneging on its promise to stop arming and supporting the FDLR.' Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame accuses the DRC of backing FDLR — the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a Congo-based, mainly Hutu rebel group that includes some fighters who were involved in Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. The Tutsi-led M23, short for the March 23 Movement, first seized control of Goma in 2012. The group was pushed back the next year by the Congolese army, some of its regional allies, and special operations forces of the U.N. Stabilization Mission in the DRC. The group has been among more than 130 armed groups operating in the eastern DRC, mainly in the North and South Kivu provinces, vying for control of valuable and abundant mineral wealth including gold, diamonds, uranium and copper, as well as coltan and cobalt, major components in batteries used in electric cars, cellphones and other electronics. Claude Gatebuke, a Rwandan genocide survivor and coauthor of the book Survivors Uncensored, said Rwanda is not the only backer of the M23. 'It’s Rwanda and Uganda under the leadership of Paul Kagame and Yoweri Museveni who are invading Congo to provide access to Congo resources to ... mostly Western multinationals. This is all well documented,' Gatebuke said. Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, based in Washington, called the situation confusing. 'Uganda has troops in DRC that are fighting conjointly with the Congolese, against the ADF, the Allied Democratic Forces, an Islamist Ugandan group based in that part of the country,' Dizolele said. 'It’s confusing in the sense that on one level, Ugandans are collaborating with the government of DRC ... and on other hand, they’ve been reported to be engaged in this instabilization [instability], as well.' Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni recently said he is ready to assist with peace initiatives in the DRC. M23 leaders have said they plan to go all the way to Kinshasa. 'We ... do not know fully what they want, so it’s gone anywhere from, ‘Are they only trying to hold part of the Kivus and surrounding areas and set some kind of domination there?’ Or are they willing to go to Kinshasa?' Dizolele said. Gatebuke added: 'For sure they are trying to carve off the Kivus. The problem that they have, they would’ve been able to do this a long time ago had it not been for the Congolese not wanting to be in separate countries. … So, they are going to try to keep that area by force for as long as they can ... set up their own government and pretty much try to run a parallel country inside of the [DR] Congo.' A statement posted Feb. 17 on X by the M23 reiterated the group’s call for a direct and sincere dialogue with the DRC government. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference last week, DRC President Felix Tshisekedi criticized the outside world for not taking action against Rwanda in light of the escalating violence in his country. On Thursday, a Rwandan government minister and the spokesperson of the M23 rebel group were sanctioned by the United States for their alleged involvement in the recent escalation. In response, Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told VOA the recent sanctions are unjustified. 'This kind of punitive measures cannot contribute toward peace and stability in our region,' Nduhungirehe said. The government also says the country’s only aim is a secure border and that for the last three years, the conflict has involved hostile forces — including Congolese armed forces and FDLR — that have not been sanctioned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/motivations-ambitions-of-congo-s-m23-rebels-unclear-analysts-say/7983473.html	2025-02-21T09:25:59-08:00	
Rubio highlights emerging terror threat in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late Thursday there are ungoverned regions in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan that provide opportunities for extremist groups to operate. The comments came in an interview with former CBS correspondent Catherine Herridge on X, where Rubio was asked if intelligence indicates that al-Qaida and Islamic State had set up safe havens in Afghanistan, posing a threat comparable to the one preceding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 'I wouldn’t say it’s the pre-9/11 landscape, but I think anytime you have governing spaces that are contested that you don’t have a government that has full control of every part of their territory, it creates the opportunity for these groups,' Rubio said. 'The difference between today and 10 years ago is that we don’t have American elements on the ground to target and go after them,' the top U.S. diplomat noted. Rubio added that in some cases, the Taliban has been cooperative when 'told that ISIS or al-Qaida is operating in this part of your country' and to go after them. Not so much in other cases, he said. 'So, I would say that I wouldn’t compare it to pre-9/11, but it’s certainly far more uncertain — and it’s not just limited to Afghanistan,' Rubio said. The Taliban did not immediately respond to Rubio’s remarks, but they have persistently claimed to be in control of the entire country and rejected that any foreign terrorist organizations are on Afghan soil. Rubio’s comments came just days after the United Nations reported that al-Qaida operatives continued to find shelter across Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban's intelligence agency. 'The Taliban maintained a permissive environment allowing al-Qaida to consolidate, with the presence of safe houses and training camps scattered across Afghanistan,' read the report. It also described an Afghan-based Islamic State affiliate, the Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K, as 'the greatest extra-regional terrorist threat.' The U.N. assessment highlighted that in addition to attacks on Taliban authorities and Afghan religious minorities, IS-K supporters conducted strikes as far away as Europe, and that the group 'was actively seeking to recruit from among Central Asian states' bordering Afghanistan. The Taliban militarily swept back to power in August 2021 when the then-Afghan government collapsed as all U.S.-led NATO allied troops withdrew from the country after a nearly two-decade-long presence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-highlights-emerging-terror-threat-in-afghanistan/7983365.html	2025-02-21T08:03:28-08:00	
Half-billion people attend Hindu festival in India	MUMBAI, INDIA — Even for the world’s most-populous nation, the scale of a Hindu religious festival being held in India’s northern city of Prayagraj since mid-January is staggering. Surpassing previous numbers, the Maha Kumbh Mela that wraps up Wednesday has drawn more than half a billion devotees in the last six weeks, according to officials. The government of Uttar Pradesh, where the festival is being held, claims that this year's event is the largest congregation in human history for a religious, cultural and social event. Those who have taken a holy dip in waters that Hindus believe cleanses them of their sins and helps attain salvation include ordinary devotees from all walks of life, billionaires, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, politicians and Bollywood stars. Others went to simply witness the mesmerizing panorama of the religious spectacle that unfolds along the confluence of two rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna, where Hindus believe a third, mythical river also exists. Among the first rush of pilgrims to attend the Kumbh Mela when it began last month was Deepinderr Singh Bindra, a resident of Gurugram in North India. 'It was the accumulation of my spiritual journey following my visit to several Hindu pilgrim sites in the last few years,' he said. He took an early morning dip on three consecutive days and 'found it a surreal, deeply satisfying experience.' The pull of the Maha or great Kumbh Mela, which is held every 12 years, became even greater for many devotees because this year’s event was considered special — it coincided with an alignment of the planets and stars that occurs once in 144 years. The festival was marred by a stampede on Jan. 29 that killed 30 pilgrims who were trampled amid the rush to take part in the bathing on a day considered particularly auspicious. That tragedy, however, failed to dampen the fervor as millions continued to pour into the vast temporary tented township that covers a stretch of 4,000 hectares, or 40 square kilometers, along the banks of the river. The tented township includes roads, hospitals, toilets and free community kitchens run by volunteers. A platform made of sandbags stretches along the Ganges riverbank for devotees to take part in the ritual immersion. But for many like Mumbai resident Nikhil Shirodkar, joining the festival was not just about the dip in the river but a once-in-a-lifetime experience that offered a chance for a connection with age-old Hindu traditions. 'I went more as a spiritual seeker and not with the belief that the dip cleanses one’s sins,' he said. He spent three days sleeping on the floor like an ascetic and helping serve meals to people. 'It was an eye opener. Everybody was reaching out to each other. On the roadside some would be serving tea, others biscuits, to the pilgrims who kept pouring in. It had an impact on my outlook,' Shirodkar said. Others, especially overseas visitors, were drawn to it by a sense of curiosity. Twenty-one-year-old Lucinda Pernell, who had come from Australia to India to attend a yoga camp, decided to attend after learning from her photographer friend about the festival’s immense scale. 'It was overwhelming because there were just so many people, which a Westerner like me has never seen. But I found it amazing. It was a kind of organized chaos, but what I will take back with me is that people respected each other. There was a sense of belief,' she said, recalling the experience. On one of the days that she was there, considered an especially auspicious day, an estimated 35 million took a dip in the waters in Prayagraj — that’s more people than the population of Australia. She visited the camp for Naga sadhus, the ash-smeared, often naked Hindu ascetics, who armed with tridents lead the religious spectacle. It’s one of the most dramatic sights of the festival. At this year’s festival, the sacred coexisted with high technology, as underwater drones and artificial intelligence systems were used to monitor the crowds and improve safety. The Kumbh Mela also reflected the growing synergy between religion and politics since Prime Minister Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata party came to power 10 years ago, according to political analyst Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay. Giant billboards of Modi stood high at the festival site. 'The open, publicized participation of top political leaders at a religious festival is not something you witnessed in the past,' he said, pointing out that lines between religion and the state have been increasingly blurred. Besides Modi, who took a dip in the river, the Uttar Pradesh state government, led by a Hindu monk, held a Cabinet meeting at the site of the festival. Reasserting a Hindu cultural identity has been part of the BJP’s agenda. Under the rule of the country’s erstwhile Mughal rulers, the city where it took place was earlier known as Allahabad. It was renamed Prayagraj in 2018 by the BJP state government in a bid to restore its identity as a Hindu pilgrimage center. Mukhopadhyay also pointed out that the elaborate facilities built for the festival at a cost of over $8 billion, included upscale accommodations, airport and railway expansions and new roads. 'With facilities like air-conditioned tents and roads, the rich and upper middle classes no longer had to trek for miles as devotees did in earlier days. So for many of them, attending the Kumbh transitioned from a purely religious pilgrimage into a social talking point,' he said. Questions have been raised about the water in which the devotees immerse themselves. A report by the federal government’s Central Pollution Control Board earlier this month said that there were high levels of contamination in a key bathing place. But the Uttar Pradesh state government rejected the report, saying authorities were continuously monitoring water in the rivers to maintain its quality. At last count provided by the state government, 550 million had attended the festival. With five more days to go until it culminates on Wednesday, which is considered another auspicious day, those numbers will rise. Among those who plan to travel to Prayagraj on that day is Bindra, the resident of Gurugram. 'I will be going again to take another dip,' he said. 'It is a calling for me.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/half-billion-people-attend-hindu-festival-in-india/7983298.html	2025-02-21T07:39:41-08:00	
Russian region holding Ukrainian Prisoners of War as ‘bargaining chip’	RFE/RL — Iya Rashevskaya was told her husband — a member of the country’s armed forces – had gone missing in the frontline in the eastern Donetsk region, in April 2023. The news of Serhiy Skotarenko’s disappearance came just a month after he had joined the military, having given up his job abroad. Rashevskaya soon found out that her husband, a native of Ukraine’s southeastern Zaporizhzhya region, was alive and being held captive in Chechnya along with several other Ukrainian prisoners of war. A Ukrainian soldier who was released in a prisoner swap in June 2023 told Rashevskaya that he and Skotarenko had been held in the same jail in Chechnya. Rashevskaya recalls getting an unexpected, brief video call from her husband in August 2023. 'My husband asked about me and our children. He also asked me to help him to return home, saying we were his only hope,' Rashevskaya said. 'He looked awful, he has lost a lot of weight.' Ukrainian captives in Chechnya 'were being held in a basement and survived on instant noodles, bread, and water,' according to Rashevskaya. Ukrainian authorities estimate that more than 150 Ukrainian POWs are currently being held in Chechnya, a Russian region ruled by authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov says the soldiers were captured by Chechen military units fighting alongside other Russian forces in Ukraine. But Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs has claimed that Chechnya also often 'buys' Ukrainian captives from various Russian military units to use them as a bargaining chip in negotiations. RFE/RL cannot independently verify the claim. Some of the Ukrainian captives were exchanged with Chechen fighters seized by Ukrainian forces. Kadyrov, a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has sent thousands of Chechen fighters to Ukraine since the invasion began three years ago. In December 2024, Kadyrov threatened to use Ukrainian captives as human shields to protect strategically important buildings in Grozny from Ukrainian drone attacks. He said he would place them on the rooftops of buildings. He made the statement after Ukrainian drones reportedly hit a police campus in the Chechen capital. In January 2024, Kadyrov offered to release 20 Ukrainian captives in exchange for the removal of U.S. sanctions against his relatives and horses. Kadyrov, 48, and several of his family members, including his mother, Aymani Kadyrova, have been sanctioned by the United States and the European Union in recent years. Kadyrova, 71, is the head of the Kadyrov Foundation, which runs reeducation programs for Ukrainian children abducted by Russian forces from occupied territories. Washington imposed sanctions on Kadyrova and the Foundation in August 2023. Kadyrov was sanctioned by Washington in 2017 and 2020 over accusations of human rights abuses. PR campaign for Kadyrov Chechen human rights lawyer Abubakar Yangulbaev says Kadyrov directly controls any prisoner swaps involving the Ukrainians captives in Chechnya. 'While the Chechens fighting in Ukraine are part of Russian troops, Chechnya also has its own interests. It’s important for Kadyrov to secure the release of the Chechens captured in Ukraine to protect his own reputation before his people, whom he constantly calls to go to fight in Ukraine,' Yangulbaev told RFE/RL. 'It is a PR campaign for Kadyrov,' he added. Chechnya has never released the exact number or Ukrainian POWs it holds. According to Maria Klimik, a reporter for the Ukraine-based monitor, Media Initiative for Human Rights, in some cases the Ukrainian and Chechen sides have swapped captured soldiers 'informally' in the battlefields in Ukraine without involving a third party. Klimik told RFE/RL that Ukrainian POWs in Chechnya are usually held in dark, windowless basements of buildings – presumably police stations. Prisoners sleep on utility shelves as there are no beds in the basements, Klimik said citing accounts of former POWs. RFE/RL cannot independently verify the claims. In his New Year address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that 3,956 Ukrainian soldiers had been freed in prisoners’ exchanges between Kyiv and Moscow since the beginning of the invasion. There has been no public mention of any direct prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Chechnya, as the families of the captives in Grozny call for their release.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-region-holding-ukrainian-prisoners-of-war-as-bargaining-chip-/7983230.html	2025-02-21T06:11:06-08:00	
Netanyahu: Hamas will 'pay the price' for not returning body of Israeli hostage	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday Hamas will 'pay the price' for failing to release the body of hostage Shiri Babas, according to the peace agreement with Israel. 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages -- both living and dead -- and ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement,' Netanyahu said in a video statement. 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two small infants in an unimaginably cynical manner, but they also failed to return Shiri to her small children, the little angels, and instead placed the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin,' he said. Hamas said Friday Shiri Babas’ remains appeared to have been mixed with other human remains from rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit the place she was held, the Reuter News Agency reported. The bodies of three Israeli hostages and the body of a fourth, unidentified woman, were returned to Israel on Thursday in the latest release under a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group Hamas. Hundreds of people gathered in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where Hamas handed over four black coffins to the Red Cross, which took them away in a convoy and delivered them to the Israeli military. An Israeli procession passed through areas where people gathered on the side of the road holding Israeli flags. The bodies arrived several hours later at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to confirm their identities. Those released Thursday included the youngest captives – infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas. The body of their mother, Shiri Bibas, was also supposed to be released. But on Friday, local time, the Israeli military said the female body was not Shiri Bibas. The body does not belong to any other hostage and remains unidentified, the military said. The Israeli military accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement. 'This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is obliged under the agreement to return four deceased hostages,' the military said in a statement. Israel’s United Nations representative Danny Danon also condemned Hamas for returning an unidentified body. 'Hamas returned an unidentified body, as if it were a worthless shipment. This is a new low, an evil and cruelty with no parallel,' Danon said in a statement. The Bibas family was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video of the abduction showed Shiri Bibas swaddling the boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. Hamas has said the boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, was also released on Thursdsay. 'We received with deep sorrow the official and bitter news confirming the identification of our beloved Oded's body,' the Lifshitz family said in a statement released by a group representing family members of those taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on X that the hearts of the entire nation 'lie in tatters.' 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness,' Herzog said. 'Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday would be 'a day of grief' for his nation. Hundreds of people gathered in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where Hamas handed over four black coffins to the Red Cross, which took them away in a convoy and delivered them to the Israeli military. An Israeli procession passed through areas where people gathered on the side of the road holding Israeli flags. The bodies arrived several hours later at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to confirm their identities. Before transferring the four coffins to the Red Cross, Hamas had them displayed on a stage at the handover site along with flags and banners. One of the banners accused Netanyahu of being a war criminal and said Israeli airstrikes killed the hostages. The United Nations criticized what it called the 'abhorrent and cruel' staging of the event, with U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk saying Thursday the remains need to be respected. 'Under international law, any handover of the remains of deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' Türk said in a statement. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has facilitated the hostage and prisoner releases so far, also had called for handovers of bodies 'to be done privately out of utmost respect for the deceased and those left grieving.' On Saturday, six living hostages are set to be released in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians detained by Israeli forces in Gaza during the war. Israel and Hamas are in the process of implementing the first phase of a ceasefire that began on Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. A Hamas spokesperson on Thursday accused Netanyahu of 'procrastinating regarding the second phrase,' saying the group was 'ready to engage.' A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the remaining hostages may be released together during the next phase of the truce. 'We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,' senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told the news agency. Hamas is believed to be holding 66 more captives, about half of them living. The group has said it will release the remaining hostages only in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-hamas-will-pay-the-price-for-not-returning-body-of-israeli-hostage-/7983003.html	2025-02-21T01:42:42-08:00	
Commercial airlines warned as Chinese navy holds live-fire exercises off Australia	SYDNEY — Airlines modified flight paths between Australia and New Zealand on Friday after China notified Australia that the People's Liberation Army Navy would hold live-fire exercises off the New South Wales coast in international waters, a rare event. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters on Friday afternoon that the time period for the Chinese navy exercises had expired, and it was unclear if live fire had been used by the Chinese navy. 'China issued, in accordance with practice, an alert that it would be conducting these activities, including the potential use of live fire. It's outside of Australia's exclusive economic zone,' he said, indicating it was at least 370 kilometers offshore. 'According to defense, there has been no imminent risk of danger to any Australian assets or New Zealand assets, and that's why this notification occurs,' he added. A People's Liberation Army Navy frigate, cruiser and replenishment vessel last week entered Australia's maritime approaches, and traveled down Australia's east coast this week, monitored by the navies and air forces of Australia and New Zealand. Airlines were contacted by Australia's air traffic control agency on Friday warning them of reports of live fire where the Chinese navy task group was operating, the agency and Australian officials said. 'The Civil Aviation Authority and Airservices Australia are aware of reports of live firing in international waters,' air traffic control agency Airservices Australia said in a statement. 'As a precaution, we have advised airlines with flights planned in the area,' it added. Qantas and its low-cost arm Jetstar were monitoring the airspace and temporarily adjusted some flights across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Air New Zealand said it had modified flight paths as needed to avoid the area, with no impact to its operations, while Virgin Australia was following instructions from Airservices Australia. Albanese said he had contacted New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon about the matter. 'The chief of the defense force has advised that it's not clear whether there was any actual live fire used in this area, but it is consistent with international law,' Albanese said. Foreign Minister Penny Wong would raise the matter with her Chinese counterpart in South Africa, where they are attending the G20 foreign ministers meeting, he added. Wong said the live fire was 'an evolving situation.' 'We do have concerns about the transparency associated with this and the notice, and I certainly will be having a discussion with (China's) Foreign Minister Wang about that,' she said in an ABC television interview Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/commercial-airlines-warned-as-chinese-navy-holds-live-fire-exercises-off-australia/7982998.html	2025-02-21T01:15:09-08:00	
US tax agency fires 6,000 amid federal government downsizing	A tearful executive at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service told staffers on Thursday that about 6,000 employees would be fired, a person familiar with the matter said, in a move that would eliminate roughly 6% of the agency's workforce in the midst of the busy tax-filing season. The cuts are part of President Donald Trump's sweeping downsizing effort that has targeted bank regulators, forest workers, rocket scientists and tens of thousands of other government employees. The effort is being led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, Trump's biggest campaign donor. Musk was on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, when Argentine President Javier Milei, known for wielding a chain saw to illustrate his drastic policies slashing government spending, handed him one. 'This is the chain saw for bureaucracy,' said Musk, holding the power tool aloft as a stage prop to symbolize the drastic slashing of government jobs. Labor unions have sued to try to stop the mass firings, under which tens of thousands of federal workers have been told they no longer have a job, but a federal judge in Washington on Thursday ruled that they can continue for now. Christy Armstrong, IRS director of talent acquisition, teared up as she told employees on a phone call that about 6,000 of their colleagues would be laid off and encouraged them to support each other, a worker who was on the call said. 'She was pretty emotional,' the worker said. The layoffs are expected to total 6,700, according to a person familiar with the matter, and largely target workers at the agency hired as part of an expansion under Democratic President Joe Biden, who had sought to expand enforcement efforts on wealthy taxpayers. Republicans have opposed the expansion, arguing that it would lead to harassment of ordinary Americans. The tax agency now employs roughly 100,000 people, compared with 80,000 before Biden took office in 2021. Independent budget analysts had estimated that the staff expansion under Biden would work to boost government revenue and help narrow trillion-dollar budget deficits. 'This will ensure that the IRS is not going after the wealthy and is only an agency that's really focused on the low income,' said University of Pittsburgh tax law professor, Philip Hackney, a former IRS lawyer. 'It's a travesty.' Those fired include revenue agents, customer-service workers, specialists who hear appeals of tax disputes, and IT workers, and impact employees across all 50 states, sources said. The IRS did not respond to a request for comment. The IRS has taken a more careful approach to downsizing than other agencies, given that it is in the middle of the tax-filing season. The agency expects to process more than 140 million individual returns by the April 15 filing deadline and will retain several thousand workers deemed critical for that task, one source said. The Trump administration's federal layoffs have focused on workers across the government who are new to their positions and have fewer protections than longer-tenured employees. Meanwhile, the Trump White House is also preparing to dissolve the leadership of the U.S. Postal Service and absorb the independent agency into the Commerce Department, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Waiting for dismissal email At the IRS's Kansas City office, probationary workers found all functions had been disabled on their computers except email, which would deliver their dismissal notices, said Shannon Ellis, a local union leader. 'What the American people really need to understand is that the funds that are collected through the Internal Revenue Service, they fund so many programs that we use every day in our society,' Ellis told Reuters. The White House has not said how many of the nation's 2.3 million civil-service workers it wants to fire and has given no numbers on the mass layoffs. Roughly 75,000 took a buyout offer last week. The campaign has delighted Republicans for culling a federal workforce they view as bloated, corrupt and insufficiently loyal to Trump, while also taking aim at government agencies that regulate big business -- including those that oversee Musk's companies SpaceX, Tesla and Neuralink. The small unit within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that regulates the kind of autonomous cars that Musk says are the future of Tesla is losing nearly half of its staff, the Post reported on Thursday. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team has also canceled contracts worth about $8.5 billion involving foreign aid, diversity training and other initiatives opposed by Trump. Both men have set a goal of cutting at least $1 trillion from the $6.7 trillion federal budget, though Trump has said he will not touch popular benefits programs that make up roughly one-third of that total. Democratic critics have said Trump is exceeding his constitutional authority and hacking away at popular and critical government programs at the expense of legions of middle-class families. Most Americans worry the cost-cutting could hurt government services, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday. Some agencies have struggled to comply with the rapid-fire directives Trump has issued since taking office a month ago. Workers who oversee U.S. nuclear weapons were fired and then recalled, while medicines and food exports have been stranded in warehouses by Trump's freeze on foreign aid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-tax-agency-fires-6-000-amid-federal-government-downsizing/7982991.html	2025-02-21T00:57:35-08:00	
Costa Rica and Honduras join Panama as stopovers for foreign deportees	SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA — A group of families and children hailing from Uzbekistan, China, Afghanistan, Russia and more countries climbed down the stairs of an airplane in Costa Rica's capital Thursday, the first flight of deportees from other nations Costa Rica agreed to hold in detention facilities for the Trump administration while it organized the return back to their countries. The flight of 135 deportees, half of them minors, added Costa Rica to a growing list of Latin American nations to serve as a stopover for migrants as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to step up deportations. While Costa Rica joins Panama in holding deportees from mostly Asian origin until their repatriation can be arranged or they can seek protection somewhere, Honduras on Thursday also facilitated a handoff of deportees between the U.S. and Venezuela from a flight coming from Guantanamo Bay. The migrants arriving in Costa Rica will be bused to a rural holding facility near the Panama border, where they will be detained up to six weeks and be flown back to their countries of origin, said Omer Badilla, Costa Rica’s deputy minister of the interior and police. The U.S. government will cover the costs. The arrangement is part of a deal the Trump administration struck with Costa Rica during U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit earlier this month. It comes as Trump has pressured countries across the region to help facilitate deportations at times under the threat of steep tariffs or sanctions. Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves told reporters Wednesday that his country is helping its 'economically powerful brother from the north.' Similar agreements have been reached with other Latin American nations, but the concept of using third countries as deportation layovers has drawn strong criticism from human rights advocates. Beyond the conditions of their detention in Costa Rica, concerns revolve around international protections for asylum seekers and whether these deportees will be appropriately screened before being returned to their countries or sent to yet another country. Panama this week became the first such country to accept 299 deportees from other nations, with the government holding them in hotel rooms guarded by police. About one-third of those who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were sent to a remote camp in Darien province bordering Colombia on Wednesday. The rest were awaiting commercial flights back home. 'We’ve thrown out the possibility of a hotel, precisely to avoid a situation similar to that in Panama,' Badilla, the Costa Rican official, told The Associated Press. Honduras said Thursday it also acted as a brief stopover for a deportation flight of Venezuelans coming from Guantanamo Bay in what it described as a 'humanitarian bridge' since there are no direct flights between the United States and Venezuela. A U.S. flight carrying 170 Venezuelans landed Thursday in a joint U.S.-Honduran military base in central Honduras, and within hours were transferred to a Venezuelan aircraft. An official with Honduras’ foreign ministry said this was not a routine arrangement, but that the Central American nation remains open to facilitating more transfers between the two adversaries. Badilla said that Thursday's deportation flight from San Diego is largely made up of families, including 65 children, two pregnant women and an elderly woman. He said Costa Rica was told by the Trump administration that most of the deportees have agreed to voluntarily return to their countries. If they refuse, Costa Rica is open to offering deportees refuge or will work with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, IOM, to facilitate travel to another third country. 'Costa Rica is a country that guarantees human rights,' he said. 'We are going to guarantee that they are returned to safe countries. We cannot leave that to chance because of an ethical and moral commitment of our country.' In the meantime, migrants will be detained in the border facility, where they will be accompanied by U.N. officials, the Red Cross and other aid-focused government entities to 'guarantee their rights,' Badilla said. The facility being used to hold migrants, a former factory, has faced criticisms for its conditions in the past. During a visit by the AP in October 2023, migrants were fenced off in cramped facilities and said they felt like 'prisoners.' Many slept in tents on the ground, where some said liquid from portable toilets leaked. Badilla said that facilities have since been improved, but the government has denied journalists access to the building. The facility will also be processing a 'reverse flow' of migrants from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador that previously sought asylum in the U.S. and now want to return home. Badilla said Costa Rica has seen between 50 and 75 migrants headed south entering the country a day. IOM said in a statement to the AP that 'we do not have direct involvement in the detention or restriction of movement of individuals' and that it was providing humanitarian support and supporting voluntary returns to their countries and 'identifying safe alternatives for others.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/costa-rica-and-honduras-join-panama-as-stopovers-for-foreign-deportees-/7982987.html	2025-02-21T00:43:08-08:00	
China's military says it drove away Philippine aircraft near Spratly Islands	BEIJING — China's military said it warned and drove away three Philippine aircraft that 'illegally intruded' into the airspace near the Spratly Islands on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Philippine Embassy in Beijing on the Chinese military's statement issued on Friday. China's Southern Theatre Command accused the Philippine side of attempting to 'peddle its illegal claims' through provocation and warned that the 'clumsy maneuver is doomed to failure.' China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, putting it at odds with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. A 2016 arbitration ruling invalidated China's expansive claim, but Beijing does not recognize the decision. On Thursday, the Philippines said its coast guard and fisheries bureau had jointly carried out a maritime domain awareness flight over the Kalayaan Islands, the Philippine name for Spratly Islands. The mission was to assert the Philippines' sovereignty, sovereign rights, and maritime jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea, it said. More than 50 Chinese maritime militia vessels and a Chinese coast guard ship were spotted during the exercise. It was not immediately clear if that mission, which deployed two aircraft, was the one Chinese military said it responded to. The latest confrontation comes after Philippine coast guard accused the Chinese navy of performing dangerous flight maneuvers earlier this week when it flew close to a government aircraft patrolling the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Beijing disputed that account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-military-says-it-drove-away-philippine-aircraft-near-spratly-islands/7982985.html	2025-02-21T00:30:33-08:00	
South Korea's ousted PM says he tried to stop martial law decree	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's ousted premier said on Thursday that he had opposed suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law, testifying for the first time at his former boss's impeachment trial about the events of a night that threw the country into turmoil. Han Duck-soo was impeached by parliament as acting president and prime minister in December over alleged obstruction of the trial that could formally remove Yoon from office for his martial law decree. He appeared before that trial for the first time on Thursday, telling Seoul's Constitutional Court he had 'expressed my opposition' to Yoon's decision to suspend civilian rule on the night of Dec. 3. Han said he and most of his fellow cabinet members 'believed such a declaration would put South Korea in serious difficulty' and that he recalled them 'being concerned and trying to dissuade it.' The court said later on Thursday the final hearing will be held on the 25th. The judges will then deliberate behind closed doors, with elections required within 60 days if Yoon is removed. Yoon walked out of the court just five minutes after proceedings began on Thursday, according to a pool report. His lawyer Yoon Kap-keun told reporters the ousted president felt it was 'inappropriate' for him to sit in the same court room with Han 'or for the president to watch the prime minister testify.' 'It is not good for the nation's prestige,' his lawyer quoted Yoon as saying. Yoon returned later to hear the testimony of former senior intelligence official Hong Jang-won, seen as a key figure in the decision to declare martial law. Hong has claimed to be in possession of a memo containing a list of names of individuals Yoon ordered arrested during the night of the martial law declaration, including the leaders of the opposition and Yoon's own ruling party. 'I will do my best to recount everything as I remember it,' Hong told reporters before the hearing. Court footage showed Yoon shouting at Hong, accusing him of plotting his impeachment. Given the opportunity to speak by one of the court's eight judges, Yoon acknowledged that it was 'unnecessary and wrong' to try to track the locations of politicians on the night of the decree but also said he was doing it simply to 'monitor movements' and not to 'arrest' them. The head of South Korea's National Police Agency, who is also on trial on insurrection charges related to the martial law decree, is another witness. Courting controversy The impeachment hearing was Yoon's second of the day. He also appeared in court in the morning to answer charges of insurrection, becoming South Korea's first sitting president to stand trial in a criminal case. The 64-year-old former prosecutor has been behind bars since he was arrested last month on those charges, for which he could be sentenced to life in prison -- or face the death penalty -- if convicted. Yoon attended that hearing but did not speak, an AFP journalist in the packed courtroom said. Prosecutors have accused the suspended president of being the 'ringleader of an insurrection.' They argued on Thursday against releasing him, saying he could try to 'influence or persuade those involved in the case.' Yoon's lawyer Kim Hong-il condemned the 'illegal probe,' telling the court the 'investigating body has no jurisdiction.' 'The declaration of martial law was not intended to paralyze the state,' Kim said. Instead, he said, it was meant to 'alert the public to the national crisis caused by the legislative dictatorship of the dominant opposition party, which had crippled the administration.' Much of Yoon's impeachment trial has centered on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war. The crisis has plunged South Korea into months of political turmoil with protests, two impeachments and a surge of online disinformation. Yoon also sent a message rallying his supporters on Thursday, urging 'the older and established generations to work together with the younger generation.' 'If that happens, I will be able to swiftly return to my duties and lead South Korea with the power of generational integration,' Yoon said, according to his lawyers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-ousted-pm-says-he-tried-to-stop-martial-law-decree/7982981.html	2025-02-21T00:18:34-08:00	
South Korea requests exclusion from US plan to increase tariffs	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean officials have asked the Trump administration to exclude their country from U.S. plans to impose aggressive tariffs on trade partners, emphasizing that Seoul is already applying low duties on American products under the free trade agreement between the two nations. South Korea’s government on Friday said Deputy Trade Minister Park Jong-won made the request while traveling to Washington this week for meetings with unspecified officials from the White House, the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The South Korean Trade Ministry didn’t say what Park heard from the Americans. Park cited how South Korean companies were contributing to the U.S. economy through large-scale business investments and noted that the country was already imposing low duties on free trade partners such as the United States. He called for South Korea to be excluded from U.S. plans to establish reciprocal tariffs with trade partners and raise duties for imported steel and aluminum, the ministry said. South Korea’s top economic think tank this month slashed its growth forecast for the country’s economy for the second time since November, expressing concern about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s expanding tariffs and other measures aimed at resetting global trade. The state-run Korea Development Institute projected the national economy to grow by 1.6% in 2025, which was 0.4 percentage points lower than its previous estimate. The group’s economists assessed that Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs won’t likely have a major impact on South Korea’s economy, as those products account for less than 1% of its exports to the U.S. However, they expressed concern that possible increases in U.S. duties for semiconductors and cars would hurt the country’s trade-dependent economy more. South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, on Friday called a meeting with trade and foreign policy officials to discuss the potential impact of Trump’s trade measures, including reciprocal tariffs and possible product-specific duties for semiconductors, cars and pharmaceuticals. Choi, who is also South Korea’s finance minister, instructed officials to examine how other major economies, including the European Union, Japan and China, are responding to Trump’s trade policies, and try harder to effectively communicate South Korea’s position to U.S. officials. South Korea’s trade surplus with the U.S. reached $55.7 billion in 2024. According to the South Korean trade ministry, the country’s tariff rates on U.S. manufacturing imports is around zero percent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-requests-exclusion-from-us-plan-to-increase-tariffs/7982973.html	2025-02-20T23:45:09-08:00	
Philippine police arrest more than 450 in raid on alleged 'Chinese-run' scam center	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Philippine police arrested more than 450 people in a raid on an allegedly Chinese-run offshore gaming operator in Manila, the country's anti-organized crime commission has said. Initial interrogations suggested the suburban site had been operating as a scam center, targeting victims in China and India with sports betting and investment schemes, the commission said after the Thursday raid, which saw 137 Chinese nationals detained. 'We arrested around five Chinese bosses,' commission chief Gilberto Cruz told AFP on Friday, adding they faced potential trafficking charges. Banned by President Ferdinand Marcos last year, Philippine online gaming operators, or POGOs, are said to be used as cover by organized crime groups for human trafficking, money laundering, online fraud, kidnappings and even murder. 'This raid proves that the previous POGO workers are still trying to continue their scamming activities despite the ban,' Cruz said. He previously told AFP that about 21,000 Chinese nationals have continued to operate smaller-scale scam operations in the country since the online gaming ban. International concern has grown in recent years over similar scam operations in other Asian nations that are often staffed by trafficking victims tricked or coerced into promoting bogus cryptocurrency investments and other cons. President Marcos has put POGOs at the center of recent campaign messaging in the run-up to May mid-term elections, framing predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's alleged tolerance of the sites as evidence of a too-cozy relationship with China. Thursday's raid is the latest in a series of busts this year, including one in January that saw some 400 foreigners arrested in the capital, including many Chinese nationals. The Washington-based think tank United States Institute of Peace said in a May 2024 report that online scammers target millions of victims around the world and rake in annual revenues of $64 billion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-police-arrest-more-than-450-in-raid-on-alleged-chinese-run-scam-center/7982967.html	2025-02-20T23:32:08-08:00	
Netanyahu orders 'intensive' West Bank operations after Israel bus blasts	JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday ordered an 'intensive operation against centers of terrorism' in the occupied West Bank, his office said, after three buses exploded in central Israel without causing any reported injuries. Three devices detonated on buses in the city of Bat Yam on Thursday evening and two others were being defused, according to police, with Israel's defense minister accusing 'Palestinian terrorist' groups of being behind the blasts. Netanyahu's office said on social media early Friday that he had completed a security assessment with top officials, ordering fresh counterterrorism operations as well as stepped up security in Israeli cities. 'The Prime Minister has ordered the IDF (military) to carry out an intensive operation against centers of terrorism in Judea and Samaria,' Netanyahu's office said on X, using the biblical term for the West Bank. 'The Prime Minister also ordered the Israel Police and the ISA (internal security agency) to increase preventative activity against additional attacks in Israeli cities,' he added. A large number of police were deployed to search for suspects after the 'suspected terror attack,' the police force said in a statement. 'Police bomb disposal units are scanning for additional suspicious objects. We urge the public to avoid the areas and remain alert for any suspicious items,' it added. Tzvika Brot, the mayor of Bat Yam, said in a video statement that there were 'no injured in these incidents.' Security forces and bomb disposal units were seen by an AFP journalist as they inspected the remains of destroyed buses. Israeli media said that bus drivers countrywide had been asked to stop and inspect their vehicles for additional explosive devices. 'Intensify' West Bank raids A police commander from central Israel, Haim Sargarof, said in a televised briefing that the devices used to set off the blasts were similar to those found in the West Bank. Separately, Defense Minister Israel Katz said he ordered the military to 'intensify operations to thwart terrorism' in West Bank refugee camps, particularly Tulkarem. The military has been carrying out near-daily raids in West Bank cities and camps for several weeks now targeting Palestinian militants. Multiple Palestinian civilians have also been killed in the raids, while Israeli security forces have destroyed homes and infrastructure. The military operation has displaced more than 40,000 Palestinians, according to the United Nations. Violence in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has escalated since the October 2023 outbreak of war in the Gaza Strip. At least 897 Palestinians including militants have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since the Gaza war began, according to an AFP tally based on figures provided by the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah. At least 32 Israelis, including some soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or confrontations during Israeli operations in the West Bank over the same period, according to official Israeli figures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-orders-intensive-west-bank-operations-after-israel-bus-blasts/7982955.html	2025-02-20T23:08:35-08:00

US Senate Republicans push to pass border bill without Trump tax cuts	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday began a debate on a Republican bill to advance President Donald Trump's priorities on immigration, energy and defense, even after he urged lawmakers to scrap the effort in favor of a House of Representatives bill that would also include trillions of dollars in tax cuts. Trump this week came down firmly in favor of House Republicans' plan for a single sweeping bill. Backers of that plan fear that passing an immigration bill first could diminish their chances of extending $4.5 trillion in tax cuts in the House, where Republicans hold a narrow and fractious 218-215 majority. Senate Republicans said they would nonetheless push ahead with their narrower plan and address tax cuts in a later bill. They are seeking to bypass Democratic opposition in that chamber and secure an early legislative win for Trump. Democrats lack the votes to stop the bill but have vowed to fight it as long as possible, accusing Republicans of shortchanging American families to benefit the wealthy with tax breaks. 'We're going to be here all night,' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer proclaimed just before voting on amendments that began Thursday evening. Schumer introduced the first amendment, which seeks to prohibit tax cuts for those earning more than $1 billion. Republicans blocked the amendment. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine put the Senate on notice that he alone was seeking debate on about two dozen amendments ranging from middle-class tax cuts to measures protecting federal workers from termination and social safety net programs from cuts. Republican Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said earlier in the evening that there was an urgent need to beef up border security and the U.S. military. He argued that the higher spending ordered in the legislation would be 'offset with $342 billion in cuts in other parts of the government.' In a rarely used Senate process known as a 'vote-a-rama,' amendments can be offered until both parties agree to stop. Normally, the two parties agree upon a narrow set of amendments for debate in the full Senate on legislation. Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage over Democrats in the Senate, were expected to defeat scores of opposition amendments. Both chambers of Congress need to pass the same budget resolution to unlock the parliamentary tool that would enable Republicans to enact Trump's legislative agenda in a way that circumvents Democratic opposition and the Senate filibuster. Democrats made use of this maneuver in the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency, when they held majorities in both chambers of Congress. The Senate's bill, which leaves the issue of Trump's desired extension of his 2017 tax cuts to a later date, could serve as a backup in case the House Republicans cannot agree on how to pay for the tax cuts in their bill without slashing funding for popular safety net programs like Medicaid and Social Security or potentially adding to the country's $36 trillion debt. The Senate measure, a $340 billion fiscal 2025 budget resolution, would boost spending by $85 billion a year for four years to fund tighter border security, Trump's deportation of immigrants in the country illegally, energy deregulation, and an increase in military spending. The House budget resolution includes those same priorities along with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, while seeking to cover the cost through $2 trillion in spending cuts and accelerated economic growth based mainly on the tax and energy policy changes it would usher in.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-republicans-push-to-pass-border-bill-without-trump-tax-cuts-/7982905.html	2025-02-20T19:03:43-08:00

US small businesses brace for effects of higher steel, aluminum tariffs	U.S. small businesses are waiting to feel the effects of President Donald Trump’s executive order imposing a 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum.

Mexico’s president calls for constitutional reform to protect nation's sovereignty	Mexico’s president said Thursday that she would propose constitutional reforms to protect her country’s sovereignty, after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump designated eight Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. 'The Mexican people will not accept under any circumstances interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that could be harmful to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the nation,' President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday in her morning press conference. Some in Mexico fear that the Trump administration’s designation of the drug cartels as terrorist organizations could be the first step to U.S. military action within Mexico, something Trump proposed during his presidential election campaign. On Thursday, the names of the cartels were published in the U.S. Federal Register, carrying out one of Trump’s Jan. 20 executive orders. The Mexican president said the U.S. did not consult with her government before making the designations, which are usually reserved for terrorist groups with political goals, not groups looking to make financial gains. Sheinbaum said that any foreign investigations or prosecutions conducted by foreign agents on Mexican soil could not move forward without the authorization by and collaboration with the Mexican government. 'What we want to make clear in the face of this designation is that we do not negotiate sovereignty,' Sheinbaum said. 'This cannot be an opportunity for the United States to invade our sovereignty.' Laws passed under Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, restricted the independence and movements of foreign agents in Mexico. Sheinbaum now wants those laws written into Mexico’s constitution. Sheinbaum also wants an addition to the constitution that would apply the stiffest penalties possible to people engaged in the manufacturing, smuggling and distribution of guns. This has long been a point of contention between Mexico and the U.S., as Mexico is flooded with guns from U.S. shops and manufacturers.

US flies Venezuelan migrants from Guantanamo to Honduras	The U.S. government flew 177 Venezuelan migrants from Guantanamo Bay to Honduras on Thursday, from where they are set to be transferred on to Venezuela, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security said. Earlier on Thursday, the Honduran government said about 170 Venezuelan migrants were set to arrive in the Central American nation from the United States, before being transported immediately back to Venezuela. The transfer of the migrants would take place at Soto Cano, a joint U.S.-Honduras military air base, the Honduran government said. Venezuela requested the repatriation of the citizens who it said were unjustly taken to Guantanamo naval base, Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said in a statement posted on Telegram, adding they would be flown from Honduras by Venezuelan airline Conviasa. The arrival in Venezuela is expected Thursday evening local time. Lawyers representing at least half a dozen of the deportees said they learned about the deportations on Thursday afternoon. The deportations come after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit last week seeking access to dozens of migrants flown to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to an attorney. The deportees included 126 people with criminal charges or convictions, 80 of whom were allegedly affiliated with Tren de Aragua, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said, adding that 51 had no criminal record. There are no migrant detainees left at Guantanamo after Thursday’s deportations, the spokesperson said. The U.S. has designated Tren de Aragua a global terrorist organization along with other organized crime groups, as President Donald Trump steps up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-flies-venezuelan-migrants-from-guantanamo-to-honduras/7982890.html	2025-02-20T17:54:54-08:00	
Trump order challenges independence of FCC, other agencies	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump this week signed an executive order intended to expand the White House’s authority over various independent regulatory agencies that Congress set up to be shielded from direct White House control, including the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The order, signed Tuesday, would require independent agencies to submit proposed regulations to the White House for review. The order also would require agencies to consult with the White House on their 'policies and priorities' and 'strategic plans.' 'These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people,' the order said. The executive order, titled 'Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies,' is expected to face challenges in court, according to legal experts. The move came as the president has worked to consolidate power within the executive branch, including by removing more than a dozen inspectors general who provided oversight at various government agencies. In addition to the FCC, agencies that would be affected by the new order include the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FCC does not directly regulate major news networks, but it does evaluate the actions of broadcasting stations around the U.S. that hold FCC licenses to use public airwaves. Former FCC chairs told VOA that the move would be a significant change for the FCC. 'It makes an independent agency that was created to be independent like an agency in the executive branch,' said Tom Wheeler, who served as FCC chairman under former President Barack Obama. Reed Hundt, who served as FCC chairman under former President Bill Clinton, agreed that the order would mark a departure from the agency’s nearly 100-year history. 'For 90 years, the governmental idea was that the president should not be regulating the media,' Hundt told VOA. Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican who served as an FCC commissioner under Clinton, told VOA that the order 'would have a major effect on rulemaking' at the FCC. He added that other areas, like enforcement, might not be affected. Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez told VOA that she was concerned by the order. 'Our informed decision-making is meant to be consistent with our technical expertise, not subject to political pressure,' Gomez told VOA in an emailed statement. Gomez added that Congress already provides oversight over the FCC. 'Efforts to expand executive influence on the FCC will only further diminish our standing as a stable, independent and expert-driven regulatory body,' said Gomez, who has served as a commissioner since 2023. Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, as well as Commissioners Geoffrey Starks and Nathan Simington, did not immediately reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment on the order. Carr and Simington are Republicans, Starks is a Democrat. Kim Zarkin, a professor of communication at Westminster University in Utah who has researched the FCC for three decades, said she thought it was important for the FCC and other independent agencies to remain as nonpolitical as possible. Even though commissioners at agencies such as the FCC are nominated by the president, 'there was always this expectation that these were meant to be nonpolitical,' Zarkin told VOA. 'They were meant to bring in expertise.' Zarkin, who has written two books on the FCC, said time will tell whether the order has any material impact on how the FCC and other agencies operate. Trump’s executive order comes amid concerns that the FCC is being weaponized to intimidate broadcasters through investigations, according to Democratic FCC commissioners and media law experts. The FCC is currently investigating broadcasters, including NPR, PBS, CBS and NBC. The FCC is investigating whether NPR and PBS member stations violated FCC rules on airing commercial ads. Both broadcasters deny wrongdoing. The CBS inquiry pertains to whether the broadcaster doctored an October '60 Minutes' interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. That interview is also at the center of a $10 billion lawsuit from Trump. CBS denied wrongdoing when Trump filed the lawsuit. Earlier this month, CBS published the interview’s unedited transcripts, which showed '60 Minutes' and 'Face the Nation' used slightly different parts of the same answer from Harris, which is common journalistic practice. The NBC investigation is into the company’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Democratic FCC commissioners and media law experts have expressed concern about the investigations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-order-challenges-independence-of-fcc-other-agencies/7982860.html	2025-02-20T17:16:01-08:00	
Pope Francis' health condition is stable, Vatican says	Pope Francis 'had a restful night,' and Thursday morning 'got out of bed and had breakfast in an armchair,' the Vatican said in a statement. Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital last week with bronchitis, which then developed into double pneumonia. Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said Thursday that the pope now has focal pneumonia with limited areas of infection in the lungs. Bruni said Francis is breathing on his own, and his heart is stable. An earlier statement Thursday reported the pope's clinical condition as 'stable,' and his blood tests had shown 'a slight improvement, particularly in the inflammatory indices.' Wednesday evening, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited the pope for 20 minutes in the hospital's special papal suite. 'We joked as always,' the prime minister said in a statement afterward. 'He hasn't lost his proverbial sense of humor.' Francis, whose birth name is Jorge Mario Bergoglio, has been the head of the Roman Catholic Church since 2013, when his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, resigned from the papacy. In a recent memoir, Francis addressed the possibility of his own resignation if he became incapacitated. He said such a move would be a 'distant possibility,' justified only if facing 'a serious physical impediment.' 'We are all worried about the pope,' Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, head of the Italian Bishops’ Conference, told Agence France-Presse. Zuppi said, however, that the reports about Francis eating and greeting people are good indications that 'we are on the right path to a full recovery, which we hope will happen soon.' Speaking at a Vatican news conference about a Mediterranean youth peace initiative, Cardinal Juan Jose Omella Omella of Barcelona compared the papacy to a train to give reassurances that the work of the papacy will continue, even with Francis' hospitalization. 'Popes change, we bishops change, priests in parishes change, communities change, but the train continues being on the move,' the cardinal said. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-health-condition-is-stable-vatican-says-/7982824.html	2025-02-20T17:00:09-08:00	
US State Department tweaks online fact sheet on China	WASHINGTON — PRC is out. China is in. That is among the significant modifications to the U.S. State Department’s online fact sheet on China, which drops the country’s official name, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), in favor of just China. Former President Joe Biden’s administration routinely referenced the Beijing government with the PRC abbreviation. Since former President Richard Nixon normalized relations with Beijing — ending recognition of the government in Taipei, the United States has maintained diplomatic ties with the communist-run government on the mainland while reducing the relationship with Taiwan — officially known as the Republic of China — to unofficial but friendly. 'Taipei should take solace in the fact that the change in the term [from PRC to China] does not represent a policy change in the United States. The fact of the matter is that the U.S. still has its ‘One China' policy, and under that policy, it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and robust unofficial relations with Taipei,' Russell Hsiao, Global Taiwan Institute executive director, told VOA. 'Since 1979, Washington has recognized the government in Beijing of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, so the change in term is essentially a different way of presenting the same set of facts, all of which haven't changed,' Hsiao said. China considers Taiwan a rogue province. Nationalist forces, backed by the United States and commanded by Chiang Kai-shek, fled the mainland for Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communist forces led by Mao Zedong. Chiang became Taiwan’s relatively benign dictator until his death in 1975. Mao ruled over the mainland as a rigid authoritarian until his death a year after Chiang died. Washington continues to provide Taipei with weapons and has left the question ambiguous as to whether the United States would use its military to defend the island if Taiwan were to be attacked. The Taiwan Relations Act commits the United States to help Taiwan defend itself, but the final decision on military intervention would rest with the president and Congress. Language changes last week by the State Department eliminated a reference to Washington not supporting Taiwan independence, but left intact was content noting that the United States opposes 'unilateral changes to the status quo' by either side of the Taiwan Strait. A significant change to the State Department’s web page on China, however, is the deletion of content on cooperating with allies on China-related issues and on helping Beijing with cultural matters and environmental protections. Instead, there is new language focusing on the U.S.-China trade relationship, noting the difficulty for American businesses to operate in China and that the Chinese economy is 'one of the most restrictive investment climates in the world.' Yet another shift in tone, in line with rhetoric used by President Donald Trump’s administration, is reflected by frequent references to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The party is directly accused of trying to 'manipulate and subvert' United Nations organizations and other international bodies and seeking to 'groom and install CCP members in leadership and other positions' in such groups. In the newly edited fact sheet, the CCP is also blamed for 'malicious cyber activity against U.S. government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks.' The document now notes the United States is dedicated to countering these activities 'to help protect American citizens, businesses and industries.' 'These moves reflect an overall sense in Washington and within the Trump administration that engagement with China has failed and a tougher approach is warranted,' Rorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA. 'This mood has been building — particularly in Congress — for years, and a change of emphasis is no surprise. However, swapping out PRC for China reflects a deeper and more dangerous narrative that attacks the CCP’s legitimacy as the governing authority of China. I expect this will be viewed with grave concern by Beijing and raised at the highest levels in the coming days and weeks,' added Daniels. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, responding during Thursday’s regular press briefing, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the website changes. The State Department’s actions 'misrepresent the facts, attack China’s foreign policy and peddle the so-called China-U.S. strategic competition. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose it,' Guo said. The changes come after Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China. The president said he was taking the action because Beijing’s government has failed to stop the flow into the United States of the illicit opioid fentanyl. Trump has also announced he intends to put in place further retaliatory tariffs on all trading partners that limit access for U.S. goods into their markets.

Trump administration reduces deportation protections for 521,000 Haitians	WASHINGTON — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday cut the duration of deportation protections and work permits for 521,000 Haitians covered by the Temporary Protected Status program so that they will expire in August, a Homeland Security Department spokesperson said. The decision reverses a Biden administration move last year to extend the protections through February 2026, the spokesperson said, saying the extension was unjustified. President Donald Trump, a Republican, tried to end most enrollment in the TPS program during his 2017-2021 presidency but was blocked by federal courts. Noem earlier this month revoked a Biden-era TPS extension for some 600,000 Venezuelans and terminated the status for half of them, whose protections and access to work permits expire in April. Trump falsely said during a September 2024 debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets, sparking fear of retaliation among Haitians in the city. Trump said a month later that if elected he would revoke TPS for Haitians and deport them. Noem will now need to decide whether to terminate the status for Haitians. 'President Trump and I are returning TPS to its original status: temporary,' she said in a statement. More than 1 million people, more than half of them children, are now displaced within Haiti where gang violence continues unabated despite the start of a United Nations-backed security mission last year, U.N. data published in January showed. Haiti has lacked elected representatives since 2023 and has not held elections since 2016. The country's capital is almost entirely controlled by armed gangs, and leaders have said security must first be established to hold a free and fair vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-cuts-duration-of-deportation-protections-for-521-000-haitians/7982521.html	2025-02-20T15:01:19-08:00	
EU official meets with Trump counterparts to resolve tariff threats	WASHINGTON — Hoping to head off a potential trade conflict, a top European Union official stressed the importance of active engagement and fairness in trade during a four-hour meeting with Trump administration officials. 'The top objective as it was presented to us yesterday by our American partners is reciprocity,' Maros Sefcovic, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, told reporters at a Thursday briefing. Sefcovic met on Wednesday with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump's nominee to be the U.S. trade representative. Trump has thrown the decades long partnership between the U.S. and Europe into turmoil by pledging to charge higher taxes on imports from Europe that he says would match the tariffs faced by American products. But Trump's plan for fair tariffs would also include the value added tax — which is akin to a sales tax — charged in Europe that could drastically push up import taxes and potentially trigger a broader trade conflict if the EU imposed retaliatory measures. A broader trade war risks both an economic slowdown and higher inflation that could create financial challenges for millions of families and potentially hurt political support for Trump, as voters in 2024's election specifically wanted him to lower price pressures. Trump also has proposed separate sectoral tariffs on autos, pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips, in addition to having already imposed 25% steel and aluminum tariffs with no avenues to provide exceptions or exemptions. Additionally, the U.S. president also has tariffs ready on Mexico and Canada over his claims that more should be done on illegal immigration and drug smuggling, though he suspended those tariffs for 30 days for ongoing talks. The import taxes that could potentially harm the U.S. auto sector and other industries could potentially begin in March. At Thursday's White House news briefing, Hassett said that he and Lutnick had talks with a Mexican delegation about resolving the issues. 'We want trade to be fair,' Hassett said. The EU official tried in his conversation with White House officials to equate the value added tax as similar to a sales tax as its paid by the final consumer, but he said that the issue had not been resolved. Sefcovic also said they discussed the industrial overcapacity of China, particularly in steel, and that the U.S. and EU should work together to tackle that problem, instead of targeting each other. He stressed that the meeting ended with a focus on looking for ways to 'generate positive momentum,' adding that the EU would like to 'see where we can, like, move first and fast, because I really would like to avoid the pain of measures and countermeasures.' The EU official said it was critical to establish a personal relationship with his U.S. counterparts. 'I’m glad that it happened and that we could have such an intense meeting,' he said. 'Now, I think we will both be thinking how to keep the momentum going on and how to hopefully avoid I would say, the pain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-official-meets-with-trump-counterparts-to-resolve-tariff-threats-/7982535.html	2025-02-20T14:51:00-08:00

European shipyards sustain Russia's Arctic gas trade	london — European shipyards are providing vital servicing contracts to vessels carrying Russian liquefied natural gas, sustaining a trade that Kyiv says is funding the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. Meanwhile, a new analysis of the latest trade data shows that imports of Russian LNG to the EU rose last year, bucking the overall trend of declining imports from the rest of the world. A fleet of 15 specialized Arc7 tankers carry Russian LNG from its source on the Yamal Peninsula, high in the Russian arctic, to import terminals in Europe and beyond. The vessels are designed to smash through the arctic ice, allowing Moscow to ship its lucrative LNG year-round. The demanding conditions mean that the tankers require regular repairs. Satellite tracking data show 14 of the vessels are being serviced at two European ports: the Damen shipyard in Brest, France, and the Fayard A/S shipyard near Odense, Denmark. 'The European shipyards … are pretty much right along the natural export-import route that they're going along anyway. So, it's pretty convenient to stop there for a week or 10 days to do the hull maintenance, repainting, et cetera. For Russia, if those European shipyards would be off limits, the operation would definitely peter out over several years as the vessels would become more and more unusable,' said Malte Humpert, a senior fellow at The Arctic Institute and an expert on LNG shipping. Western expertise Western expertise appears crucial in keeping the tankers operational. A single Arc7 vessel, the Christophe de Margerie, is subject to Western sanctions and can no longer call at European shipyards. Attempts to repair the ship in China appear to have failed, and it is currently out of action. Even if other servicing facilities were found, the LNG trade might not be profitable, Humpert said. 'A large part of the economics is to have the shipyards very close to where you offload the gas. The operating costs are up to $100,000 per day for those vessels. So if suddenly you lose a journey from Europe to China, that's several weeks. If you lose weeks and weeks, that's millions of dollars you lose in terms of operating costs,' he told VOA via Zoom. There is no suggestion that the European shipyards – Damen in France and Fayard A/S in Denmark – have broken any EU sanctions. Damen told Britain’s Financial Times that no further servicing of the Arc7 tankers was planned 'for the coming period.' Fayard declined to comment. Imports rise The servicing is being carried out despite European pledges to stop buying Russian energy, following Moscow’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv says the profits fund the Kremlin’s war. Before 2022, Russia supplied about 40% of Europe’s gas. Most European countries no longer receive Russian gas via pipelines after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement with Moscow at the beginning of the year. It’s a different story for liquefied natural gas transported by sea. A new analysis shows LNG imports from Russia rose by 18% last year, bucking the overall trend of declining imports from the rest of the world. Market forces Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, who co-wrote the European LNG Tracker report for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said market forces dictate LNG trade patterns. 'The main suppliers decreased their exports to Europe: the U.S., Qatar. But we saw an increase in Russian LNG. So then we started thinking: What's going on? What is happening there?' 'Yamal [in Russia] has contracts with certain companies in Europe, so we see lots of companies involved in all this trade. The issue is that [the European Union] could say something, but these are commercial agreements. These are private companies. It's just business. ... They will try to secure LNG where it's best for them,' Jaller-Makarewicz told VOA via Zoom. For some European countries, that business is worth more than the aid they’re sending to Ukraine, Humpert said. 'Spain imported $2.5 billion of LNG from Russia last year, and they spent $500 million in military aid,' he said, adding that many of the tankers carrying Russian LNG are owned and insured by European companies. 'If the EU were to sanction them, then that definitely cuts into European companies' profits and there’s definitely losses. I mean, that’s always what you have to weigh up, right? Sanctions do cause economic harm,' he said. EU ban The EU so far has stopped short of banning Russian LNG imports. Officials told Reuters last month that the bloc wants to secure alternatives before taking any measures against Moscow. 'First you have to have a deal, because otherwise you will be left without gas from Russia and without the U.S.,' an unnamed EU diplomat told Reuters. European pledges to cut down on Russian energy imports are being undermined by the LNG trade, said analyst Jaller-Makarewicz. While some LNG importers are tied to long-term contracts, 'around 30% are done on spot rates,' she said. 'In 2022, Europe said, 'We definitely need to stop our dependency on Russian gas as a whole.' LNG from Russia was not a major factor at that moment; it was the gas coming via pipeline. So then why are we still buying on spot rates that are not really based on LNG long-term contracts?' she asked. An EU ban on the transshipment of Russian LNG to countries outside the bloc is due to come into force later this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-shipyards-sustain-russia-s-arctic-gas-trade-/7982453.html	2025-02-20T13:55:17-08:00

Trump loyalist Kash Patel takes helm of FBI	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration's makeover of the United States' national security and law enforcement agencies took a major step forward Thursday, with Senate lawmakers voting 51-49 to confirm Kash Patel as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The vote puts Patel at the helm of the country's premier law enforcement agency, where he has promised to lead an overhaul of the bureau at a time when critics of President Donald Trump have accused the administration of leading a purge to end the bureau's tradition of independence and align the bureau with Trump's priorities. Two Republicans — Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski — voted with Democrats against Patel's confirmation. But support from the rest of the Senate Republican delegation gave Patel a slim victory, with many hailing the new FBI director as an agent of change. 'The FBI has lost trust among the American people in recent years. Much of that stems from a perception that politics has infected the FBI's important work,' said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, ahead of Thursday's vote. 'We need all law enforcement working together and focused on the real threats facing our country,' Thune said. 'I look forward to working with Mr. Patel to restore the integrity of the FBI and get it focused on its critical mission.' Other Republicans have echoed similar sentiments. 'The FBI has been infected by political bias and weaponized against the American people,' said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley before advancing Patel's nomination to the full Senate earlier this month, noting 'Mr. Patel knows it, Mr. Patel exposed it, and Mr. Patel was targeted.' 'The American people are sick and tired of two tiers of access, two tiers of treatment, and two tiers of justice,' said Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, also speaking earlier this month on the need for Patel to head the FBI. Patel is a former public defender and federal prosecutor who previously served as a Trump national security adviser and at the Pentagon. In a statement announcing Patel's nomination in November, Trump praised him as having 'played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability and the Constitution.' Democrats, however, have repeatedly questioned Patel's qualifications and integrity, accusing him of describing some of the prosecuted, Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol rioters as 'political prisoners,' and of calling for the prosecution of Trump opponents. And citing whistleblowers, they have accused Patel of lying to lawmakers about knowledge of efforts at the FBI to force out officials and agents who were assigned to investigate the Capitol Hill riot. 'He is unprepared and unqualified. He has an enemies list. He has these foreign entanglements,' said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, rallying against Patel's confirmation in front of FBI headquarters in Washington before Thursday's vote. 'To Republicans who may vote for Kash Patel, this vote will haunt you,' he said. 'You will rue the day of this vote.' Democrat Peter Welch, also speaking in front of FBI headquarters, called Patel 'a crown jewel' in what he described as a 'lawless rampage' by Trump. 'He's an instrument of Donald Trump's effort to destroy the Justice Department and the FBI so that he is absolutely and completely not only above the law, but beyond the law,' Welch said. Patel, during his confirmation hearing last month, rejected accusations he has an enemies list or that he will seek retribution against Trump's opponents or enemies. 'I have no interest nor desire and will not, if confirmed, go backwards,' Patel told lawmakers. 'There will be no politicization at the FBI. There will be no retributive actions taken by the FBI.' 'The only thing that will matter if I'm confirmed as a director of the FBI is a de-weaponized, de-politicized system of law enforcement completely devoted to rigorous obedience to the Constitution and a singular standard of justice,' he said. The FBI director is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a term not to exceed 10 years.

Israel reports several bus explosions; no injuries reported	Israeli police on Thursday reported a series of explosions on buses in central Israel in what they said appeared to be a militant attack. No injuries were reported. Police forces rushed to the scene in Bat Yam, a Tel Aviv suburb, as they searched for suspects. Police said bomb disposal units were searching for additional bombs. Police spokesman Asi Aharoni told Channel 13 TV that explosives were found on two other buses. He called on the public to be alert and report any suspicious objects to authorities. Police said the Shin Bet internal security agency was taking over the investigation. The explosions took place just hours after Hamas released the bodies of four Israeli hostages held in Gaza — the first of eight hostages that Israel believes are dead and to be returned during the current phase of the ceasefire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-reports-several-bus-explosions-no-injuries-reported/7982435.html	2025-02-20T13:17:31-08:00	
Somali government says attacks on bases repulsed, 130 militants killed	Officials in Somalia say 130 militants were killed Thursday as Somali National Army troops 'repulsed' attacks on four government military bases in the center of the country. VOA Somali was not able to immediately confirm the death toll from the fighting, which took place in an area where government forces have clashed repeatedly with al-Shabab in recent days. In a statement, Somalia's Ministry of Information said that militants used explosives to attack the bases in the Middle Shabelle region. 'Al-Shabab suffered a heavy defeat and our brave heroes are actively pursuing the remaining militants. Somalia will never falter in its fight against terrorism,' the ministry said. The statement said government forces also recovered weapons from the defeated militant fighters. For the last couple of weeks, Somali government forces, supported by local clan militias, have carried out operations aimed at securing rural villages along the Shabelle River that were recently liberated from al-Shabab. General Ibrahim Mumin, the commander of the 3rd division of the Somali National Army, told VOA Somali that Thursday’s al-Shabab attacks 'failed' as government troops fought off the militants. Mumin said defensive barriers erected by the soldiers in anticipation of al-Shabab attacks prevented the explosives from penetrating the military bases. Neither the information ministry nor the commander provided casualty totals for government forces, but a local resident told VOA at least five soldiers were killed and more than 10 others injured. In separate clashes on Thursday, at least 20 Islamic State militants were killed, and dozens were injured in Somalia’s northeastern Puntland region, according to officials. Puntland police commissioner Brigadier General Mumin Abdi Shire told VOA that Islamic state militants suffered heavy casualties. 'Our brave men carried out military operations around the villages of Dhasaq and Dandamale near the Togga Jacel area of the Cal Miskaad mountains, killing at least 20 militants. All of them foreigners,' Shire said. Al-Shabab has been fighting Somali governments since 2007 to impose its strict brand of Islamic law on the country. In the northeast, Puntland began a major offensive against Islamic State in December and claims to have since killed nearly 200 Islamic State fighters, dozens of them foreign fighters, and captured villages and bases in the mountainous area controlled by IS. This month, U.S. warplanes twice targeted the Islamic State affiliate in the area, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold. Among those killed was Ahmed Maeleninine, an Omani-born leader of Islamic State, officials of the Puntland region said last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-government-says-attacks-on-bases-repulsed-130-militants-killed/7982300.html	2025-02-20T11:56:18-08:00	
McConnell, longest-serving US senator, to retire in early 2027	U.S. Senator and former Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Thursday, on his 83rd birthday, that he will not seek reelection when his current term ends in early 2027. First elected in 1984, McConnell made the announcement from the Senate floor. 'Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate. Every day in between, I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business here,' he said. 'Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.' McConnell will retire as the longest-serving senator in U.S. history and the longest-serving Senate leader from any party. He has led the Republicans since 2007 both as majority and minority leader before giving up the position to Senator John Thune last year. McConnell’s storied political career saw him guide the Senate chamber through a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, presidential impeachment trials and fierce political fights. In recent years, McConnell had a series of health scares, including two separate incidents in which he froze while talking to reporters. He blamed those incidents on a previous concussion. In his comments Thursday, McConnell said he decided last year that he would not run for reelection. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mcconnell-longest-serving-us-senator-to-retire-in-early-2027/7982278.html	2025-02-20T11:51:04-08:00	
Azerbaijan suspends BBC	Azerbaijan’s government has ordered the suspension of the Azerbaijani operation of BBC News, the British news agency confirmed Thursday. In a statement, the BBC said it had made the 'reluctant decision' to close its office in the country after receiving a verbal instruction from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 'We deeply regret this restrictive move against press freedom, which will hinder our ability to report to and from Azerbaijan for our audiences inside and outside the country,' a BBC spokesperson said in a statement. The suspension comes after Azerbaijani state-run media last week reported that the Azerbaijani government wanted to reduce the number of BBC staff working in the country to one. The BBC said it has received nothing in writing about the suspension from the Azerbaijani government. While the news agency seeks clarification, its team of journalists in the country have stopped their journalistic activities, according to the BBC. Neither Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry nor its Washington embassy immediately responded to VOA’s emails seeking comment. The BBC has operated in Azerbaijan since 1994. The news agency says its Azerbaijani service reached an average of 1 million people every week. The BBC suspension marks the continuation of a harsh crackdown on independent media that the Azerbaijani government has engaged in for years. Azerbaijan is among the worst jailers of journalists in the world. As of last week, at least 23 journalists were jailed in the former Soviet country in retaliation for their work, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Many of the journalists jailed in Azerbaijan are accused of foreign currency smuggling, which media watchdogs have rejected as a sham charge. Among those jailed is Farid Mehralizada, an economist and journalist with the Azerbaijani Service of VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Jailed since May 2024, Mehralizada faces charges of conspiring to smuggle foreign currency and 'illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery.' He and his employer reject the charges, which carry a combined sentence of up to 12 years behind bars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijan-suspends-bbc/7982159.html	2025-02-20T10:28:32-08:00	
US envoy Kellogg, Zelenskyy talk in Kyiv	U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg met in Kyiv Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but there was no immediate word on whether they had eased U.S.-Ukrainian relations after U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelenskyy traded barbs this week over Russia’s three-year war against Ukraine. Kellogg said upon arriving in the Ukrainian capital that he was there to listen to Zelenskyy’s views after officials in Kyiv voiced their anger at being excluded this week when the top U.S. and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia to lay the groundwork for talks to end the fighting. After Kellogg met with Zelenskyy, the two men were expected to hold a news conference, but the Ukrainian side said the Americans asked that it be called off, and it was. Trump and Zelenskyy assailed each other this week. The U.S. president, echoing Russian attacks, called Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' while Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian-influenced 'disinformation space' when the U.S. leader indicated that Ukraine started the war. It was Moscow that invaded its neighbor three years ago next week. Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms more favorable to Moscow. Russia currently controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory. U.S. Vice President JD Vance told a gathering of conservative activists outside Washington on Thursday that Trump 'wants the killing to stop' in Ukraine and that 'peace is in the interest of the American people.' He said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, 'We’re on the cusp of peace.' Vance did not mention Ukraine’s role in settling the conflict, although U.S. officials have said Kyiv and Moscow will both be involved in the settlement and have to make concessions to achieve peace. European leaders have responded to Trump's recent remarks about Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if the fighting ends. The Kremlin says the plan is a major cause for concern, but Zelenskyy and NATO have welcomed it. 'It is vital that ... Russia will never again try to take one more square kilometer of Ukrainian land,' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said, adding that a peace pact would have to entail robust security guarantees for Ukraine. 'While there is much that still needs to be decided, there is no question that Europe has a vital role to play in securing peace in Ukraine,' he told reporters in Bratislava. In a string of comments on his Truth Social platform this week, Trump accused Zelenskyy of refusing to hold elections in Ukraine, which had been scheduled for April 2024 but were delayed after Russia invaded in 2022. Trump disparaged Zelenskyy as 'a modestly successful comedian' and said, 'The only thing he was good at was playing [former U.S. President Joe] Biden 'like a fiddle'' for more U.S. military assistance.' 'I love Ukraine,' Trump said, 'but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died — And so it continues.' Earlier, Trump had scoffed at Zelenskyy's complaint about not being invited to the Tuesday talks in Riyadh headed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 'Today I heard, 'Well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years,' Trump said of Ukraine's leaders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-kellogg-zelenskyy-talk-in-kyiv/7982134.html	2025-02-20T10:23:34-08:00	
Creating inclusive Syrian government could help lift sanctions, UN envoy says	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Creating an inclusive government in Syria in coming weeks will help determine whether Western sanctions are lifted as the country rebuilds after the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad, the U.N. special envoy to Syria said Thursday. 'What I'm hoping is that with a truly new inclusive government in place on the 1st of March, this will help us in lifting sanctions' imposed on Syria by Western countries during Assad's rule, Geir Pedersen told The Associated Press in an interview during a visit to Damascus. After Assad was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its 'salvation government' that had ruled in northwestern Syria. The country's de facto authorities said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria's interim president after a meeting of most of the country's former rebel factions. In recent weeks, a committee has been holding meetings in different parts of Syria in preparation for a national dialogue conference to chart the country's political future, the date of which has not yet been announced. Pedersen said that in his first meeting with al-Sharaa in December, al-Sharaa had insisted that the interim government would rule for only three months, although Pedersen warned him the timeline was tight. 'I think the important thing is not whether it is three months or not, but it is whether they will deliver on what they have said all along, that this is going to be an inclusive process where all Syrians will be included,' Pedersen said. The U.S. and European countries have not lifted sanctions that were imposed on the Syrian government under Assad's rule, which the new authorities have said is handicapping their ability to rebuild the country after nearly 14 years of civil war and restore essential services like state electricity. Officials from some Western countries have said they want to see if the interim rulers will follow through on their promises of inclusive governance and protecting minorities. Organizers of the national dialogue have said the conference will include all segments of Syrian society except for Assad loyalists and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led force in the northeast that has so far refused to dissolve and be absorbed into the new national army. The SDF is currently in negotiations with the central government, and Pedersen said he hopes to see a 'political solution' to the impasse. Pedersen said he is also concerned about a security vacuum following the disbanding of the former national army and security services by the country's new rulers. 'It's very important that the new structures of the state are coming in place quickly and that there is an offer to those who are no longer in service of the army or the security services, that there are other job opportunities and that people do not feel that they are excluded from the future of Syria,' he said. The U.N. envoy said he also remains concerned about Israel's incursions into Syrian territory since the fall of Assad. The Israeli army has seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria and has also made forays beyond the buffer zone. The U.N. has said that Israel is violating the agreement. Israeli officials have said they took the action to protect Israel's security and that their presence would be temporary. Pedersen said the security concerns are being addressed and 'there is really, in my opinion, no argument for why the Israelis should be staying.' 'The solution is very simple. The Israelis need to withdraw,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/creating-inclusive-syrian-government-could-help-lift-sanctions-un-envoy-says/7982063.html	2025-02-20T09:31:16-08:00	
Former Spanish football chief guilty of sexual harassment	Spain’s High Court in Madrid on Thursday found former Spanish football federation chief Luis Rubiales guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent following the 2023 Women's World Cup final. The court fined the 47-year-old Rubiales $10,400, and he was ordered to stay at least 200 meters from Hermoso and refrain from communication with her for at least one year. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 2½ years. Rubiales was cleared of charges of coercion. Prosecutors alleged he and three other male Spanish federation members and former women's team coach Jorge Vilda had pressured Hermoso into supporting Rubiales’ claim that the kiss had been consensual. They all were acquitted. The two-week trial was carried live on Spanish television and had been highly anticipated. Rubiales kissed Spanish women’s team member Hermoso on the lips during the awards ceremony in Sydney, Australia, after Spain beat England 1-0 in the Women’s World Cup final in August 2023. The incident sparked outrage within and outside Spain, marring the victory celebration, with many, including government ministers, players and coaches, demanding his resignation. International football’s governing body, FIFA, opened disciplinary proceedings against him. Rubiales, who had been football federation chief since 2018, initially dismissed the kiss as a 'peck' but gave in to pressure and resigned in September 2023 after an investigation began. A recent reform of the Spanish penal code classified a nonconsensual kiss as sexual assault. Following the verdict, Spain's equality minister, Ana Redondo, told the Reuters news service, the court’s decision proves their law is a good one. 'It is a law that protects women against aggression,' Redondo said. 'Consent, and this is the important thing, is the cornerstone of every relationship.'

Trump signs order aimed at ending benefits for some immigrants	SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order aimed at ending federal benefits for people in the country illegally, the White House said Wednesday, his latest in a blizzard of moves to crack down on immigration. The White House said the order seeks to end 'all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens,' but it was not clear which benefits will be targeted. People in the country illegally generally do not qualify except for emergency medical care. Children are entitled to a free K-12 public education regardless of immigration status under a 1982 Supreme Court ruling. The order notes that a 1996 welfare overhaul denies most public benefits to people in the country illegally but says that law has been gradually undermined. 'Over the last 4 years, in particular, the prior administration repeatedly undercut the goals of that law, resulting in the improper expenditure of significant taxpayer resources.' Trump's words appear directed at former President Joe Biden's extensive use of parole authority to allow people in the country temporarily, including more than 900,000 through an online appointment app called CBP One used at border crossings with Mexico and more than 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who flew to the United States at their own expense with a financial sponsor. Trump immediately ended both programs. Biden also granted parole to nearly 300,000 people from Ukraine and Afghanistan. People granted parole for at least a year are considered 'qualified noncitizens,' making them eligible for some income-based benefits, but only after five years. They include Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Some states have shortened the five-year wait. Trump's order appears to have other targets, some already subjects of earlier edicts and Justice Department lawsuits. It directs all departments and agencies to identify federal benefit spending that is inconsistent with the 1996 welfare law. It also seeks to ensure that state and local governments are not using federal funds for policies that support 'sanctuary' policies or encourage illegal immigration. Trump signed 10 executive orders on immigration on his first day in office. They included ending automatic citizenship for people born in the United States and asylum at the southern border. The birthright citizenship order has been temporarily halted in court.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-aimed-at-ending-benefits-for-some-immigrants/7981983.html	2025-02-20T08:35:36-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon makes 2 court appearances	Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared in two Seoul courtrooms Thursday, first to hear criminal insurrection charges and then to face a Constitutional Court impeachment trial, both in connection with his short-lived, Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Yoon was taken by motorcade from the Seoul Detention Center, where he is being held, to the Central District Court for the preliminary hearing on the insurrection charges prosecutors filed last month. In that hearing, Yoon’s lawyers argued that his declaration of martial law was not intended to paralyze the state, but to 'alert the public to the national crisis caused by the legislative dictatorship of the dominant opposition party, which had crippled the administration.' The lawyers also asked for Yoon’s release from detention, although it was unclear when the court would rule on that request. Yoon next traveled to the Constitutional Court for the tenth and final scheduled hearing in the trial over validity of his impeachment for declaring martial law. In Yoon’s first appearance at that trial, the court heard testimony from Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was also impeached by National Assembly lawmakers for his role in the early December declaration. Yoon briefly left the courtroom during Han’s testimony, with Yoon’s lawyers explaining they felt it was inappropriate for the two to be seen together. Han told the court that while he shared Yoon’s views on the liberal opposition, he and the rest of the cabinet disagreed with the president’s declaration of martial law and even tried to dissuade him. To his knowledge, the prime minister added, none of the cabinet members supported the action. The Constitutional Court is reviewing parliament’s Dec. 14 vote to impeach Yoon and will decide whether to permanently remove him from office or reinstate him. The court is considering if Yoon violated the constitution while Yoon and his lawyers have argued that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break a political deadlock. If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days. The court is expected to deliver its ruling in early or mid-March. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-makes-2-court-appearances/7981971.html	2025-02-20T08:12:23-08:00	
Ivory Coast takes control of last remaining French base	ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST — Ivory Coast officially took control of the last remaining French military base in the country Thursday as most French forces departed from countries across West Africa. Some 80 French troops will stay in the country to advise and train the Ivorian military, Tene Birahima Ouattara, the Ivorian defense and state minister, said at a news conference with the French minister of the armed forces. 'The world is changing and changing fast,' Ouattara said. 'It's clear that our defense relationship also had to evolve and be based more on future prospects in the face of the realities of threats and those of a world that has become complex in terms of security, and not on a defense relationship inspired by the past. 'France is transforming its presence. France is not disappearing,' he said. Ivory Coast's announcement follows that of other leaders across West Africa, where the French military is being asked to leave. Analysts have described the requests as part of a broader structural transformation in the region's engagement with Paris amid growing local sentiments against France, especially in coup-hit countries. French troops who have long been on the ground have in recent years been kicked out of several West African countries, including Niger, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Chad, considered France's most stable and loyal partner in Africa. France has now been asked to leave more than 70% of African countries where it had a troop presence since ending its colonial rule. The French remain only in Djibouti, with 1,500 soldiers, and Gabon, with 350 troops. After expelling French troops, military leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have moved closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel who have been accused of abuses against civilians. However, the security situation has worsened in those countries, with increasing numbers of extremist attacks and civilian deaths from armed groups and government forces. The French government has been making efforts to revive its waning political and military influence on the continent by devising a new military strategy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ivory-coast-takes-control-of-last-remaining-french-base/7981876.html	2025-02-20T07:10:42-08:00	
Hamas releases bodies of 4 Israeli hostages, including youngest	The bodies of four Israelis held hostage in Gaza returned to Israel on Thursday in the latest release under a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group Hamas. Hundreds of people gathered in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where Hamas handed over four black coffins to the Red Cross, which carried them away in a convoy and delivered them to the Israeli military. An Israeli procession passed through areas where people gathered on the side of the road holding Israeli flags, and the bodies arrived several hours later at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to confirm their identities. Those released Thursday included the youngest captives – infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas – and their mother, Shiri Bibas. They were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video of the abduction showed Shiri Bibas swaddling the boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. The boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023, according to Hamas. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, was also released. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on X that the hearts of the entire nation 'lie in tatters.' 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness,' Herzog said. 'Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday would be 'a day of grief' for his nation. Before transferring the four coffins to the Red Cross, Hamas had them displayed on a stage at the handover site along with flags and banners. One of the banners accused Netanyahu of being a war criminal and said Israeli airstrikes killed the hostages. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said Thursday the remains need to be respected. 'Under international law, any handover of the remains of deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' Türk said in a statement. On Saturday, six living hostages are set to be released in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians detained by Israeli forces in Gaza during the war. Israel and Hamas are in the process of implementing the first phase of a ceasefire that began on January 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the remaining hostages may be released together during the next phase of the truce. 'We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,' senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told the news agency. Hamas is believed to be holding 66 more captives, about half of them living. The group has said it will release the remaining hostages only in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-releases-bodies-of-4-israeli-hostages-including-youngest/7981768.html	2025-02-20T05:31:21-08:00	
North Korea rights groups face collapse amid US funding halt	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The vast majority of human rights groups focused on North Korea face an existential crisis after receiving notices from the U.S. government that their grant funds have been frozen, according to several sources among the predominantly Seoul-based NGOs. The National Endowment for Democracy, or NED, established by Congress to strengthen democratic institutions globally, and the State Department’s Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Bureau, which provide most of the groups’ funding, sent the notices over the last several weeks, according to documents reviewed by VOA. The freeze threatens to devastate an already fragile collection of North Korea human rights groups, potentially wiping out vital sources of advocacy and research on one of the world’s most closed and repressive states, which has a population of 25 million. Hanna Song, executive director of the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights, told VOA her organization, like many others in Seoul, is now in 'survival mode' because of the funding freeze. 'I just really don’t know how many will be able to survive,' said Song, whose organization works directly with North Koreans who have fled the North and has long been a key repository of data on Pyongyang’s abuses. Trump policy shift The funding freeze is part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s broader push to reshape the federal bureaucracy and realign taxpayer spending with his 'America First' agenda, in coordination with billionaire businessman Elon Musk. The NED has been repeatedly attacked by Musk, who has called it a 'scam' and an 'evil organization [that] needs to be dissolved.' In a message sent last week to several North Korea-focused human rights organizations, the NED said it has 'unfortunately been unable to access our previously approved funds' and 'may not be able to provide additional payments to your organization.' 'Once you run out of money, consider your NED grant agreement suspended,' the message added. Meanwhile, a January 24 notice from the State Department bureau ordered organizations receiving grants to immediately stop all work, even if already funded. The bureau has reportedly fired dozens of contractors and is also subject to a Trump executive order suspending foreign aid for 90 days. Although aid could theoretically resume, the pause has already had devastating consequences for many North Korea advocacy groups. Survival mode Song’s Seoul-based center, whose mission includes providing psychosocial support to North Korean defectors, has had to postpone counseling sessions while they look for new funding, Song said. 'It’s just absolutely destroying groups working on North Korea,' said Sokeel Park, South Korea country director at Liberty in North Korea, which helps North Korean defectors escape and resettle. 'It’s by far the biggest crisis facing NGOs working on this issue since the start of the movement in the 1990s,' he said in an interview. Although the group does not receive direct U.S. government funding, Park said other organizations have been forced to reduce salaries, furlough staff, or halt projects midstream. The freeze threatens a broad range of activities, including support for North Koreans who have fled, efforts to transmit information into and out of the country, and raising global awareness of its abuses. The crisis comes at a time when gaining insight into North Korea is more challenging than ever. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, strict border controls have made escapes rare and slowed the flow of information, leaving the outside world with extremely little insight into the reclusive country. This isolation has coincided with a decline in global attention to North Korea more generally, which has made it harder for organizations to diversify their funding sources, activists say. Seoul’s inconsistency While South Korea, a wealthy democracy bordering the North, might seem like a natural alternative source of funds, it has failed to consistently support North Korea-focused NGOs, mainly because the issue is politically sensitive in Seoul. Conservative governments, which take a harder line on the North, often condemn its human rights abuses and provide more backing for civil society groups. In contrast, left-leaning governments tend to focus on improving ties with Pyongyang, favoring humanitarian aid directly to the North Korean government in the hope that better relations will eventually lead to improved human rights. South Korea’s inconsistency on the issue is unfortunate, Lee Jung-hoon, former South Korean ambassador for North Korean human rights under conservative President Park Geun-hye told VOA. 'In fact, we should be the ones providing funding to American NGOs working on North Korea… we should be at the forefront of this,' Lee, now a dean and professor of international relations at Seoul’s Yonsei University, said. After taking office in 2022, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol pledged to improve North Korea’s 'horrendous' human rights situation. However, in December, Yoon unexpectedly declared martial law to combat what he called 'anti-state forces,' leading to his impeachment and possible removal from office. With Yoon’s future uncertain, the left-leaning Democratic Party is seen as the favorite to reclaim the presidency. Such political volatility has made many NGOs hesitant to accept South Korean government funding, fearing it could be easily withdrawn. As a result, many organizations have felt compelled to rely on U.S. government funding – primarily from NED and the State Department. With that money now frozen, many groups are scrambling to fill the gaps by seeking support from European governments and major private donors, Park said. North Korea-focused groups, though, are competing with countless global causes for limited funds. Song said no one wants to be in a position where they’re saying North Korea is a more important issue events in Myanmar or Syria, 'But it’s gotten to the point where it’s just survival mode.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-rights-groups-face-collapse-amid-us-funding-halt/7981751.html	2025-02-20T05:09:06-08:00	
Students lead 'Dark Indonesia' protests against budget cuts	YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia — Thousands of students staged 'Dark Indonesia' protests in cities across the country on Thursday against budget cuts and other policies of President Prabowo Subianto, fearing they will undermine social support systems and their futures. Clad in black, about a thousand placard-carrying students in the major city of Yogyakarta marched through a busy thoroughfare, yelling out demands for change, four months after Prabowo took office following a landslide election win. There were protests in other cities, including the capital Jakarta, and Medan on Sumatra island. 'Dark Indonesia' has gained traction on social media to represent concerns about the cuts. Another popular trend, 'Just Escape First', sees people sharing advice on how to escape to work and live overseas. Herianto, a student leader in Jakarta, said students are protesting cuts in the education sector after Prabowo ordered a cost-cutting drive to free up around $19 billion that can be used to fund his policies, including a school lunch plan. 'Indonesia is dark because there are many policies that aren't clear to our society,' said Herianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. 'The cuts are designed to plug a hole in the free meal program expenses. Education is one of the things that could be impacted. Students are so angry.' Speaking at the protest in Jakarta on Thursday, state secretariat minister Prasetyo Hadi said the government had received the students' demands and would study them. Prabowo's office has said the funding changes would not affect the education sector and teacher welfare, but with ministries cutting back a wide range of spending there are concerns that it could disrupt government services. The students were also demonstrating against the military's move into civilian roles and a lack of subsidized cooking gas. Prabowo remains broadly popular across the sprawling country, with his approval rating near 80% in surveys conducted by independent pollsters, including one last month by research firm Indikator Politik Indonesia. Indikator executive director Burhanuddin Muhtadi told Reuters Prabowo's popularity could dip as the policies were rolled out, when the country's middle class had shrunk. 'If the government does not respond well to this issue, there can be anxiety from the middle class and could lower its popularity,' he said. The demonstrations were the biggest since last August, before Prabowo took office, when the parliament shelved plans to revise election laws after thousands of protesters took to the streets, setting fires and facing down tear gas and water cannon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/students-lead-dark-indonesia-protests-against-budget-cuts/7981720.html	2025-02-20T04:37:18-08:00	
Rwanda says DRC criticism of Arsenal, Bayern and PSG deals threatens regional peace	London — Rwanda on Thursday described recent criticism of its Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain football sponsorship deals by the Democratic Republic of Congo’s foreign minister as a threat to regional peace and stability. Earlier this month, DRC's foreign minister, Therese Kayikwamba Wagner, urged the three prominent European clubs to end their 'blood-stained' sponsorship agreements with 'Visit Rwanda,' questioning the morality of such partnerships while fighting raged in eastern Congo. Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have seized key parts of eastern DR Congo in recent weeks, in what is the gravest escalation in more than a decade of a long-running conflict rooted in the spillover into Congo of Rwanda's 1994 genocide and the struggle for control of Congo's vast mineral resources. 'The Government of Rwanda rejects recent attempts by the Democratic Republic of Congo to undermine Rwanda’s international partnerships through misinformation and political pressure,' Rwanda Development Board, which oversees the deals, said in a statement on Thursday. 'These efforts not only misrepresent the truth but also threaten the foundations of regional peace, stability, and economic cooperation that we have worked tirelessly to build.' Congo's foreign affairs minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on WhatsApp. The fighting in eastern Congo has led to human rights violations including summary executions, the bombing of displacement camps, reports of gang rape and other sexual violence, according to the United Nations. Rwanda says it is defending itself, accusing Congo's military of joining forces with ethnic Hutu-led militias bent on slaughtering Tutsis in Congo and threatening Rwanda, where Hutus targeted Tutsis in a 1994 genocide and some of them later fled to Congo. 'Visit Rwanda' began their sponsorship of Arsenal in 2018, with the latest deal reported to be worth more than $12 million per year. Bayern Munich signed a five-year football development and tourism promotion partnership with Rwanda in 2023, while 'Visit Rwanda' has been a sponsor of PSG since 2019. Reuters previously contacted the three clubs about the sponsorship deals but none replied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-says-drc-criticism-of-arsenal-bayern-and-psg-deals-threatens-regional-peace/7981705.html	2025-02-20T04:23:01-08:00	
Taliban withdraw Afghanistan from International Criminal Court	Islamabad — Afghanistan's radical Taliban leaders on Thursday rejected the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) over their country, declaring as ‘unlawful’ the decision in 2003 by their predecessors to join the Hague-based court’s founding treaty. The decision follows the ICC chief prosecutor’s announcement last month, seeking arrest warrants for the reclusive Taliban supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, and a close associate, accusing them both of being 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' The Taliban militarily regained power in August 2021, succeeding the internationally recognized government in Kabul, which collapsed alongside the withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO troops after nearly two decades in Afghanistan. The Taliban, now governing as the Islamic Emirate, have imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia, placing sweeping restrictions on freedom of speech and women’s access to education and public roles in society. No country has recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government primarily over their harsh treatment of Afghan women and girls. 'As an entity that upholds the religious and national values of the Afghan people within the framework of Islamic Sharia, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan does not recognize any obligation to the Rome Statute or the institution referred to as the ‘International Criminal Court,'' the Taliban stated in an English-language declaration. It accused the ICC of political bias and failing to take any 'substantive measures against the war crimes perpetrated in Afghanistan by occupying forces and their allies.' 'Given that many of the world's major powers are not signatories to this 'court,' it is unwarranted for a nation such as Afghanistan, which has historically endured foreign occupation and colonial subjugation, to be bound by its jurisdiction,' the Taliban asserted. In October 2001, Western forces led by the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, overthrowing the then-Taliban government for sheltering al-Qaida leaders held responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States that occurred in September of that year. In February 2003, the Washington-backed successive government in Kabul formally deposited its instrument of accession to the Rome Statute, which founded the ICC, thereby granting the court jurisdiction over crimes committed within its territory or by Afghan nationals. 'In light of the aforementioned considerations, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan formally asserts that it does not recognize any legal obligation under the Rome Statute and deems the previous administration’s accession to this statute to be devoid of legal validity,' said Thursday’s Taliban statement. Karim Khan, the ICC prosecutor, stated in his January 23 announcement that his decision to seek arrest warrants for Akhundzada and Taliban chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, was based on a thorough investigation and evidence collected into their alleged crimes against humanity. The ICC is mandated to rule on the world’s worst offenses, such as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court has no police force and relies on 125 member states to execute its arrest warrants. Akhundzada seldom leaves his office in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar and rules the country through religious decrees. He has banned girls’ education beyond the sixth grade and prohibited women from most public as well as private sector employment, among other restrictions on their rights. In a speech he delivered in Kandahar last week, the Taliban chief again dismissed criticism of his governance, asserting that it was rooted in divine commands. A government spokesperson quoted Akhundzada as stating that 'every decree he issues is based on consultation with scholars and derived from the Quran and Hadith [sayings of Islam’s prophet] and represents commands of Allah.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-withdraw-afghanistan-from-international-criminal-court/7981683.html	2025-02-20T03:58:54-08:00	
Indian police seize books by Islamic scholar in Kashmir	Srinagar, India — Indian police in disputed Kashmir have raided dozens of bookshops and seized hundreds of copies of books by an Islamic scholar, sparking angry reactions by Muslim leaders. Police said searches were based on 'credible intelligence regarding the clandestine sale and distribution of literature promoting the ideology of a banned organization.' Officers did not name the author but store owners said they had seized literature by the late Abul Ala Maududi, founder of the Islamist political party Jamaat-e-Islami. Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947, and both claim the Himalayan territory in full. Rebel groups, demanding Kashmir's freedom or its merger with Pakistan, have been fighting Indian forces for decades, with tens of thousands killed in the conflict. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government banned the Kashmir branch of Jamaat-e-Islami in 2019 as an 'unlawful association.' New Delhi renewed the ban last year for what it said were 'activities against the security, integrity and sovereignty' of the nation. Plainclothes officers began raids in the main city of Srinagar on Saturday, before launching book seizures in other towns across the Muslim-majority region. 'They (police) came and took away all the copies of books authored by Abul Ala Maududi, saying these books were banned,' a bookshop owner in Srinagar, who asked not to be identified, told AFP. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said it was 'the latest step in a series of measures to crush dissent and to intimidate the local people.' 'They must be given freedom to read the books of their choice,' spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said. Police said the searches were conducted 'to prevent the circulation of banned literature linked to Jamaat-e-Islami.' 'These books were found to be in violation of legal regulations, and strict action is being taken against those found in possession of such material,' police said in a statement. The raids sparked anger among supporters of the party. 'The seized books promote good moral values and responsible citizenship,' said Shamim Ahmed Thokar. Umar Farooq, Kashmir's chief cleric and a prominent leader advocating for the right to self-determination, condemned the police action. 'Cracking down on Islamic literature and seizing them from bookstores is ridiculous,' Farooq said in a statement, pointing out that the literature was available online. 'Policing thought by seizing books is absurd -- to say the least -- in the time of access to all information on virtual highways,' he said. Critics and many residents of Kashmir say civil liberties were drastically curtailed after Modi's government imposed direct rule in 2019 by scrapping Kashmir's constitutionally enshrined partial autonomy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-police-seize-books-by-islamic-scholar-in-kashmir/7981662.html	2025-02-20T03:32:55-08:00	
EU approves $960 million in German aid for Infineon chips plant	BRUSSELS — The European Commission said Thursday it had approved 920 million-euro of German state aid, or $960 million, to Infineon Technologies for the construction of a new semiconductor manufacturing plant in Dresden. The measure will allow Infineon to complete the MEGAFAB-DD project, which will be able to produce a wide range of different types of computer chips, the Commission said. Chipmakers across the globe are pouring billions of dollars into new plants, as they take advantage of generous subsidies from the United States and the EU to keep the West ahead of China in developing cutting-edge semiconductor technology. The European Commission has earmarked 15 billion euros for public and private semiconductor projects by 2030. 'This new manufacturing plant will bring flexible production capacity to the EU and thereby strengthen Europe's security of supply, resilience and technological autonomy in semiconductor technologies, in line with the objectives set out in the European Chips Act,' the Commission said in a statement. The Commission said the plant -- which is slated to reach full capacity in 2031 -- will be a front-end facility, covering wafer processing, testing and separation, adding that its chips will be used in industrial, automotive and consumer applications. The aid will take the form of a direct grant of up to 920 million euros to Infineon to support its overall investment, amounting to 3.5 billion euros. Infineon, Germany’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, which was spun off from Siemens 25 years ago, has said the plant will be the largest single investment in its history. Infineon has agreed with the EU to ensure the project will bring wider positive effects to the EU semiconductor value chain and invest in the research and development of the next generation of chips in Europe, the Commission said. It will also contribute to crisis preparedness by committing to implement priority-rated orders in the case of a supply shortage, in line with the European Chips Act.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-approves-960-million-in-german-aid-for-infineon-chips-plant/7981638.html	2025-02-20T02:49:18-08:00	
China's sprawling rail projects around Asia	TOKYO — Vietnam approved plans on Wednesday for a multibillion-dollar railway with China, boosting links between the two communist countries. Around the region, China has been financing railways under its Belt and Road Initiative, which funds infrastructure projects globally but has come under fire with a number of plans stalled or mired in controversy. Here are some of the key installments in Asia's China-backed railway network: Indonesia: Southeast Asia first Indonesia launched Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in October 2023, after years of delays. The $7 billion China-backed project links the capital Jakarta to the city of Bandung in 45 minutes -- slashing the journey by about two hours. Built by a joint venture of four Indonesian state companies and Beijing's China Railway International Co, it was initially set to cost less than $5 billion and be completed by 2019. But construction challenges and the pandemic led to delays and surging expenses. Indonesia's then-president Joko Widodo nevertheless hailed its opening as a symbol of modernization. Laos: On the move Laos unveiled its $6 billion Chinese-built railroad in 2021, bringing hopes of an economic boost despite backlash after thousands of farmers had to be evicted to make way for construction. The 414-kilometer route connects the Chinese city of Kunming to Laotian capital Vientiane, with plans for the high-speed line to ultimately reach Singapore. Infrastructure-poor Laos, a reclusive communist country of about 7.4 million people, previously had only four kilometers of railway tracks. It was hoped that the railway would boost the Southeast Asian country's ailing tourism industry, which struggled to rebound from the pandemic. But experts also raised concerns over whether cash-strapped Laos -- where public debt made up 116% of GDP in 2023 -- would ever be able to pay back Beijing. Thailand: Full steam ahead After long delays, Thailand is pressing ahead with a Chinese-backed high-speed line set to partially open in 2028. The $5.4 billion project aims to expand the connection to Kunming, running to Bangkok via Laos by 2032. Thailand already has nearly 5,000 kilometers of railway but the sluggish, run-down network has long driven people to favor road travel -- despite extremely high accident rates. When the new railroad is fully complete, Chinese-made trains will run from Bangkok to Nong Khai, on the border with Laos, at up to 250 kph. Unlike Laos, Thailand signed a deal to cover project expenditures itself and has pitched it as a way to boost the economy through trade with China. China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan: Bridge to Europe Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov inaugurated construction in December of a railway linking China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, with hopes it will serve as a supply route to Europe. 'This route will ensure supply of goods from China to Kyrgyzstan and then onto Central Asia' and nearby countries 'including Turkey' and 'even to the European Union,' he said. The project, which Kyrgyz authorities estimate could cost up to $8 billion, includes construction through mountains and in areas of permafrost, where the ground never fully thaws. Vietnam: Link to manufacturing hubs Vietnam this week approved an $8 billion railroad running from its largest northern port city to China. The line will operate through some of Vietnam's key manufacturing hubs, home to Samsung, Foxconn and Pegatron factories, many of which rely on components from China. Another yet-to-be-approved line to China would connect Hanoi to Lang Son province, traveling through more areas packed with manufacturing facilities. Malaysia: Back on track Malaysia has revived construction of a nearly $17 billion railroad to carry passengers and freight between shipping ports on its east and west coasts. The China-backed, 665-kilometer project was originally launched in 2011 under ex-leader Najib Razak but shelved due to a dispute about payments. After blowing past several deadlines and budgets, it now looks set to be operational by 2027. Pakistan, Myanmar, Philippines: Stalled In Pakistan, a railway linking southwestern Gwadar Port with China's northwestern Xinjiang province has long been on the cards but has yet to materialize. If the project moves ahead, a 2023 Chinese study estimated an eyewatering price tag of $58 billion. In coup-hit Myanmar, talks on building a railway from Mandalay to China's Yunnan province appear to have stalled. And in the Philippines, plans for China to fund three railways flopped after Manila backed out of talks in 2023 as the South China Sea dispute heated up.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-sprawling-rail-projects-around-asia/7981628.html	2025-02-20T02:33:29-08:00	
China says it’s 'doing its best' to push for tariff negotiations with EU	BEIJING — China has been 'doing its best' to push for negotiations with the European Union over its tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, a commerce ministry spokesperson said on Thursday, almost four months after the punitive import curbs took effect. The bloc voted to increase the tariffs to as much as 45.3% in October after the European Commission -- which oversees EU trade policy -- launched an anti-subsidy probe into whether Chinese firms benefited from preferential grants and financing as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices. 'China has been doing its best to push for negotiations with the EU,' He Yadong said. 'It is hoped that the EU will take notice of the call from industry and promote bilateral investment cooperation through dialogue and consultation.' China launched its own probes last year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products. He told reporters China's anti-dumping probe into Europe's pork products and anti-subsidy investigation into the 27-strong bloc's dairy trade were still ongoing, when asked how the cases were progressing. 'We will conduct the investigation in an open and transparent manner in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations and World Trade Organization rules,' he added. China's commerce ministry in December decided to extend its anti-dumping investigation into EU brandy imports by three months to April 5.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-s-doing-its-best-to-push-for-tariff-negotiations-with-eu/7981611.html	2025-02-20T01:50:34-08:00	
Crews in Ukraine’s Odesa region work to restore power after Russian attacks	Tens of thousands of people remained without power Thursday in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa as a result of several days of Russian aerial attacks. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that crews were working to restore electricity service, and had brought 40,000 customers back online, with another 49,000 still without power. Russian attacks continued Thursday in multiple parts of Ukraine, including in the central region of Cherkasy where Governor Ihor Taburets said air defenses shot down 14 Russian drones. Taburets said on Telegram there was damage to a business and a power line, but no casualties. Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim reported the military shot down a drone over his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed four Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Russia-occupied Crimea and one over Bryansk. Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-in-ukraine-s-odesa-region-work-to-restore-power-after-russian-attacks/7981587.html	2025-02-20T00:03:52-08:00	
North Korea criticizes US over AUKUS nuclear submarine deal	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean state media on Thursday criticized the United States for a nuclear submarine deal with Australia under the AUKUS partnership signed in 2021, calling it a 'threat to regional peace.' A commentary carried by KCNA said Washington should be wary of consequences for what it said were nuclear alliances, naming AUKUS and the trilateral cooperation with South Korea and Japan. Australia just made its first $500 million payment to the U.S. under the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal. Under AUKUS, Australia will pay the United States $3 billion to boost the capacity of the U.S. submarine industry, and Washington will sell several Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia in the early 2030s. The KCNA commentary also argued the U.S. sees North Korea as an obstacle to its establishment of hegemony in the region and said nuclear states will not sit idly by, referring to itself. North Korea has been criticizing the trilateral military cooperation between South Korea, Japan and the U.S. and has called the relationship 'the Asian version of NATO.' South Korea's defense ministry on Thursday said that a joint air drill was held with the U.S. with at least one B-1B strategic bomber taking part. The drill was to show extended deterrent capabilities by the United States in response to threats from North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the ministry said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-criticizes-us-over-aukus-nuclear-submarine-deal/7981578.html	2025-02-19T23:06:47-08:00

Trump expects visit from Chinese President Xi without giving timeline	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE/ WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expected Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the United States, without giving a timeline for his trip. Trump made the remarks to reporters on Air Force One and said 'it's possible' for the U.S. and China to have a new trade deal. A conversation or interaction between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a potential easing or delay of trade tariffs. 'We'll have, ultimately, President Xi, we will have everybody coming (to the U.S.),' Trump said, while also speaking about other leaders potentially visiting the United States. Xi last travelled to the U.S. in November 2023, in his fifth visit to the country as Chinese president, for a summit with then U.S. President Joe Biden, resulting in agreements to resume military-to-military communications and curb fentanyl production. Trump and Xi had spoken just before Trump took office on January 20 and discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he was talking to China about TikTok as the United States seeks to broker a sale of the popular app owned by Chinese parent firm ByteDance. Trump said last week he had spoken to Xi since taking office as well, but did not offer details on the topics of that conversation. China's foreign ministry did not directly comment on Trump's remarks that day and instead referred reporters to their 'scheduled' call before Trump took office. Washington and Beijing have had tense relations for years over differences ranging from trade and tariffs and cybersecurity, and TikTok, Taiwan, Hong Kong, human rights and the origins of COVID-19. Trump also again told reporters he could make a deal with Russia over the war in Ukraine. 'We can make a deal with Russia to stop the killing,' Trump said, adding he thought the Russians wanted to see the war end. 'I think they have the cards a little bit because they've taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards,' Trump said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-expects-visit-from-chinese-president-xi-without-giving-timeline/7981566.html	2025-02-19T22:42:27-08:00	
Native American activist Leonard Peltier, freed from prison, welcomed on reservation	BELCOURT, NORTH DAKOTA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was defiant toward the government but grateful for his supporters as they welcomed him home to North Dakota on Wednesday, a day after his release from a Florida prison where he had been serving a life sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents. Peltier, 80, grew emotional as he addressed about 500 people who gathered at the festive event that included food, a drum circle and dancers at a center in Belcourt. The small town is just south of the Canadian border on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians' reservation. 'I'm so proud of the showing and support you've given me,' Peltier said. 'I've got a hard time keeping myself from crying. A strong warrior can't be up crying in front of his people.' Before leaving office, former President Joe Biden commuted Peltier's life sentence to home confinement, leading to his release Tuesday from the Coleman penitentiary. Peltier was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences stemming from a 1975 confrontation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed, and while Peltier acknowledged firing shots during the confrontation, he denied being the person whose shots killed the men. Native Americans widely believe he was a political prisoner who was wrongly convicted because he fought for Indigenous rights as a member of the American Indian Movement. For years, many in law enforcement argued against freeing Peltier. Current and former FBI agents disputed his claims of innocence. As Biden considered his options as his term ended, former FBI Director Christopher Wray sent the president a letter in which he called Peltier 'a remorseless killer' who should remain in prison. In a statement about the commutation, Biden said numerous individuals and groups supported releasing Peltier due to the time he spent in prison, his age and his leadership role among Native Americans. For decades, Peltier has maintained he was innocent of the murder charges, and he said Wednesday: 'I spent 49 years straight in prison for something I didn't do.' Peltier said he went into prison a young man and emerged far older at age 80. During all that time, Peltier said he tried to keep Native American issues in the forefront of his activism, and he thanked tribes across the nation for their decades of support. 'From day one, from the first hour I was arrested, Indian people came to my rescue, from all over the country,' Peltier said. Tribal leaders presented Peltier with an eagle feather staff that supporters had carried to Washington and other places as they campaigned for his release, and a traditional star quilt that Peltier draped over his shoulder. Nick Tilsen, an Oglala Lakota and founder of the NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group, paid tribute to Peltier and his generation of American Indian Movement leaders for standing up 'against the most powerful government in the world. And they instilled that pride back into our people. They instilled that fight back into our people.' 'All around the world, Leonard Peltier's name will be remembered as a warrior, as a warrior who outlasted one of the strongest governments in the world, and came out victorious.' Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribal Chair Jamie Azure said the welcome shown by hundreds of people at the event was a testament to what he means to the tribe and other Native Americans. 'What I think you can see from the turnout here today, it means a lot to a lot of people on a lot of different levels to see Mr. Peltier come back to his homeland, to just be home,' Azure said. As tribal member Denise Lajimodiere said, 'It's a big day. A day of celebration.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/native-american-activist-leonard-peltier-freed-from-prison-welcomed-on-reservation-/7981521.html	2025-02-19T22:39:31-08:00	
Rights groups: Iran executed 975 people in 'horrifying' 2024 escalation	PARIS — Iran executed at least 975 people last year in a 'horrifying escalation' of its use of capital punishment, two human rights groups said on Thursday. Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) and French group Together Against the Death Penalty (ECPM) said the figure was the highest since IHR began recording executions in Iran in 2008. The figure 'reveals a horrifying escalation in the use of the death penalty by the Islamic republic in 2024,' they said in a joint report, accusing Iran of using the death penalty as a 'central tool of political oppression.' 'These executions are part of the Islamic republic's war against its own people to maintain its grip on power,' IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said. 'Five people were executed on average every single day in the last three months of the year as the threat of war between Iran and Israel escalated.' Last year's figure represented a 17% increase on the 834 executions recorded in 2023, the report said. Of the 975 people executed, four people were hanged in public and 31 were women, also the highest figure for the past 17 years. Executions over protests Human rights groups, who say that Iran is the world's most prolific executioner after China, accuse the authorities of using the death penalty to sow fear among the public, particularly after nationwide protests broke out in 2022. Capital punishment remains a key pillar of the sharia-based judicial system established after the 1979 revolution ousted the Western-backed shah. Crimes punishable by death include murder, rape and drugs offenses but also more vaguely worded charges like 'corruption on earth' and 'rebellion' which activists say are used against dissidents. In recent years, executions have been carried out by hanging, mostly in prison yards but occasionally in public, though other methods remain on the statute books. Two of last year's executions were in connection with the nationwide protests that erupted in September 2022 after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian-Kurdish woman arrested for an alleged breach of Iran's mandatory dress code. Mohammad Ghobadlu, 23, was executed in January 2024 on charges of killing a police officer with a car during a protest in October 2022. Human rights groups have charged that his trial was deeply flawed, with judges ignoring evidence presented by the defense that he suffered from bipolar disorder. Gholamreza Rasaei, 34, was executed in secret in August on charges of killing a Revolutionary Guard during a 2022 protest. Activists said his confession had been obtained by torture. The rights groups said there was evidence Iran might have carried out more executions last year that they were unable to confirm for their report. They said there were reports of an additional 39 executions in 2024 that they had been unable to corroborate through second sources. Already this year, Iran has carried out at least 121 executions, according to IHR's count.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-groups-iran-executed-975-people-in-horrifying-2024-escalation/7981559.html	2025-02-19T22:31:09-08:00	
Australia, Papua New Guinea vow to strike defense treaty	SYDNEY — Australia said Thursday it will strike a defense treaty with Papua New Guinea, bolstering ties with a Pacific state that has been courted persistently by China. The historically close Pacific nations said in a joint statement they were committed to negotiating the treaty to deepen integration of their forces and make it easier to offer security support. 'This will enable our two defense forces to walk down a pathway of increasing integration and increasing interoperability,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said. 'We live in a world which is increasingly strategically complex,' he told reporters at a press conference with his Papua New Guinea counterpart. 'It is really important that we are working with our closest friends, but in this case, we are working with family and that is very much how we see our relationship with Papua New Guinea.' Few details were given on the future treaty, which would build on an overarching security agreement signed between the two countries in 2023. Papua New Guinea Defense Minister Billy Joseph said the treaty was important 'with the geopolitics and all the different contests that are going on.' 'We have consciously made a decision to choose who should be our friends as far as security is concerned,' he said. Papua New Guinea has many friends but it counts Australia as 'very close,' Joseph said. Perched less than 200 kilometers from Australia's northernmost border, Papua New Guinea is the largest and most populous state in Melanesia. Australia has been signing security deals, dishing out aid funding and ramping up diplomatic visits to cement its influence in the South Pacific, while China renews its efforts to woo island nations in the region. Over the past decade, China has committed billions of dollars to Pacific nations, funding hospitals, sports stadiums, roads and other public works. It is an approach that appears to be paying dividends. Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Nauru have all severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in recent years in favor of China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-papua-new-guinea-vow-to-strike-defense-treaty/7981558.html	2025-02-19T22:25:05-08:00	
Stax Music Academy's teen students mark 25th anniversary, Black History Month with concert	MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE — The Memphis music studio where some of America’s most recognizable songs were recorded decades ago is now a museum. But next door, trumpets blare, drums boom, and singers craft the soulful sounds of Stax Records’ biggest hits. At Stax Music Academy, young musicians rehearse the unmistakable intro to 'Theme from Shaft,' the Isaac Hayes tour de force that won an Oscar in 1972 and tantalizes listeners with its pulsating bass line, crisp hi-hat and funky guitar. There's an air of professionalism among the students as their teacher hands out sheets of music and words of wisdom. 'Here we go. Read the ink that’s on the paper. From the top, one, two, ready and …,' says Sam Franklin IV, the academy's music director. When they finish, Franklin says, 'Hey y’all, that was good.' Under the guidance of Franklin and other instructors, the students are practicing for three concerts in Memphis, Tennessee, on Friday to celebrate Black History Month and the academy's 25th anniversary. Created in 2000, the academy is an after-school program for teens that teaches them to sing, dance and play instruments. Some pay nothing to attend. The academy has graduated more than 4,000 students since it started in the working-class neighborhood of Soulsville, where Stax Records produced soul and R&B classics in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 2008, every high school senior has been accepted to a college or university, many on full scholarships. The academy has performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, the Kennedy Center in Washington, and in Europe and Australia. Students take pride and joy in continuing the legacy of the influential record company, where Otis Redding cut '(Sittin’ On) the Dock of the Bay,' Sam and Dave worked on 'Soul Man,' and The Staple Singers made 'Respect Yourself.' Other mainstays of the Stax catalog include Booker T. and the MGs, Rufus and Carla Thomas, Wilson Pickett and Johnnie Taylor. Before it went bankrupt in 1975, Stax Records helped develop the raw, emotional Memphis Sound, driven by tight horn and rhythm sections, and strong-voiced singers. Some Stax songs were energetic and raucous, others smooth and sexy. Stax Records no longer churns out chart-topping music, although it still has a program for songwriters. The building has been converted into the Stax Museum of American Soul Music. The Stax Music Academy group practicing on a rainy January evening includes both Black and white players. Before the work begins, some students joke around and dance in the hallway outside the rehearsal room, which boasts a high ceiling and a whiteboard with musical notes written on it. In a separate room, vocalists clap for each other as they take turns singing for their instructors. 'It’s so fun,' said Tatiyana Clark, a 17-year-old singer who joined the academy in 2023. 'I’ve been in places where we would have the same interest in music, but nothing is like the connection that I have here. Honestly, it’s a different level of friendship, when you have the exact same feelings towards music, the same experiences — almost.' Stax began online Black History Month presentations in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous programs have included specific themes, with this year's being the U.S. labor movement and how it involved and affected Black people, including work training, entrepreneurship and unionization. But this year's show is a series of in-person concerts at a downtown Memphis venue where attendees will hear Sam and Dave's 'Hold On, I'm Comin'', Arthur Conley's 'Sweet Soul Music,' and 'Cause I Love You,' by the father and daughter duet of Rufus and Carla Thomas. A companion study guide includes lessons and activities highlighting key figures and events that shaped labor policies and standards. 'It’s all about the message for me,' said Johnathan Cole, an 18-year-old singer and songwriter. 'It feels good because with the world going crazy right now, everybody just needs a little bit of love, happiness and music. That’s what Stax Music Academy has always been about: love, music, creativity.' When the labor and civil rights movements were striving for racial equality and social justice, Booker T. and the MGs churned out 'Green Onions' and other toe-tapping instrumental songs, with Black men at organ and drums — Booker T. Jones and Al Jackson Jr. — and white players on lead and bass guitar — Steve Cropper and Donald 'Duck' Dunn. 'I would describe Stax as ‘change,'' said Johnathan McKinnie, a 16-year-old piano and organ player. 'It drastically changed how music was formed … It was definitely an advocate for civil rights.' In the vocalists' rehearsal room, the group is perfecting Eddie Floyd's song about luck and love, 'Knock on Wood.' 'It’s like thunder, and lightning, the way you love me is frightening … better knock, knock, knock on wood,' three vocalists sing in harmony. 'Breathe. You’re not breathing,'' one instructor tells a student, who smiles and nods. The exchange exemplifies the spirit of cooperation and dedication that permeates the academy. Pasley Thompson, a 17-year-old singer and songwriter, calls the academy 'an escape from the every day.' 'Being able to be in a space with people that get you on a creative level, and on a personal level, because we’re around each other all the time, it’s a really great feeling to have,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stax-music-academy-s-teen-students-mark-25th-anniversary-black-history-month-with-concert-/7981556.html	2025-02-19T22:17:54-08:00	
Trump, Vance among speakers at gathering of conservatives	Conservative leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and politicians from Argentina, Britain, Poland and Italy, are among those set to address a three-day meeting of conservatives outside of Washington beginning Thursday. U.S. Vice President JD Vance leads off the Conservative Political Action Conference, with other sessions Thursday set to include discussions of cryptocurrency and Middle East peace, and a panel featuring relatives of hostages being held in Gaza. The CPAC conference helped Trump emerge as a figure in conservative politics and one which he addressed every year during his prior term in office. He used an address last year at the conference to pledge that a victory in the November presidential election would bring 'judgment day' for 'the liars and cheaters and fraudsters and censors and imposters who have commandeered our government.' In addition to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Thursday’s agenda also includes remarks from former British Prime Minister Liz Truss and Balazs Orban, the political director for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Santiago Abascal, head of the far-right Spanish political party Vox is set to address the event Thursday, as is British lawmaker Nigel Farage and former Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Later conference speakers include Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, Argentina’s President Javier Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-vance-among-speakers-at-gathering-of-conservatives/7981546.html	2025-02-19T21:47:27-08:00	
Trump says he has not seen the Egyptian counter to his plan for Gaza	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday evening he has not seen the proposal being discussed by Arab leaders as an alternative to his plan to take over Gaza once the war between Hamas and Israel ends. 'I haven’t seen it,' Trump said in response to a reporter’s question on Air Force One. 'Once I see it, I’ll let you know,' he added. Trump said early this month he wants to forcibly relocate almost 2 million Palestinians from Gaza into neighboring Jordan and Egypt. He said the United States will 'own' the territory and turn it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East,' which prompted rejection by Arab countries. It’s unclear whether Trump is serious or merely threatening to extract concessions from Arab states. During a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that it could be the latter, urging regional leaders to make a counteroffer. Envoys of Egyptian, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will meet Friday in Riyadh to discuss options, including an Egyptian plan to raise up to $20 billion over three years from Arab and Gulf states for Gaza’s reconstruction. Under this plan, Gazans would not be forced out and the strip would be governed by Palestinians. Saudi connection Trump spoke en route to Washington after delivering remarks at a conference in Miami, hosted by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, the nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund – the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund led by the crown prince. His speech marked the first time a U.S. president addressed the annual gathering of global financiers and tech executives. It is a testament to how the Saudi crown prince, known by his initials MBS, has leveraged his connection to Trump, Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, said. The prince established close ties during Trump’s first term and continued business ties with the Trump organization while the president was out of office, including investing $2 billion to a firm belonging to Trump’s son-in-law and former aide, Jared Kushner. 'Trump believes in the Golden Rule, but not the Golden Rule from Sunday school,' Blumenfeld told VOA. 'It's if you're rich, you're right.' As Riyadh leads the charge to unify Arab nations to support postwar Gaza, there may be signs that Trump is softening his demand. In his remarks, Trump did not mention Gaza beyond repeating what he said was his role on the ceasefire signed January 19, during the last day then-President Joe Biden was in office. 'We've secured a ceasefire in Gaza, and we're bringing in the hostages, and we're bringing them home to their families,' Trump said, adding that some of the hostages 'are in pretty bad shape.' He lauded Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi wealth fund, and Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Jadaan. The White House did not immediately respond to VOA’s query on whether Trump met with any of the Saudi delegation during the event. During his Wednesday remarks Trump thanked the Saudi crown prince for hosting talks between U.S. and Russian officials Wednesday to find a way to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies have decried the meeting as an effort to sideline Kyiv. Egyptian proposal on Gaza Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said under the proposal, 'secure areas' equipped with mobile houses and shelters will be established as living areas in Gaza while Egyptian and international construction firms rebuild the devastated infrastructure. The proposal also calls for forming a national Palestinian committee of technocrats and community leaders unaffiliated with Hamas to govern postwar Gaza. It is unclear whether the plan has the support of the Palestinian Authority, the internationally recognized body that currently rules parts of the West Bank and administered Gaza until it lost the 2006 election to Hamas. 'What is needed now is a political solution to Gaza to make that reconstruction both physically possible and long term sustainable,' said Tariq Kenney-Shawa, U.S. Policy Fellow at the Palestinian Policy Network Al-Shabaka. The goal is that 'we don't return to a situation where Gaza remains under occupation,' he told VOA. On Monday Hamas indicated a willingness to cede any postwar governance role. 'It is not necessary for Hamas to be part of the political and administrative arrangements in the next phase for Gaza, especially if it serves the interests of our people,' Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasim told Al Arabiya TV. Hamas made the conciliatory statement as negotiations toward phase two of the ceasefire is set to begin in days, after weeks of delay. However, it fulfils only part of Israel’s and the United States’ key demand – the elimination of governance and military role for Hamas in postwar Gaza. So far Hamas has not shown it would disarm. Meanwhile Israel has not defined what it considers an acceptable alternative governing entity to Hamas and has rejected any involvement of the Palestinian Authority. The Egyptian proposal also does not solve a longstanding issue between the warring parties. Israeli leaders oppose any postwar plans that would pave the way to a two-state solution, while a sovereign Palestine remains a key requirement for Palestinians and Arab countries. Expedited hostage release A top Hamas official announced earlier this week that the group will return the remains of four deceased Israeli hostages and free six living ones in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including 47 senior Hamas members. Israel will also allow mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza. The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under phase one of the ceasefire that called for the gradual release of 33 hostages, eight of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas took about 250 hostages and killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel. Analysts said the expedited exchange of hostages and prisoners could mean that both parties are anxious to secure what they can now, due to concerns the truce will collapse before phase one expires next week. 'What we're looking at now is possibly – possibly a swifter resolution to phase two,' said Mirette Mabrouk, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'But if that happens, then that sort of signals near the end of the conflict,' she told VOA. 'And that's something that [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he's not going to want without Hamas being disarmed.' Hamas is believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. It insists it will only release them in exchange for a permanent end to fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Israel's counteroffensive to the Hamas attack has displaced more than 2 million Palestinians and killed more than 48,200, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-he-has-not-seen-the-egyptian-counter-to-his-plan-for-gaza/7981543.html	2025-02-19T21:23:41-08:00	
Vietnam parliament approves $8 billion railway with loan from China	WASHINGTON — The Vietnam National Assembly on Wednesday gave a near-unanimous approval to a railway bill that allows the country to utilize Chinese loans for the construction of a new $8.3 billion link aimed at improving transport connections between the two neighboring countries. The country's rubber-stamp parliament gave the go-ahead to the project, with 455 of the 459 members voting for the project. The approval marks a significant step forward in Vietnam’s infrastructure modernization efforts, as the country seeks to boost connectivity and economic growth, local media reported. The 427-kilometer railway project will run from the Vietnam-China border gate at Lao Cai-Hekou, through the capital of Hanoi and port city of Haiphong, to Ha Long City, the official Vietnam News Agency reported. It is one of two railway lines to China that Vietnam plans as part of its 'Two Corridors, One Belt' initiative, which connects to Beijing's Belt and Road global infrastructure program. Phase 1 of the project will build a single-track standard gauge rail with a designed speed of 160 kph. Phase 2 will upgrade it to a double-track line able to support a speed of 200 kph. The government has proposed paying for the project with money from the state budget, domestic capital sources and loans, including from the Chinese government. The Vietnam News Agency reported that the railway will be financed through a concessional loan provided by the Chinese government. Funding will also be sourced from the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), the news agency said. Neither Vietnam nor China disclosed the amount of the loan. 'Investing in a new railway line ensures meeting transportation needs, restructuring the transportation market shares, reducing logistics costs and ensuring sustainable development,' Le Quang Tung, general secretary of Vietnam’s 15th legislature, told Vietnam Television (VTV). Minister of Construction Nguyen Hong Minh, formerly the transport minister, highlighted the necessity of the project during a parliamentary session last week. He emphasized that Vietnam’s current railway system is outdated and insufficient for the nation’s needs. The government hopes the new railway will stimulate economic development by improving transportation efficiency between major cities and regions. Tran Thanh Canh, a poet and resident in Hanoi, told VOA by phone that he welcomed the Vietnamese National Assembly's approval of the railway project. 'This project should have been done a long time ago, to connect the western part of China via the shortest route to the sea at Hai Phong port. It brings many economic benefits to both Vietnam and China,' he said. 'This is a very necessary project and suitable for the economic development of both countries.' The plan to build these major railway lines is part of Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative and was agreed upon during meetings between Vietnamese General Secretary To Lam and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in late August 2024, as well as between Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Chinese Prime Minister Li Cuong in Hanoi in mid-October 2024. 'The project comes with both advantages and disadvantages for Vietnam as the borrower, but the disadvantages are predominant,' Nguyen Minh Le, a longtime expert in China-Vietnam relations in California, told VOA by phone. Nguyen said Xi has recently narrowed down the scope of the BRI and just focused on neighboring countries like Vietnam. 'Vietnam has actively become engaged in China’s BRI projects and receiving funding. It should stay cautious about sovereignty and autonomy because of Chinese debt-trap diplomacy,' Nguyen added. The new rail line will run through some of Vietnam’s key manufacturing hubs, home to Samsung, Foxconn, Pegatron and other global giants, many of whom rely on a regular flow of components from China, Agence France-Presse reported. 'Railway infrastructure projects are hugely expensive, incur numerous land rights and environmental issues and nearly always run over budget and deadline. Even if these projects are approved, it will be many years before passengers jump on board,' Gary Bowerman, director of Check-in Asia, a travel and hospitality research company, told VOA by email. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Wednesday said that since last year, China and Vietnam have exchanged views on multiple occasions on enhancing railway connectivity between the two countries. 'The two sides agreed to accelerate the feasibility study of the Lao Cai-Hanoi-Hai Phong standard-gauge railway, speed up the plan compilation of the Dong Dang-Hanoi standard-gauge railway and the Mong Cai-Ha Long-Hai Phong standard-gauge railway, and advance the work of building a standard-gauge railway connection point between Hekou and Lao Cai,' Guo said during a news conference in Beijing. Vietnam's Ministry of Transport has indicated that more details on the bidding process and project timeline will be released in the coming months. The project is expected to take approximately six years to complete following its approval and the finalization of the loan agreement, according to the Vietnam Railway Authority.

Thousands without power, heat in Odesa	Thousands of residents in Ukraine's city of Odesa were without electricity or heating after Russia launched a massive drone attack for the second night in a row. In his address to the nation on Wednesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said repair work was underway after 80,000 people lost power and the same number lost heating. Governor Oleh Kiper, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said drone strikes damaged an administration building and triggered a fire at a restaurant and a storage facility. One person was injured. During the Tuesday attack, four people were injured, including a child. Officials said 500 apartment buildings, 13 schools, a kindergarten, and several hospitals lost heating. In Ukraine's northeastern city of Kupiansk, one person was killed Wednesday by a Russian guided bomb, Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Two others were injured in an attack on a village south of the city. Guided bombs also hit an apartment building in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, the head of the city's military administration posted on Telegram. Three people, including 13-year-old twins, were injured. One man was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's border region of Belgorod, the regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Wednesday.

Migrants in Panama deported from US moved to Darien jungle region	PANAMA CITY — A group of migrants deported from the U.S. to Panama last week were moved on Tuesday night from a hotel in the capital to the Darien jungle region in the south of the country, a lawyer representing a migrant family told Reuters on Wednesday. Susana Sabalza, a Panamanian migration lawyer, said the family she represents was transferred to Meteti, a town in the Darien, along with other deported migrants. La Estrella de Panama, a local daily, reported on Wednesday that 170 of the 299 migrants who had been in the hotel were moved to the Darien. Panama's government did not respond to a request for comment. The 299 migrants have been staying at a hotel in Panama City under the protection of local authorities and with the financial support of the United States through the U.N.-related International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency, according to the Panamanian government. The migrants include people from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, according to Panama's president, Jose Raul Mulino, who has agreed with the U.S. to receive non-Panamanian deportees. The deportation of non-Panamanian migrants to Panama is part of the Trump administration's attempt to ramp up deportations of migrants living in the U.S. illegally. One of the challenges to Trump's plan is that some migrants come from countries that refuse to accept U.S. deportation flights, due to strained diplomatic relations or other reasons. The arrangement with Panama allows the U.S. to deport these nationalities and makes it Panama's responsibility to organize their onward repatriation. The process has been criticized by human rights groups that worry migrants could be mistreated and also fear for their safety if they are ultimately returned to violent or war-torn countries of origin, such as Afghanistan. Sabalza said she had not been able to see her clients while they were held at the hotel in Panama City and said she is seeking permission to visit them at their new location. She declined to identify their nationality, but said they were a Muslim family who 'could be decapitated' if they returned home. Sabalza said the family would be requesting asylum in Panama or 'any country that will receive them other than their own.' Mulino said previously the migrants would be moved to a shelter in the Darien region, which includes the dense and lawless jungle separating Central America from South America that has in recent years become a corridor for hundreds of thousands of migrants aiming to reach the United States. Panama's security minister said on Tuesday that more than half of the migrants deported from the United States in recent days had accepted voluntary repatriations to their home countries. On Wednesday morning the hotel in Panama City where the migrants had been held appeared quiet, according to a Reuters witness. On Tuesday some migrants had been seen holding hands and looking out a window of the hotel to get the attention of reporters outside. Migrants in the hotel were not allowed to leave, according to media reports. On Wednesday, Panama's migration service said in a statement that a Chinese national, Zheng Lijuan, had escaped from the hotel. It asked that she return and accused unspecified people outside the hotel of aiding her escape.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-in-panama-deported-from-us-moved-to-darien-jungle-region/7981522.html	2025-02-19T19:25:55-08:00	
Israel prepares for ‘very difficult day’; bodies of youngest hostages to be returned	Hamas is scheduled to turn over the bodies of four slain hostages Thursday, including those of the youngest captives – infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas. Both were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video footage of the abduction showed their mother, Shiri Bibas, swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. The boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023, according to Hamas. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya announced the return of the Bibas family earlier this week. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, will also be released. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday would be a day of grieving for his nation. 'Tomorrow will be a very difficult day for the State of Israel. A wrenching day, a day of grief. We are bringing home four of our beloved hostages, deceased. We embrace the families, and the heart of the entire nation is torn. My own heart is torn. So is yours. And all of the world's heart should be torn, because this demonstrates who we are dealing with, what we are dealing with — with such monsters,' Netanyahu said. 'We are grieving, we are in pain, but we are also determined to ensure that such a thing never happens again.' Israel Defense Forces will hold a ceremony for the hostages immediately after their bodies are transferred from the Red Cross. They will be moved to coffins covered by the Israeli flag. Soldiers will salute, a rabbi will read from Psalms, and the coffins will be carried to military vehicles. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum invited the public to hold Israeli flags and stand along the military convoy’s route to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir, Tel-Aviv, where the bodies will undergo an identification process. On Saturday, six living hostages are set to be released in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians detained by Israeli forces in Gaza during the war. Israel and Hamas are in the process of implementing the first phase of a ceasefire that began Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the remaining hostages may be released together during the next phase of the truce. 'We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,' senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told the news agency. He did not clarify how many hostages were currently being held in Gaza. Hamas is believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. So far during the ceasefire, Hamas has released 24 hostages, and Israel has freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-prepares-for-very-difficult-day-bodies-of-youngest-hostages-to-be-returned/7981519.html	2025-02-19T19:24:50-08:00	
Senate Republicans to push ahead with border bill despite Trump opposition	WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans will push ahead on Thursday with a measure to kickstart President Donald Trump's agenda on immigration, energy and defense, Majority Leader John Thune said on Wednesday, after Trump called on them to drop the plan in favor of a sweeping resolution prepared by House Republicans. Trump came down firmly in favor of the House of Representatives' plan for one sweeping bill that would also include trillions of dollars in tax cuts. House Republicans fear that the Senate's 'skinny' plan could diminish their chances of extending Trump's tax cuts later in their own chamber, where the party holds a narrow and fractious 218-215 majority. 'We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to 'kickstart' the Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept of, 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL',' the president wrote on social media on Wednesday morning. After a lunch meeting with Vice President JD Vance and his own Senate Republicans, Thune told reporters that he would still go ahead with the smaller bill. 'In the end, we'll be able to, whether it's one bill or two bills, to get all the things that the president's outlined -- his objectives -- across the finish line,' said Thune, adding that he expected the Senate to vote on its own blueprint on Thursday. Some Republicans said they were confused about the plan to proceed after Trump's message. 'It seems a little strange to me,' Senator Josh Hawley said. 'If the president supports it and ... I have some assurance of that, I’ll support it,' the Missouri Republican added. 'But it just seems a little bizarre to me. I can't quite figure out what we're doing.' Meanwhile, Democrats promised a long, drawn-out fight. 'Senate Democrats will expose Republicans' reconciliation budget bill exactly for what it is: a sinister front for clearing the way to cut taxes for Donald Trump's billionaire buddies,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said. The Senate measure, a $340 billion fiscal 2025 budget resolution, would boost spending by $85 billion a year for four years to fund tighter border security, Trump's deportation of immigrants in the country illegally, energy deregulation and an increase in military spending. Republicans say the plan would offset the higher spending with funding cuts in other areas. The House budget resolution includes those same priorities along with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, while seeking to cover the cost through $2 trillion in spending cuts and accelerated economic growth based mainly on the tax and energy policy changes it would usher in. 'FULL agenda' Both chambers of Congress need to pass the same budget resolution to unlock the parliamentary tool that would enable Republicans to enact Trump's legislative agenda in a way that circumvents Democratic opposition and the Senate filibuster. Republican lawmakers in recent weeks have backed away from concerns that extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts could add to the nation's fast-growing $36 trillion in debt. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that Trump's full tax cut agenda could cost more than $5 trillion over the next decade. House Republicans welcomed Trump's intervention as they try to forge unity for a floor vote on their own budget blueprint expected next week. '@realDonaldTrump is right! House Republicans are working to deliver President Trump’s FULL agenda - not just a small part of it. Let’s get it done, @HouseGOP!' tweeted House Speaker Mike Johnson, Thune's Republican counterpart. The difference between the House and Senate strategies comes down to Trump's proposed tax cuts. House Republicans fear the two-step Senate approach could lead to a stalled standalone tax cut bill if lawmakers cannot agree on offsetting cuts in spending. Senate Republicans worry that the rush for all-encompassing legislation may not provide enough time to adequately handle the intricacies of the tax component. Senate Republicans began moving forward with their own budget resolution last week in response to what they described as a plea for border and immigration funding from Trump 'border czar' Tom Homan and White House budget director Russ Vought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-republicans-to-push-ahead-with-border-bill-despite-trump-opposition/7981515.html	2025-02-19T19:05:43-08:00	
Trump's comments on Ukraine draw mixed reaction from US lawmakers	U.S. President Donald Trump's comments this week claiming Ukraine was responsible for starting the three-year conflict with Russia and calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'a dictator without elections' drew criticism from congressional Democrats and pushback from some members of the Republican Party. 'Clearly, Vladimir Putin is responsible for this war,' Republican Senator Thom Tillis told reporters. 'His decision has resulted in the murder, rape, torture and kidnapping of untold numbers of Ukrainians. He owns responsibility for this war. I don't know how more plainly it can be stated.' Republican Senator John Kennedy told reporters he believes Russia started the war. 'I also believe, through bitter experience, that Vladimir Putin is a gangster. He's a gangster with a black heart,' he added. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune declined to criticize Trump when speaking to reporters Wednesday. 'The president speaks for himself,' Thune said. 'What I want to see is a peaceful result, a peaceful outcome. And I think right now, there's a negotiation going on, and let's see where that ultimately leads.' Republican Senator Josh Hawley said Trump has blamed Russia 'as well, and threatened to sanction Russia if they didn't come to the negotiating table.' The conflict between Trump and Zelenskyy comes as U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday to meet with Zelenskyy. Ukraine was not included in peace talks that began this week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between the United States and Russia. Trump brushed off Ukraine's complaints at not being included in negotiations, saying Tuesday, 'You never should have started it.' Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, claiming eastern parts of the country needed to be liberated. U.S. officials say nearly half a million Ukrainian civilians have died in the war and at least 124,000 Ukrainian soldiers. After Trump's comment, seeming to blame the Ukrainian leader for starting the war, Zelenskyy responded on social media that Trump lives in a 'disinformation space' influenced by Russia. Trump responded to Zelenskyy on Truth Social on Wednesday: 'Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn't be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle. A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.' Hawley told reporters Wednesday that he supported Trump's calls for an election in Ukraine. 'The suspension of elections in Ukraine is a bad deal,' Hawley said. 'Zelenskyy should hold elections. He's the elected leader of the country. Our president is right — they haven't had elections in a long time, and they are basically under martial law. That's not good when you claim to be defending democracy. You need to practice it.' But Democrats said Trump's comments endanger America's standing on the global stage. 'This is outrageous. It's outrageous if not humorous that the president does these sorts of things, goes off on wild tangents and says things that are clearly false,' Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin told reporters. Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin said Wednesday, 'It is what we all feared, which is he understands incorrectly what's happening in the span of history and is blaming the head of a country that has been invaded by an autocratic regime; a democracy was invaded. 'And however you want to solve it, however you want to negotiate, is one thing,' Slotkin said. 'But he put down his cards.'

First Egyptian pharaoh's tomb discovered since King Tut’s	Archaeologists in Egypt say they have unearthed the ancient tomb of King Thutmose II, the first discovery in 100 years of a tomb of an Egyptian royal. The discovery near Luxor is the first of a pharaonic royal tomb since the treasures of Tutankhamun’s tomb were found over a century ago in 1922, Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said Tuesday. Thutmose’s tomb was found west of the Valley of the Kings, one of the world’s most important archaeological sites and home to the burial sites of many ancient Egyptian royals and nobles, including Tutankhamun, also known as King Tut. Thutmose, an ancestor of Tutankhamun, lived nearly 3,500 years ago. His wife, Queen Hatshepsut, was one of the few women known to have ruled Egypt. Her mortuary temple is on the west bank of the Nile at Luxor, not far from where her husband’s tomb was found. Thutmose was a king of ancient Egypt’s 18th dynasty. His tomb was the last undiscovered tomb of that group. An archaeology team found the entrance to Thutmose’s tomb in October 2022, according to the online magazine Archaeology News, but they thought it was likely the burial site of a queen. As they dug deeper, they found inscriptions referring to Thutmose II as the 'deceased king' and Hatshepsut. The tomb flooded soon after the king’s burial, damaging most of its contents, but some funerary furniture was recovered. Egypt’s antiquities ministry said Tuesday the discovery of the tomb is 'one of the most significant archaeological breakthroughs in recent years.' Professor Mohamed Abdel-Badel, who heads Egypt’s Antiquities Sector, told Archaeology News that the team 'recovered and restored fallen plaster fragments' that had blue inscriptions on them, including from the Book of the Amduat, which the website described as 'a key funerary text used in royal burials.' Thutmose’s tomb can now be listed among the wonders of ancient Egypt that draw hordes of tourists to the country. Last year, Egypt hosted 15.7 million tourists and aims to attract 18 million visitors in 2025, according to Agence France-Presse. Egypt may reach that goal with the long-awaited opening this year of the Grand Egyptian Museum at the foot of the legendary pyramids in Giza. Some information for this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-egyptian-pharaoh-s-tomb-discovered-since-king-tut-s/7981486.html	2025-02-19T18:08:52-08:00	
US figures do not support Trump claims on Ukraine spending	President Donald Trump on Wednesday repeated a claim that the United States has spent $350 billion on Ukraine’s war — a figure that far eclipses the amount recorded by the Department of Defense and the interagency oversight group that tracks U.S. appropriations to Ukraine. Since Russia’s illegal invasion in February 2022, the U.S. Congress has appropriated about $183 billion for Ukraine, according to the interagency oversight group that is charged with presenting reports to Congress. Of that, the Pentagon confirmed to VOA that the U.S. has sent $65.9 billion in military aid to Ukraine, and an additional $3.9 billion that Congress has authorized in military aid to Kyiv remains unspent. About $58 billion of the $183 billion in total aid for Ukraine was spent in the U.S., going directly toward boosting the U.S. defense industry, either by replacing old U.S. weapons given to Kyiv with new American-made weapons, by procuring new U.S.-made weapons for Kyiv or by making direct industrial investments. VOA asked the White House to clarify Trump’s comments, specifically seeking any documentation for the mathematical discrepancy. The White House replied by referring VOA back to the president’s comments. In a post Wednesday on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said, 'Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle.' Zelenskyy on Wednesday told Ukrainian reporters the total cost of the war since February 2022 was about $320 billion. 'One hundred and twenty billion of that comes from us, the people of Ukraine, the taxpayers, and $200 billion from the United States and the European Union,' Zelensky said. 'This is the cost of weapons. This is the weapons package — $320 billion.' Trump, who has mentioned the $350 billion figure several times, also said in his Wednesday social media post: 'The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe’s money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back.' The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a Germany-based nonprofit that tracks military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine, says European nations —specifically the EU, United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland — have allocated about $140 billion in total in aid for Ukraine, while the United States has allocated about $120 billion in total aid. Total aid includes military, humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine. The U.S. has provided about $2 billion more than Europe in military aid for Ukraine, but 'European donors have been the main source of [total] aid to Ukraine since 2022, especially when it comes to financial and humanitarian aid,' the institute said in its latest report last week. The aid to Ukraine constitutes a very small amount of GDP for several nations. For example, the U.S., Germany and the U.K. have mobilized less than 0.2% of their GDP per year to support Kyiv, while contributions from France, Italy and Spain to Ukraine have amounted to about 0.1% of their annual GDP. U.S. government math is complex, and spending is massive in scale. A live tracker of U.S. government spending says that the U.S. government has spent about $2.4 trillion in the early part of the 2025 fiscal year. The previous year’s spending was $6.75 trillion. Still, scholars were quick to dismiss the accuracy of Trump’s numbers. 'This figure is not true,' said Liana Fix, fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'It's possible to track how much the United States has spent for Ukraine.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-figures-do-not-support-trump-claims-on-ukraine-spending/7981441.html	2025-02-19T16:49:09-08:00

Pentagon chief eyes funding cuts to some parts of military by 8%	WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has asked some parts of the military to propose what could be cut as part of a potential 8% spending reduction for them over each of the next five years, U.S. officials said on Wednesday, although it was unclear if the total defense budget would shrink. In a memo described to Reuters by U.S. officials, Hegseth called for the proposals by Feb. 24. Officials said it did not appear that Hegseth wanted a major budget cut but was looking to reprioritize funding to better align with President Donald Trump's national security priorities. There was a long list of exemptions, including U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, funding for the military's mission along the U.S. border with Mexico, as well as missile defense and autonomous weapons, one of the officials said. The military's commands that oversee operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were not exempt. The Pentagon's budget is approaching $1 trillion per year. In December, former President Joe Biden signed a bill authorizing $895 billion in defense spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. Hegseth has said publicly that the Pentagon's focus is on U.S. border security and threats posed by China. He has said the U.S. can no longer be 'primarily focused on the security of Europe.' Pentagon employees have braced for firings after businessman Elon Musk's government downsizing teams started working out of the Pentagon. Some civilian employees in the military said they had started receiving emails on Thursday saying they could be separated from the government since they were hired less than a year ago. Leaders from across the political spectrum have long criticized waste and inefficiency at the Defense Department. But Democrats and civil service unions have said Musk, the world's richest person, lacks the expertise to restructure the Pentagon, and the efforts of his team risk exposing classified programs. Attempting to cancel defense programs could trigger pushback from lawmakers to defend spending in their electoral districts, a fact defense contractors are well aware of. The F-35, for example, has suppliers located in all 50 U.S. states, a point Lockheed makes with a map on its website detailing the economic value derived from production of the fighter jets. Musk, himself a major U.S. defense contractor, has a particular disdain for certain defense projects, especially the F-35. He has posted on X that 'Some U.S. weapons systems are good, albeit overpriced, but please, in the name of all that is holy, let us stop the worst military value for money in history that is the F-35 program!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-eyes-funding-cuts-to-some-parts-of-military-by-8-/7981185.html	2025-02-19T15:53:46-08:00

After decades in exile, Syria's Jews visit Damascus	DAMASCUS, Syria — For the first time in three decades, Rabbi Joseph Hamra and his son Henry read from a Torah scroll in a synagogue in the heart of Syria's capital Damascus, carefully passing their thumbs over the handwritten text as if still in awe they were back home. The father and son fled Syria in the 1990s, after then-Syrian president Hafez al-Assad lifted a travel ban on the country's historic Jewish community, which had faced decades of restrictions including on owning property or holding jobs. Virtually all of the few thousand Jews in Syria promptly left, leaving less than 10 in the Syrian capital. Joseph Hamra and Henry, who was just a child at the time, settled in New York. 'Weren't we in a prison? So we wanted to see what was on the outside,' said Joseph Hamra, now 77, on his reasons for leaving at the time. 'Everyone else who left with us is dead.' But when Assad's son and successor as president, Bashar al-Assad, was toppled in December, the Hamra family began planning a once-unimaginable visit to Damascus with the help of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based advocacy group. They met with Syria's deputy foreign minister at the ministry, now managed by caretaker authorities installed by the Islamist rebels who ousted Assad after more than 50 years of family rule that saw itself as a bastion of secular Arab nationalism. The new authorities have said all of Syria's communities will play a role in their country's future. But incidents of religious intolerance and reports of conservative Islamists proselytizing in public have kept more secular-minded Syrians and members of minority communities on edge. Henry Hamra, now aged 48, said Syria's foreign ministry had now pledged to protect Jewish heritage. 'We need the government's help, we need the government's security and it's going to happen,' he said. Walking through the narrow passages of the Old City, a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site, Henry and Joseph ran into their onetime neighbors — Palestinian Syrians — and later marveled at hand-painted Hebrew lettering at several synagogues. 'I want to see my kids come back and see this beautiful synagogue. It's a work of art,' said Henry Hamra. But some things were missing, he said, including a golden-lettered Torah from one of the synagogues that was now stored in a library in Israel, to where thousands of Syrian Jews fled throughout the 20th century. While the synagogues and Jewish school in the Old City remained relatively well-preserved, Syria's largest synagogue in Jobar, an eastern suburb of Damascus, was reduced to rubble during the nearly 14-year civil war that erupted after Assad's violent suppression of protests against him. Jobar was home to a large Jewish community for hundreds of years until the 1800s and the synagogue, built in honor of the biblical prophet Elijah, was looted before it was destroyed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-decades-in-exile-syria-jews-visit-damascus/7981169.html	2025-02-19T15:21:43-08:00

VOA Mandarin: What do Canadians think about the threat of US tariffs?	While the U.S. is holding off on imposing 25% tariffs on Canada, a new poll shows Canadians are angered by U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs against Canada and his comments about making their nation the 51st U.S. state.

US Army Corps seeks to fast-track 600 'emergency' projects through environmental review	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has identified over 600 energy and other infrastructure projects that could be fast-tracked under President Donald Trump's National Energy Emergency declaration, according to data posted on its website. Among the projects on the list were Enbridge's Line 5 oil pipeline under Lake Michigan, several natural gas power plants, and liquefied natural gas export terminals proposed by Cheniere and Venture Global. The Army Corps posted the list, without sending a public notice, last week, marking the projects as eligible for emergency permitting treatment. Trump had ordered the Army Corps to issue permits enabling the filling of wetlands and dredging or building in waterways as part of the 'National Energy Emergency' he declared in a day-one executive order. The Army Corps was not immediately available for comment. The fast-tracking of these projects could trigger legal fights over many of the permits that will be issued, with environmental groups warning they are flouting federal laws. 'This end-run around the normal environmental review process is not only harmful for our waters but is illegal under the Corps’ own emergency permitting regulations,' said David Bookbinder, director of Law and Policy at The Environmental Integrity Project. Courts may be unwilling to weigh in on the president's criteria for what constitutes a national energy emergency but will more likely weigh how individual projects adhere to the language of the executive order, he said. Companies with projects awaiting key permits applauded the move to 'streamline' the review process. 'Line 5 is critical energy infrastructure,' said Enbridge spokesperson Gina Sutherland, saying the company has been awaiting a permit for building a Great Lakes Tunnel under Lake Michigan for nearly five years. 'We are very encouraged to see this action to expedite review for responsible critical mineral development projects,' said Jon Cherry, CEO of Perpetua Resources, which is developing a U.S. antimony and gold mine in Idaho with financial support from the Pentagon and U.S. Export-Import Bank. The Biden administration had issued the mine a permit, but it still needs a wetlands permit, which Cherry said he expects to receive by July. The Army Corps has in the past issued emergency designations to skip over environmental reviews in cases in which the project addressed poses a threat to human life. Environmental and watchdog groups say that most of the projects marked as emergencies on the list do not meet the Army Corps' definition of an emergency. They also question the Trump administration's justification for declaring a national energy emergency. 'It is laughable to see Line 5 on this list,' said Debbie Chizewer, managing attorney for the Midwestern office of Earthjustice, which represents the Bay Mills Indian Community in opposition of the project. 'It's a pipeline that carries crude oil from Canada to Canada and will not increase U.S. capacity or respond to Trump's declared energy emergency.' Other projects do not relate to energy production, including a home-building project built on land owned by oil giant Chevron in California, as well as an aerial electrical distribution line to private waterfront residences in Alabama. There are at least five dozen solar energy projects on the list. Solar and wind energy were excluded from the definition of energy in Trump's energy emergency order. West Virginia has the largest number of projects on the list at 141. There are 60 in Pennsylvania, 57 in Texas, 42 in Florida, and 41 in Ohio, according to the Environmental Integrity Project, which is tracking the permits. Officials at Venture Global and Cheniere were not immediately available to comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-army-corps-seeks-to-fast-track-600-emergency-projects-through-environmental-review/7981113.html	2025-02-19T14:13:48-08:00

US judge delays ruling on federal request to drop case against New York City mayor	NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams told a federal judge Wednesday that he is innocent and doesn't fear corruption charges could be refiled if a Justice Department request to dismiss them is granted. Judge Dale E. Ho ended the hearing by saying he wouldn't rule immediately but he was aware that 'it's not in anyone's interest here for this to drag on.' During the hearing, Ho asked the mayor questions to ensure he understood that if the charges were dropped, they could later be reinstated. 'I have not committed a crime,' Adams said. 'I'm not afraid of that.' Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove said the request to drop the corruption charges against the mayor resulted from 'a straightforward exercise in prosecutorial discretion guided' by President Donald Trump's executive order on weaponization of the justice system and Attorney General Pam Bondi's memorandum outlining the same. Bove said he believed the request to drop charges, when tied to Trump's order and Bondi's conclusions, made it 'virtually unreviewable in this courtroom.' Bove said he also believed 'the continuation of this prosecution is interfering with both national security and immigration enforcement initiatives being carried out by the executive branch.' Ho scheduled the hearing after three Trump administration lawyers, including Bove, made the dismissal request on Friday. Manhattan's top federal prosecutor resigned after she refused an order to do so. An indictment charges the first-term Democrat with accepting more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy Adams' influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. Adams has pleaded not guilty. He faces multiple challengers in the Democratic primary in June. Closely watching the judicial proceedings is Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, who is considering whether to remove Adams from office amid concerns that he reached a deal to have the case dropped in exchange for the mayor's political fealty to Trump. Early last week, Bove told prosecutors in New York to drop the charges because the prosecution 'has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.' Bove said charges could be reinstated after November's mayoral election. Two days later, then-interim U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon told Bondi in a letter that dismissing the charges in return for Adams' assistance in enforcing federal immigration laws would betray Bondi's own words that she 'will not tolerate abuses of the criminal justice process, coercive behavior, or other forms of misconduct.' 'Dismissal of the indictment for no other reason than to influence Adams's mayoral decision-making would be all three,' said Sassoon, a Republican. She said it amounted to a 'quid pro quo' deal and disclosed that prosecutors were about to bring additional obstruction of justice charges against Adams. Bove, in accepting Sassoon's resignation, accused her of 'pursuing a politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to dismiss the case.' He informed her that two other prosecutors assigned to the case were being suspended with pay and that an investigation would determine if they would keep their jobs. One prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, quit the following day. In all, seven prosecutors, including five high-ranking prosecutors at the Justice Department, had resigned by Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-delays-ruling-on-federal-request-to-drop-case-against-new-york-city-mayor/7981080.html	2025-02-19T13:34:51-08:00	
WTO holds 'constructive' talks after China condemns Trump tariffs	GENEVA — The World Trade Organization said on Wednesday that discussions on trade tensions were 'constructive,' after China accused the United States of imposing 'tariff shocks' that could upend the global trading system. China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump at a WTO meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China's comments as hypocritical. Trump has announced sweeping 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump's stance towards the institution. The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday. The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader talks on trade. The large majority 'stressed the importance of upholding WTO principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability and effectiveness of the global trading system,' Dieng added. Two trade sources at the meeting told Reuters that some countries expressed deep concern about the ramifications of tariffs, while others criticized China for alleged market distortions. It is the first time that mounting trade frictions were formally addressed on the agenda of the watchdog's top decision-making body, the General Council. 'Tariff shocks' 'These 'tariff shocks' heighten economic uncertainty, disrupt global trade, and risk domestic inflation, market distortion, or even global recession,' China's ambassador to the WTO, Li Chenggang, said at a closed-door meeting of the global trade body on Tuesday, according to a statement sent to Reuters. 'Worse, the U.S. unilateralism threatens to upend the rules-based multilateral trading system.' U.S. envoy David Bisbee called China's economy a 'predatory non-market economic system' in response and accused it of violating and evading WTO rules. Negotiating tactic Some delegates said they saw China's intervention as an attempt to show itself supporting WTO rules — a posture that can help China win allies in ongoing global trade negotiations. Disputes between the two top economies at the WTO long pre-date Trump's arrival. Beijing has accused Washington of breaking rules while Washington says Beijing does not deserve its 'developing country' status at the WTO. The Trump administration has announced plans to withdraw or disengage from other global organizations, but the WTO has not yet been a major focus for the White House. However, incoming U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has called the WTO 'deeply flawed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/wto-holds-constructive-talks-after-china-condemns-trump-tariffs/7981049.html	2025-02-19T13:21:42-08:00	
Europe frozen out of peace talks as Russia's war on Ukraine enters fourth year	LONDON — Russia’s tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border three years ago this month, triggering the worst conflict on European soil since World War II. Ukraine has resisted the full-scale invasion largely thanks to the support of the United States and Europe. But on the frozen front lines, the war grinds on — and Russia’s forces are slowly edging forward. 'Every day, it pushes back the Ukrainian front line somewhere by a kilometer or so. My judgment is that it could continue to do that over the rest of this year,' said Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. 'We must remember this is a terrible war. My judgment is that over a million people have been killed or seriously wounded. Now the balance of casualties is probably in Ukraine's favor. A figure of 700,000 or 800,000 Russian casualties seems credible to me. President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy says Ukraine has only suffered 48,000 killed. That seems implausibly low to me,' Barry told Agence France-Presse. Europe excluded As the war enters its fourth year, Europe and Ukraine fear they are being excluded from deciding their own fate. Behind the scenes, the geopolitical forces that are shaping the conflict appear to be changing fast. Russia and the United States began peace talks this week in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine and Europe were not invited. 'There will be some very significant alarm in European capitals about what might be discussed with regards to the security of their continent, their whole region,' said David Blagden, associate professor of international security at the University of Exeter. 'One sort of potentially really bad outcome for European capitals is to discover that the Americans have basically put them on the hook for attempting to do some sort of peacekeeping mission in Ukraine or whatever without their say-so,' he told Reuters. Peacekeepers Britain and France have already said they may be willing to contribute to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, a requirement of an estimated 100,000 troops. There are deep concerns over the potential risks of sending peacekeeping troops, according to Armida van Rij, head of the Europe program at London’s Chatham House. 'The U.S. seemed to have taken away NATO's Article 5 protection [on collective self-defense] for any troops that would be put in Ukraine. That means that they would not be protected, so that deterrent effect is gone. We know that Russia tends to break agreements. It has a long history of doing that under [President Vladimir] Putin and previous presidents. So, it is quite likely that Russia may well break the terms of any ceasefire or peace agreement that may come ... and then the question is, ‘OK, so what do the Europeans then do in response?' That might put them in direct confrontation with Russia, which is a terrifying thought,' van Rij told VOA. Defense spending The European Union says it has provided around $145 billion in military, financial, humanitarian and refugee aid to Ukraine over the past three years, more than half the total global assistance for Kyiv. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said this month that European security will no longer be a priority, and Washington is demanding NATO allies increase their defense spending. 'Where that money's going to come from is a key question,' said van Rij. 'The European Commission seems open to allowing some flexibility to their fiscal rules, which will make it a little bit easier for countries to spend on defense. But all of that still takes time, so it's still going to be really difficult.' Hard decisions will have profound implications for Europe, according to British Defense Secretary John Healey. 'The decisions that we make right now over the coming weeks will not only define the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine, but the security of our world for a generation to come,' Healey said in a speech Tuesday in London.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-frozen-out-of-peace-talks-as-russia-s-war-on-ukraine-enters-fourth-year/7981053.html	2025-02-19T13:04:48-08:00

Does AI detect breast cancer better than doctors can?	WASHINGTON — A German study shows that the cancer detection rate improves by almost 18% when doctors get help from artificial intelligence. For the study, radiologists — doctors who analyze the results of mammograms and other diagnostic tests — used artificial intelligence to examine the mammograms of more than 460,000 German women between the ages of 50 and 69. They found one more cancer for every 1,000 women than humans alone did, according to researchers. It was the largest real-world exploration to date into the use of AI to help detect breast cancer. 'The breast cancer detection rate is better, and this is really strong evidence,' said Dr. Alexander Katalinic, of the University of Lubeck in Germany, who was the study’s principal investigator. 'And based on this evidence, we should start to use more AI in breast cancer screening, and in the end, this should be standard.' The mammograms of 463,094 German women were examined between July 2021 and February 2023. About half were reviewed by two radiologists, which is standard procedure in Germany. In just over half of the cases, the humans were assisted by AI. When AI was involved, the breast cancer detection rate was 6.7 per 1,000 women, compared to 5.7 per 1,000 women screened solely by humans. 'AI really is suitable for replacing human readers to a certain extent,' Katalinic said. 'But how far do you want to go? This is not only a question of science, it's also a social question. How is the society’s trust in AI?' The study found that AI also helped reduce the number of false positive results. Artificial intelligence, however, did miss some cancers. 'The AI is not perfect in the same way that the humans are not perfect,' said Stefan Bunk, cofounder of Vara, a health care technology company in Berlin that developed the artificial intelligence used in the study. 'There were 20 cases in our study where the AI said this case is normal but actually a radiologist found cancer.' Humans, however, missed a malignancy 10 times more than the AI, according to the study results. 'AI, unlike humans, doesn't get tired, right?' Bunk said. 'AI works in the same way at 2 a.m. in the morning like in the middle of the day. So, it's definitely an advantage, and it's also one of the reasons why I think AI finds cancers that otherwise humans would miss.' AI could help reduce the workload for radiologists, freeing them to focus on more complex cases, according to Bunk, who added that increasing reliance on AI could lead to the risk of losing human expertise over time. 'Those complex cases — those cases where you need to take into account multiple angles, where you need to talk to the patient, right — is something where expertise and an actual radiologist is very important and should continue to be trained,' Bunk said. Dr. Wei Yang, a professor in breast radiology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, believes increased use of AI could energize radiologists. 'I think that the advent of AI is an opportunity and a trigger for us to become more excited about our field so that highly trained radiologists will have the open space, the time and the concentration to focus on more complex tasks,' Yang said. Using a human radiologist along with artificial intelligence offers the best of both worlds, according to Katalinic. 'The combination of a human together with AI is much better than only having the human reading,' he said. Yang, who was not involved in the study, is encouraged by the results. 'The data is very compelling,' she said. 'The increased cancer detection rate, the reduction in the false positive callbacks and the potential impact this can have on the workforce and burnout. So overall, very, very positive.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/does-ai-detect-breast-cancer-better-than-doctors-can/7980983.html	2025-02-19T12:10:50-08:00	
US agriculture secretary calls for federal action on foreign farm ownership	The new head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said seeking a federal solution to ban China from purchasing farmland in the United States will be one of her top priorities. 'One of the very, very top of the list perhaps is the Chinese purchase of our farmland. A lot of that land is around some of our military outposts,' Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview, the details of which were released on Tuesday. In recent years, Chinese entities or individuals purchasing land near sensitive locations such as military installations have drawn growing scrutiny from lawmakers and security officials. According to data from the Committee of 100, a nonprofit that advocates for Chinese Americans, as of mid-December of last year, 215 bills restricting property ownership by foreign entities have been introduced across 40 states, of which 164 prohibit or otherwise restrict Chinese citizens from purchasing or owning some form of property. Thirty-six of the bills have passed, and 16 of them limit Chinese citizens from purchasing or owning some form of property, the Committee of 100 said on its website. In her interview with Breitbart News, Rollins said that the Trump administration is looking to take these state-level legislative concerns to the federal level. 'For the last several years my organization America First Policy Institute, we actually worked among multiple states to get states to act on this to pass state legislation [on banning Chinese purchase of farmland], but we also are looking at a federal solution too,' she told Breitbart on Friday. She said there is 'no doubt' that the people are concerned about Chinese foreign investment of farmland, and Americans want U.S. farmland to be owned by fellow Americans as opposed to foreigners such as those loyal to the Chinese Communist Party. She also praised President Donald Trump for promoting an 'America First' ideology that has posed China as a potential security threat to the U.S. A 2023 report containing data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency shows that Canada currently owns the largest amount of foreign-held agricultural and nonagricultural land, with 33%. In comparison, China holds slightly less than 1% of foreign-held farmland. Other notable countries owning U.S. agricultural land include the Netherlands (11%), Italy (6%), the United Kingdom (6%), and Germany (5%). Collectively, these countries account for 28% of foreign-held agricultural land in the U.S., totaling approximately 5 million hectares, according to the Farm Service Agency report. In the report, the USDA noted that despite China’s relatively low percentage holding of foreign-owned farmland, 'there is considerable interest in their holdings.' Indiana is one example of a state that took action over Chinese ownership of agriculture land. In March 2024, Indiana State Representative Kendell Culp’s legislation to 'protect Hoosier farmland and military bases from foreign adversaries' was signed into law. 'Our foreign adversaries like China and Russia should not be able to buy up Hoosier land, which could compromise our ability to protect our food and national security,' Culp said in a press release about the legislation. 'We can't afford to let even a fraction more of our valuable farmland to be gobbled up,' he said. The Committee of 100 said the development of legislation restricting foreign-owned land ownership would 'legitimize harmful and xenophobic claims about immigrants that would exacerbate rising anti-Asian violence that has negatively affected U.S. citizens and non-citizens alike.' 'Should they take effect, these laws would also disproportionately affect a wide range of people of color living in the United States; most of the countries targeted in this legislation are majority nonwhite,' the organization said on its website.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agriculture-secretary-calls-for-federal-action-on-foreign-farm-ownership/7980929.html	2025-02-19T12:07:13-08:00	
Trump administration orders halt to NYC toll meant to fight traffic, fund mass transit	new york — President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday ordered a halt to New York City's congestion pricing system, which thins traffic and funds mass transit by imposing high tolls on drivers entering some parts of Manhattan. Launched Jan. 5, the city's system uses license plate readers to impose a $9 toll on most vehicles entering Manhattan neighborhoods south of Central Park. In its early days, transit officials say the toll has brought modest but measurable traffic reductions. In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced the federal government has rescinded its approval of the program, calling it 'slap in the face to working class Americans and small business owners.' Duffy said his agency will work with the state on an 'orderly termination of the tolls.' Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower penthouse and other properties are within the congestion zone, had vowed to kill the plan as soon as he took office. He previously characterized it as a massive, regressive tax, saying 'it will be virtually impossible for New York City to come back as long as the congestion tax is in effect.' Similar tolling programs intended to force people onto public transit by making driving cost-prohibitive have long existed in other global cities, including London, Stockholm, Milan and Singapore, but the system had never before been tried in the U.S. The Trump administration order kicked off a wave of criticism from congestion pricing supporters in New York City. 'By blocking this successful policy, Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system,' said state Senator Andrew Gounardes, a city Democrat. New York planned to use the toll revenue to issue bonds that would fund billions of dollars in improvements and repairs for the city's creaky and cash-strapped transit system, which carries 4 million riders daily. The tolling system has been divisive. Transit advocates and environmentalists have heralded it as an innovative step to reduce air pollution from vehicle exhaust, make streets safer for pedestrians and bikers, while speeding up traffic for vehicles that truly need to be on the road, like delivery trucks and police cars. But the high tolls are hated by many New Yorkers who own cars, particularly those who live in the suburbs or parts of the city not well-served by the subway system. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat, had fought the tolls in court and wrote a letter Trump on Inauguration Day imploring him to kill the program. New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, also had misgivings. Last June, she abruptly halted the tolling system's planned launch, citing concerns about its impact on the local economy. The Democrat then revived the toll in November following Trump's election, but reduced the toll for passenger vehicles from $15 to $9. Since then, she has lauded it as a win for the city and has discussed the issue multiple times with the president. A spokesperson for Hochul did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. New York lawmakers approved the tolling plan in 2019, but it was stalled for years awaiting a required federal environmental review during Trump's first term before President Joe Biden's administration approved it. As in other cities, the New York congestion fee varies depending on the time and the size of the vehicle. Trucks and other large automobiles pay a higher rate, and the fee goes drops to $2.25 for most cars during the quieter overnight hours. The toll survived several lawsuits trying to halt it before its launch, including from the state of New Jersey, unionized teachers in New York City, a trucking industry group and local elected leaders in the Hudson River Valley, Long Island and northern New Jersey.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-orders-halt-to-nyc-toll-meant-to-fight-traffic-fund-mass-transit-/7980931.html	2025-02-19T11:43:33-08:00	
Solar refrigerators in Kenya reduce food waste	NAIROBI, KENYA — Milk and egg vendor Caroline Mukundi has lost a lot of her stock in her years of selling fresh food at a Nairobi market. Mukundi said she had no way to keep food fresh, and the cost of refrigerating was out of reach. 'The food would go bad,' she said, and she would have to throw it away. 'It was a big challenge for me.' Mukundi said her situation turned around when she acquired a solar-powered refrigerator. The refrigerators, named Koolboks and manufactured in Kenya, are fitted with ice compartments that can chill food even without a source of power. The devices can keep food cool for up to four days without electricity, even with limited sunlight. Customers can buy the refrigerators on a customized payment model, said Natalie Casey, chief business officer at the Koolboks startup company. 'They can be between 1,500 and 3,000 US dollars, because it includes not only the appliances but also the solar panels and battery storage to enable the continuous cooling,' she said. 'We’ve decided what might be more accessible to them is to first pay a down payment between 20 and 35% of the total, and the customer can pay in installments of up to 24 months.' Koolboks has sold about 7,000 solar-powered refrigerators. Conventional refrigerators for businesses can cost anywhere from $11,000 to $100,000 or more, said Dorothy Otieno, program manager at the Center for Environmental Justice and Development. 'Some businesses, especially small businesses, are not able to afford it,' she said. 'We are looking at, for example, how businesses can be supported to get access to [the Koolboks refrigerators], especially for communities that are not able to afford,' she said. The refrigerator was among dozens of innovations showcased at the recent Africa Tech Summit in Nairobi. The conference’s founder, Andrew Fassnidge, told VOA that such creations are crucial to solving local problems on the continent. 'What’s interesting with ... Koolboks refrigeration is, if we look at the Covid vaccine, one of the biggest issues at the time was refrigeration, and it’s still an issue in most markets,' he said. Koolboks markets a refrigerator specifically for vaccines. The refrigerators could have an impact on climate change, too. A 2024 survey by the U.N. Environmental Program showed Kenya has a high level of food waste, with annual waste ranging from 40 to 100 kilograms per person. Environmentalists say high levels of organic waste worsen climate change, so preventing food waste can have an impact.	https://www.voanews.com/a/solar-refrigerators-in-kenya-reduce-food-waste/7980847.html	2025-02-19T11:39:09-08:00

Trump administration labels 8 Latin American cartels as 'foreign terrorist organizations'	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is formally designating eight Latin American crime organizations as 'foreign terrorist organizations,' upping its pressure on cartels operating in the U.S. and on anyone aiding them. The move, carrying out a Jan. 20 executive order by President Donald Trump, names Tren de Aragua in Venezuela, MS-13 in El Salvador and others. The notification is due for formal publication Thursday in the Federal Register. The Republican president has made securing the U.S.-Mexico border among his top priorities, vowing to carry out mass deportations, sending active duty troops to the border and reaching deals with some countries to take in more migrants. The 'foreign terrorist organization' label is unusual because it deploys a terrorist designation normally reserved for groups like al-Qaida or the Islamic State group that use violence for political ends — not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels. The Trump administration argues that the international connections and operations of the groups — including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory — warrant the designation. Critics of the move call it an unnecessarily broad and harsh one that could damage relations and paralyze trade with Latin America. Businesses, banks and buyers could fear possible U.S. prosecution if they knowingly or unknowingly have any transactions that touch the world of the cartels. Such cartels permeate Mexico's economy, dealing not only in drug trafficking and migrant smuggling but fighting for control of the multibillion-dollar avocado business. Aid groups say some past U.S. designations of groups as foreign terrorist organizations have threatened overall food imports into countries, for example, by making shipping companies fearful that U.S. prosecutors may accuse them of directly or indirectly supporting the targeted groups. Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to Trump's order last month that set up the new formal designation by saying Mexico would defend its sovereignty and independence while seeking coordination. 'We all want to fight the drug cartels,' Sheinbaum said. The U.S. 'in their territory, us in our territory.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-labels-8-latin-american-cartels-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-/7980775.html	2025-02-19T10:16:21-08:00	
Italian Premier Meloni visits Pope Francis in hospital, says he's ‘alert and responsive’	Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni visited Pope Francis in the hospital Wednesday and reported he was 'alert and responsive' and full of good humor, despite his diagnosis of pneumonia and a complicated bronchial infection that has sidelined the 88-year-old pontiff for six days. Meloni said she wanted to bring get-well wishes to the pope on behalf of the government and the entire nation. 'We joked around as always. He has not lost his proverbial sense of humor,' she said in a statement issued by her office. Meloni's visit marked the first confirmed outside visitor known to have called on the pope, beyond his secretaries and medical team, since his admission Friday at Rome's Gemelli hospital, where popes have their own suite on the 10th floor. The Vatican has said Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was up, eating and had gotten out of bed after a tranquil night, a day after tests confirmed he had pneumonia in both lungs on top of asthmatic bronchitis. The visit by Meloni appeared aimed at sending a reassuring message, especially to Italians who haven't seen even a photograph of Francis since Friday. The Italian premier, who came to power in 2022 with a message touting her Christian credentials, has referred in glowing terms to Pope Benedict XVI, who was a reference point for European conservatives like herself. She also has teamed up constructively with Francis on a campaign to reverse Italy's low birth rate, though they don't necessarily see eye-to-eye on her government's crackdown on migrants. Her visit came as prayers were pouring in for Francis' recovery. On Wednesday, Francis' vicar for Rome urged all the faithful to devote an hour of silent prayer for the pope before evening vespers services, some visitors to Gemelli lit a candle in his honor and pilgrims who had planned to attend his weekly general audience came to St. Peter's Square anyway to offer a prayer after it was cancelled. 'I think many people are disappointed but I think more importantly we really have to pray for his health,' said Sister Charlene, a nun from Singapore who was in the piazza. Francis also received another get-well wish from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, whom Francis has recently targeted in criticizing the Trump administration's plans for mass deportations of migrants. 'Let's all say a prayer for Pope Francis, who appears to have some serious health issues,' Vance, a Catholic, posted on X from his private account. Francis was admitted to the Gemelli hospital Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, medical personnel determined that he was suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, meaning a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms had colonized in his respiratory tract. Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest CT scan showed the onset of bilateral pneumonia on top of asthmatic bronchitis, which is being treated with cortisone and antibiotics. 'I think the key will be how well and quickly he responds to treatment,' said Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospitals. Bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, which is a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs' air sacs. Pneumonia can develop in part or all of one lung or in both lungs. It tends to be more serious when both lungs are affected because there isn't healthy tissue to compensate. Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids — and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection. To date, Francis is breathing on his own and his heart function is said to be good. He has eaten breakfast every day, gotten out of bed, read the newspapers and done some work from his hospital room. 'Pope Francis is a strong man who does not let difficulties get him down,' said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who heads a new Vatican committee on children. The fact that Francis is keeping up with his ordinary routine, including receiving the Eucharist, 'is a sign of a man who wants to experience the ordinariness of illness in the hospital.' The Vatican hasn't provided any information about how Francis is responding to any of the drugs he has been given other than to say he isn't running a fever. The Argentine pope, who has previously admitted to being a non-compliant patient, has a number of conditions that make him particularly at risk for complications: Aside from his age, he is not physically active and uses a wheelchair, limiting his ability to clear the fluids building up in his lungs. Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said doctors will be looking to see if Francis responds to the therapy, which can include physiotherapy to help clear the lungs. Severe cases of pneumonia are typically treated for about one to two weeks, but recovery in an older person could extend beyond that. 'Lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign,' said McCormack, who is not involved in Francis' care. The Vatican has given no indication of how long the pope might remain hospitalized, only saying that the treatment of such a 'complex clinical picture' would require an 'adequate' stay. Despite the less than positive news about Francis' condition, Francis was receiving get-well drawings and cards from children being treated in the hospital's oncology ward. And at the Vatican on Wednesday, Holy Year pilgrimages continued, with groups of faithful walking through the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica on a chilly and cloudy day. 'We are very happy to be here but we are also sad for the pope's sickness,' said Amparo Alcala, who was leading a large group of pilgrims from Valencia, Spain. 'He is doing great things, most of all for the women in the church, and this gives us a lot of joy. We are praying for his recovery and that he might come back, if this is God's will.' A group of South Korean pilgrims in traditional costumes had planned to attend Francis' weekly Wednesday general audience and show off their national dress, as pilgrims often do for the pope's weekly appointment. When it was cancelled, they came anyway. 'The Lunar New Year was very recent so we also wanted to bow traditionally and formally in front of him,' said Junhee Christina Kim, a pilgrim from Seoul, South Korea. 'It was too good of a chance to pass up so we came anyway so that we can be in the Vatican in our traditional costumes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-premier-meloni-visits-pope-francis-in-hospital-says-he-s-alert-and-responsive-/7980724.html	2025-02-19T09:47:47-08:00

Mexico says US drone flights part of years-old collaboration	MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s president said Wednesday that U.S. drone flights were part of a collaboration that has existed for years between the two countries, after U.S. media reported increased cross-border aerial surveillance of drug cartels. 'There is nothing illegal, and it is part of a collaboration and coordination,' Claudia Sheinbaum said at her morning news conference. 'It is a coordination and collaboration protocol that has existed for years between the United States and Mexican governments,' she said. According to The New York Times, Washington has stepped up secret drone flights over Mexico in search of fentanyl labs as part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign against drug cartels. The CIA has not been authorized to use the drones to take lethal action, and any information collected is passed to Mexican officials, the Times said, adding that the covert program began under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, but had not been previously disclosed. Last week, Mexico’s government said U.S. military aircraft may have spied on drug cartels during recent flights near Mexican territory. Mexico was aware of two such U.S. military flights in late January and early February that were in international airspace, Defense Minister Ricardo Trevilla said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-says-us-drone-flights-part-of-years-old-collaboration/7980616.html	2025-02-19T08:28:58-08:00	
Austria arrests teen over foiled plot to attack Vienna station	VIENNA — Austria arrested a 14-year-old on Feb. 10 on suspicion of planning a militant attack on a Vienna train station, the Interior Ministry said Wednesday, calling the suspect an Islamic State supporter who became radicalized online. The announcement follows a knife attack in the southern town of Villach on Saturday in which a 23-year-old Syrian refugee is suspected of killing a teenager and wounding five people. That man was rapidly radicalized after watching Islamist videos on TikTok, Austrian authorities have said. 'Domestic intelligence and the police have prevented a terrorist attack in Vienna,' the ministry said in a statement. 'The suspect is 14 years old, an Austrian citizen with Turkish roots, and he became radicalized on the internet.' The ministry said he had been planning an attack on the Westbahnhof station, a striking mid-20th century building that is the departure point for lines that include a private train company's service to cities such as Salzburg and Innsbruck. A search of the suspect’s home found numerous Islamist books as well as two knives, handwritten instructions for producing explosives to be used as a detonator for a bomb, as well as material including aluminum pipes that were intended to be used for bomb-making, the ministry said. 'The Directorate for State Security and Intelligence received information that an initially unknown supporter of a terrorist organization was spreading stories and videos with Islamist ideas on several TikTok profiles,' the ministry said, describing how the investigation started.

Philippines to hold large military drills as China tensions simmer	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Philippine defense officials say they will hold a large, 10-day military training exercise next month, aiming to strengthen the country’s ability to respond to any crisis caused by an 'external threat.' Although Manila did not name China explicitly when it announced the drills — the biggest in recent years — they come as Beijing has increased the frequency of its maritime patrols and coast guard maneuvers around several disputed reefs that lie within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ. Several of those patrols have resulted in clashes and the use of aggressive maneuvers and accusations of vessel ramming. China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea as its own despite an international ruling to the contrary, insists that its actions have been in accordance with the law. The Combined Arms Training Exercise, or Catex, will take place March 3-12, involving approximately 6,000 soldiers and live-fire drills involving some of the Philippines’ most advanced artillery weapons. Expanded drills In the announcement on Monday, defense officials said that unlike past exercises, this year’s Catex will be conducted across the archipelago, including the northern island of Luzon, the island of Visayas in Central Philippines, and the southern island of Mindanao. The expanded drills will 'strengthen our command-and-control capabilities, further enhancing our preparedness to respond to any challenge that may threaten our national security,' Philippine Army Chief Lieutenant General Roy Galido told media during a news conference on Monday. Typhon missile system While the Philippine military is expected to test the Autonomous Truck-Mounted Howitzer Systems, its largest artillery weapon, during the live-fire drills, Galido said the U.S.-made Typhon missile system, which has prompted concerns from China, won’t be part of the large-scale exercise. The Philippine military is still 'appreciating the system and being able to understand how to utilize it in our defense concept,' he told Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post in an interview on Monday. The deployment of the Typhon missile system to the northern Philippines has prompted concerns from China. During a press conference Friday, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang urged Manila to 'remove the [Typhon] system as soon as possible.' Analysts say the Philippines should focus on building up anti-ship missile capabilities and procuring more unmanned aerial vehicles rather than buying expensive items like submarines, which the Philippines is reportedly considering purchasing from India. 'The anti-ship missiles can survive in a modern war with China, and it can really force the Chinese military planners to rethink their strategies,' Zachary Abuza, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at the National War College in Washington, told VOA by phone. Other experts say the military drills and the ongoing efforts to acquire missile or air defense systems are part of the Philippines’ attempt to strengthen its sea capabilities and deterrence against China. 'Given the Philippines’ limited materiel capabilities, these efforts are part of a long-term endeavor that will need continuity to ensure the Philippines will be able to muster the capabilities to pursue the objective of countering China’s maritime aggression,' Don McLain Gill, a lecturer in international studies at De La Salle University in the Philippines, told VOA in a recorded voice message. ‘Aggressive’ China action The announcement of the drills comes amid another uptick in tensions between China and the Philippines after a Chinese navy helicopter allegedly flew within 10 feet of a Philippine patrol plane near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea on Tuesday. The Philippine coast guard characterized the Chinese aircraft’s actions as 'aggressive and escalatory' and said they remained 'committed to asserting our sovereignty, sovereign rights and maritime jurisdiction' in the South China Sea. Meanwhile, Southern Theater Command of the People’s Liberation Army — China's military — accused the Philippine aircraft of 'illegally' intruding on the airspace above Scarborough Shoal, which China views as its territory, and said its troops 'are resolute in defending national sovereignty and security as well as peace and stability in the South China Sea.' Weakest link? Experts say the latest incident reflects Beijing’s attempt to test the Philippines’ defense capabilities and the United States’ commitment to supporting Manila, which has a mutual defense treaty with Washington. 'China sees the Philippines as the weakest link in the U.S. security architecture in the Indo-Pacific region, so they are testing how effective Manila can push back against its assertive behaviors,' Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at International Christian University in Japan, told VOA by phone. He said while it’s important for the Philippines to strengthen defense cooperation with like-minded democracies, including conducting joint patrols and military exercises, Manila should also carefully calibrate its responses to Chinese aggression. The Philippines’ response should 'reciprocate the pressure that the Chinese are putting on them because the Chinese strategic mindset is based on the idea of active defense, which means when they pressure their opponents to escalate the conflict, that gives them the right to escalate their behaviors,' Nagy said. New legal challenge possible In addition to strengthening defense capabilities, the Reuters news agency reported last month that the Philippines may soon initiate a second legal challenge against China over the South China Sea by suing Beijing for allegedly damaging the marine environment. Despite the report, Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo said in response to a question from VOA during a public event held by the London-based think tank Chatham House on Tuesday that Manila has no plan to launch a legal challenge against China right now. Joshua Espena, a lecturer of international relations at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, told VOA that since the Philippines is gearing up for the parliamentary election in May, Manila is unlikely to initiate a new legal challenge against China at this point. 'The 2016 South China Sea Arbitration ruling gives the Philippines sufficient ground to do what the government needs to do,' he said. As the U.S. focuses on facilitating a peace deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, Nagy said, China will likely maintain its pressure campaign against the Philippines in the coming months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-to-hold-large-military-drills-as-china-tensions-simmer/7980497.html	2025-02-19T07:03:56-08:00

Taliban confirm Pakistan’s new plan for swift mass eviction of Afghan refugees	Islamabad — Diplomats from Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban reported Wednesday that neighboring Pakistan is implementing a plan for the 'imminent' and swift mass deportation of nearly three million Afghan refugees from its territory. The Taliban-operated embassy in Islamabad issued the statement, ending days of uncertainty about an ongoing police crackdown to arrest and remove Afghan citizens, including legal refugees, from the Pakistani capital and the adjoining city of Rawalpindi. The Afghan diplomatic mission stated that Pakistan did not formally notify Kabul about its latest refugee deportation plans. It added that several attempts were made through diplomatic channels to seek clarification from the host government regarding the reasons behind the detentions and removals of Afghan nationals from the two cities. 'Ultimately, officials from Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that there is a definitive and final plan to deport/remove all Afghan refugees not only from Islamabad and Rawalpindi but also from the entire country in the near future,' the Wednesday statement noted. The Taliban reaction comes nearly three weeks after Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a multistage plan targeting the Afghan refugee population in the country. They include more than 1.4 million legally declared refugees with UNHCR-granted proof of registration cards, or PoRs, who have been granted permission by Pakistan to remain in the country until June 30, 2025. The rest of the population in question comprises nearly 900,000 documented economic migrants holding the Afghan Citizenship Card (ACC), an estimated 40,000 awaiting promised relocation to the United States or other Western countries, and individuals living in Pakistan without legal status or having exceeded their visa duration. The Taliban embassy stated Wednesday that Pakistani officials informed it that only Afghan nationals with valid legal visas would be permitted to reside in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. 'They further stated that the government has decided to immediately remove all Afghan refugees, including those holding ACC and PoR cards, from Islamabad and Rawalpindi and that their expulsion from the entire country is imminent,' the statement added. The UNHCR has meanwhile also confirmed that the Pakistani government plans to relocate all Afghan refugees out of Islamabad and Rawalpindi by February 28, except for holders of valid visas. The Afghan embassy noted that it expressed 'serious concerns' to Islamabad and international organizations regarding 'the mass expulsion of Afghan refugees within such a short timeframe and the unilateral nature of Pakistan’s decision.' The spokesperson for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry rejected the Taliban embassy's claims of mistreatment of Afghan nationals during the repatriation process as misplaced. 'In this connection, we also extensively engaged the Afghan side to ensure smooth repatriation of Afghan nationals,' Shafqat Ali Khan stated in a brief statement. The deportation plan, seen by VOA, requires authorities to relocate around 40,000 Afghans out of Islamabad and Rawalpindi by March 31 and subsequently arrange for their repatriation to Afghanistan if their relocation and resettlement cases to third countries are not processed expeditiously. These individuals fled their country after the Taliban militarily recaptured its control in 2021, primarily seeking shelter from potential retribution due to their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces. Last month, President Donald Trump halted the U.S. Refugee Admission Program to assess whether reinstating it serves the interests of Washington, stranding thousands of Afghan allies in Pakistan approved for, or being evaluated for, relocation to the U.S. The UNHCR says that more than 825,000 undocumented Afghans have already been forcibly repatriated from Pakistan since 2023, resulting from a government crackdown on foreigners living in the country without legal permission or whose visas had expired. Islamabad has defended the crackdown, attributing a recent rise in crime in Pakistan and increased militancy to Afghan nationals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-confirm-pakistan-s-new-plan-for-swift-mass-eviction-of-afghan-refugees-/7980321.html	2025-02-19T04:17:45-08:00	
China proposes new rules to tighten control over rare earth sector	BEIJING — China on Wednesday began public consultation on new regulations designed to protect its domestic rare earth industry, a sector where Beijing has previously weaponized its dominance via export controls and other restrictions. The draft regulations were released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology late on Wednesday and touched on issues including quotas for mining, smelting and separating, as well as monitoring and enforcement. The rules are the latest in a series of attempts to bring the globally critical sector under tighter state control. China already dictates output via a system of quotas and state-controlled companies. Rare earths are a group of 17 minerals whose production China dominates, accounting for nearly 90% of global refined output. In 2023, Beijing banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets, adding it to an existing ban on technology to extract and separate the critical materials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-proposes-new-rules-to-tighten-control-over-rare-earth-sector-/7980313.html	2025-02-19T04:04:08-08:00	
China opposes Vietnam's building work on disputed reef in South China Sea	BEIJING — China opposes Vietnam's construction activities on a disputed islet in the South China Sea known as the Barque Canada Reef, its foreign ministry said on Wednesday. Occupied by Vietnam since the 1980s, the reef in the Spratly Islands is claimed by several countries, in a dispute that has intensified as China and the United States vie for influence in the strategic Southeast Asian nation. The reef is 'part of China's territory,' ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular news conference, adding that China had always opposed 'illegal occupation' of islands and reefs. Vietnam's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China claims almost the entire South China Sea despite overlapping claims in the busy waterway by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Vietnam's land reclamation had expanded the reef by 10 times since 2022, according to a study by Guangdong Ocean University and China's natural resources ministry, and which is being reviewed for publication in the Journal of Tropical Oceanography. The study added that Vietnam had dredged a channel 299 meters in width at the reef, sufficient to berth large vessels, such as warships. Last year, China rebuffed Vietnam's claims of sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly island chains, saying its own claims to the two were backed by history. Vietnam has previously cited 'full legal basis and ample historical evidence' for its claims to the reef. The neighbors, who have close economic ties, agreed to step up cooperation on security matters in a move towards building a community with a 'shared future' during a trip to Hanoi last December by Chinese President Xi Jinping. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that China's South China Sea claims were not supported by international law, a decision Beijing rejects. 'China will strive for an early conclusion of the code of conduct in the South China Sea and jointly safeguard peace and stability' in the region, Guo said in response to a query about disputes in the South China Sea. He was referring to a framework the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping is striving to finalize.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-opposes-vietnam-s-building-work-on-disputed-reef-in-south-china-sea-/7980305.html	2025-02-19T03:54:58-08:00	
UAE says it rejects any attempt to displace Palestinian people	United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the UAE rejects 'any attempts to displace the Palestinian people from their land' as Rubio made a visit Wednesday to Abu Dhabi. UAE state media reported the comments and said the president highlighted the need to prevent an expansion of the conflict in Gaza. 'He also underscored the importance of linking Gaza’s reconstruction to a path that leads to a comprehensive and lasting peace based on the two-state solution, as the only manner of ensuring stability in the region,' the report said. Arab leaders have rejected plans suggested by U.S. President Donald Trump that Palestinians leave Gaza for other countries in the region, and that the U.S. take over and rebuild the Palestinian enclave. Rubio’s visit was part of a multi-nation tour that also included talks with leaders in Israel and in Saudi Arabia, which came as the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip moved into its final weeks. Hostage release A top Hamas leader said Tuesday that the militant group plans to release six more living Israeli hostages from their Gaza captivity on Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday. Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made the surprise announcement in a recorded statement, an apparent response to the Israeli decision to allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into the Gaza Strip. The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under the first phase of the ceasefire that expires in early March, with Hamas believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. Four more bodies of hostages are set to be returned next week. So far during the ceasefire, Hamas has released 24 hostages, and Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The warring sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase of their truce, in which Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Tuesday that Israel was ready to open negotiations on the details of the second phase. Those talks were supposed to have started two weeks ago, according to the ceasefire deal. In his remarks, Hayya said the 'Bibas family' would be included in the handover of the four bodies, apparently referring to Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who for many Israelis embody the captives' plight. Israel has not confirmed their deaths, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office urged the public not to distribute 'photos, names and rumors.' Israel has said it was gravely concerned about the Bibas family, while Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early in the war. Yarden Bibas, the husband and father, was kidnapped separately and released this month. Kfir, who was 9 months old at the time, was the youngest hostage taken in Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered 15 months of fighting. Video footage of the abduction showed Shiri swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. 'In recent hours we have been shaken after the Hamas spokesman's announcement was published about the return of our Shiri, Ariel and Kfir this coming Thursday as part of the movement to release kidnapped civilians,' the family said in a statement. 'It is important for us to say that we are aware of the reports but have not yet received an official update on the matter.' 'Until we receive certainty, our journey will not end,' the family said. An Israeli official said Netanyahu had agreed to allow the mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza to accelerate the hostages' release. Hamas last week threatened to hold up the release of more hostages, citing the mobile home issue and other alleged violations of the truce. Israel is expected to continue releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks, in exchange for the hostages. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million.

US envoy in Ukraine for talks following US-Russia meeting	U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia said Wednesday the United States understands the need for security guarantees for Ukraine, as he visited the country for talks with Ukrainian officials. Gen. Keith Kellogg told reporters in Kyiv that he was in Ukraine 'to listen,' hear the concerns of Ukrainian leaders and return to the United States to consult President Trump. Kellogg said the United States wants the war in Ukraine to end, saying that would be good for the region and the world. The talks come amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts focused on Russia’s war in Ukraine, including French President Emmanuel Macron hosting European leaders Wednesday for a second round of talks about the conflict and European support for Ukraine. Kellogg also met earlier this week with European leaders, and on Tuesday U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Saudi Arabia. Rubio said both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to achieve peace. 'The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,' Rubio told reporters. No Ukrainian or European officials were at the table for the talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy objected to being excluded from the meeting, a position that drew criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. 'Today I heard, ‘Well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years,' Trump said of Ukraine’s leaders. 'You should have never started it.' Russia began the war with its February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While speaking to reporters at his Florida residence, Trump said he thought he had a 'good chance' to end the war. But Zelenskyy has said his country will not agree to a U.S.-Russian dictated settlement of the war. Zelenskyy postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the negotiations. The United States and Russia agreed to 'appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible,' State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Bruce characterized the meeting as 'an important step forward' toward peace. Rubio said Ukraine and European nations would have to be involved in talks on ending the war. He said that if the war is halted, the United States would have 'extraordinary opportunities … to partner' with Russia on trade and other global issues. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she and other European foreign ministers spoke to Rubio after the U.S.-Russia meeting, and she expressed support for a Ukraine-led resolution. 'Russia will try to divide us. Let’s not walk into their traps,' Kallas said on X. 'By working together with the US, we can achieve a just and lasting peace – on Ukraine’s terms.' Russia now controls about one-fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized 2014 territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that it unilaterally annexed in 2014, a large portion of eastern Ukraine that pro-Russian separatists captured in subsequent fighting, and land Russia has taken over since the 2022 invasion. As the invasion started, Moscow hoped for a quick takeover of all of Ukraine. But with stiff Ukrainian resistance, the war instead evolved into a grinding ground conflict and daily aerial bombardments by each side. Zelenskyy has long demanded that his country’s 2014 boundaries be restored, but U.S. officials have said that is unrealistic, as was Kyiv’s long-sought goal of joining NATO.

Swedish Supreme Court: Activists can't sue over climate action	STOCKHOLM — Sweden's Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that Greta Thunberg and hundreds of other young activists cannot sue the state in a Swedish court over what they say is insufficient action against climate change. Activists filed a class action lawsuit in 2022 with a district court claiming the state violates their rights as laid out in the European Convention on Human Rights by not doing enough to limit climate change, nor to mitigate its effects. The district court in 2023 asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether a lawsuit of this kind can effectively be tried in a Swedish court, after the state requested the case be dismissed. 'A court cannot decide that the Riksdag or the government must take any specific action. The political bodies decide independently on which specific climate measures Sweden should take,' the Supreme Court said in a statement on Wednesday. The currently around 300 plaintiffs, which call themselves the Aurora group, wanted the district court to order Sweden to do more to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-supreme-court-activists-can-t-sue-over-climate-action/7980241.html	2025-02-19T01:11:28-08:00	
South Korea court finds former officials guilty of forcible return of N. Koreans	SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean court found four former government officials guilty on Wednesday of forcibly repatriating two North Korean fishermen in 2019, despite their intention to defect, in a case that provoked criticism from global human rights activists. At the time they were deported, the government of former President Moon Jae-in called the fishermen 'dangerous criminals' who had killed 16 colleagues in a fight over an abusive captain on their ship before crossing the sea border. The Seoul Central District Court suspended sentencing for the four, who had held office under Moon, and had all denied wrongdoing. They were former National Security Office chief Chung Eui-yong, former presidential chief of staff Noh Young-min, former National Intelligence Service chief Suh Hoon and former Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul. South Korea hands down suspended sentences for crimes seen as relatively minor that are not viewed as convictions in the traditional sense, but figure in the criminal record. In 2022, South Korea reopened the case, with the office of now-impeached President Yook Suk Yeol denouncing the repatriation to North Korea that called the defectors 'human scum,' as a potential 'crime against humanity.' The deportation was also criticized by rights watchdogs, including U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, which called it illegal under international law because of the likelihood the men would be tortured. Their fate has not been confirmed. Photographs and videos released by the Yoon administration in 2022 showed South Korean security officials dragging the men over the border into the hands of North Korean troops. Outside the court, former National Security Office chief Chung defended the repatriations and said he would discuss whether to appeal the ruling. 'Those repatriated ... in November 2019 were not just North Korean defectors who committed criminal acts in the course of defection, as prosecutors claim,' Chung told reporters. 'They brutally killed 16 of their fellow sailors (and) fled from North Korean society.' Prosecutors could not immediately be reached for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-court-finds-former-officials-guilty-of-forcible-return-of-n-koreans/7980237.html	2025-02-19T01:00:32-08:00	
Vietnam raises GDP growth target to at least 8%, approves China rail link	HANOI, VIETNAM — Vietnam's National Assembly on Wednesday approved raising the economic growth target for this year and also voted in favor of major infrastructure projects, including the country's first nuclear power plants and a rail link to China. Lawmakers approved a new growth target for 2025 of at least 8% proposed by the government, an increase from the previous goal of 6.5% to 7.0%. 'With faster economic growth, macro stability must still be ensured while inflation must be kept under control,' the government said in a report to parliament. The report said inflation would be kept between 4.5% and 5.0% this year. Parliament also passed a resolution supporting construction of a new railway, linking a major seaport in northern Vietnam with China. The project is expected to cost $8.3 billion, part of which to be funded by loans from the Chinese government. Vietnam, a regional manufacturing hub heavily reliant on exports to drive its economy, has been seeking to ramp up infrastructure investment to boost growth. Lawmakers approved policies to develop nuclear power plants, the first of which is set to be built by the end of 2031. Under the policies, the government can appoint contractors to construct the plants without holding a tender process. Parliament approved rules that would allow Elon Musk's Starlink to provide satellite internet services in the country while maintaining full ownership of any local subsidiary. And a plan to offer financial support to local firms that enter the semiconductor industry was also supported. On Tuesday, the assembly approved a bold bureaucratic reform plan that will slash up to a fifth of government bodies, as it tries to cut costs and improve administrative efficiency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-raises-gdp-growth-target-to-at-least-8-approves-china-rail-link/7980234.html	2025-02-19T00:47:16-08:00	
Immigration, cost of living frustrate voters as German elections loom	LONDON — Germany is set to hold a general election on Sunday, with voter frustrations over migration at the forefront of a heated campaign. The center-right Christian Democrats are leading the polls with about 29% support, with party leader Friedrich Merz the front-runner to become Germany’s next chancellor. The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, Party, which domestic intelligence services are monitoring as a suspected extremist organization, is polling in second place, with 21% support ahead of Sunday’s election. 'I am in favor of the principle that we must make a fundamental distinction between asylum and immigration. The state has not done that so far. Everything is mixed up, and we have had illegal migration into our country for 10 years,' AfD co-leader Alice Weidel said during a televised election debate on Monday. The AfD has steadily risen in support over recent months, said political scientist Wolfgang Schroeder, a fellow at the Berlin Social Science Center. 'This party has gained more and more support over time, interestingly to the same extent that it has become more radicalized,' he told The Associated Press. 'And the main driving force behind this success is, on the one hand, its anti-migration policy, which is very popular in Germany, even in the center of the political spectrum. Then there is their fight against the environmental transformation and their positioning in the Russia war.' The AfD has campaigned against sending military aid to Ukraine and advocates a closer relationship with Russia. The party’s policies have caught the attention of U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote on his social media platform X in December that 'only the AfD can save Germany.' In an opinion article for Germany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Musk wrote, 'The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!' Musk later hosted a live chat on X with Weidel. Terror attacks Meanwhile, a recent spate of deadly terror attacks in Germany has intensified the debate over migration. 'And this has been one of the main reasons why the election has been really shifted toward focusing around migration,' said Sarah Wagner, an assistant professor at Queen's University Belfast. 'It’s quite different to the election campaigns that we saw back in 2021, where a lot of the parties were talking quite a lot about climate change, for example,' Wagner told VOA. Despite its growing popularity in some parts of the country, the rhetoric of the AfD and its supporters repulses many Germans. Large protests against the far right have been held in Berlin and other cities in the lead-up to the election. Cost of living While immigration is dominating the campaigns, analysts say the cost of living is at the forefront of voters’ minds as Europe’s biggest economy struggles to emerge from an inflation crisis. Germany’s past reliance on cheap Russian energy and Europe’s rapid severing of ties with the Kremlin have seen prices soar. Germany’s powerhouse carmakers are facing stiff competition from China, while the threat of U.S. import tariffs looms over the election, along with U.S. demands for a huge rise in defense spending. Economic pressures led to the collapse of the three-party coalition government in November. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats wants to increase borrowing to fill a $26 billion hole in the 2025 budget and to help fund military aid for Ukraine. Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union, argues that the country shouldn’t take on more debt and should instead seek to stimulate greater economic growth. 'The economy of the Federal Republic of Germany is now bringing up the rear in the European Union. We are in last place,' Merz told lawmakers on Feb. 11. Firewall Polls suggest that the Christian Democrats will win the election but finish well short of a majority. Merz has ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD, despite relying on their votes to pass a recent motion in parliament calling for tougher immigration controls. Mainstream German parties have sought to exclude the far right from power since the end of World War II by refusing to enter coalitions or relying on their votes in parliament, a policy known as the 'firewall.' The policy drew criticism from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who surprised delegates at the Munich Security Conference on Friday with a speech focusing on a purported democratic backsliding among European allies. 'Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don’t,' Vance said before meeting Weidel on the sidelines of the Munich summit. ‘American interference’ Mainstream German parties united in rejecting Vance’s intervention. On Monday, Scholz said, 'When a vice president interferes in the German election campaign and says extreme right-wing parties are not so bad, I say that we think extreme right-wing parties are bad, and we don’t want to work with them.' Merz echoed those concerns. 'The Americans are questioning democratic institutions. And they are interfering quite openly in an election, including in relation to democratic parties and their majorities. And I have to say, it disturbs me,' Merz told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.	https://www.voanews.com/a/immigration-cost-of-living-frustrate-voters-as-german-elections-loom/7979704.html	2025-02-19T00:13:38-08:00	
Russian attack injures at least 4 in Odesa	Officials in southern Ukraine said Wednesday that Russian aerial attacks overnight injured at least four people and damaged civilian infrastructure. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that Russian forces carried out what he called a 'massive' drone attack that disrupted power and heat services. He said the damage included a children’s clinic and a kindergarten. Russian attacks overnight also damaged power lines in the Cherkasy region, where Governor Ihor Taburets said debris from destroyed drones damaged eight houses. Ukraine’s military said it shot down 106 of the 167 drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said. Russia’s military said Wednesday it shot down about 30 Ukrainian drones overnight, mostly over the Bryansk region where officials said there were no reports of damage or casualties. Ukrainian forces attacked an oil refinery overnight in the Russian city of Syzran, in the Samara region. Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev said on Telegram that the situation at the refinery was under control, and that the attack caused no major damage. Syzran is about 800 kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border, making the attack unusual in how far into Russia Ukrainian forces decided to strike. Most Ukrainian attacks take place in regions along the border between the two countries. Oil facilities and military airfields are among the most common targets for the deeper attacks.

Panama says many migrants deported from the US agree to be returned to home countries	PANAMA CITY — Panama's security minister said on Tuesday that more than half of the migrants deported from the United States to transit points Panama in recent days had accepted voluntary repatriations to their home countries, largely in Asia or the Middle East. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration recently deported the migrants on three flights, part of his crackdown on unlawful migration. The 299 migrants have been staying at a hotel in Panama City under the protection of local authorities and with the financial support of the United States through the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency, Security Minister Frank Abrego said. 'Today I can tell you that 171 of the (migrants) have accepted to return voluntarily,' said Abrego, adding that the others will leave gradually when the U.N. provides them with their return transportation. In the interim, those migrants will likely be transferred to a shelter near the Darien Gap jungle in southern Panama that connects Central America with South America. After talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month, Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino announced that a deal signed in July with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security could be expanded so that Venezuelan, Colombian and Ecuadorean migrants could also be repatriated from Panama.	https://www.voanews.com/a/panama-says-many-migrants-deported-from-the-us-agree-to-be-returned-to-home-countries/7980201.html	2025-02-18T22:59:34-08:00	
New Zealand must ‘reset’ Cook Islands ties after China pact, foreign minister says	New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on Wednesday his country must 'reset' its relationship with the Cook Islands government after its Pacific neighbor signed agreements with China without consultation. In a speech to the Pacific Island Political Science Association in Wellington, Peters said Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown’s opaque dealings with Beijing was the latest attempt to test constitutional ties with New Zealand. 'While the connection between the people of the Cook Islands and New Zealand remains resolutely strong, we currently face challenges in the government-to-government relationship,' he said. 'We are going to need to reset the government-to-government relationship.' The Cook Islands is a self-governing nation and maintains free association with Wellington, sharing a head of state and citizenship rights. It is permitted an independent foreign policy, but the two countries are required to consult on security, defense and foreign policy issues. Brown’s visit to Beijing this month resulted in a strategic partnership with China spanning education, the economy, infrastructure, fisheries, disaster management and seabed mining. It set off alarm bells in New Zealand due to concerns with China’s growing presence in the region and the potential threats to the country’s national security. While the Cook Islands government has released details of the strategic partnership, Peters said New Zealand had not seen a number of memoranda of understanding also signed with China. 'New Zealand and the Cook Islands people remain, as of this evening, in the dark over all but one the agreements signed by China and the Cooks last week,' Peters said. Brown’s deal with China follows an attempt by the Cooks to create its own passports and citizenship, a proposal New Zealand said would require the islands to become fully independent to do. Separately, Peters also addressed tensions with Kiribati after its government canceled a planned visit by New Zealand officials at short notice. Kiribati has also signed a series of bilateral deals with China in recent years. Peters said Wellington had committed more than $57 million in aid to the Pacific island nation over the past three years and needed to reassess how funds were being used.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-must-reset-cook-islands-ties-after-china-pact-foreign-minister-says/7980196.html	2025-02-18T22:13:20-08:00	
Questions emerge about what may have caused Delta plane to burst into flames and flip over	TORONTO — Investigators will consider the weather conditions, as well as the possibility of human error or an aircraft malfunction as they try to determine why a Delta Air Lines jet burst into flames and flipped upside down as it tried to land in Toronto, aviation experts said Tuesday. Witnesses and video from the scene Monday afternoon shows the plane landing so hard that its right wing is sheared off. It bursts into flames before sliding down the runway and flipping over. Miraculously, all 80 people on board the flight from Minneapolis to Toronto’s Pearson International Airport survived. 'It appears from the video that the plane landed so hard that the right main gear collapsed. The tail and right wing began skidding causing the plane to roll over to the right,' Ella Atkins, the head of Virginia Tech’s aerospace and ocean engineering department and a pilot. 'During the rollover, the right wing and tail sheared off, and a fire ignited, likely due to skidding and fuel leakage at least from a right-wing tank.' All but two of the 21 people injured on the flight have been released from hospitals, the airport CEO said Tuesday. 'How grateful we are there was no loss of life, or life-threatening injuries,' Deborah Flint, CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, said during a news conference. 'The crew heroically led passengers to safety.' Crash investigation Communications between the tower and pilot were normal on approach and it’s not clear what went wrong when the plane — a Mitsubishi CRJ-900 made by the Canadian company Bombardier — touched down. Aviation experts said investigators will consider conditions on the ground, the pilot's actions before landing, and potential problems with the landing gear. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is leading the investigation with support from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Juan Browne, a commercial pilot who discusses aviation incidents on his popular YouTube channel, said preliminary data suggests the speed and rate of descent, crosswinds and the weather were 'within limits.' But Browne raised concerns about the pilots' actions before landing. 'It appears that the aircraft simply did not flare at all,' Browne said. Flaring slows the aircraft’s rate of descent. 'They just drove it into the runway.' At the time of the crash, Pearson was experiencing blowing snow and winds of 51 kph, gusting to 65 kph, according to the Meteorological Service of Canada. The temperature was about minus 8.6 degrees Celsius. Browne said blowing snow reduces visibility. Michael McCormick, an assistant professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, said investigators would look closely at the landing gear to make sure it was properly locked in place, and would consider staffing on the ground and in the aircraft. 'They will look at the number of people working both on the aircraft and the control towers. And they will look at their schedules,' McCormick said. 'Are they well-rested? Are they well-staffed?' A Canadian investigator refused to comment on preliminary theories. 'At this point, it’s far too early to say what the cause of this accident might be,' TSB Senior Investigator Ken Webster said in a video statement Tuesday, as he stood near the remains of the aircraft. He said investigators will examine the wreckage and runway, and have removed the cockpit voice and flight data recorders and sent them to the lab for analysis. ‘Everything just kind of went sideways’ Peter Carlson, who was traveling to Toronto for a paramedics’ conference, said the landing was 'very forceful.' 'All the sudden, everything just kind of went sideways and the next thing I know, it’s kind of a blink, and I’m upside down, still strapped in,' he told CBC News. That everyone survived the Delta crash is a testament to the safety improvements made by airlines and aircraft manufacturers, including wings that are designed to come off to reduce explosions, well-trained flight crews and seats built to withstand impacts of up to 16 times the force of gravity. 'That seat is your single best resource in order to keep you protected,' McCormick said. 'There’s a reason why the flight attendants walk around the aircraft prior to (landing) ... to make sure everybody has their seat belts fastened.' But is it safe to fly? The crash was the fourth major aviation accident in North America in recent weeks. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And on Feb. 6, 10 people were killed in a plane crash in Alaska. Nevertheless, according to Jeff Guzzetti, an airline safety consultant and a former FAA and NTSB investigator, air travel is 'extremely safe.' 'The odds of getting injured or killed in a commercial airline accident is far less than driving in your car,' Guzzetti said. Still, he worries about layoffs at the Federal Aviation Administration under the Trump administration. ‘’I am concerned that the proposed cuts and changes to the FAA may increase the risk of further accidents,' he said. The Delta flight was cleared to land at about 2:10 p.m. Audio recordings show the control tower warned the pilots of a possible air flow 'bump' on approach. 'It was windy, but the airplanes are designed and certified to handle that,' said John Cox, CEO of aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida. 'The pilots are trained and experienced to handle that.' Carlson said when he took off his seat belt, he crashed onto the ceiling, which had become the floor. He smelled gas, saw aviation fuel cascading down the cabin windows and knew they all had to get out. Carlson and another man assisted a mother and her son out of the plane, then Carlson dropped onto the snowy tarmac. 'All of us just wanted to be out of the aircraft,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/questions-emerge-about-what-may-have-caused-delta-plane-to-burst-into-flames-and-flip-over-/7980194.html	2025-02-18T22:07:15-08:00	
US condemns 'dangerous' maneuvers by Chinese navy in South China Sea	MANILA, Philippines — The United States condemned the 'dangerous' maneuvers of a Chinese navy helicopter that endangered the safety of a Philippine government aircraft patrolling a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, its ambassador to Manila said on Wednesday. In a post on X, Ambassador MaryKay Carlson also called on China 'to refrain from coercive actions and settle its disputes peacefully in accordance with international law.' The Philippines said late on Tuesday it was 'deeply disturbed' by the Chinese navy's 'unprofessional and reckless' flight actions and that it will make a diplomatic protest. Manila's coast guard said the Chinese navy helicopter performed dangerous flight maneuvers when it flew close to a government aircraft conducting surveillance over the Scarborough Shoal, endangering the lives of its pilots and passengers. China disputed the Philippines' account, saying on Tuesday its aircraft 'illegally intruded' into China's airspace and accused its Southeast Asian neighbor of 'spreading false narratives.' Named after a British ship that was grounded on the atoll nearly three centuries ago, the Scarborough Shoal is one of the most contested maritime features in the South China Sea, where Beijing and Manila have clashed repeatedly. 'The Philippines has undeniable sovereignty and jurisdiction over Bajo de Masinloc,' its maritime council said in a statement, using Manila's name for the shoal. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, putting it at odds with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. A 2016 arbitration ruling invalidated China's expansive claims but Beijing does not recognize the decision.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-condemns-dangerous-maneuvers-by-chinese-navy-in-south-china-sea/7980179.html	2025-02-18T21:08:50-08:00	
Senate advances nomination of Trump FBI pick Kash Patel	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to advance the nomination of Kash Patel to be the director of the FBI, putting a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and a critic of the bureau on track to run the most prominent U.S. law enforcement agency. The Senate voted 48-45 along party lines on a procedural measure setting the stage for a final confirmation vote on one of Trump’s most controversial nominees later this week. Patel, a former intelligence and Defense Department official in Trump’s first term, has called for a radical reshaping of the FBI, pledging to expand its role on illegal immigration and violent crime, core Trump priorities. Patel has been among the most vocal critics of FBI investigations into Trump on issues ranging from Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump’s retention of classified documents at his Florida club and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Democrats have called Patel unfit to lead the FBI, pointing to his embrace of false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election and FBI agents fomenting the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But Patel has attracted broad support from Republicans, who have touted him as a reformer. A Senate panel voted 12-10 along party lines last week to send his nomination to the full Senate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-advances-nomination-of-trump-fbi-pick-kash-patel/7980183.html	2025-02-18T21:00:05-08:00	
Senate confirms Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary	Washington — The Senate confirmed wealthy financier Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary Tuesday, putting in place a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump's hardline trade policies. At the Commerce Department, Lutnick, who was CEO at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will oversee 50,000 employees who do everything from collecting economic statistics to running the census to issuing weather reports. But he's likely to spend a lot of time — along with Jamieson Greer, Trump's nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator — managing the president's aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S. trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike. The Senate vote to confirm Lutnick was 51-45. Trump views the tariffs as a versatile economic tool. They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy. At his confirmation hearing last month, Lutnick dismissed as 'nonsense'' the idea that tariffs contribute to inflation. He expressed support for deploying across-the-board tariffs 'country by country'' to strong-arm other countries into lowering barriers to American exports. Trump last week announced plans for 'reciprocal'' tariffs — raising U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have governed world trade for decades. Since the 1960s, tariff rates have mostly emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Trump is commandeering the process. The president has also imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. He has threatened — and delayed until March 4 — 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Lutnick was CEO at Cantor Fitzgerald when its offices were hit in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. The firm lost two-thirds of its employees — 658 people — that day, including Lutnick's brother. Howard Lutnick led the firm's recovery and is a member of the Board of Directors of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Lutnick has promised to sell off his business holdings. They're complicated. His financial disclosure statement showed that he had positions in more than 800 businesses and other private organizations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-howard-lutnick-as-commerce-secretary/7980176.html	2025-02-18T20:31:43-08:00	
Ukrainian drone hits oil pumping station	Russia shot down 21 Ukrainian drones late Tuesday, but a drone attack on an oil pumping station in southern Russia reduced oil supplies for Kazakhstan and the global market, Russian officials said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces said one of their drones struck and knocked out a North Korean self-propelled howitzer on the eastern front. 'In Luhansk region, fighters of the 412th separate regiment of Nemesis drones struck a very rare M-1978 North Korean self-propelled artillery vehicle with a gun caliber of 170 mm,' the Ukrainian military posted on the Telegram messaging app. The Russian defense ministry said 20 drones in the Bryansk region on the Ukrainian border and another in Crimea were shot down within an hour late Tuesday. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the drone attack on the pumping station reduced oil flows through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium by 30%-40% on Tuesday. 'As a result of the attack, energy equipment, a gas turbine unit, and a substation were damaged,' he said on Russian television. CPC pumps crude from companies that include Chevron and Exxon Mobil, Reuters reported. Novak said repairs might take several months. Earlier Tuesday, a Russian drone hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dolynska, officials said Tuesday, injuring at least three people. Andriy Raikovych, governor of the Kirovohrad region where the attack took place, said on Telegram that authorities evacuated dozens of people from the building and that those injured included a mother and two children. The attack was part of a widespread Russian aerial assault overnight, which the Ukrainian military said included 176 drones. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 103 of the drones, with intercepts taking place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said Tuesday. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from a destroyed drone damaged four houses in his region.

Brazil's former President Bolsonaro charged with attempting coup	RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil's prosecutor-general on Tuesday formally charged former President Jair Bolsonaro with attempting a coup to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat, in a plot that included a plan to poison his successor and current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and kill a Supreme Court judge. Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet alleges that Bolsonaro and 33 others participated in a plan to remain in power. The alleged plot, he wrote, included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of the former president. 'The members of the criminal organization structured a plan at the presidential palace to attack institutions, aiming to bring down the system of the powers and the democratic order, which received the sinister name of 'Green and Yellow Dagger,'' Gonet wrote in a 272-page indictment. 'The plan was conceived and taken to the knowledge of the president, and he agreed to it.' Bolsonaro is often seen in Brazil's yellow-and-green national soccer jersey and the colors have become associated with his political movement In November, Brazil's Federal Police filed a 884-page report with Gonet detailing the scheme. They allege a systematic effort to sow distrust in the electoral system, drafting a decree to provide legal cover for the plot, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan and inciting a riot in the capital. In the indictment, Gonet described the alleged crimes as part of a chain of events articulated with an overarching objective of stopping Bolsonaro from leaving office, 'contrary to the result of the popular will at the polls.' The Supreme Court will analyze the charges and, if accepted, Bolsonaro will stand trial. The far-right leader denies wrongdoing. 'I have no concerns about the accusations, zero,' Bolsonaro told journalists earlier on Tuesday during a visit to the Senate in Brasilia. 'Have you seen the coup decree, by any chance? You haven't. Neither have I,' he added. Fabio Wajngarten, a lawyer for Bolsonaro, did not immediately comment on the charges but said there will be a statement without saying when. As well as participating in a coup d'état, the 34 defendants are accused of participating in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage qualified by violence and serious threat against the state's assets, and deterioration of listed heritage, according to a statement from the Prosecutor General's press office. Gonet said the criminal organization he charged 'had, as leaders, the (then) president himself and his running mate, Gen. Braga Netto.' 'Both accepted, stimulated, and performed acts that are described in our criminal legislation as attacking the existence and the Independence of (the branches) of power and of the democratic rule,' Gonet wrote in his report. The indictments, based on manuscripts, digital files, spreadsheets, and message exchanges, expose a scheme to disrupt democratic order, according to the prosecutor-general's office. The charges are 'historic,' said Luis Henrique Machado, a criminal attorney and professor at the IDP university in Brasilia, adding that he expects the Supreme Court to accept the charges and put Bolsonaro on trial sometime before the end of next year. 'The charges show Brazil's institutions are robust, independent and agile,' Machado said. 'They are a role model for other countries where democracy is at risk.' Bolsonaro is barred from running in the 2026 election after judges with the country's top electoral court ruled that he abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the country's electronic voting system. Following Tuesday's charges, Bolsonaro will 'position himself as a victim,' said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro has previously said his legal woes are an attempt to stop him from returning to office. 'There are polls saying he would be competitive in the 2026 elections against Lula, one of them published today,' said Melo. 'There's going to be political dust, but it will settle.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-former-president-bolsonaro-charged-with-attempting-coup/7980166.html	2025-02-18T19:44:51-08:00	
Chinese influence in South Korea a focus in Yoon impeachment hearings, analysts say	WASHINGTON — South Korea’s Constitutional Court is approaching the final phase of proceedings before it decides in March whether to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his brief martial law bid in December. Since its first official hearing on Jan. 14, exactly a month after the National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon, the court has held nine hearings; the last is scheduled for Thursday. China has become a central issue at some of the hearings, with analysts saying that South Korea-U.S. counterintelligence coordination is crucial in deterring Beijing influence operations that threaten both countries. Yoon's attorney, Cha Gi-hwan, raised concerns about what he alleged was China's interference in South Korean politics, elections and media at several proceedings, apparently in defense of Yoon's statement made in December. Yoon had said 'anti-state forces' were operating in South Korea while explaining his decision to impose martial law at the time and highlighted Chinese nationals using a drone to film a U.S. aircraft carrier docked at the port city of Busan. He had said the opposition parties blocked a revision to anti-espionage law, preventing the prosecution of foreign nationals spying on South Korea. The ruling People Power Party (PPP) pushed for an amendment to the law to broaden its scope from targeting 'enemy states' to include 'foreign countries,' citing threats posed by Chinese espionage. The opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) blocked the revision for fear of potential misuse of the law. Cha said at a hearing on Feb. 11 that China has been interfering in South Korean politics by having its companies and people residing in South Korea fund and support pro-China politicians, manipulate public opinion and spread fake news unfavorable to those who oppose pro-China politicians running for election. Chinese Ambassador to Seoul Dai Bing on Feb. 10 denied widespread accusations among Yoon's supporters that Beijing interfered in South Korean politics and elections. He wrote on X that Beijing 'has all along upheld the principle of noninterference in other countries' internal affairs.' Growing threat In testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month, Dartmouth University professor Jennifer Lind said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) conducts malign influence operations that aim 'to bolster authoritarianism, discredit democratic governance and reshape global norms in China's interests.' The Senate hearing was about 'The Malign Influence of the People’s Republic of China' in the U.S. and abroad. Analysts in Washington said if Yoon is removed from the office, China will conduct full-fledged malign operations in the country. 'I would expect Beijing to increase its efforts, as it sees South Korea's political upheaval as ripe for Chinese malicious intervention,' said Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow at the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University. 'China's goal will be to weaken the democracy and to support those in favor of better ties with Beijing at the expense of the U.S. alliance,' said Wilder, who served as the CIA's deputy assistant director for East Asia and the Pacific from 2015 to 2016. 'The key to defeating China's ambition is intense and sustained counterintelligence programs. The United States has a great deal to teach South Korea in this area, and the CIA and the FBI should work with the South Koreans to improve their ability to spot and deter Chinese covert operations,' Wilder added. 'Everything on the Korean Peninsula affects U.S. security,' said David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy. 'President Yoon is right to call attention to what China is doing. Ideally, it would be wonderful to have a coordinated [U.S.] response with South Korea.' US-South Korea coordination If the court decides to remove Yoon from office, main opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is considered a candidate for an election to be held within 60 days. Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said, 'Statements by party chief Lee Jae-myung indicate the party will pursue a more conciliatory policy toward China and North Korea, more antagonistic toward Japan, and place less emphasis on strengthening the alliance with the United States.' Klingner, formerly the CIA's deputy division chief, told VOA on Thursday, 'The Trump administration will look for South Korea and other Indo-Pacific democracies to pursue stronger policies against the multifaceted China threat, including supporting roles in Taiwan contingencies. The [main] Democratic Party of Korea would resist such entreaties, which will cause strains with Washington.' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said at a news conference after meeting with NATO defense ministers in Belgium on Thursday that working with Pacific allies South Korea, Japan and Australia will be 'critical' in dealing with the Chinese threat. Korean Service's Kim Hyungjin contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-influence-in-south-korea-a-focus-in-yoon-impeachment-hearings-analysts-say/7980160.html	2025-02-18T19:21:57-08:00	
66 measles cases reported in US states of Texas, New Mexico	Measles is making a comeback in the United States. Fifty-eight cases of the highly contagious disease were reported Tuesday by health officials in rural West Texas, while eight cases were confirmed in neighboring eastern New Mexico. Texas officials say the outbreak there, the largest in almost 30 years, is mainly confined to Gaines County, with 45 infections, but four other counties account for an additional 13 cases. The Texas measles cases, according to health officials, have occurred mainly among a 'close-knit, undervaccinated' Mennonite community. Authorities say at least three of the New Mexico cases are in counties that border Texas' Gaines County. Earlier this month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 14 measles cases across the country. Mayo Clinic describes measles as 'a childhood infection caused by a virus. Once quite common, measles can now almost always be prevented with a vaccine ... measles spreads easily and can be serious, and even fatal, for small children.' Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for two hours. As many as nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. However, in recent years, the necessity and safety of the vaccinations designed to prevent the disease have come under question, with some parents citing a now-discredited study that linked the measles vaccine to autism. Another unfortunate development in the fight against measles happened during the COVID-19 pandemic when many children missed their vaccinations. Los Angeles Cedars Sinai said in a statement in February 2024 that 61 million fewer doses of the measles vaccine were distributed nationwide from 2020 to 2022. Before the MMR vaccination, which addresses not only measles, but also mumps and rubella, was introduced in the U.S. in 1963, there were 3 million to 4 million measles cases every year. Now there are usually fewer than 200 cases per year, but pockets of measles persist in areas that still resist the vaccinations. The shots are first given to toddlers between 12 and 15 months and then again at 4 to 6 years of age.	https://www.voanews.com/a/measles-cases-reported-in-us-states-of-texas-new-mexico/7980149.html	2025-02-18T19:04:11-08:00	
Saudi prince proving crucial to Trump efforts to end Ukraine, Gaza wars	WASHINGTON — Top U.S. and Russian officials wrapped up their meetings Tuesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a pathway to end the war in Ukraine, days before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is set to convene a summit with leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to discuss an Arab response to U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to take over Gaza. The two separate talks reflect the growing role of the prince in Trump's efforts to fulfill his campaign promise to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. On Tuesday, Trump again declared he would swiftly end fighting. 'I have the power to end this war,' Trump said from Mar-a-Lago, his residence in Florida, dismissing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's concern that Kyiv was excluded from the Riyadh meeting. 'Well, you've been there for three years, you should have ended it,' he said of Zelenskyy in response to a reporter's question. 'I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land.' Trump did not clarify which part of land would remain Ukrainian. Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and now controls parts of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, and fighting has been ongoing at the borders of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The Saudi talks signaled a major détente between Washington and Moscow and an abrupt end of U.S. policy under former President Joe Biden to isolate Russia and support Ukraine 'for as long as it takes.' Instead, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dangled the prospects of 'the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians' on trade and other global issues when the war ends. Arab response to Gaza plan Later this week, Prince Mohammed will bring together leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the UAE to discuss an Arab response to Trump's vow to take over Gaza and create a 'Riviera in the Middle East' by expelling Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries. Trump's plan has angered regional leaders, who are now scrambling to come up with a counteroffer that they will discuss in Riyadh ahead of a broader Arab League gathering in Cairo next week. One of the Arab proposals being discussed is an Egyptian-led plan that involves forming a national Palestinian committee to govern Gaza without Hamas and raising up to $20 billion from Arab and Gulf states over three years for reconstruction. As Saudi Arabia makes a play for the diplomatic mainstage, Prince Mohammed is motivated to be proactive rather than reactive, to counsel pragmatism rather than rigidity, said Laura Blumenfeld, a senior fellow and Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies. Blumenfeld told VOA that the prince could pair his approach with a language that Trump likes to speak: investments. This week, global financiers and tech executives will gather in Miami, Florida, in a conference hosted by the Future Investment Initiative Institute, a nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund — the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund led by the prince. Reuters, quoting several people with knowledge of the event, reported that Trump is scheduled to deliver an address at the meeting. 'Trump is a peacemaker in a hurry, with his eye on the Nobel Prize. [The prince] is a dealmaker in a hurry, with his eye on the Saudi Vision 2030 economic diversification plan,' Blumenfeld added. 'The two men are a match made in transactional heaven.' Prince Mohammed the power broker With his efforts focused on Ukraine and Gaza, the 39-year-old de facto leader of Saudi Arabia has emerged as a power broker that Trump leans on for his foreign policy goals. Prince Mohammed has done this in part by leveraging close ties during Trump's first term, maintaining business ties while Trump was out of office, and further expanding the relationship since the president's inauguration last month. Saudi Arabia was Trump's first foreign trip in 2017, where he signed several deals, including a $110 billion arms deal, which could expand up to $350 billion over 10 years. Trump spoke openly about the transactional nature of the visit, telling reporters days after his second inauguration in January that the reason he chose Riyadh for that first visit was because 'they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products.' Trump suggested on the day of his last inauguration that he would again make Saudi Arabia his first destination in return for Saudi funds, and days later, the prince told him during a phone call that he planned to invest $600 billion or more in the U.S. over the next four years. In 2021, Saudi Arabia invested $2 billion with a firm that belonged to Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and former aide. The Trump Organization has also expanded its real estate presence in the region, announcing it had leased its brand to two real estate projects in Riyadh in December after launching the Trump Tower project in Jeddah. As Prince Mohammed cultivated his political and business ties with Trump, he maintained a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid Biden's effort to isolate the Russian leader following his 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'The crown prince has been making the argument for the last five years that it's in America's interest that Saudi Arabia maintains very good ties with Russia and China,' said Ali Shihabi, author and commentator on the politics and economics of Saudi Arabia. 'Saudi Arabia was insisting on maintaining a multipolar policy while maintaining very strong ties with the United States,' he told VOA. The prince is poised to host a summit between the two leaders that Trump said he agreed to during his call with Putin last week. The summit, Shihabi said, would be an example of how the prince's gambit has paid off. 'I don't think there are any leaders in the world that have the relationship that the crown prince has with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump,' he said. There is also a practical reason. The kingdom is not a signatory of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Putin in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-prince-proving-crucial-to-trump-efforts-to-end-ukraine-gaza-wars/7980148.html	2025-02-18T18:54:02-08:00

Sudanese RSF paramilitaries kill 100s in White Nile state	CAIRO — Attacks by Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Force have killed hundreds of civilians, including infants, in White Nile state, Sudanese officials and rights groups said Tuesday. Sudan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the paramilitary group targeted civilians in the past few days in villages in the al-Gitaina area after they were 'overwhelmed by its devastating defeat' by the Sudanese army. The statement put the death toll at 433, while the Preliminary Committee of Sudan Doctors' Trade Union put that figure at 300. Emergency Lawyers, a rights group tracking violence against civilians, said in a statement Tuesday morning that more than 200 people, including women and children, were killed in RSF attacks and hundreds of others were injured over the past three days. 'The attacks included executions, kidnapping, forced disappearance, looting, and shooting those trying to escape,' the group said. Minister of Culture and Information Khalid Ali Aleisir said on Facebook that recent attacks by the RSF in Al-Kadaris and Al-Khalwat villages in White Nile state are the latest 'systematic violence against defenseless civilians.' The Sudanese military said Saturday it had advanced in White Nile and 'liberated more cities and villages,' cutting crucial supply routes to the RSF, a rival group it has battled for control of the country since April 2023. The war in Sudan has killed more than 24,000 people and driven more than 14 million people — about 30% of the population — from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries. The U.N. on Tuesday said that throughout 2024, its human rights office documented more than 4,200 civilian killings, adding that the total number is likely much higher. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed on Monday for $6 billion for its 2025 humanitarian response in Sudan, to help about 21 million people in the country and the millions who fled the war abroad. 'This is a humanitarian crisis that is truly unprecedented in its scale and gravity,' said U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher in a statement, 'and it demands a response unprecedented in scale and intent.' Meanwhile, Norwegian Minister of International Development Asmund Aukrust denounced the escalation in violence and attacks against civilians. 'I am deeply concerned about the sharp increase in civilian deaths caused by the intensified conflict in Sudan. I am also shocked by reports of indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure. Any such attacks must stop immediately,' Aukrust said in a statement published on the web portal for the Norwegian government. The developments on the ground have given the military the upper hand in the war as the paramilitary suffered multiple blows, including losing control of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, and other areas in the province. The Sudanese military also regained control of the country's largest oil refinery. The RSF appears to have lost control of the Greater Khartoum area and the cities of Omdurman and Khartoum Bahri. The war has shown no end in sight despite international mediation attempts, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudanese-rsf-paramilitaries-kill-100s-in-white-nile-state-/7980135.html	2025-02-18T18:24:46-08:00

Yazidi woman enslaved by Islamic State relocates to Germany months after rescue	WASHINGTON — A Yazidi woman who survived rape and enslavement by Islamic State and was rescued from Gaza last October in a U.S.-led operation arrived in Germany on Tuesday, February 18. Fawzia Amin Saydo, 21, was kidnapped by IS militants from her hometown of Sinjar, northern Iraq, in August 2014, just a month before her 11th birthday. She endured a decade of suffering, including rape, enslavement and forced marriage to a Palestinian IS fighter in Syria before being sent to Gaza to live with her captor's mother. She was rescued from Gaza on October 1, 2024, during a secret U.S.-led operation that involved cooperation among human rights activists, as well as Israeli, Jordanian, Iraqi and United Nations officials. Saydo arrived about 5 p.m. local time at Hannover Airport in Langenhagen, Germany, where she was received by her lawyer, Kareba Hagemann, a group of relatives and human rights activists. 'She has arrived in Germany safely, and she is very relieved,' Hagemann told VOA. 'The first thing Fawzia said upon her arrival was, 'Please make sure my family can also come join me and live here with me.'' The German consulate in Baghdad on February 10 issued Saydo a visa on a humanitarian basis. Her mother, grandmother and five siblings are still in Iraq. 'Her family, except her two sisters, wanted to go as well, but the German government made it clear that they will only agree to take in Fawzia,' Hagemann said. 'There is no legal obligation to take her, but it is an act of humanity, which is why I was thankful to them to agree to take Fawzia at least.' According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, Germany is the third-largest refugee-hosting country in the world and the largest in the European Union, with 2.5 million refugees from all over the world, including more than 1 million refugees from Ukraine. Since the 2014 Yazidi genocide carried out by Islamic State in northern Iraq, the number of Yazidi asylum-seekers in Germany has risen to more than 200,000. The ongoing debate within German society about deporting refugees, however, has put many asylum-seekers from the religious minority at risk of deportation. This is particularly due to some politicians arguing that the defeat of IS in 2017 has ended group-specific persecution in Iraq — a claim contested by human rights organizations. On Monday, German authorities announced the deportation of 47 Iraqis whose asylum applications had been denied. Among the more than 300,000 Iraqi refugees and migrants living in Germany, refugee organizations estimate that nearly 700 Iraqis were deported in 2024 alone, with about 10,000 currently facing the risk of deportation. Hagemann, who is also a Yazidi, told VOA the uncertainty has taken a psychological toll on many Yazidi asylum-seekers who fled Iraq due to persecution. While the exact number of deported Yazidis remains unclear, she estimated that at least five have been sent back to Iraq and the Kurdistan region. 'Those Yazidis want to build their new life and integrate, even though some of them find it hard to learn a new language because of their trauma,' Hagemann said. 'Unfortunately, most of them are not as lucky as Fawzia to be supported, and [they] decide to come to Germany illegally, where they face deportation and have been held in captivity for years.' In January 2023, the German Bundestag [parliament] passed a resolution that recognized Islamic State's crimes against Yazidis as genocide. Since then, the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein have enacted laws to protect Yazidi asylum-seekers from deportation. Hagemann argued that allowing Yazidi survivors, particularly those who have been victims of rape, to remain in Germany would provide them with a chance to heal — an opportunity, she said, they cannot find in Iraq. 'We have been able to schedule a therapy session for Fawzia on Thursday, just two days after her arrival in Germany, to enable her start a self-determining life again,' Hagemann said. Rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, have reported that Yazidi survivors do not get adequate psychological support upon their return to Iraq. Activists from the Montreal-based Liberation of Christian and Yazidi Children of Iraq (CYCI), who assisted Saydo in relocating to Germany, stated that her return from Gaza to Iraq only marked a minor improvement in her life, as she continued to endure neglect and targeting from militants in her hometown of Sinjar. 'She kept saying, 'I have been brought from one hell to another,'' said human rights activist and CYCI member Dawood Jajju, describing Saydo's dire situation in Iraq. Activists say Saydo and her family were threatened by Iraqi militants three weeks after her return to Sinjar after she appeared in a news article in which she praised Israel for its role in taking her out of Hamas-controlled Gaza. Iraqi officials tasked to work on her case were not available to comment. Steve Maman, founder of CYCI, told VOA that Saydo was summoned several times by Iraqi authorities 'who mistakenly believe she is a Zionist and an Israeli-trained agent.' 'Fawzia did not receive any therapy at all. The country has not made any effort or gesture to help her. It seems that Yazidis are second-class citizens in their own country,' Maman said. When Islamic State attacked the Sinjar region in 2014, the group killed nearly 10,000 Yazidis and enslaved more than 6,000 of women and children. Data from the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Region show that some 3,500 Yazidis have been rescued or freed, with some 2,600 still missing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/yazidi-woman-enslaved-by-islamic-state-relocates-to-germany-months-after-rescue/7979829.html	2025-02-18T17:29:29-08:00

Judge won't block Musk, DOGE from federal data, layoffs	WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused Tuesday to immediately block billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan found that there are legitimate questions about Musk's authority but said there isn't evidence of the kind of grave legal harm that would justify a temporary restraining order. The decision came in a lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states challenging DOGE's authority to access sensitive government data. The attorneys general argued that Musk is wielding the kind of power that the Constitution says can only be held by those who are elected or confirmed by the Senate. The Trump administration, for its part, has maintained that layoffs are coming from agency heads, and asserted that despite his public cheering of the effort, Musk isn't directly running DOGE's day-to-day operations himself. DOGE has tapped into computer systems across multiple agencies with the blessing of President Donald Trump, digging into budgets and searching for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse, even as a growing number of lawsuits allege DOGE is violating the law. Chutkan recognized the concerns of the group of states, which include New Mexico and Arizona. 'DOGE's unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion,' she wrote. Their questions about Musk's apparent 'unchecked authority' and lack of Congressional oversight for DOGE are legitimate and they may be able to successfully argue them later. Still, at this point, it remains unclear exactly how DOGE's work will affect the states, and judges can only issue court only issue orders to block specific, immediate harms, she found. Chutkan, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama, previously oversaw the now-dismissed criminal election interference case against Trump in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-won-t-block-musk-doge-from-federal-data-layoffs-/7979818.html	2025-02-18T16:35:52-08:00	
Trump signs order to study how to make IVF more accessible, affordable	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order to study how to expand access to in vitro fertilization and make it more affordable. The order calls for policy recommendations to 'protect IVF access and aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such treatments,' according to the White House. On the campaign trail, Trump called for universal coverage of IVF treatment after his Supreme Court nominees helped to overturn Roe v. Wade, leading to a wave of restrictions in Republican-led states, including some that have threatened access to IVF by trying to define life as beginning at conception. Trump, who was at his Florida residence and club Mar-a-Lago, also signed another executive order and a presidential memorandum. The second executive order outlined the oversight functions of the Office of Management and Budget, while the presidential memorandum called for more transparency from the government, according to White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who Trump called to the podium to detail the orders. The order called for 'radical transparency requirements' for the government, requiring it to detail the 'waste, fraud and abuse' that's found as the Department of Government Efficiency, overseen by Elon Musk, looks to cut government spending. DOGE has often fallen short of the administration's promises of transparency. Musk has taken questions from journalists only once since becoming Trump's most powerful adviser, and he's claimed it's illegal to name people who are working for him. Sometimes DOGE staff members have demanded access to sensitive government databases with little explanation. According to a fact sheet provided by the White House, Trump's IVF order will focus on prioritizing whether there are any current policies 'that exacerbate the cost of IVF treatments.' Last year, Trump declared public support for IVF after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. The decision, which some Republicans and conservatives cheered, touched off immediate backlash. Families 'appreciative,' says Trump On the campaign trail, IVF quickly became a talking point for Trump, who said he strongly supports its availability. In vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and combining them in a lab dish with a man's sperm to create a fertilized embryo, which is then transferred into the woman's uterus in an attempt to create a pregnancy. IVF is done in cycles, and more than one may be required. 'I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of it,' Trump said in brief remarks on the order, before he took questions on a variety of topics. Trump, who spent the morning at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, spoke to reporters hours before his first joint TV interview with adviser Elon Musk airs in prime time. Trump and Musk gave their first joint interview to Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel. The interview was taped on Friday at the White House and is set to air as Musk leads Trump's effort to cut federal spending and slash the federal workforce. Musk has drawn criticism from Democrats in Congress and others for the methods he and his team at DOGE are using to cut spending, including foreign aid, and eliminate jobs across the bureaucracy. The Fox News interview also follows Musk's appearance with Trump in the Oval Office last week, when both defended Musk's approach to federal cost-cutting. In an excerpt from the interview that Fox News released on Sunday, Musk said he 'used to be adored by the left' but 'less so these days' because of the work he's doing at Trump's direction. 'They call it Trump derangement syndrome. You don't realize how real this is until you can't reason with people,' Musk said, adding that normal conversations with Democrats about the president are difficult because 'it's like they've become completely irrational.' Event celebrates 'American Exceptionalism' Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club is the setting Tuesday night for an awards program by America's Future, a conservative group led by Mike Flynn, who briefly served as national security adviser in the Republican president's first term. The program aims to preserve individual rights and promote American values and traditions, according to its website. The event, called Celebrate American Exceptionalism 2025, will honor one member from the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force and the Space Force. The event includes a poolside reception, musical performances and dinner in Mar-a-Lago's Grand Ballroom, where other award presentations are expected from a lineup that includes such names as comedian Russell Brand, singer Ted Nugent and former pro boxer Mike Tyson. It's unclear whether Trump will participate in the event.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-to-study-how-to-make-ivf-more-accessible-affordable/7979778.html	2025-02-18T16:28:35-08:00

US Postal Service head to step down after 5 years	Louis DeJoy, the head of the U.S. Postal Service, intends to step down, the federal agency said Tuesday, after a nearly five-year tenure marked by the coronavirus pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts. In a Monday letter, Postmaster General DeJoy asked the Postal Service Board of Governors to begin looking for his successor. 'As you know, I have worked tirelessly to lead the 640,000 men and women of the Postal Service in accomplishing an extraordinary transformation,' he wrote. 'We have served the American people through an unprecedented pandemic and through a period of high inflation and sensationalized politics.' DeJoy took the helm of the Postal Service in the summer of 2020 during President Donald Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business before taking office and was the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee. DeJoy developed a 10-year plan to modernize operations and stem losses. He previously said that postal customers should get used to 'uncomfortable' rate hikes as the Postal Service seeks to stabilize its finances and become more self-sufficient. The plan calls for making the mail delivery system more efficient and less costly by consolidating mail processing centers. Critics, including members of Congress from several states, have said the first consolidations slowed service and that further consolidations could particularly hurt rural mail delivery. DeJoy has disputed that and told a U.S. House subcommittee during a contentious September hearing that the Postal Service had embarked on long-overdue investments in facilities and making other changes to create 'a Postal Service for the future' that delivered mail more quickly. DeJoy also oversaw the Postal Service during two presidential elections that saw spikes in mail-in ballots. Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge limited one of the Postal Service's cost-cutting practices after finding it contributed to delays in mail delivery. DeJoy had restricted overtime payments for postal workers and stopped the agency's longtime practice of allowing late and extra truck deliveries in the summer of 2020. The moves reduced costs but meant some mail was left to be delivered the following day. DeJoy said in his letter that he was committed to being 'as helpful as possible in facilitating a transition.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-postal-service-head-to-step-down-after-5-years-/7979825.html	2025-02-18T15:48:40-08:00

Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai's 'time is running out,' son says	As pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai spoke in his defense at a Hong Kong court Tuesday, his son Sebastien Lai was in Geneva calling for the United States and other world leaders to help secure this father's release. Speaking on Tuesday at the latest hearing in his national security trial, Lai, 77, denied any intention to incite violence among protesters. He defended an opinion piece published in 2019 in the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper that he founded in which he suggested that pro-democracy protesters establish a leadership structure to weed out those who wished to engage in violence during protests that year. 'By saying they should choose a leadership group, [it means that] they should put down some principle or bottom line for the valiant acts which, basically, is for them to stop the violence,' Lai said in court. The British national has been standing trial for more than a year on charges of collusion with foreign forces and sedition under Hong Kong’s national security law. Lai rejects the charges, which foreign governments and press freedom groups have said are politically motivated. Hong Kong authorities deny that the trial is unfair and have previously told VOA that the government respects press freedom and the rule of law. Lai has been in solitary confinement since late 2020. Sebastien Lai raised concerns about his father’s health as he advocated for him in Geneva. 'I ask that you join my call to free Jimmy Lai and champion him for all he’s given in the hope of freedom,' the younger Lai said Monday at the annual Human Rights and Democracy summit in Geneva. When Beijing’s national security law was enacted in Hong Kong in 2020, Sebastien Lai said his father knew he would be a target. 'But he refused to leave,' he said. 'Six decades after landing on the shore of this island in pursuit of freedom, he decided to stay and stand with his fellow protesters.' Jimmy Lai was born in Guangzhou, China, and fled to Hong Kong when he was 12. He worked in a garment sweatshop before eventually founding the successful clothing brand Giordano. He later moved into media, founding Apple Daily in 1995. Both the United States and Britain have criticized Hong Kong’s case against him. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump in October said he would '100%' get Lai released, without specifying details. Sebestien Lai said Trump’s comment gave the family 'a lot of hope.' But he cautioned that time is running out for his father, who has diabetes. The publisher’s international legal team says he isn’t receiving adequate medical care, which authorities deny. 'His body is breaking down,' Sebastien Lai told Reuters ahead of the summit. 'Time is running out for my father.' Lai’s international legal team urged global leaders to stand up for press freedom at the U.N. Human Rights Council next week. 'How the world responds will send a vital message to authoritarians across the world,' Caoilfhionn Gallagher, head of Lai’s international legal team, told Reuters. Gallagher and her team at the London law firm Doughty Street Chambers have faced significant harassment for their role defending Lai. On social media and in email, Gallagher has faced threats of death, rape and dismemberment, The Guardian reported. She has also been targeted with hundreds of attempts to hack her bank account. The Bar Council, the representative body for barristers in England and Wales, expressed concern about the harassment.

More than 170 migrants now detained at Guantanamo Bay	WASHINGTON — The United States has more than doubled the number of detainees — both those deemed to be a 'high threat' as well as others slated for deportation — at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. As of Tuesday, there were more than 120 of what the administration calls 'criminal aliens' under guard at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, according to a U.S. defense official. Approximately 50 other individuals are also being held at the base's migrant facility, which was being readied to hold nonviolent individuals. Separately, a second U.S. defense official told VOA that as of Monday, the U.S. military had sent a total of 13 flights of undocumented migrants to Guantanamo aboard a mix of C-17 and C-130 military cargo jets. So far, none of the detainees brought to the facilities at Guantanamo Bay have been deported to other countries. Both officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the military's deportation operation. VOA has also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, which is spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, about the growing number of detainees. Last Thursday, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers there were about 68 detainees at the base's prison facility. Admiral Alvin Holsey also told lawmakers that the base's migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500 nonviolent detainees. Efforts are underway to allow it house as many as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation. Holsey said that it was too soon to determine how much it will cost to house the growing number of individuals. 'We're working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,' he said during Thursday's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'We're not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will come. So, we're waiting at this point.' Details about the growing population of detainees at the U.S. naval base in Cuba come just a day after the Department of Homeland Security unveiled what it described as a multimillion-dollar ad campaign warning migrants not to enter the U.S. illegally. 'If you are considering entering America illegally, don't even think about it,' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a video targeting an international audience. 'If you come to our country and you break our laws, we will hunt you down,' she said. 'Criminals are not welcome in the United States.' Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the transfer of a third flight of detainees to the detention center, has repeatedly described the men as 'murderers and vicious gang members' from Venezuela and as 'the worst of the worst.' In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. Last Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been improperly denied access to lawyers. DHS has dismissed the lawsuit's allegations. 'There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,' said a senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with VOA. 'If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers & vicious gang members than they do about American citizens — they should change their name,' the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-170-migrants-now-detained-at-guantanamo-bay/7979741.html	2025-02-18T14:23:41-08:00	
Iran charges British couple with spying	A British couple detained in Iran last month has been charged with spying, Iran's state media reported Tuesday. Britain's Foreign Office has identified the couple as Craig and Lindsay Foreman. 'The detained individuals entered the country as tourists and collected information in several provinces of the country,' reported Iran's judiciary-affiliated Mizan news agency. Iran has accused the couple of having connections with 'hostile countries.' 'We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran,' a British Foreign Office spokesman said Tuesday. 'We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities.' The Associated Press reported that Hugo Shorter, Britain's ambassador to Iran, has met with the couple in the southern city of Kerman, where they are jailed, with Iranian government officials in attendance. The Foreign Office said it is providing the couple with consular assistance and is in close contact with their family. The couple's family said in a statement on Saturday, after the couple's arrest, 'This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time.' The family said it is 'united on our determination to secure their safe return.' The two were traveling around the world on motorbikes, according to an AP report, which said that they crossed Armenia's border into Iran on December 30. Iran has long used Western detainees to gain concessions in negotiations with Western countries, a move Tehran denies. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-charges-british-couple-with-spying-/7979677.html	2025-02-18T12:53:46-08:00	
After resolutions on Sudan, DRC at African Union summit, analysts urge swift action	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Regional analysts are calling for the swift implementation of resolutions made at the recently concluded African Union (AU) Summit in Ethiopia. The summit was dominated by discussions on escalating conflicts in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sudan, as well as concerns over the impact of U.S. aid cuts on the continent. African leaders and delegates from more than 50 countries gathered in Addis Ababa for the 38th AU Summit on Saturday and Sunday. Leaders at the summit called for dialogue to end conflicts in the DRC and Sudan and renewed calls to merge two existing peace processes — the Rwanda Process and the Nairobi Peace Process — to streamline negotiations between the DRC government and M23 rebels. Bankole Adeoye is the AU commissioner for political affairs, peace, and security, expressed concerns about the escalation of the conflict in the DRC. 'We are all very, very concerned about the risk of an open regional war over eastern DRC,' Adeoye said. 'We have reiterated the need for caution and called on the M23 rebels and their supporters to disarm and withdraw.' More than 3,000 people have been killed in clashes between government forces and the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group. The rebels have captured large Congolese cities, including Goma and Bukavu. African leaders also condemned human rights violations caused by the nearly two-year conflict in Sudan. But security analyst Senator Iroegbu said African leaders need to match words with action this time. 'If what's happening in DRC is not well managed it will escalate,' Iroegbu said. '[It's] not just issuing a communique at the end of the meeting; it should be followed up with some strategic measures or plans to ensure that they bring some of these issues to the table and set up mediation teams and let’s look for African solutions to African problems.' Beyond security, leaders further addressed the impact of climate change and food security on the continent, while demanding reparations for centuries of slavery and colonialism. John Mahama, president of the Republic of Ghana, said the economic impact of colonialism has been profound. 'The continent lost trillions of dollars in both human and material resources due to colonial exploitation,' he said. 'Today the descendants of enslaved Africans continue to face economic disparities, social inequality, systemic discrimination and racial prejudices. Addressing these challenges [requires] more than just acknowledging them, it demands action.' African leaders also discussed the impact of U.S. aid cuts, urging the continent to focus on self-sufficiency and domestic funding for development projects. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organization, spoke to Lagos-based Channels Television on the sidelines of the summit. 'Africa we really need to change our mindsets — access to aid I think we can think of it as a thing of the past,' she said. 'We really have to focus on two things — attracting investments and mobilizing our own domestic resources. I think that is the theme that is running through almost all the meetings here at the AU.' Many observers will be watching to see how quickly African leaders move to implement summit resolutions. But analysts warn that delays in securing peace in Sudan and Congo could lead to more casualties and prolonged instability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-urge-swift-action-after-resolutions-on-sudan-drc-at-african-union-summit-/7979599.html	2025-02-18T11:50:45-08:00	
Rubio snubs South Africa's G20 meeting amid diplomatic tensions	Johannesburg — South Africa will host a meeting of foreign ministers from the G20 group of major economies later this week, but the chief diplomat for the world’s largest economy, the U.S., is skipping it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X earlier this month that he would not attend the meeting, taking place Thursday and Friday in Johannesburg, because he objected to the meeting’s agenda, which he described as anti-American. He said South Africa was 'using G20 to promote ‘solidarity, equality, & sustainability.’ In other words: DEI and climate change. My job is to advance America’s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism.' DEI is short for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and in President Donald Trump’s first week in the White House, he signed an executive order to end DEI policies and hiring practices in the federal workforce. 'I think the whole topic of the G20 gathering is one that I don’t think we should be focused on, talking about global inclusion, equity, and these sorts of things,' Rubio later told the press. He continued by saying the forum should be focused on issues 'like terrorism and energy security and the real threats to the national security of multiple countries.' The G20 is a group of the world’s 19 major individual economies as well as the EU and African Union. This year marks the first time an African country is in the rotating presidency position of the G20. While Rubio will not attend, the South African government has confirmed the U.S. will still have a presence at the meeting, likely at a lower level. South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation responded to Rubio in a statement saying: 'Our G20 Presidency, is not confined to just climate change but also equitable treatment for nations of the Global South, ensuring an equal global system for all.' Ronald Lamola, minister of international relations and cooperation, told local TV that the meeting’s agenda had been adopted by all members of the G20 and carries on the themes from previous summits, such as the one in Brazil last year. Deteriorating relations Even before the announcement that Rubio would not be taking part in the foreign ministers’ meeting, there had been a swift deterioration in U.S.-South Africa relations under the new administration in Washington. President Trump accused South Africa’s government of engaging in land grabs and mistreating white minority Afrikaners. He cut U.S. financial assistance to the country. While the South African government did pass a controversial land reform law earlier this year, no land has been seized. The white minority is still one of the country’s most privileged communities and owns the majority of private farmland. Response from other G20 members Several other nations were quick to affirm their attendance at the meeting after Rubio said he will not attend. Those included EU members Germany, Italy and France, whose ambassadors to South Africa posted a joint video on X saying they were 'united in diversity' and shared the South African government’s democratic values. Russia also confirmed Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will attend. 'The priorities stated by the South African presidency are designed to encourage economic growth, reduce inequality and imbalances, and ensure equitable access to financing for countries in the Global South.,' said Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. China likewise confirmed its commitment to the meeting, with ambassador to South Africa Wu Peng meeting foreign minister Lamola just after Rubio’s announcement and posting on X: 'I also expressed China's readiness to support South Africa's G20 Presidency.' Last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, said in a press briefing, 'China stands ready to work with all parties to make this meeting a productive one, and send a strong message of supporting multilateralism, strengthening solidarity and cooperation, and jointly responding to global challenges,' he said. Analysts weigh in Political analysts said Rubio’s absence could provide space for countries hostile to the U.S. to advance their agendas. 'Will we see the increase of countries like Russia and China pushing their lines, their issues, their perspectives in the absence of the US? That’s entirely possible,' Steven Gruzd, from the South African Institute of International Affairs, told VOA. Brooks Spector, a retired U.S. diplomat, said Rubio’s boycott of the meeting was 'a serious misstep.' 'You get to make your points at a meeting, boycotting it simply means your voice is not heard,' he said. 'Calling the meeting 'anti-American' is a misunderstanding of the nature of bilateral, international and multi-lateral discussions.' However, he said he expected Trump would likely still attend the major G20 summit in South Africa in November. In December, the U.S. will take on the presidency of the G20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-snubs-south-africa-s-g20-meeting-amid-diplomatic-tensions/7979557.html	2025-02-18T11:26:58-08:00	
Pakistan set to host first major cricket event in three decades	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan is ready to host the International Cricket Council Champions Trophy 2025 on Wednesday, with eight teams coming together for a major cricketing event in the country for the first time in three decades. Pakistan last hosted a men’s Cricket World Cup in 1996 under the International Cricket Council. The Champions Trophy will see players from Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand Pakistan, and South Africa compete over almost three weeks, with the final scheduled for March 9. All the teams except India will play in three stadiums across Pakistan. All matches involving India will be staged in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, after the Indian cricket board refused to send the team to the archrival country, citing security concerns. Afghanistan’s cricket team faced boycott calls from politicians in England and South Africa, who did not want their cricket boards to play the team because of the Afghan Taliban’s severe restrictions on women’s mobility, education and ability to work. The cricket series begins in Pakistan’s biggest metropolis, Karachi, with the host team playing New Zealand. Long wait for this opportunity International cricket dried up in Pakistan after a 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan national team in Lahore injured six players. Six Pakistani police officers and two passersby were killed. The incident deprived Pakistan of the chance to host the 2009 Champions Trophy and the 2011 Men’s Cricket World Cup. International cricket returned with Zimbabwe’s visit in 2015. Since 2019, several major foreign teams have played in Pakistan. For the nation of cricket lovers, attending a large event at home after more than a decade is nothing short of a dream come true. 'It’s the biggest event for us since 2009, so we are very excited,' said Mohsin Ali. Ali told VOA he paid just over $10 for a ticket to see Pakistan face Bangladesh on Feb. 27 in Rawalpindi, near the capital, Islamabad. 'Pakistani team would play overseas, and we would watch it on TV, which wasn’t much fun,' said Ubaid Hassan, who was a child when international teams shunned Pakistan. Hassan, a captain of the cricket team in his village, has tickets to two matches. Tight security for the event Pakistan is deploying almost 20,000 police officials and personnel across Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi for security on game days, with snipers deployed on buildings surrounding the stadiums. The security situation remains poor in Pakistan with near daily deadly militant attacks in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces. However, the country’s eastern province of Punjab and the southern province of Sindh, where the matches will be played, remain largely calm. Still, in Karachi, the capital of Sindh, paramilitary troops and the military will be on standby to respond to security emergencies during the event. Players are receiving state guest-level security. That means a heavy police contingent at hotels where teams are staying, with their travel routes cleared of all traffic. Only personnel with security clearances are allowed to interact with them. Muhammad Waqas, deputy inspector general of operations for the Punjab police, told VOA that since the 2009 attack, 'sports security and security of international events has become very important for us.' 'Even the slightest administrative lapse will cause embarrassment at a very large level, and if we do a good job and manage things efficiently, the same positive impression will go to a billion odd people,' Waqas said. 'That is why it’s extremely important and is being planned and monitored at the highest level.' Fans coming to the stadium will go through several layers of security, including metal detectors and pat downs. Each ticket bears the name and national identity card number of the buyer. Could be good for nation's image While it’s not clear how many visas have been issued to foreign fans, cricket experts in Pakistan say the event will help improve the country’s image, which has suffered partly because of a lack of international exposure. 'When you don’t have tourists, then people will not know how your country is and people will keep thinking poorly of Muslims and Pakistanis,' said Tauqir Zia, former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. Although India’s absence from Pakistan’s grounds is a disappointment for many Pakistani cricket lovers who wanted to see the sport’s biggest rivalry play out at home, some say the arrival of other cricketing powers is a vote of confidence. 'Six countries coming to play here is a very big victory for Pakistan. If India doesn’t come, it’s not stopping cricket. The game is still happening,' said cricket journalist Umar Farooq. The final will be played in Pakistan, unless India qualifies to play the last match, in which case the event will take place in Dubai. Pakistan has spent millions of dollars in recent months to upgrade the stadiums in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. Former Pakistani cricketer Mushtaq Ahmed said he hopes the arrival of heavyweights will usher in a new era for international cricket in the country. 'It’s the first step,' said Ahmed, who is a spin bowling coach for Bangladesh. 'I am very hopeful that this will open more doors.'

Hamas says it will release 10 more hostages, six of them living	A top Hamas leader says that the militant group plans to release six more living Israeli hostages from their Gaza captivity on Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday. Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made the surprise announcement in a recorded statement Tuesday, an apparent response to the Israeli decision to allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into the Gaza Strip. The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under the first phase of the ceasefire that expires in early March, with Hamas believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. Four more bodies of hostages are set to be returned next week. So far during the ceasefire, Hamas has released 24 hostages, and Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The warring sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase of their truce, in which Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Tuesday that Israel was ready to open negotiations on the details of the second phase. Those talks were supposed to have started two weeks ago, according to the ceasefire deal. In his remarks, Hayya said the 'Bibas family' would be included in the handover of the four bodies, apparently referring to Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who for many Israelis embody the captives' plight. Israel has not confirmed their deaths, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office urged the public not to distribute 'photos, names and rumors.' Israel has said it was gravely concerned about the Bibas family, while Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early in the war. Yarden Bibas, the husband and father, was kidnapped separately and released this month. Kfir, who was 9 months old at the time, was the youngest hostage taken in Hamas' shock Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered 15 months of fighting. Video footage of the abduction showed Shiri swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. 'In recent hours we have been shaken after the Hamas spokesman's announcement was published about the return of our Shiri, Ariel and Kfir this coming Thursday as part of the movement to release kidnapped civilians,' the family said in a statement. 'It is important for us to say that we are aware of the reports but have not yet received an official update on the matter.' 'Until we receive certainty, our journey will not end,' the family said. An Israeli official said Netanyahu had agreed to allow the mobile homes and construction equipment into Gaza to accelerate the hostages' release. Hamas last week threatened to hold up the release of more hostages, citing the mobile home issue and other alleged violations of the truce. Israel is expected to continue releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks, in exchange for the hostages. Israelis and Palestinians marked 500 days of the war on Monday. Hamas killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military, without offering evidence, says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Meanwhile, Israeli troops remained in some areas of southern Lebanon on Tuesday, despite a deadline for their withdrawal as part of a ceasefire with the militant group Hezbollah. Israel withdrew from some villages in the region, but said it was leaving forces in place in five positions that it said were necessary to protect parts of northern Israel. A joint statement from Lebanon’s president, prime minister and parliament speaker on Tuesday called on the U.N. Security Council to demand Israel’s immediate withdrawal. The ceasefire agreement called for Israel to withdraw by late January, with Hezbollah also moving away from the border and U.N. peacekeepers deploying in the vacated buffer zone along with the Lebanese troops. An extension pushed the deadline to Tuesday. The U.N. envoy for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, and the head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission and force commander in Lebanon, Lieutenant General Aroldo Lazaro, said in a joint statement that another delay in implementing the ceasefire deal 'is not what we hoped would happen.' Katz said the military 'will remain in a buffer zone in Lebanon with five control positions and will continue to act forcefully and uncompromisingly against any Hezbollah violation.' The ceasefire, reached in late November, halted more than a year of fighting in Lebanon, which had intensified in the months ahead of the truce, with Israeli troops conducting ground operations inside of Lebanon and repeated airstrikes targeting Hezbollah. The militants launched a cross-border rocket campaign in October 2023, attacking northern Israel a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated by the United States and others as terrorist organizations.

Pakistan claims 30 militants killed near Afghan border	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan reported Tuesday that its security forces killed at least 30 Islamist insurgents during clashes in a volatile region bordering Afghanistan. A military statement attributed the casualties to an overnight 'intelligence-based' operation against a militant location in the tribal district of South Waziristan. The slain people were referred to as 'khwarij,' a local term employed by the government to identify members of the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, militant group. The TTP has not commented on the reported clashes, and it is not possible to verify government claims through independent sources in the violence-hit district. The Waziristan region and nearby districts along the Afghan border face almost daily militant raids targeting Pakistani troops, police officers and various government entities, with the TTP claiming responsibility for most of it. The violence has killed dozens of Pakistani security personnel within the first two months of 2025 alone. Military officials claim that retaliatory counterinsurgency operations have killed scores of TTP operatives, including key militant commanders, in recent days. Islamabad alleges that the TTP, listed as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, uses havens and training camps in Afghanistan to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks. The Taliban government in Kabul, which is not recognized by any country, rejects Pakistani allegations. The latest report by the U.N. Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, released last week, highlighted Pakistan's concerns, stating that the TTP has 'significantly increased' its attacks in the country and from Afghan territory. The report noted that Kabul 'continued to provide the TTP with logistical and operational space and financial support.' It added that the militant group 'established new training centers' in the Afghan provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost and Paktika, 'while enhancing recruitment within TTP cadres, including from the Afghan Taliban.' The Taliban government dismissed the U.N. findings as 'inaccurate' and contrary to reality.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-claims-30-militants-killed-near-afghan-border/7979417.html	2025-02-18T10:24:47-08:00	
Pope accepts resignation of Canadian bishop accused of sexual abuse	OTTAWA — Pope Francis on Tuesday said he had accepted the resignation of a Canadian bishop who has been named in a class-action lawsuit against the church that alleges sexual assault. The pope did not give a reason for replacing Jean-Pierre Blais, the 75-year-old bishop of Baie-Comeau in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, and the diocese said the resignation was not linked to the allegations. He also named a replacement: Reverend Pierre Charland, 62, currently a leading member of Canada's Roman Catholic Franciscan order. In a statement, the pope noted that any bishop who turns 75 is automatically requested to offer his resignation. The pope makes a decision on whether to accept the offer 'after he has examined all the circumstances,' the statement said. Blais is mentioned in a list of sexual predators filed as part of a victims' class action against the Archdiocese of Quebec. He has denied any wrongdoing. 'The nomination of a new bishop ... is not linked to the allegations against Bishop Blais,' the Diocese of Baie-Comeau said in an emailed statement, noting the church's policy of requiring all those who hit 75 to offer their resignation. Blais would not be speaking to the media, it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-accepts-resignation-of-canadian-bishop-accused-of-sexual-abuse/7979365.html	2025-02-18T09:53:05-08:00	
Men, women experience near daily floggings in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities publicly flogged six individuals on Tuesday after convicting them of offenses such as adultery, sodomy and eloping. The Supreme Court of the de facto Afghan rulers announced that the punishments were carried out in southeastern Khost and northern Faryab provinces and that the individuals received 39 lashes each, along with varying prison sentences of up to 18 months. Since the beginning of February, at least 61 Afghans, including nine women, have been flogged in sports stadiums packed with ordinary citizens and Taliban officials from the judiciary and administration, according to data from the top court. The individuals were accused of adultery, eloping, sodomy and robbery, with many of them also receiving prison sentences ranging from several months to six years. The United Nations and human rights organizations have condemned corporal punishment in Afghanistan as a violation of international law, urging the Taliban to immediately cease the practice. Despite global outcry, hundreds of Afghan men and women have faced public flogging, and several have been executed under the Taliban’s interpretation of retributive justice, known as qisas. Last week, reclusive Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada defended his governance, including the criminal justice system, saying they were rooted in divine commands. 'The esteemed supreme leader stated that every decree he issues is based on consultation with scholars and derived from the Quran and Hadith [sayings of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad] and represents commands of Allah,' a government spokesman quoted Akhundzada as telling a gathering in Kandahar. Akhundzada, who is based in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, has issued numerous decrees in accordance with his stringent interpretation of Islamic law and principles, resulting in restrictions on freedom of speech and female access to education and employment in the country. The Taliban leader has banned girls’ education beyond the sixth grade and blocked many women from public and private sector employment. Afghan women cannot travel by road or air without a chaperone and cannot visit public places such as parks, gyms or beauty salons. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan emphasized again on X Tuesday that restrictions on women 'are causing long-term damage' in the impoverished, war-torn country. The chief prosecutor of the Hague-based International Criminal Court last month announced he was seeking arrest warrants for Akhundzada and the Taliban chief justice, holding them 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' The Taliban dismissed the warrants as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.' No country has recognized the Taliban as the legitimate governing authority of the country, primarily due to the harsh treatment of Afghan women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/men-women-experience-near-daily-floggings-in-afghanistan/7979256.html	2025-02-18T08:53:25-08:00	
Rubio: US looks for 'fair, sustainable' end to Russian war on Ukraine	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that the United States is working toward a 'fair' and 'sustainable' solution to end Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine, but that both Moscow and Kyiv would have to make concessions to achieve peace. Rubio offered his assessment after he and other key U.S. officials met for several hours in Saudi Arabia with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his aides in a first effort toward ending the war and improving the contentious Washington-Moscow relationship. 'The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's fair, enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,' Rubio told reporters, although no Ukrainian or European officials were at the table for the talks. Rubio said he was 'convinced' that Moscow was willing to engage in a 'serious process' to end the war, which Russia started with a full-scale invasion of its neighbor three years ago next week. Tens of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, along with Ukrainian civilians, have been killed in the fighting, Europe’s worst conflict since World War II. The U.S. and Russia agreed to 'appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible,' State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Bruce characterized the meeting as 'an important step forward' toward peace. Rubio said Ukraine and European nations would have to be involved in talks on ending the war. He said that if the war is halted, the U.S. would have 'extraordinary opportunities … to partner' with Russia on trade and other global issues. 'The key to unlock that is the end to this conflict,' he said. National security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff joined Rubio for the talks. Waltz told reporters that negotiations to end the fighting will focus on territory and security guarantees for both Ukraine and Russia. 'This needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end, as we've seen in the past,' Waltz said. Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized 2014 territory. Moscow controls the Crimean Peninsula that it unilaterally annexed in 2014, along with a large portion of eastern Ukraine pro-Russian separatists captured in subsequent fighting and lands the Russian military have taken over since the 2022 invasion. As the invasion started, Moscow hoped for a quick takeover of all of Ukraine. But with stiff Ukrainian resistance, the war instead evolved into a grinding ground conflict and daily aerial bombardments by each side. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has long demanded that his country’s 2014 boundaries be restored, but U.S. officials have said that is unrealistic, as was Kyiv’s long-sought goal of joining NATO, the West’s main military alliance, as part of a negotiated peace settlement. Zelenskyy has said it will not agree to a U.S.-Russian dictated settlement of the war. He postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this week, citing the fact that officials from his country were not invited to Tuesday’s U.S.-Russia talks. The Ukrainian leader suggested that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the talks and rescheduled the trip for March 10. Zelenskyy is due to host the U.S. envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, for talks on Wednesday. Bruce said the Rubio-Lavrov talks, the first extensive discussions between the two countries in more than three years, also laid the groundwork for more talks aside from the negotiations to end the war. She said the two sides would 'establish a consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective diplomatic missions.' Bruce said the U.S. and Russia would 'lay the groundwork for future cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic economic and investment opportunities' once the war is ended. The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in discussions about its future, and for European nations to play a role in what they also see as a key development for their own security. French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders for a Monday session in Paris, where they discussed boosting defense spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine. There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that discussion was premature. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-us-looks-for-fair-sustainable-end-to-russian-war-on-ukraine/7979267.html	2025-02-18T08:48:09-08:00	
Uganda under fire for detention of opposition leader	NAIROBI, KENYA — Human rights activists, lawyers and medical practitioners in East Africa called on the Ugandan government Tuesday to release opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who has spent the past three months in military detention. Besigye, who was abducted while on a trip to Kenya in November, was recently rushed to a hospital after going on a hunger strike to protest his imprisonment. Reading a statement on behalf of 12 organizations in Nairobi, the head of one of the groups, Khalid Hussein, said they condemn the militarization of justice and escalating government repression in Uganda. 'We call on Ugandan authorities to immediately release Kizza Besigye, Hajj Obeid Lutale, Eron Kiiza and others unlawfully detained,' Hussein said. 'The abduction and rendition of Kizza Besigye and Hajj Obeid Lutale blatantly violated international human rights law and the principles of extradition treaties.' A politician who ran against Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in three elections, Besigye was abducted by unidentified men while on a visit to Kenya in November and taken to Luzira Maximum Security Prison in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. He appeared before a military court, where former Kenyan justice minister and lawyer Martha Karua defended him. He is charged with treason, illegal possession of a firearm and threatening national security. Last week, the 68-year-old fell ill and was taken to a hospital after going on a hunger strike to protest his arrest and the charges. Ugandan lawyer Andrew Karamagi said the treatment of Besigye and other Museveni critics exposes ongoing rights violations in his country. 'The medical union has spoken out and given a scientific medical analysis of Dr. Besigye's health, which is in serious jeopardy,' he said. 'Citizens who have attempted to protest this have as well been detained, and I should add, violently arrested, as some of you might have seen. This is a culmination of years of human rights abuses [and] disregard for the constitution.' On Jan. 31, the Ugandan Supreme Court ruled that the trial of civilians in a military court is unconstitutional and that such cases must be transferred to ordinary courts. But the government rejected the ruling, saying such trials protect the country from criminals. In a statement posted on X, Museveni called on those demanding the release of Besigye to instead demand a quick trial to establish the facts. Otherwise, he said, such demands promote insecurity, which is dangerous for the country. Amnesty International East African regional researcher Roland Ebole said a united voice against human rights violations can help end abuses. 'We are having cross-border repression,' Ebole said. 'We are having a transnational repression where we are seeing abductions happening beyond borders. And these abductions are happening sanctioned or blessed by presidents, blessed by heads of state. And they are taking advantage of the fact that on the ground, we are not as united against them.' Rights groups say they will circulate petitions and reach out to other nations and organizations to demand the release of unlawfully detained Ugandans. The 12 organizations that took part in today’s demonstration have called for people to join a march on Friday to the Ugandan embassy in Nairobi and the parliament building to present a petition for justice and the release of Besigye and those detained alongside him.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-under-fire-for-detention-of-opposition-leader/7979156.html	2025-02-18T08:03:11-08:00	
After Toronto plane crash, Delta says 19 of 21 passengers released from hospitals	Delta Air Lines said on Tuesday that 19 of the 21 passengers transported to local hospitals after a Toronto plane crash a day earlier have been released, as officials continue a probe into why the regional jet flipped over upon landing. Investigators from Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB) are leading the probe into why the CRJ900 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines' Endeavor Air subsidiary went belly-up on Monday at Toronto's Pearson Airport. It's not yet clear what happened to Flight DL4819 from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Air crashes are usually caused by multiple factors. The 16-year-old CRJ900, made by Canada's Bombardier and powered by GE Aerospace engines, can seat up to 90 people. At least one of the two wings was no longer attached to the plane, video showed after the accident. Toronto Pearson Airport said earlier on Monday it was dealing with high winds and frigid temperatures as airlines attempted to catch up with missed flights after a weekend snowstorm dumped more than 22 centimeters (8.6 inches) of snow at the airport. The Delta plane touched down in Toronto at 2:13 p.m. (1913 GMT) after an 86-minute flight and came to rest near the intersection of runway 23 and runway 15, FlightRadar24 data showed. The weather at the time of the crash indicated a 'gusting crosswind and blowing snow,' the flight tracking website said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-toronto-plane-crash-delta-says-19-of-21-passengers-released-from-hospitals-/7979157.html	2025-02-18T08:01:11-08:00	
Uganda discharges last Ebola patients; No new deaths from contagious virus reported	KAMPALA — Uganda discharged on Tuesday the last eight patients who recovered from Ebola, health authorities reported, and there were no other positive cases in the outbreak declared last month. World Health Organization described the recoveries as a milestone that 'reflects the power of Uganda's quick and coordinated response.' Most of the Ebola patients were treated at the main referral facility in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. The lone Ebola victim was a male nurse who died the day before the outbreak was declared in Kampala on Jan. 30. His relatives are among those later hospitalized with Ebola. Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever. Ugandan officials documented at least 265 contacts, and at least 90 of them have completed a period of quarantine during which they were monitored for signs of Ebola, Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng told reporters in Kampala. There are no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola in Uganda's outbreak. But authorities have launched a clinical study to further test the safety and efficacy of a trial vaccine as part of measures to stop the spread of Ebola. The last outbreak of Ebola in Uganda, which began in September 2022, killed at least 55 people by the time it was declared over four months later. Ebola is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. Scientists suspect that the first person infected in an Ebola outbreak acquires the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat. Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-discharges-the-last-ebola-patients-no-new-deaths-from-contagious-virus-reported-/7979160.html	2025-02-18T07:59:25-08:00	
Leonard Peltier leaves prison after Biden commuted sentence in killing of FBI agents	SUMTERVILLE, FLORIDA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was released from a Florida prison on Tuesday, weeks after then-President Joe Biden angered law enforcement officials by commuting his life sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents. For nearly half a century, Peltier's imprisonment has symbolized systemic injustice for Native Americans across the country who believe in his innocence. The decision to release the 80-year-old to home confinement was celebrated by supporters. 'He represents every person who's been roughed up by a cop, profiled, had their children harassed at school,' said Nick Estes, a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe who advocated for Peltier's release. But the move just before Biden left office also prompted criticism from those who say Peltier is guilty, including former FBI Director Christopher Wray, who called him 'a remorseless killer' in a private letter to Biden obtained by The Associated Press. 'Granting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law,' Wray wrote. The commutation was not a pardon for crimes committed, something Peltier's advocates have hoped for since he has always maintained his innocence. Peltier left the prison Tuesday morning in an SUV, according to a prison official. He didn't stop to speak with reporters or his supporters outside the gates. One of his attorneys, Jenipher Jones, said Peltier was looking forward to going home. 'We're so excited for this moment,' Jones said. 'He is in good spirits. He has the soul of a warrior.' After being released from USP Coleman, a high-security prison, Peltier planned to return to North Dakota, where he is expected to celebrate with friends and family on Wednesday. Biden commuted Peltier's sentence Jan. 20, noting he had spent most of his life in prison and was now in poor health. 'We never thought he would get out,' Ray St. Clair, a member of the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, said shortly before Peltier's release. 'It shows you should never give up hope. We can take this repairing the damage that was done. This is a start.' Peltier, an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota, was active in the American Indian Movement, which beginning in the 1960s fought for Native American treaty rights and tribal self-determination. The group grabbed headlines in 1969 when activists occupied the former prison island of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay, and again in 1972, when they presented presidential candidates with a list of demands including the restoration of tribal land. After they were ignored, they seized the headquarters of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. From then on, the group was subject to FBI surveillance and harassment under a covert program that sought to disrupt activism and was exposed in 1975. Peltier's conviction stemmed from a confrontation that year on the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, in which FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed. According to the FBI, the agents were there to serve arrest warrants for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon. Prosecutors maintained at trial that Peltier shot both agents in the head at point-blank range. Peltier acknowledged being present and firing a gun at a distance, but he said he fired in self-defense. A woman who claimed to have seen Peltier shoot the agents later recanted her testimony, saying it had been coerced. He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences. Two other movement members, co-defendants Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and was not eligible to be considered for it again until 2026. 'Leonard Peltier's release is the right thing to do given the serious and ongoing human rights concerns about the fairness of his trial, his nearly 50 years behind bars, his health and his age,' Paul O'Brien, executive director with Amnesty International USA, said in a statement before Peltier's release. 'While we welcome his release from prison, he should not be restricted to home confinement.' Prominent Native American groups like the National Congress of the American Indian have called for Peltier's release for decades, and Amnesty International considered him a political prisoner. Prominent supporters over the years included South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, civil rights icon Coretta Scott King, actor and director Robert Redford, and musicians Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte and Jackson Browne. Generations of Indigenous activists and leaders lobbied multiple presidents to pardon Peltier. Former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the first Native American to hold the secretary's position, praised Biden's decision. 'I am grateful that Leonard can now go home to his family,' she said Jan. 20 in a post on X. 'I applaud President Biden for this action and understanding what this means to Indian Country.' As a young child, Peltier was taken from his family and sent to a boarding school. Thousands of Indigenous children over decades faced the same fate, and were in many cases subjected to systemic physical, psychological and sexual abuse. 'He hasn't really had a home since he was taken away to boarding school,' said Nick Tilsen, who has been advocating for Peltier's release since he was a teen and is CEO of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group based in South Dakota. 'So he is excited to be at home and paint and have grandkids running around.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/leonard-peltier-leaves-prison-after-biden-commuted-his-sentence-in-the-killing-of-two-fbi-agents/7979095.html	2025-02-18T07:20:30-08:00	
Inclusivity, economic woes, and security challenge Syria post-Assad	Syria’s top diplomat says the country has gained freedom while managing to avoid another civil war, but observers point to major challenges ahead, such as the dire economy, uncertain security, and including Syria's diverse population in decision-making and governance. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani told the Munich Security Conference last weekend that the country’s new leadership will set in place a government that reflects the will of the people. 'The Syrian people freed themselves by themselves. We are now putting the steps and principles to have a system that represents the people to be Syrian-led and Syria-owned. The dictatorship will not be repeated again,' he said. Al-Shibani said the country’s Islamist interim leaders want 'to bring the whole Syrian society with us to prevent any actions that will break this stability and our achievement.' Bassam Said Ishak is president of the Syriac National Council of Syria, based in northeast Syria and representing Syriac Christians. He told VOA it is important for Christians and all minorities in a post-Assad government to be represented and respected. Ishak spoke about a national dialogue conference scheduled for next month. 'My worry is that they wind up with a conference that it does not magnify the real voices of these diverse Syrians. That’s serious because this has been the traditional way. Assad did it this way. We just need a viable representation of everybody, whether it’s a Kurd, Syriac, Druze, Alawi, Ismaili. We just need to hear these voices. We need to hear people who are different, of different opinion and think of real solutions,' he said. Syrian American lawyer Dima Moussa, who is a member of the Syrian National Coalition, an organization that promotes constitutional reforms, said the caretaker government is applying the Islamist principles it enforced when it ruled just Idlib province to the rest of the country. She told the Washington-based Arab Center recently the interim leaders have 'not yet completely come out of that mentality,' but she expressed optimism for the future. 'Inclusivity is probably one of the most important issues on the table today. And if it is not carefully and diligently worked on, especially at the national conference stage, it can set up for the reoccurrence and failure of many problems in the future. There have been some positive steps. They’re getting lost amid the hardships of the living conditions and some incidents in some of the more sensitive areas that historically had sectarian tensions which were amplified during the last 14 years,' said Moussa. Some observers are concerned about a lack of clarity on how the new government will attempt to heal the still-divided country. Questions remain over Syria’s future relations with Russia and Iran, and stalwart Assad supporters, as it pursues reintegration in the Arab fold. Meanwhile, Syria’s economy is in tatters after nearly 14 years of civil war, widespread corruption under the Assad regime and sanctions by the West, including on its banking sector. U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen told the Munich Security Conference the Syrian interim government faces 'enormous humanitarian challenges' as 17 million refugees and internally displaced people try to return home. 'They need to see there if a future in Syria, and they need to see it quickly,' Pedersen warned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/inclusivity-economic-woes-and-security-challenge-syria-post-assad/7979055.html	2025-02-18T06:54:15-08:00	
Social Security head steps down over DOGE access of recipient information: AP sources	Washington — The Social Security Administration's acting commissioner has stepped down from her role at the agency over Department of Government Efficiency requests to access Social Security recipient information, according to two people familiar with the official's departure who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Acting Commissioner Michelle King's departure from the agency over the weekend — after more than 30 years of service — was initiated after King refused to provide DOGE staffers at the SSA with access to sensitive information, the people said Monday. The White House has replaced her as acting commissioner with Leland Dudek, who currently works at the SSA, the people said. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields released a statement Monday night saying: 'President Trump has nominated the highly qualified and talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner.' Fields added, 'President Trump is committed to appointing the best and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them for far too long.' King's exit from the administration is one of several departures of high-ranking officials concerned about DOGE staffers' potential unlawful access to private taxpayer information. DOGE has accessed Treasury payment systems and is attempting to access Internal Revenue Service databases. Since Republican President Donald Trump has retaken the White House, his billionaire adviser Elon Musk has rapidly burrowed deep into federal agencies while avoiding public scrutiny of his work through the DOGE group. Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the preservation of Social Security benefits, said of DOGE's efforts that 'there is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is. And my understanding is that it has already occurred.' 'The information collected and securely held by the Social Security Administration is highly sensitive,' she said. 'SSA has data on everyone who has a Social Security number, which is virtually all Americans, everyone who has Medicare, and every low-income American who has applied for Social Security’s means-tested companion program, Supplemental Security Income.' 'If there is an evil intent to punish perceived enemies, someone could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned.' The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/social-security-head-steps-down-over-doge-access-of-recipient-information-ap-sources-/7978978.html	2025-02-18T05:55:09-08:00	
Vietnam parliament approves radical government cost-cutting drive	Hanoi, Vietnam — Vietnam will cut one in five public sector jobs and slash billions of dollars from government budgets, after the country's rubber-stamp parliament on Tuesday gave the go-ahead to a radical streamlining drive. The reform are creating unease in a communist country where working for the state long meant a job for life. Described as 'a revolution' by senior officials, the drive will see the number of government ministries and agencies slashed from 30 to 22. The National Assembly voted to pass the government's organizational structure, a statement on the parliament's website said. The ministries of transport, planning and investment, communications and labor have been scrapped, and state media, the civil service, the police and the military will face cuts. As part of the government restructuring, the National Assembly on Tuesday approved two new deputy prime ministers, taking the total to seven. Almost two million people worked in the public sector as of 2022, according to the government, although the International Labor Organization puts the figure much higher. One in five of these jobs will be eliminated over the next five years. The government has said that 100,000 people will be made redundant or offered early retirement, but it has yet to offer clarity on how the much larger target will be reached. Vietnam's top leader To Lam, who half a year ago became Communist Party general secretary following the death of his predecessor, has said that state agencies should not be 'safe havens for weak officials'. 'If we want to have a healthy body, sometimes we must take bitter medicine and endure pain to remove tumors,' Lam said in December. He has also said that the plan had received 'large consensus from the people'. But several workers told AFP they were laid off with little notice and were concerned that decisions about which employees to keep were not based on ability. Thanh, a pseudonym to protect his identity, told AFP his 12-year career as a TV producer was 'aggressively' terminated last month. The state-controlled news channel where he worked was shuttered, one of five broadcasters already closed, and Thanh was given two weeks' notice. 'It is painful to talk about,' said Thanh, a father who has turned to driving a taxi. Business impact Building on stellar economic growth of 7.1 percent in 2024, Vietnam —a global manufacturing hub heavily reliant on exports — is aiming for eight percent this year. But anxiety is mounting over the country's potential vulnerability to tariffs under the new Trump administration. A bloated bureaucracy is also seen as a brake on growth, as is a high-profile anti-corruption campaign that has slowed everyday transactions. Authorities say savings from the cuts in spending could total $4.5 billion over the next five years, despite costs of more than $5 billion for retirement and severance packages. Streamlining the bureaucracy has been a Communist Party policy for nearly a decade but Lam is pushing the scheme ahead rapidly. Lam has also enthusiastically pursued an anti-graft campaign that has swept up dozens of business leaders and senior government figures, including two presidents and three deputy prime ministers since 2021. Critics accuse him of targeting his rivals through the action, but the drive has proved popular with the public and analysts say Lam may be looking to bolster his legitimacy ahead of the next Communist Party congress in early 2026. The turmoil, however, has threatened the country's reputation for stability and there are fears the bureaucratic reforms could also cause short-term chaos. At a press conference last week, Pham Thu Hang, spokesperson for the foreign affairs ministry, said the drive 'would not affect the investment and business environment in Vietnam.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-parliament-approves-radical-govt-cost-cutting-drive-/7978965.html	2025-02-18T05:54:07-08:00	
Vatican cancels pope's weekend engagements as he battles 'complex' infection	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis, who began his fifth day in hospital on Tuesday for what doctors have described as a 'complex' respiratory infection, will not take part in this weekend's Holy Year events, the Vatican said on Tuesday. The 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday. A planned public papal audience set for Saturday had been canceled 'due to the health condition of the Holy Father,' the Vatican said in a brief statement. A papal mass scheduled for Sunday will still take place, but will be led instead by a senior Vatican official, it added. The Vatican said on Monday that doctors had changed the pope's drug therapy for the second time during his hospital stay to tackle a 'complex clinical situation.' They described it as a 'polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract.' Doctors say polymicrobial diseases can be caused by a mix of viruses, bacteria and fungi. Francis, who has been pontiff since 2013, has had influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. As a young adult he developed pleurisy and had part of one lung removed, and in recent times has been prone to lung infections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-cancels-pope-s-weekend-engagements-as-he-battles-complex-infection-/7978833.html	2025-02-18T03:24:09-08:00	
Philippines reports intrusions targeting intelligence data	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines has detected foreign attempts to access intelligence data, but its cyber minister said on Tuesday no breaches have been recorded so far. Attempts to steal data are wide-ranging, said minister for information and communications Ivan Uy. Advanced Persistent Threats or APTs have repeatedly attempted but failed to infiltrate government systems, suggesting the country's cyber-defenses have held firm. APTs are a general term for cyber actors or groups, often state-backed, that engage in malicious cyber activities. 'These have been present for quite some time, and threats come from many actors, but a big majority of them are foreign,' Uy told Reuters. Some of these threats, which Uy referred to as 'sleepers,' had been embedded in systems before being exposed by government's cyber security efforts. 'Why are these things operating in those systems, without even anybody calling it out?,' he said. So far, the government has not seen any cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure, he said. 'Hopefully it's because our cyber defenses and cyber security are strong enough,' he said. Uy acknowledged the difficulty of attributing cyber intrusions to specific attackers, as they sometimes leave misleading digital traces. However, the government is working through diplomatic channels and sharing intelligence with the military, including with other countries, to validate threats and strengthen defenses, he said. Last year, the Philippine said it thwarted attempts by hackers operating in China to break into websites and e-mail systems of the Philippine president and government agencies, including one promoting maritime security. Uy described the escalating cyber threats as part of a global arms race, where nations and criminal organizations exploit digital vulnerabilities for financial or strategic gain. 'World War III is happening and it is cyber,' Uy said. 'These weapons are non-kinetic. They are cyber, digital, virtual, but it's happening. The attacks and defenses are happening as we speak, without any physical manifestation.' Beyond cyberattacks, Uy has also flagged a surge in deepfakes and what he referred to as 'fake news media outlets' aiming to manipulate public opinion ahead of the Philippines' mid-term elections in May, and the ministry has deployed tools to combat them. 'Misinformation and disinformation are riskier with respect to democracies like ours, because we rely on elections, and elections are based on personal opinion,' Uy said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-reports-intrusions-targeting-intelligence-data/7978813.html	2025-02-18T02:13:49-08:00	
Israel keeping troops in 5 southern Lebanon locations	Israeli troops remained in some areas of southern Lebanon on Tuesday, despite a deadline for their withdrawal as part of a ceasefire with the militant group Hezbollah. Israel withdrew from some villages in the region, but said it was leaving forces in place in five positions that it said were necessary to protect parts of northern Israel. The Lebanese government, which moved its own troops into areas Israel left, has called on Israel to fully implement the ceasefire deal and leave the country. The agreement called for Israel to withdraw by late January, with Hezbollah also moving away from the border and U.N. peacekeepers deploying in the vacated buffer zone along with the Lebanese troops. An extension pushed the deadline to Tuesday. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the military 'will remain in a buffer zone in Lebanon with five control positions, and will continue to act forcefully and uncompromisingly against any Hezbollah violation.' The ceasefire reached in late November halted more than a year of fighting in Lebanon, which had intensified in the months ahead of the ceasefire with Israeli troops conducting ground operations inside of Lebanon and repeated airstrikes targeting Hezbollah. The militants launched a cross-border rocket campaign in October 2023, attacking northern Israel a day after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in their own attack on southern Israel. Israel’s counteroffensive against Hamas has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel said it has killed more than 17,000 militants. The first phase of a Gaza ceasefire is due to end at the beginning of March. So far, the ceasefire has included Hamas releasing 24 hostages and Israel freeing more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The tentative second phase of the ceasefire plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, the drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated by the United States and others as terrorist organizations.

Turkish police detain 282 suspects in raids targeting PKK militants	ISTANBUL — Turkish police detained 282 suspected members of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, militant group in raids over the last five days, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on Tuesday. The raids came as Turkey continues to remove elected pro-Kurdish mayors from their posts over militant ties in a crackdown coinciding with hopes for an end to a 40-year conflict between the PKK and authorities. Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is expected to make a statement on such efforts, four months after an ally of President Tayyip Erdogan urged him to call on the militants to lay down their arms. Police carried out this week's counter-terror raids in 51 provinces, as well as in the capital, Ankara, and the largest city of Istanbul, the minister said on X. The suspects were accused of conducting PKK propaganda, providing financing for the group, recruiting members and joining in street protests, he said. The police seized two AK 47 rifles among other weapons. On Saturday, Turkey removed a pro-Kurdish DEM Party mayor from his post in the eastern province of Van over terrorism-related convictions, taking to eight the number of DEM mayors replaced by state-appointed officials since 2024 elections. The PKK, designated as a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies, launched its insurgency against the state in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-police-detain-282-suspects-in-raids-targeting-pkk-militants/7978791.html	2025-02-18T00:30:27-08:00	
Russian drone attack hits central Ukraine apartment building	A Russian drone hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dolynska, officials said Tuesday, injuring at least three people. Andriy Raikovych, governor of the Kirovohrad region where the attack took place, said on Telegram that authorities evacuated dozens of people from the building and that those injured included a mother and two children. The attack was part of a widespread Russian aerial assault overnight, which the Ukrainian military said included 176 drones. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 103 of the drones, with intercepts taking place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said Tuesday. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from a destroyed drone damaged four houses in his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed five Ukrainian drones, including four over the Voronezh region and one over Belgorod. Both regions are located along the Russia-Ukraine border and are frequent targets of Ukrainian drone attacks. Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said on Telegram there were no reports of casualties or damage.

US, Russian officials to discuss Ukraine war, bilateral relations	Top U.S. and Russian diplomats are set to meet Tuesday in Saudi Arabia for discussions about relations between their countries and a potential end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Both sides have tempered expectations, describing the talks as an initial step that could lay the framework for direct talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading the U.S. delegation, which also includes national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Wikoff. Russia’s side includes Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and senior Putin aide Yuri Ushakov. Ukrainian leaders said they were not invited to participate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to host U.S. envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg for talks on Wednesday. The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in discussions about its own future, and for European nations to play a role in what they also see as a key development in their own security. French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders for a Monday session in Paris where they discussed boosting defense spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine. There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that discussion was premature. 'We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,' Macron said on X. The French leader said he had spoken with Trump and Zelenskyy after the Paris talks, and that it is important for Europeans, Americans and Ukrainians to work together. Zelenskyy expressed a need for 'robust and reliable' security guarantees, saying that otherwise Russia will just start another war with Ukraine or other nations in Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-russian-officials-to-discuss-ukraine-war-bilateral-relations/7978750.html	2025-02-17T21:59:55-08:00	
Japan approves new climate, energy and industry policies through 2040	TOKYO — Japan's government approved on Tuesday new targets to cut the country's greenhouse gas emissions through 2040, alongside a revised energy plan and an updated industrial policy for the same period. The measures, which seek to bolster long-term policy stability for businesses, focus on promoting decarbonization, ensuring a stable energy supply and strengthening industrial capacity to drive economic growth. Under the new climate policy, Japan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% from 2013 levels by 2035 and by 73% by 2040, extending its 2030 goal of a 46% cut. The emissions-cutting target sparked calls for deeper reductions from experts and ruling coalition members when it was first proposed, as the world's fifth-biggest carbon emitter struggles to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. Despite more than 80% of 3,000 public comments supporting a more ambitious target, the environment and industry ministries finalized the goal without changes, citing prior deliberations by climate experts. As part of global efforts to combat climate change, Japan plans to submit its new target, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, to the United Nations this month. The revised energy policy aims for renewables to account for up to 50% of Japan's electricity mix by fiscal year 2040, with nuclear power contributing another 20% as the country pushes for clean energy while meeting rising power demand. Japanese utilities have struggled to restart nuclear reactors since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, limiting nuclear power to just 8.5% of Japan's electricity supply in 2023. The new energy plan removes the previous goal of minimizing reliance on nuclear and calls for building next-generation reactors. A new national strategy integrating decarbonization and industrial policy through 2040, aligned with the emission target and energy plan, was also approved by the cabinet. It aims to develop industrial clusters in areas rich in renewable energy, nuclear power, and other low-carbon power sources. However, uncertainties are emerging around Japan's policies, as the domestic offshore wind market, a key driver of renewable energy growth, faces headwinds from inflation and high costs, recently prompting Mitsubishi Corp to review three domestic projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-approves-new-climate-energy-and-industry-policies-through-2040/7978736.html	2025-02-17T20:36:01-08:00	
At AU summit, Tigray demands full implementation of peace deal	Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — The leaders of Ethiopia’s Tigray region have called for the full implementation of the Pretoria agreement that ended the conflict between Ethiopia's federal government and the Tigray rebels in 2022. The bloc released a report about the agreement during the African Union Summit over the weekend in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. The two main leaders of Tigray, who also are political rivals, urged the AU to pay attention to the implementation of the agreement. The AU-brokered agreement, reached in November 2022, required the cessation of hostilities, return of internally displaced people, disarmament, expedition of humanitarian access, and restoration of services in the region. The agreement ended the two-year conflict and prompted the return of some social services. Just over two months ago, the first phase of the Pretoria agreement's disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program, known as DDR, was launched in Tigray. DDR aims to demobilize 371,971 combatants overall in Ethiopia, including 75,000 combatants from Tigray region in its first phase. But the Tigray region’s leaders say there are outstanding issues. Some territories have not yet been returned by the federal government, and internally displaced people have not returned to disputed areas in Western Tigray. The president of the Tigray interim regional administration, Getachew Reda, who signed the agreement on behalf of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, or TPLF, told AU leaders that 'many contents of the agreement have not been implemented.' 'Most of the focus of the international community on DDR is on the first ‘D,’ the disarmament process, but the most important aspect for us is, where we disarm, should not be the end,' he said. 'Whether we demobilize and reinstate the people who have been the former combatants is something that should be taken into account. The international community, the AU, should take this process seriously, and it should continue to press all of us to focus on this part of the Pretoria agreement.' TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael, who was president of the region at the time of the conflict, said that while the cessation of hostilities has been a 'significant milestone' there have been shortcomings. 'We must acknowledge that critical components such as the constitutional restoration of occupied territories, the withdrawal of non-ENDF forces, and the resettlement of the displaced persons, as well as TPLF legal reinstatement, require accelerated action,' he said. The 'non-ENDF forces' that Debretsion refers to are Eritrean and Amhara region forces that have been allies of the federal Ethiopian National Defense force, or ENDF, during the conflict. Eritrea denies having forces in Ethiopian territory. Regarding the resettlement of disputed Western Tigray, the Ethiopian government's position is that it will be resolved through a referendum. Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs Gedion Timothewos said the way ahead must be conducted through 'constructive engagement' and in 'strict adherence' to the rule of law. He told the AU that the Ethiopian government is taking steps to implement the agreement and it 'must be fulfilled in the manner specified.' Gedion added: 'With good faith implementation, as provided in the peace agreement, we are convinced that the remaining and outstanding important measures are within our reach and could be fulfilled.' AU chief negotiator and former president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, said that the issues of the DDR program and contested areas should continue to be addressed in a phased manner until they are resolved, and that they should not 'hold back the implementation of the agreement.' He said the Pretoria peace agreement reflected the principle of 'African solutions to African problems.' 'It underscores the capability of African statesmen and institutions to resolve conflicts and foster peace within our continent,’’ Obasanjo said. Rift between Tigray's leaders The two main leaders of Tigray, Getachew and Debretsion, shook hands at Sunday’s AU event, but the duo have been involved in a bitter political dispute that crippled the region’s administration and functions for months. The dispute is rooted in differences over the implementation of the Pretoria agreement. Debretsion accuses his former TPLF deputy chairman of not representing the region's interests, a charge Getachew denies. The two also clashed over the convening of the TPLF party congress and the appointment of local administration. TPLF held a congress in August during which it expelled 15 members including Getachew from the central committee, a move Getachew described as 'null and void.' Getachew accuses the TPLF leadership of orchestrating 'a coup d'état' against his administration and alleges the TPLF leaders are working to dismantle the regional government. The TPLF has made the same accusation against Getachew. Last month, over 200 Tigray security force commanders sided with Debretsion after staying neutral for many months, accusing Getachew of betraying Tigray’s interests. Getachew hit back, saying the use of security forces for the benefit of a particular political faction is unacceptable. On Thursday, the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) suspended TPLF from conducting any political activities for three months because it has yet to convene a general assembly. TPLF rejected the suspension, accusing NEBE of meddling. 'Whilst TPLF leadership is dealing and negotiating with relevant stakeholders to amend relations, the National Board of Elections is going out of its way to intervene and taint the party negatively,' TPLF said in a statement on Friday. 'As a signatory of the Pretoria agreement, we make clear our stand that the board is meddling. … We appeal to the federal government that if anything goes wrong, the responsibility lies on the board.' In a statement on his Facebook page Ethiopia’s prime minister recently called on Tigray elites to solve their internal differences in dialogue, and he added that any other differences, be it with other forces or federal government, should be addressed based on the national constitution.

M23 rebels tighten their grip on second major city in eastern DRC	BUKAVU, Democratic Reupblic of Congo — Rwanda-backed rebels tightened their grip on Bukavu on Monday, a day after seizing the second major city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo whose residents appeared resigned to their fate under the new rulers. On Sunday, M23 rebels captured the city of 1.3 million people after it was abandoned by Congolese forces. Bukavu lies 101 kilometers south of Goma, which was captured by the rebels in late January. The M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo's trillions of dollars in mineral wealth that's critical for much of the world's technology. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts. The decades-long fighting has displaced more than 6 million people in the region, creating the world's largest humanitarian crisis. As the rebels made their way into Bukavu, its streets were flooded by residents attempting to leave and looters filling flour sacks with what they could find. A pall of silence set in later as residents and business owners braced for M23's entrance into the city center. On Monday morning, people gradually started coming out again while the rebels patrolled major intersections in the city. 'People are still scared to go out because of the insecurity so it's not business as usual yet,' David Balezi, a shopkeeper in Bukavu, told The Associated Press. Bukavu's border crossing to Rwanda was closed on Monday morning, as were most shops and stores while traffic gradually picked up again. 'Now we thank God that the situation is OK, even if we don't know what's coming. Whatever happens, we will live with it,' David Munyaga, a resident of Bukavu, said. On Monday, Erasto Bahati Musanga, the rebel-appointed governor of North-Kivu province announced that Goma and Bukavu's ports will reopen Tuesday. Navigation on Lake Kivu, one of the largest lakes in Africa, had been banned since late January, during the rebels’ offensive on Goma. In rebel-controlled Goma, hundreds of protesters gathered to call for the departure of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Democratic Republic of Congo, known as MONUSCO, and the withdrawal of troops from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which includes countries ranging from Congo to South Africa. The protestors organized a sit-in in front of the MONUSCO headquarters in Goma, with some brandishing signs and chanting slogans calling for the resignation of Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi. 'The war does not end in Congo, why? They have nothing to do here, they should leave,' Bauma Sukali, a protester, said. Another protester, Fiston Nsabimana, said: 'Tshisekedi is not able to ensure peace. Let him leave power.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-rebels-tighten-their-grip-on-second-major-city-in-eastern-drc/7978719.html	2025-02-17T19:06:52-08:00	
Costa Rica will receive deported migrants from US	San Jose, Costa Rica — Costa Rica announced Monday it would receive migrants from other countries who were deported by the United States, following in the footsteps of Panama and Guatemala. 'The Government of Costa Rica agreed to collaborate with the United States in the repatriation of 200 illegal immigrants to their country,' the Costa Rican president's office said in a statement, adding that 'these are people originating from ... Central Asia and India.' Costa Rica is the third country in Central America to collaborate on repatriating deported migrants from the United States since President Donald Trump assumed office in Washington on Jan. 20. The first set of deportees will arrive in Costa Rica on Wednesday aboard a commercial flight, according to the statement, whereupon they will be transported to a Temporary Migrant Care Center near the border with Panama. The statement specified that 'the process will be completely financed' by the U.S. government under the supervision of the International Organization for Migration. Panama and Guatemala had previously agreed to a similar arrangement when U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited on a recent tour of Latin America. Panama received its first repatriation flight with 119 migrants aboard last week, originating from China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere, according to Panamanian officials. None have arrived yet in Guatemala. Latin America is the original home of most of the United States' estimated 11 million undocumented migrants. Many had made dangerous journeys, braving treacherous terrain, wild animals and criminal gangs for a chance at a better life. Trump, however, took a hard line against undocumented migrants during last year's U.S. election campaign, describing some as 'monsters' and 'animals.' On his first day in office last month, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border and vowed to deport 'millions and millions' of migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/costa-rica-will-receive-deported-migrants-from-us/7978707.html	2025-02-17T18:15:07-08:00	
Argentine judge investigates fraud case against President Milei over crypto promotion	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — A judge in Argentina was selected Monday to investigate allegations of fraud against President Javier Milei for his brief promotion of a cryptocurrency whose value collapsed within hours of its launch last week. Milei distanced himself from the scandal and said he acted in good faith. Milei and his office denied involvement with creators of the $LIBRA cryptocurrency, saying he initially drew attention to it Friday as an entrepreneurial project that might benefit Argentina but learned more about it later and then withdrew his support. Lawyers in Argentina filed fraud complaints against the libertarian president on Sunday. The case was assigned Monday to Judge María Servini, head of Federal Court No. 1 in Buenos Aires. She doesn't have a deadline to finish investigating the allegations. In a tweet Friday evening that coincided with the launch of the $LIBRA crypto coin, Milei said that it was aimed at 'encouraging economic growth by funding small businesses and startups.' It enjoyed a brief spike in value above $4 billion in market capitalization, although its value began to decline amid comments of critics that it could be a scam. Milei deleted the post a few hours later as the value of the cryptocurrency was collapsing in a downturn that caused millions of dollars in losses to many of its new investors. The coin, developed by KIP Protocol and Hayden Davis, could be obtained by accessing a link that directed users to a website called vivalalibertadproject.com, referring to the well-known phrase 'Viva la libertad!' that Milei uses to close speeches and messages on his social media. The president's office said in a statement that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency's development and decided to remove his post to avoid speculation and limit further exposure, following the public reaction to the project's launch. 'The president shared a post on his personal accounts announcing the launch of KIP Protocol's project, as he does daily with many entrepreneurs who wish to launch projects in Argentina to create jobs and attract investments,' the president's office said. After deleting the post, Milei said on X he was unaware of the details of the cryptocurrency and accused his political opponents of trying to exploit the episode. 'I have nothing to hide and I have no problem coming forward and showing my face,' Milei said Monday in an interview with the Todo Noticias channel. 'Those who entered there voluntarily knew what they were getting into,' he added. 'As volatility traders, they understood the risks involved.' His office said in the statement that the country's Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the executive branch, would investigate the case. Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs, said Sunday that the plaintiffs allege that Milei's actions were part of an illicit association to commit 'an indeterminate number of frauds' in the episode. 'Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president's actions were essential,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentine-judge-investigates-fraud-case-against-president-milei-over-crypto-promotion/7978683.html	2025-02-17T17:22:09-08:00	
Sources: Wagner mercenaries, Mali army accused of killing civilians	DAKAR, Senegal — Around 20 people were killed in northern Mali on Monday when the vehicles they were traveling in came under attack, with local sources telling Agence France-Presse that Wagner mercenaries and Mali's army were responsible. A relative of the driver of one of the vehicles told AFP from the northern city of Gao that the group was bound for Algeria when the deadly attack occurred. 'The driver of the first vehicle is my cousin,' they said on the condition of anonymity. 'They encountered a group of Wagner mercenaries and some Malian soldiers who shot at them. In the first car, everyone died. My cousin too,' they said, specifying that the passengers included illegal migrants and nomads. Mali's army did not provide an official comment on the accusations when approached by AFP on Monday. However, a military source refuted the claims, saying an investigation was underway but 'the army killed no one.' 'What happened is serious. These were civilians who were killed in the two vehicles in the Tilemsi region,' a representative from the Gao region told AFP. 'In total, in the two vehicles, there are at least 20 dead,' he said. The separatist rebel group Front for the Liberation of Azawad (FLA) condemned the continuation of 'ethnic cleansing carried out by the Bamako junta against the Azawad population.' The FLA statement claimed two vehicles 'were intercepted by the terrorist coalition FAMA (Malian Armed Forces)/Wagner.' 'Among the passengers, at least 24 people, including women and children, were coldly executed by the Malian army and Wagner's Russian mercenaries,' the statement continued. Mali, run by a military junta following coups in 2020 and 2021, has spent the past dozen years mired in a security crisis due to violence by groups affiliated with Al-Qaida and Islamic State. The military junta has been supported by Wagner mercenaries since breaking ties with former colonial ruler France. The nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch in December denounced the 'atrocities' committed against civilians by the Malian army and its Russian ally Wagner, as well as by Islamist armed groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sources-wagner-mercenaries-mali-army-accused-of-killing-civilians/7978672.html	2025-02-17T17:04:38-08:00	
European leaders gather for emergency summit on defense, Ukraine	PARIS — European leaders called for beefing up their defense spending Monday after a Paris summit on Ukraine and the region's security — amid concerns about an aggressive Russia and declining support from Washington. The emergency meeting comes ahead of U.S.-Russian talks on ending the war in Ukraine — which it appears could leave out the Europeans. The summit, called by French President Emmanuel Macron, came as Europeans confront a shift in transatlantic relations under the new administration U.S. President Donald Trump. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said European security was at a 'turning point.' Ahead of the Paris talks — gathering European Union, NATO and British leaders — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described efforts to introduce competition between the European Union and the United States as senseless and potentially dangerous. Ian Lesser, who heads the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund policy institute, said there are two big issues on the agenda for European leaders in the near term. 'It’s all about what can be done for and with Ukraine, in anticipation of the United States doing less, and possibly in anticipation of having to guarantee a settlement or at least a ceasefire,' Lesser said. 'The other long-term question, which is some ways more serious, is how to secure Europe’s defense with the United States potentially absent in the years to come And there, I think, there’s very little consensus, and it’s a very big and expensive and long-term project for Europe.' Top U.S. and Russian officials were to hold talks Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to discuss Ukraine and a possible summit between President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Neither Ukraine nor the Europeans have been invited. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country is willing to send troops to Ukraine as part of any peace deal. Other European leaders say that’s premature. Meanwhile, the foreign minister of Hungary, which is close to both Russia and the Trump administration, said the Paris talks undermine peace. Leaders in Paris also discussed ways to rapidly increase Europe’s own defense capabilities and support for Ukraine. 'Increased spending at home, increased defense production, increased sizes of armies, increased intelligence cooperation, increased training — all of this is to happen, in addition to supplying Ukraine so its front line doesn’t collapse,' said Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House think tank in London. She described a key security conference in Munich last week, which left Europe concerned about Washington’s new priorities, as a wake-up call. 'It’s a different White House and a different team,' she said. 'And Europe was slow to realize that and to find the right words and the right package for this transactional world of America.' The U.S. has long pushed Europe to do more for its own defense. Now — with Russia gaining the advantage on the ground in Ukraine, and Washington calling for NATO members to increase military budgets — Europeans are sensing an urgency to do so.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-leaders-gather-for-emergency-summit-on-defense-ukraine-/7978663.html	2025-02-17T16:54:17-08:00	
European leaders hold crisis security talks as US signals transatlantic reset	London — European leaders held a crisis security meeting Monday in Paris after a blizzard of diplomatic interventions by Washington in recent days that have raised doubts over the U.S. commitment to the transatlantic alliance, the bedrock of European security. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other European leaders were among those attending the emergency summit at the Elysee Palace. Starmer spoke to reporters after the meeting. 'At stake is not just the future of Ukraine. It is an existential question for Europe as a whole and therefore vital for Britain's national interest,' he said. 'It's clear the U.S. is not going to leave NATO. But we Europeans will have to do more. The issue of burden-sharing is not new, but it is now pressing. And Europeans will have to step up, both in terms of spending and the capabilities that we provide.' 'Europe must play its role, and I'm prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground alongside others, if there is a lasting peace agreement. ... But there must be a U.S. backstop, because a U.S. security guarantee is the only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again,' Starmer told reporters in Paris. Scholz, who faces elections at the end of this week, echoed calls for Europe and Ukraine to be part of the peace talks. 'It is now very clear to us that we must continue to support Ukraine. And it must and can rely on us that this will be the case. We welcome the fact that there are talks on peace development, but it must be and is clear to us — this does not mean that there can be a dictated peace and that Ukraine must accept what is presented to it,' Scholz said. Ukraine aid A series of policy shifts by Washington over the past week have transformed Europe’s geopolitical calculations. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO allies last week that Europe must provide the overwhelming share of aid for Ukraine as it fights Russian invaders. 'Now is the time to invest, because you can't make an assumption that America's presence will last forever,' Hegseth said in a Friday speech in Warsaw. 'The reality that returning to 2014 borders as part of a negotiated settlement is unlikely. The reality of U.S. troops in Ukraine is unlikely. The reality of Ukraine membership in NATO as a part of a negotiated settlement, unlikely,' Hegseth said. Peace talks Earlier in the week, U.S. President Donald Trump held a 45-minute phone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, effectively ending Moscow’s isolation since his February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both leaders agreed to begin Ukraine peace talks in Riyadh beginning Tuesday — with Kyiv and Europe excluded from the table. 'That may grate a little bit. But I'm telling you something that's really quite honest … when you looked at Minsk II [peace agreements], there was a lot of people at the table that really had no ability to execute some type of peace process, and it failed miserably. So, we're not going to go down that path,' Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told delegates Saturday at the Munich Security Conference. That approach is unsustainable, said analyst Armida van Rij, who leads the Europe program at London’s Chatham House. 'Given the U.S. has taken itself out of the equation when it comes to … providing security guarantees for Ukraine or monitoring any kind of potential ceasefire that may happen, it’s really up to the Europeans to implement any kind of ceasefire or peace deal. So, you need the Europeans at the table to be able to discuss that, because otherwise, why would they sign up to something that's been discussed over their heads that commits their troops in a potential risk of direct conflict with Russia?' van Rij told VOA. ‘Tectonic shifts’ The diplomatic flurry will have profound consequences for European security, according to Daniela Schwarzer, a political analyst at the Bertelsmann Stiftung Foundation in Germany. 'We are witnessing tectonic shifts of the order structures and also of the positioning of major powers. We see that the United States wants to retreat from international organizations, so it is weakening structures of international order,' Schwarzer told Reuters. European leaders should have been prepared, said van Rij. 'We could have seen this coming for a long time, but it hasn't been said that starkly and in such clear terms before, and that was really the wake-up call for many, many Europeans. 'Now it’s crunch time to get this going — particularly in the short term, of course, in terms of not just maintaining but upping support for Ukraine, given it's very clear that the U.S. is not going to play a major role anymore in the way that it has under [former President Joe] Biden. But also for European defense and security in the medium to longer term, what that's going to look like? So, there are huge questions hanging over Europeans,' van Rij told VOA. Only 23 of NATO’s 32 members met the alliance target of spending at least 2% of gross national income on defense in 2024, let alone the 5% recently demanded by Trump. 'That's going to be a really difficult thing for many Europeans who are operating in a fiscally very constrained space,' van Rij said. Democratic values U.S. criticism went beyond questions of defense. At the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Vice president JD Vance questioned Europe’s democratic values, criticizing mass migration and a perceived attack on freedom of speech in Europe, including the exclusion of far-right parties from power. 'The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values,' Vance told delegates in Munich on Friday. His comments were described as 'unacceptable' by German officials. Europe is reeling from the new tone in transatlantic relations, said van Rij. 'What has come as a surprise is the style in which this has been done. And that's been really breaking all the norms in terms of how diplomacy is conducted, essentially. Reality has hit very, very clearly,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-leaders-hold-crisis-security-talks-as-us-signals-transatlantic-reset/7978667.html	2025-02-17T16:51:53-08:00	
Four top New York City officials resign as turmoil ripples over mayor's corruption case	NEW YORK — Four top deputies to New York City Mayor Eric Adams are resigning in the latest fallout from the Justice Department's push to end a corruption case against Adams and ensure his cooperation in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — a bargain that has raised questions about the mayor’s political independence and ability to lead the city. In a statement Monday, Adams confirmed the departures of First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi, Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Chauncey Parker. 'I am disappointed to see them go, but given the current challenges, I understand their decision and wish them nothing but success in the future,' said Adams, who faces several challengers in June's Democratic primary. 'But let me be crystal clear: New York City will keep moving forward, just as it does every day.' City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams became the latest Democrat to call on the mayor to resign, saying that with the deputy mayor resignations it's clear he 'has now lost the confidence and trust of his own staff, his colleagues in government and New Yorkers.' Speaker Adams is not related to the mayor. Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom told agency heads and staff in a memo that they were exiting because of 'the extraordinary events of the last few weeks.' They did not give a date for their departures, but Adams said they and Parker will remain 'for the time being to ensure a seamless transition.' Adams has faced increasing scrutiny since the Justice Department's second-in-command ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan last week to drop the mayor's corruption case. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove wrote that the case had 'unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.' That directive touched off firestorms within the Justice Department and New York political circles, with seven federal prosecutors quitting in protest — including the interim U.S. attorney for Manhattan — and fellow Democrats calling on Adams to resign. On Friday, after a week of recriminations and resignations, Bove and a pair of Justice Department officials from Washington stepped in and filed paperwork asking Manhattan federal Judge Dale E. Ho to dismiss the case. Ho has yet to take action on the request. Adams, a former police captain, pleaded not guilty last September to charges that he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor. The Justice Department said in its filing Friday that it was seeking to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later, which critics see as a carrot to ensure his compliance on the Republican president's objectives. In his memo ordering prosecutors to ditch the case, Bove said the new, permanent U.S. attorney would review the matter after the November election. 'It certainly sounds like President Trump is holding the mayor hostage,' Reverend Al Sharpton, an Adams ally, said Tuesday. 'I have supported the mayor, but he has been put in an unfair position — even for him — of essentially political blackmail.' Political leaders, including Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, and Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado have called on Adams to step down. But Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul has said she's taking a more deliberative approach. 'The allegations are extremely concerning and serious, but I cannot as the governor of this state have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction like a lot of other people are saying right now,' she told MSNBC on Thursday. 'I’ve got to do it smart, what’s right, and I’m consulting with other leaders in government right now.' The drama over Adams' legal case played out as the mayor met with Trump’s border czar in New York on Thursday and announced increased cooperation on the Trump administration's efforts to remove immigrants, including reestablishing an office for immigration authorities at the city's notorious Rikers Island jail. In their memo to staff announcing their exits, Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom wrote, 'Due to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from our roles.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-top-new-york-city-officials-resign-as-turmoil-ripples-over-mayor-s-corruption-case-/7978647.html	2025-02-17T16:26:54-08:00	
Experts push to restore Syria's war-torn heritage sites, including Roman ruins at Palmyra	PALMYRA, SYRIA — Experts are returning to Syria's war-ravaged heritage sites, hoping to lay the groundwork for restoring them and reviving tourism, which they say could provide a much-needed boost to the country's decimated economy after nearly 14 years of war. Once-thriving landmarks like the ancient city of Palmyra and the medieval Crusader castle of Crac des Chevaliers remain scarred by years of conflict, but local tourists are returning to the sites, and conservationists hope their historical and cultural significance will eventually draw international visitors back. Palmyra One of Syria's six UNESCO World Heritage sites, Palmyra, was once a key hub to the ancient Silk Road network linking the Roman and Parthian empires to Asia. Located in the Syrian desert, it is renowned for its 2,000-year-old Roman-era ruins. It is now marked by shattered columns and damaged temples. Before the Syrian uprising that began in 2011 and soon escalated into a brutal civil war, Palmyra was Syria's main tourist destination, attracting around 150,000 visitors monthly, Ayman Nabu, a researcher and expert in ruins told The Associated Press. Dubbed the 'Bride of the Desert,' he said 'Palmyra revitalized the steppe and used to be a global tourist magnet.' The ancient city was the capital of an Arab client state of the Roman Empire that briefly rebelled and carved out its own kingdom in the third century, led by Queen Zenobia. In more recent times, the area had darker associations. It was home to Tadmur prison, where thousands of opponents of the Assad family's rule in Syria were reportedly tortured. The Islamic State group demolished the prison after capturing the town. IS militants later destroyed Palmyra's historic temples of Bel and Baalshamin and the Arch of Triumph, viewing them as monuments to idolatry, and beheaded an elderly antiquities scholar who had dedicated his life to overseeing the ruins. Between 2015 and 2017, control of Palmyra shifted between IS and the Syrian army before Assad's forces, backed by Russia and Iran-aligned militias, recaptured it. Fakhr al-Din al-Ma'ani Castle, a 16th-century fortress overlooking the city, was repurposed by Russian troops as a military barracks. Nabu, the researcher, visited Palmyra five days after the fall of the former government. 'We saw extensive excavation within the tombs,' he said, noting significant destruction by both IS and Assad government forces. 'The (Palmyra) museum was in a deplorable state, with missing documents and artifacts — we have no idea what happened to them.' Inside the city's underground tombs, Islamic verses are scrawled on the walls, while plaster covers wall paintings, some depicting mythological themes that highlight Palmyra's deep cultural ties to the Greco-Roman world. Crac des Chevaliers Beyond Palmyra, other historical sites bear the scars of war. Perched on a hill near the town of Al-Husn, with sweeping views, Crac des Chevaliers, a medieval castle originally built by the Romans and later expanded by the Crusaders, was heavily bombarded during the Syrian civil war. On a recent day, armed fighters in military uniform roamed the castle grounds alongside local tourists, taking selfies among the ruins. Hazem Hanna, an architect and head of the antiquities department of Crac des Chevaliers, pointed to the collapsed columns and an entrance staircase obliterated by airstrikes. Damage from government airstrikes in 2014 destroyed much of the central courtyard and the arabesque-adorned columns, Hanna said. The Dead Cities In northwest Syria, more than 700 abandoned Byzantine settlements called Dead Cities, stretch across rocky hills and plains, their weathered limestone ruins featuring remnants of stone houses, basilicas, tombs and colonnaded streets. Despite partial collapse, arched doorways, intricate carvings and towering church facades endure, surrounded by olive trees that root deep into history. Dating back to the first century, these villages once thrived on trade and agriculture. Today, some sites now shelter displaced Syrians, with stone houses repurposed as homes and barns, their walls blackened by fire and smoke. Crumbling structures suffer from poor maintenance and careless repurposing. Looters have ravaged the ancient sites, Nabu said, leaving gaping holes in search of artifacts. Local visitors carve names and messages into centuries-old walls. Sheep enclosures dot the ruins, plastic debris blending with ancient stone. Moustafa Al-Kaddour, a local resident, returned after eight years. Touring the ruins with family members he brought from Quneitra. He said the Assad forces had established a military position in the village, subjecting the ruins to heavy shelling and gunfire. The area was then controlled by rebels, who made the area off-limits to most Syrians and international tourists, unlike Palmyra, which still saw some visitors during the war. The Dead Cities were added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2011 as an open-air museum, said Nabu.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-push-to-restore-syria-s-war-torn-heritage-sites-including-roman-ruins-at-palmyra/7978643.html	2025-02-17T16:23:40-08:00	
European leaders hold crisis talks as US signals transatlantic reset	European leaders held a crisis meeting Monday in Paris to discuss Ukrainian and European security.

Taiwan considers multibillion-dollar arms purchase from US, sources say	WASHINGTON/TAIPEI — Taiwan is exploring buying arms worth billions of dollars from the United States, sources briefed on the matter said, hoping to win support from the new Trump administration as China continues to apply military pressure on the island. Three sources familiar with the situation, speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, told Reuters that Taiwan is in talks with Washington. The package is meant to demonstrate to the United States that Taiwan is committed to its defense, one of the sources said. A second source said the package would include coastal defense cruise missiles and HIMARS rockets. 'I would be very surprised if it was less than $8 billion. Somewhere between $7 billion to $10 billion,' the source added. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz has said he wants to speed delivery of weapons to Taiwan. Taiwan's defense ministry declined to comment on specific purchases but said it is focused on building its defenses. 'Any weaponry and equipment that can achieve those goals for building the military are listed as targets for tender,' it said. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan strongly objects to China’s sovereignty claims and says only the island’s people can decide their future. Trump-Taiwan relations U.S. President Donald Trump unnerved chip powerhouse Taiwan on the election campaign trail by saying the island stole American semiconductor business. This month, he threatened tariffs on chip imports. But his administration maintained diplomatic support for the Chinese-claimed island. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba issued a joint statement on Feb. 7 opposing any attempt to change the current situation in the Taiwan Strait through force or coercion. The U.S. State Department also removed language on its website that it does not support Taiwan independence, a move praised by the island's government. China has urged the U.S. to 'correct its mistakes.' Taiwan plans to propose a special defense budget that prioritizes precision ammunition, air-defense upgrades, command and control systems, equipment for the reserve forces and anti-drone technology, a third source familiar with the matter said. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump established regular arms sales to Taiwan, including multibillion-dollar deals for F-16 fighter jets. The Biden administration continued these sales, though often with smaller price tags. Taiwanese officials see encouraging signs from Trump's administration even as tariff threats weigh on that optimism. Taiwan does not believe Trump is looking to make a 'grand bargain' with Chinese President Xi Jinping to sell out Taiwan's interests, one of the sources said. Trump is more concerned with putting tariffs on semiconductors, the source said. In another sign of U.S. commitment to Taiwan, the top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Raymond Greene, will retain his post, three sources told Reuters, even as other U.S. diplomatic postings undergo major reshuffles. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Greene remains director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the unofficial U.S. Embassy in Taipei.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-considers-multibillion-dollar-arms-purchase-from-us-sources-say-/7978401.html	2025-02-17T16:00:17-08:00

Weekend clashes claim 14 lives in drug violence-torn Ecuador	GUAYAQUIL, ECUADOR — Clashes between rival criminal groups claimed the lives of 14 people over the weekend in Ecuador's port city of Guayaquil, the epicenter of a bloody power struggle between narco gangs, police said Monday. In one incident, gunmen on motorcycles fired into a crowd gathered outside a grocery store, killing a minor and six adults, police chief Santiago Tuston said, warning of possible 'reprisals' to follow. Social media videos of the aftermath of the attack showed shocking images of bodies lying on the street in northern Guayaquil. Tuston said the massacre — the exact motive of which was not divulged — brought to 14 the number of people killed in Guayaquil over the weekend. He did not provide details of the other killings. Guayaquil is the capital of the southwestern Guayas province, where a state of emergency has been in place since January as authorities battle to curtail spiraling violence in the once-peaceful South American country. Ecuador is home to an estimated 20 criminal gangs involved in trafficking, kidnapping and extortion, wreaking havoc in a country of 18 million that is squeezed between the world's biggest cocaine producers, Peru and Colombia. In recent years, the nation has been plunged into violence by the rapid spread of transnational cartels that use its ports — particularly in Guayaquil — to ship drugs to the United States and Europe. Homicides have risen from six per 100,000 inhabitants in 2018 to a record 47 in 2023. Under a state of emergency and military crackdown launched by President Daniel Noboa, in office since November 2023, that figure dropped to 38 per 100,000 last year, according to official data. Last Friday, hitmen gunned down a colonel who had been in charge of anti-drug operations in a different part of the port city. Noboa is seeking a new term in elections that will go to a runoff in April after an inconclusive first round last Sunday saw him narrowly pip challenger Luisa Gonzalez. Over the weekend, the president replaced his interior minister with retired police general Fausto Buenano, who has years of experience fighting narco gangs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/weekend-clashes-claim-14-lives-in-drug-violence-torn-ecuador/7978377.html	2025-02-17T14:59:57-08:00

Bus crash in Bolivia kills over 30 people	LA PAZ, BOLIVIA — A bus crash in Bolivia on Monday killed at least 31 people and wounded over a dozen more, according to local police. The driver of the bus likely lost control of the vehicle, causing it to drop nearly 800 meters (2,625 feet) off a precipice in the southwestern municipality of Yocalla, said a police officer speaking from the local hospital. 'There are at least 30' deceased who have been counted already and are being transferred from the crash site to the morgue, Colonel Victor Benavides told AFP. Of those injured in the crash, 10 adults and four children had been hospitalized, with several in intensive care, an official from the hospital said in a video. The mountainous route is full of twists and turns, the police officer said, adding that the speed the bus was traveling at could have been a factor in the crash. Some information in this story came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bus-crash-in-bolivia-kills-over-30-people/7978338.html	2025-02-17T13:57:18-08:00	
Trump begins firings of FAA air traffic control staff just weeks after fatal DC plane crash	Washington — The Trump administration has begun firing several hundred Federal Aviation Administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend and just weeks after a January fatal mid-air collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Probationary workers were targeted in late night emails Friday notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement. The affected workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance, one air traffic controller told the Associated Press. The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a brief statement Monday it was 'analyzing the effect of the reported federal employee terminations on aviation safety, the national airspace system and our members.' Other FAA employees who were fired were working on an urgent and classified early warning radar system the Air Force had announced in 2023 for Hawaii to detect incoming cruise missiles, through a program that was in part funded by the Department of Defense. It's one of several programs that the FAA's National Defense Program manages that involve radars providing longer-range detection around the country's borders. Due to the nature of their work, staff in that office typically provide an extensive knowledge transfer before retiring to make sure no institutional knowledge is lost, said Charles Spitzer-Stadtlander, one of the employees in that branch who was terminated. The Hawaii radar and the FAA National Defense Program office working on it 'is about protecting national security,' Spitzer-Stadtlander said. 'I don't think they even knew what NDP does, they just thought, ‘oh no big deal, he just works for the FAA.’' Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. on Friday and continued late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or barred from entering FAA buildings on Tuesday, he said. The firings hit the FAA when it faces a shortfall in controllers. Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements. In the Jan. 29 fatal crash between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport. Just days before the collision, President Donald Trump had already fired all the members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and airports. Spitzer-Stadtlander said he was supposed to be exempted from the probationary firings because the FAA office he worked in focused on national security threats such as attacks on the national airspace by drones. The Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The firings were first reported by CNN.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-begins-firings-of-faa-air-traffic-control-staff-just-weeks-after-fatal-dc-plane-crash/7978308.html	2025-02-17T13:21:41-08:00	
Delta plane flips on landing at Toronto airport, injuring 8	A plane crashed at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday, officials said, with CBC television reporting the plane flipped on landing. CBC and CP24 television both reported eight people were injured. Toronto's Pearson Airport said it was aware of an incident involving a Delta Air Lines’ regional flight arriving from Minneapolis and that emergency teams were responding. All passengers and crew were accounted for, the airport said in a statement on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. 'Emergency teams are responding,' the post added. Other social media posts appeared to show the jet upside down on the tarmac in Toronto, Ontario. Representatives for Delta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'There is a plane crash. However, we don't know the circumstances surrounding it at this point,' said Constable Sarah Patten of the Peel Regional Police in Ontario. 'It is my understanding that most of the passengers are out and unharmed but we're still trying to make sure so we're still on scene investigating,' Patten said. Airport staff told local media, CTV News, that the airport shut down arrivals and departures for the time being. Reuters was unable to confirm this with Pearson Airport officials, but the airport’s website shows multiple delays impacting arrivals and departures. Peel police say paramedics on the scene have set up a staging area off the runway.	https://www.voanews.com/a/delta-plane-flips-on-landing-at-toronto-airport-injuring-8/7978293.html	2025-02-17T13:11:08-08:00	
Syria arrests 3 men suspected of links to 2013 Tadamon massacre	TADAMON, SYRIA — Security forces in Syria said Monday that they arrested three people involved in the execution of hundreds of civilians by government forces in Damascus in 2013, two years after the country’s 13-year civil war began. Dozens of police and security trucks lined the streets of Tadamon, a Damascus suburb near the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, where they carried out the arrests in the same streets that once bore witness to mass executions. Masked, rifle-wielding men moved through hollowed-out buildings, remnants of a war that turned the district into a front line between government forces and opposition fighters. In 2022, a leaked video dated April 16, 2013, appeared to contain harrowing footage of the executions. The near seven-minute clip showed members of Syria’s notorious Military Intelligence Branch 227 leading a line of about 40 blindfolded prisoners, their hands tied behind their backs, into an abandoned building in Tadamon. One by one, the gunmen pushed or kicked the prisoners into a trench filled with old tires, shooting them as they fell. One of the three men arrested was Monzer Al-Jazairi, a resident of the Zahira neighborhood and a former operative with the military security that operated before the fall of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. 'We used to bring detainees arrested at checkpoints, put them under the buildings here and execute them, and then after we’re done, explode the buildings over them,' Al-Jazairi told The Associated Press. It was unclear whether Al-Jazairi, flanked by security men as he spoke, was speaking under duress or voluntarily. 'Every batch constituted around 25 [people],' he said, adding that 'around one week' passed between one batch and the next. He estimated that he and his colleagues killed 'around 500' people. Damascus Security Chief Lt. Col. Abdul Rahman Al-Dabbagh corroborated the number, citing additional confessions from those arrested. 'Many of those killed used to be collected at checkpoints and security (detention) centers, brought to Tadamon neighborhood, where they were executed,' Al-Dabbagh told the AP. The two other arrested suspects were identified as Somer Mohammed Al-Mahmoud and Imad Mohammed Al-Mahmoud. Years after the Syrian war’s worst massacres and mass disappearances, most alleged crimes have not been investigated and remain unpunished. Since Assad's ouster, Syrian security forces, under the new leadership led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have been tracking down and arresting remnants of the former government and military across the country. 'The operation is ongoing to apprehend all those involved in violations and massacres against Syrians,' Al-Dabbagh said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-arrests-3-men-suspected-of-links-to-2013-tadamon-massacre/7978208.html	2025-02-17T11:46:22-08:00	
Getting Cyprus natural gas to market via Egypt hailed as milestone	NICOSIA, CYPRUS — A pair of agreements outlining how sizable natural gas deposits inside Cypriot waters will get to market via processing facilities in Egypt are a milestone for energy cooperation, Cyprus' president said Monday. President Nikos Christodoulides said the cooperation between Cyprus and Egypt is helping to define the regional energy map, calling the agreements 'game-changers' that are 'pivotal for our strategic partnership.' The first agreement between Egypt, Cyprus and a consortium made up of energy companies Total of France and Italy’s Eni foresees piping natural gas from a deposit known as Cronos to Egyptian facilities where it will be liquefied and processed for export to markets including Europe. The Eni-Total consortium, which holds exploratory licenses for four of the 13 areas or blocks inside Cyprus’ offshore economic zone, will make a final decision on how it will extract and convey the gas before the summer this year. Eni Chief Executive Officer Claudio Descalzi called the agreement a decisive step toward creating an energy hub in the eastern Mediterranean. Officials haven't disclosed how large the Cronos deposit is, but it's believed to hold more than the Aphrodite deposit — the first gas field discovered inside Cyprus' exclusive economic zone in 2011 — that's estimated to contain 4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas. The second agreement between Egypt, Cyprus and a consortium composed of Chevron, NewMed Energy and Shell sets out the framework under which the Aphrodite deposit will be developed and monetized. The Aphrodite deal comes three days after the Cypriot government and the Chevron-led consortium approved a revised development and production plan for the deposit that includes a floating platform that processes extracted natural gas as well as a pipeline link to Egypt. Cypriot Energy Minister George Papanastasiou said last month the options of whether to use Aphrodite gas for Egypt’s domestic energy needs or to process it for export are still being weighed. Christodoulides also held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on the two countries' next energy cooperation goals as well as regional developments. Christodoulides also met on the sidelines of Egypt’s energy exhibition EGYPES 2025 with ExxonMobil’s Vice President for Global Exploration John Ardill. ExxonMobil and partners Qatar Petroleum — which hold exploration licenses for two Cypriot blocks — are currently drilling a new well near the existing Glaucus deposit, which is estimated to contain 5 to 8 trillion cubic feet of gas. Papanastasiou has said there are 'positive' indications of natural gas quantities at the new Elektra well, also in Cypriot waters, with preliminary results expected in early April.	https://www.voanews.com/a/getting-cyprus-natural-gas-to-market-via-egypt-hailed-as-milestone/7978170.html	2025-02-17T11:17:00-08:00	
World Bank: Afghanistan's economic recovery precarious	ISLAMABAD — The World Bank reported Monday that the economic recovery in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan remains precarious, beset by persistent challenges, including policy uncertainty, financial isolation, reduced foreign aid and fragile trade relations with neighboring Pakistan. The bank assessed in its latest report that persistent high poverty levels, unemployment, limited resources, and weak purchasing power continue to leave millions of Afghans vulnerable in a country reeling from years of conflict and natural disasters. The World Bank report revealed that Afghanistan’s trade deficit surged by 54% in 2024, reaching $9 billion, which represents 45% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). The report attributes this decline to a 5% drop in exports, totaling $1.8 billion, primarily due to a reduction in coal and textile exports. In August 2021, the Islamist Taliban regained control of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of all U.S.-led Western forces from the country, marking the end of nearly two decades of foreign presence. The Taliban takeover led to the suspension of international aid and the imposition of sanctions on the financial and banking sectors. These measures were implemented in response to terrorism concerns, as key Taliban leaders were designated as global terrorists by the United Nations for directing years of insurgent attacks on U.S.-led foreign troops. 'Coal exports saw the steepest decline, plunging 64 percent to USD 92 million as Pakistan shifted to its traditional suppliers,' stated the World Bank. The report highlighted an 11.5% increase in Afghan revenue collection, primarily driven by non-tax revenue and taxes levied at the country’s borders. 'Revenue collection remained strong in the first ten months of FY2024-25 (March 22, 2024 – January 21, 2025), totaling AFN 190.5 billion ($2.5 billion), or 12 percent of annual GDP,' stated the report. The local currency, the Afghani (AFN), continued its depreciation trajectory for the third consecutive month, falling 12% from November 2024 to January 2025. The report explained that the central Afghan bank suspended U.S. dollar auctions from Sept. 4 to Dec. 9, contributing to the depreciation of the local currency. The auctions resumed in January 2025, with the bank injecting more than $100 million. The World Bank noted that Afghanistan, a landlocked nation, is compelled to diversify its export markets due to its precarious trade relations with Pakistan. Consequently, Iran, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan each account for approximately 3% of the overall volume of Afghan exports. 'However, Pakistan remains the largest export destination, accounting for 45%, followed by India at 34%,' the report stated. Afghanistan relies on Pakistani overland routes and seaports for bilateral and international trade. Allegations that militants on Afghan soil are responsible for the rise in terrorist attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan have strained ties, affecting economic cooperation between the countries. Pakistani officials have also complained that the Taliban have imposed high taxes and duties on bilateral trade, demanding significantly higher coal prices than international rates, resulting in a decline in mutual trade. Furthermore, Islamabad asserts that de facto Afghan authorities are delaying the signing of trade-related agreements, thereby hindering the advancement of bilateral economic cooperation. No countries have recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government of Afghanistan, primarily due to restrictions on freedom of speech and female rights to education and employment. The Taliban attribute the difficulties in achieving economic recovery in the country to Western financial sanctions and the freezing of more than $9 billion in Afghan central bank assets held in the United States and other Western nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-bank-afghanistan-s-economic-recovery-precarious/7978106.html	2025-02-17T11:08:59-08:00	
Chinese official tours Thai-Myanmar border, highlights crackdown on scam centers	Bangkok — Efforts to shut down online scam centers in Myanmar appeared to gain momentum Monday as a top Chinese security official visited both sides of the Thai-Myanmar border ahead of expected large-scale repatriations of workers in the illicit industry. The visit by Liu Zhongyi, China’s vice minister of public security and commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, was part of a stepped-up effort by the three countries to address the online scam problem, Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters. Areas of Myanmar bordering Thailand have been serving as havens for criminal syndicates employing an estimated hundreds of thousands of people from Southeast Asia and elsewhere who help carry out online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Such scams have cost victims around the world tens of billions of dollars, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and find themselves trapped in virtual slavery. Last week, some 260 people from 20 nations, including many from Africa, crossed from Myanmar into Thailand after they were reportedly rescued from scam centers. Thailand and China coordinate crackdown on scam centers On a visit to China in early February, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China’s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks. Just ahead of her visit, Thailand cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border, citing national security and severe damage that Thailand has suffered from scam operations. The repatriations of foreign workers from Myanmar have been organized by the Border Guard Force in Myawaddy, a militia of the Karen ethnic minority that exercises control over the area. However, critics have accused it of being involved in the criminal activities, at least to the extent of providing protection to the scam centers. The group's leader, Saw Chit Thu, denied in a news conference Monday that his group was involved in scam activities, but acknowledged business links to some properties hosting the centers, which he said initially operated simply as resorts. Thai media reported last week that Thailand's Department of Special Investigation was considering seeking arrest warrants for Chit Thu and others for alleged human trafficking. Thousands of workers employed by scam networks Thai officials have said as many as 7,000-10,000 more people may be repatriated, but Phumtham cautioned that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their home countries. The Bangkok Post newspaper reported that an initial batch of about 600 Chinese nationals from scam centers are expected to be flown back to China on chartered flights when Liu concludes his visit. Liu visited the border areas in Thailand’s Tak province Monday and appeared in Myawaddy in Myanmar, apparently at a location where hundreds of people believed to have been rounded up from several scam centers are being held awaiting repatriation. The video of Liu’s visit showed hundreds of people there sitting on the ground with their belongings in a large open-walled hall. 'China is actively conducting bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Thailand, Myanmar, and other countries, taking comprehensive measures to address both the symptoms and root causes, and working together to block criminals from committing crimes in relevant countries,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in Beijing. 'This is part of our joint efforts to eradicate the scourge of online gambling and telecom fraud, and to maintain the safety of people’s lives and property and the order of exchanges and cooperation among regional countries.' Stories of Chinese trapped in Myanmar hurt Thailand's reputation Dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Thailand only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar spread widely on social media in China, causing alarm and denting Thailand's reputation as a safe destination for Chinese visitors. Among those trapped was Chinese actor Wang Xing, who arrived in Thailand on a promise of getting a job and was abducted to Myanmar. He was quickly rescued after the incident circulated on social media. An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023, after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations along its border in Myanmar’s northern Shan state. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-official-tours-thai-myanmar-border-highlights-crackdown-on-scam-centers/7978011.html	2025-02-17T09:43:40-08:00	
Top Greek scientist: Santorini earthquake outlook remains uncertain	ATHENS — The Greek government’s chief seismologist says the frequency of earthquakes affecting Santorini and nearby islands has eased in recent days, but that the outlook for continued tremors in the coming weeks remains uncertain. 'Unfortunately, for now, we must wait. These seismic sequences do not end quickly. They follow their own timeline,' seismologist Costas Papazachos told state-run ERT radio Monday. 'Hopefully, this particular sequence will surprise us in a positive way and resolve itself sooner rather than later,' he said. A state of emergency has been declared on Santorini and the nearby islands of Ios, Amorgos, and Anafi after a swarm of undersea earthquakes this month – sometimes felt every few minutes – prompted thousands of residents and workers to move to the Greek mainland. Schools on the islands remain closed for a third week, while security services have set up rescue teams and backup power generators as part of precautionary measures. The government announced Monday that an emergency port facility was being established on Santorini in case of a wide-scale evacuation. Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at the University of Thessaloniki, currently serves as the representative of two emergency committees that include scientists and officials from government, the military, and emergency services. He said Santorini, a volcanic island shaped by catastrophic eruptions, did not face danger from its dormant volcano, but noted that magma was affecting the tremors. 'The root cause of the activity is the interaction of tectonic and magmatic processes,' he said. 'That does not mean that the molten material – the magma – will manage to break through 8 kilometers [5 miles] of crust and reach the surface, causing a new volcanic eruption.' Scientists were developing a clearer picture after gathering data from multiple sensors, he said. 'We are monitoring not only seismographs but also numerous other systems that track ground deformation, gas emissions, and satellite data,' he said. 'At this moment, I can honestly say we do not have a definitive forecast, as it is too early to assess the current slight de-escalation of seismic activity. We have encountered many surprises.' Earthquakes of up to magnitude 5.1 were recorded Monday in the undersea area bordered by the four islands which remain under a state of emergency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-greek-scientist-santorini-earthquake-outlook-remains-uncertain-/7977959.html	2025-02-17T09:02:02-08:00	
American arrested in Moscow on drug smuggling charges freed	Russia has freed a U.S. citizen arrested earlier this month on drug smuggling charges, according to Russian media reports and a U.S. official. The move appears to be an effort to ease tensions between Moscow and Washington ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Kalob Byers, 28, was detained on Feb. 7 at Moscow's Vnukovo airport after customs officials allegedly found cannabis-laced marmalade in his baggage. According to media reports, Byers had traveled from Istanbul with his Russian fiancee, who was also detained. The authorities said he had attempted to smuggle a 'significant amount' of drugs into the country and put him in custody on the charges of drug smuggling, punishable by a prison term of up to 10 years. Byers has been released from custody and is in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow where he is awaiting a flight home, Russian independent news outlet Meduza reported Monday, citing a Facebook post by his parents. A U.S. official confirmed to The Associated Press that Byers was released to the embassy late Sunday evening. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive matters. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday in response to a question about Byers that Moscow expects 'to discuss restoring the entire complex of Russian-American relations' at the talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, 'so certain events can be viewed in this context.' It wasn't immediately clear whether Byers' fiancee was also released. Russian media reports identified her as Naida Mambetova and said she was placed in pre-trial detention on the same charges. Arrests of American nationals in Russia have become increasingly common in recent years, with relations between Moscow and Washington sinking to Cold War lows over the war in Ukraine. Some have been released in prisoner exchanges. The most recent one included Marc Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania imprisoned in Russia on charges similar to those Byers had faced. Fogel was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a school and handed a 14-year sentence for having what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. He was released and brought back to the U.S. earlier this month in a swap that saw Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the U.S., returned to Russia. The release of Fogel and Byers come as tensions between Russia and the U.S. appear to ease. President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia, saying he and Russia's President Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict following a lengthy direct phone call.	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-arrested-in-moscow-on-drug-smuggling-charges-freed/7977934.html	2025-02-17T08:41:08-08:00	
Somali officials: US airstrike against Islamic State kills 16 militants	Washington — U.S. airstrikes killed 16 militants affiliated with the Islamic State terrorist group in northern Somalia, officials there said Monday. A spokesperson for security operations in the Puntland region, Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed, disclosed the death toll in an interview VOA’s Somali Service. 'The strike carried out by our international security partners killed at least 16 militants including two senior members identified as the group’s bomb-makers, and a bomb factory was destroyed,' Ahmed said. He said local officials are working to verify the names and nationalities of the bomb-makers. Ahmed said that the United Arab Emirates played a role Sunday’s attack. 'The United States government and the United Arab Emirates, both our partners supporting us in the fight against terrorists, were involved [in] the strikes on Sunday night,' he added. Ahmed said the strikes targeted Godka Kunle and Xankookin, two villages in the Cal Miskaad mountain range in Puntland’s Bari region. Ahmed said during the airstrikes, the militants launched drone attacks on the bases of the Puntland security forces in the area. 'Trying to hit back the bases of our security forces, the militants used seven drones. Puntland forces shot down five of them and two others, apparently with explosives, went off,' Ahmed claimed. Somali and U.S. authorities have been working to root out Islamic State groups that established hideouts in mountainous parts of Puntland, a semi-autonomous region in northern Somalia. The U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) said in a statement Monday that it conducted an airstrike against ISIS-Somalia in the country’s northeast Sunday, killing two terrorists, according to an initial assessment. AFRICOM said no civilians were harmed in the operation and said it would continue to evaluate the results and provide updates as necessary. Speaking in Mogadishu, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud commended the U.S. airstrikes. 'The latest U.S. precision strikes against terrorist elements in Puntland reaffirms the strong partnership between Somalia and the United States in the fight against terrorism,' Mohamud said in a statement posted by the Somali National News Agency (SONNA). Sunday’s airstrike is the second the U.S. military carried out in Somalia this month. A similar operation on Feb. 1, which targeted senior ISIS-Somalia leadership in a network of cave complexes in Puntland’s Golis Mountains, killed approximately 14 ISIS operatives, including Ahmed Maeleninine, who the U.S. identified as a key recruiter and financier responsible for coordinating jihadi movements into the U.S. and Europe. Puntland authorities recently launched a military offensive against extremist groups in the region following months of preparations. Puntland claims to have since killed more than 200 Islamic State fighters, dozens of them foreign fighters, and captured villages and bases in the mountainous area controlled by IS.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-officials-us-airstrike-against-islamic-state-kills-16-militants/7977846.html	2025-02-17T07:36:02-08:00	
1st openly gay Muslim imam killed in South Africa; ‘hate crime’ suspected	CAPE TOWN, South Africa — A man regarded as the first openly gay Muslim imam has been fatally shot while sitting in a car in South Africa in what many are calling an assassination because of his teachings. Muhsin Hendricks was killed Saturday in the southern city of Gqeberha after being ambushed by two men in a pick-up truck. Police said the men involved in the killing had their faces covered. A security video of the shooting shows one of them jumping out of their vehicle, running up to the car Hendricks was in and firing a pistol multiple times through a side window. Police have not established a motive for the killing, but political parties and LGBTQ+ organizations say Hendricks was targeted because he started a mosque in Cape Town for gay people and called for members of the LGBTQ+ community to be welcomed into Islam. Homosexuality is forbidden in the Islamic religion. South Africa's Justice Ministry said it was investigating claims that Hendricks was the target of an assassination. Hendricks was known internationally and spoke at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association's conference in South Africa last year. The ILGA family 'is in deep shock at the news of the murder of Muhsin Hendricks and calls on authorities to thoroughly investigate what we fear may be a hate crime,' said Julia Ehrt, executive director of ILGA. 'He supported and mentored so many people in South Africa and around the world in their journey to reconcile with their faith.' The ILGA said Hendricks had spoken of how some people were calling for the closing of his mosque and had branded it the 'gay temple.' The Democratic Alliance, South Africa's second biggest political party, said 'the nature of the killing strongly suggests a professional hit.' Hendricks came out publicly as a gay imam in the mid-1990s and started a support network and later a mosque for gay Muslims. He advocated for their inclusion through his Al-Ghurbaab Foundation and referred to himself as 'the world's first openly queer imam.' 'When I was looking at the way queer Muslims were negotiating this dilemma between Islam and their sexual orientation and identity, I felt compelled to do something about it,' he said, explaining his beliefs. 'And I thought, for me to help would probably be for me to be authentic with myself and come out. I think it's possible to be queer and Muslim or queer and Christian.' In a message on its official Facebook page, the Al-Ghurbaab Foundation said Hendricks was 'a great father and a guardian of many. Continue resting with angels.' The Muslim Judicial Council of South Africa said that while it had consistently stated that Hendricks' position was incompatible with Islamic teachings, 'we unequivocally condemn his murder and any acts of violence targeting members of the LGBTQ community or any other community.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/st-openly-gay-muslim-imam-killed-in-south-africa-hate-crime-suspected-/7977802.html	2025-02-17T06:40:30-08:00	
Doctors change pope's treatment to tackle 'complex' situation, Vatican says	Vatican City — Doctors have changed treatment for Pope Francis' respiratory tract infection to tackle a 'complex clinical situation' and he will remain in hospital for as long as necessary, the Vatican said on Monday. 'The results of the tests carried out in recent days and today have demonstrated a polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract, which has led to a further modification of the therapy,' said a brief statement. 'All tests conducted up to today are indicative of a complex clinical picture that will require an appropriate hospital stay,' it said. The 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the pontiff was 'in good spirits.' He did not specify whether the pope was suffering from a bacterial or viral infection, but said a further update on the pope's condition would be issued later on Monday. While a bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics, viral infections cannot. Viruses usually have to run their course, but the patient can be assisted with other medicines to bring down their fever or help their body fight the infection. A polymicrobial infection is one caused by two or more micro-organisms, and can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The Vatican said on Monday that the pope's planned weekly audience in St. Peter's Square, set for Wednesday, had been cancelled 'due to the continued hospitalization of the Holy Father.' The pope's doctors had earlier ordered complete rest, and Francis was unable to deliver his regular weekly prayer on Sunday to pilgrims in St Peter's Square or lead a special Mass for artists to mark the Catholic Church's Jubilee Year. 'Quite worried’ by pope’s absence Pilgrims visiting the Vatican on Monday offered their hopes that Francis would recover soon. 'We certainly wish for him to get better very quickly,' said Rev. Tyler Carter, a Catholic priest from the United States. 'He is our father and our shepherd, and so we want his continued health and blessing.' Manuel Rossi, a tourist from Milan, Italy, said he was 'quite worried' when the pope cancelled his appearance on Sunday. 'I am 18 years old so I have seen few popes in my life, and am very close to him,' said Rossi. 'I hope he recovers as soon as possible.' While in hospital over the weekend, the pope continued his recent practice of making phone calls to speak with members of a Catholic parish in Gaza, Italian broadcaster Mediaset reported on Monday. One of the parish members said Francis had called on both Friday and Saturday and was in 'good spirits' but sounded 'a bit tired.' 'Thank you for the affection, prayer and closeness with which you accompany me in these days,' a post on the pope's X account said on Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doctors-change-pope-s-treatment-to-tackle-complex-situation-vatican-says/7977788.html	2025-02-17T06:32:47-08:00	
Global benchmarks trade mixed as investors continue to eye Trump	Tokyo — Global shares traded mixed on Monday as investors continued to watch economic data and policy moves from U.S. President Donald Trump, as both are likely to impact upcoming central bank moves. France's CAC 40 dipped nearly 0.1% in early trading to 8,171.59, while Germany's DAX added 0.4% to 22,560.00. Britain's FTSE 100 edged up 0.1% to 8,742.97. U.S. markets are closed on Monday for a holiday. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose in early trading after the Cabinet Office reported that the economy grew at a better-than-expected annual rate of 2.8% in October-December, underlined by steady exports and moderate consumption. But the benchmark quickly fell back and then recovered to be little changed, finishing up less than 0.1% at 39,174.25. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the world’s fourth-largest economy grew 0.7% for its third straight quarter of growth. Japan marked its fourth straight year of expansion, eking out 0.1% growth last year in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, which measures the value of a nation’s products and services. In other regional markets, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,537.10. South Korea's Kospi surged 0.8% to 2,610.42. Hong Kong's Hang Seng reversed course, to slip less than 0.1% to 22,616.23, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.3% to 3,355.83. Markets around the world are nervously watching what upward pressure may come from tariffs that Trump has announced recently. But analysts now think Trump may ultimately avoid triggering a punishing global trade war. His most recent tariff announcement, for example, won’t take full effect for at least several weeks. That leaves time for Washington and other countries to negotiate. The Federal Reserve's goal, as well as that of the Bank of Japan, is to keep inflation at 2%. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 28 cents to $71.02 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 34 cents to $75.08 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar declined to 151.90 Japanese yen from 152.25 yen. The euro cost $1.0472, down from $1.0495.	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-benchmarks-trade-mixed-as-investors-continue-to-eye-trump/7977753.html	2025-02-17T06:05:53-08:00	
Life-threatening cold' expected in some parts of US after deadly weekend flooding	Louisville, Kentucky — Harsh weather moved west on Monday as a polar vortex was expected to grip the Rockies and the northern Plains after winter storms pummeled the eastern United States over the weekend, killing at least 10 people, including nine victims in Kentucky who died during flooding from heavy rains. The National Weather Service warned of 'life-threatening cold' into Tuesday, with temperatures in northeastern Montana predicted to dip as low as -42.7 degrees Celsius (45 degrees below zero) with wind chills down to -51 degrees Celsius (60 below). Meteorologists said several states would experience the 10th and coldest polar vortex event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that the death toll rose to nine. 'I am sad to share some more tough news tonight, Kentucky. We just confirmed another weather-related death out of Pike County, bringing our total loss to 9 people.' Beshear had said earlier Sunday that at least 1,000 people stranded by floods had to be rescued. President Donald Trump approved Kentucky's request for a disaster declaration, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts throughout the state. Beshear said most of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. 'So folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,' he said. Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) of rain, said Bob Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service. 'The effects will continue for a while, a lot of swollen streams and a lot of flooding going on,' Oravec said Sunday. In Alabama, the weather service in Birmingham said it had confirmed an EF-1 tornado touched down in Hale County. Storms there and elsewhere in the state destroyed or damaged a handful of mobile homes, downed trees and toppled power lines, but no injuries were immediately reported. A state of emergency was declared for parts of Obion County, Tennessee, after a levee failed on Saturday, flooding the small community of Rives, home to around 300 people in the western part of the state. 'There will be mandatory evacuations in effect for the residents in Rives due to the rising water, no electricity, and freezing temperatures creating a life-threatening situation,' Mayor Steve Carr said in a statement Sunday. In Atlanta, a person was killed when a large tree fell on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott Powell. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures as low as minus 45.6 (50 degrees below zero) were expected in most of North Dakota, which remained under an 'extreme cold warning' along with large swaths of South Dakota and Minnesota, according to the weather service. Severe flooding Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia over the weekend. Flood warnings extended throughout Tennessee and Arkansas. The mother and child were swept away Saturday night in Kentucky’s Bonnieville community, Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, county Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry said. There was a total of four deaths in Hart County, Beshear said. The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said it had closed its emergency department and transferred all patients to two other hospitals in the region due to a nearby river flooding. High winds brought down trees and power poles across Albemarle County, Virginia. The Charlottesville Police Department said Sunday on social media that officers’ response times could be delayed due to 'an overwhelming number of weather-related calls for service.' Police urged residents to stay off the roads. Power outages were reported along much of the eastern seaboard, from New York south to Georgia. In West Virginia, 13 southern counties were under a state of emergency for flooding and some areas were cut off to vehicle traffic Sunday. Several volunteer fire departments dealt with flooding in their own buildings while answering rescue and evacuation calls. Parts of US hit with snowstorms, polar vortex on the way Ice and snow made road travel treacherous in large swaths of Michigan, which remained under a winter weather advisory until Monday afternoon. Michigan State Police reported 114 crashes Sunday around the Detroit area since snow started falling Saturday. 'Fortunately, most were one-car spin outs and there were no serious injuries,' Michigan State Police said on X. Authorities in Colorado reported eight people were killed in fatal vehicle crashes since Valentine’s Day and warned drivers to be cautious as the weather made driving more difficult. The causes of the fatal crashes weren’t immediately known. Also in Colorado, three state patrol cruisers that had pulled over along roadsides were struck by other vehicles, including one on Sunday where a trooper had stopped as officials prepared to close a road because of ice. In each case the troopers were out of their cruisers at the time and were uninjured. Avalanche warnings were issued for numerous areas of the Rocky Mountains stretching from Colorado to Washington state, with the danger rated highest in Utah.	https://www.voanews.com/a/life-threatening-cold-expected-in-some-parts-of-us-after-deadly-weekend-flooding/7977727.html	2025-02-17T05:57:11-08:00	
China aims to improve ties with EU amid transatlantic tension	Taipei, Taiwan — China has launched a new round of diplomatic outreach to European countries amid rising tension between the United States and its European allies. While top U.S. officials and European leaders clashed over issues such as values, democracy and Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi held bilateral meetings with several top European officials, including EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. 'There is no fundamental conflict of interest or geopolitical conflicts between China and the EU,' Wang said during his meeting with Kallas on Saturday, adding that Beijing 'supports all endeavors conducive to peace and backs Europe in playing a significant role' in the peace negotiation process regarding the war in Ukraine. The EU response was somewhat more reserved, with Kallas saying the EU was ready to 'continue with dialogue and cooperate in selected areas, such as trade, economic affairs, and climate change.' He urged Beijing to halt exports of dual-use goods to Russia, which she said fuels Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Wang’s remarks were in stark contrast to U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s criticism of European countries. Instead of highlighting the threats posed by Russia and China, Vance accused European government of censoring right-wing parties and failing to control migration. 'What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,' he said in a defiant speech that stunned European officials in Munich. Several European leaders quickly rejected Vance’s remarks, with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius saying the U.S. vice president’s characterization of European policies was 'unacceptable.' The rare open clash between the U.S. and European countries came as top U.S. officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff flew to Saudi Arabia on Sunday for talks about the Ukraine-Russia war with Russian diplomats. To the surprise of many European leaders, U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg said in Munich that European countries wouldn’t be part of any peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, which would be mediated by the U.S. Analysts say China’s effort to strengthen engagement with Europe is part of Beijing’s plan to take advantage of divisions between Washington and its European allies. 'China’s posture is about exploiting the perceived mistakes of any U.S. administration,' said Mathieu Duchatel, director of international studies at the French policy group Institut Montaigne. He told VOA by phone that the current tension between the U.S. and European countries has created an opportunity for Beijing to 'weaken the transatlantic alliance on China policy.' Given that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on European countries, other experts say the growing tension in transatlantic relations could force the EU to moderate its policies towards China. 'Since Europe can't afford to wage two trade wars at the same time, it will be difficult for the EU and EU member states to maintain critical policies toward China,' Matej Simalcik, executive director of the Central European Institute of Asian Studies, told VOA in an interview in Taipei. In recent weeks, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has pushed the EU to adopt more assertive policies against China, has repeatedly said the bloc is open to improving relations with China. Europe 'must engage constructively with China – to find solutions in our mutual interest,' she said during a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. US-European ties expected to hold While European countries may consider adjusting their China policies, some European analysts say it’s unlikely for these attempts to turn into a fundamental shift of European policies towards China and the U.S. 'The U.S. and Europe are each other’s most important trading partners, so I don’t think there will be a [complete] transatlantic break,' said Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. European countries 'are testing the grounds and seeing what can be done, but at the same time, European officials have said whatever happens with China, it must be fair,' she told VOA by phone, adding that these factors will prevent the EU from 'walking back' their earlier positions on China entirely. Additionally, Duchatel at Institut Montaigne said Beijing’s decision to appoint former Chinese ambassador to France Lu Shaye, a prominent 'wolf warrior diplomat,' as its special representative for European affairs means China is unlikely to make major concessions in its relations with the EU. 'Lu’s appointment represents inflexibility on everything that matters,' he told VOA, adding that some European diplomats said the new Chinese special envoy would 'turn any diplomatic meeting into some sort of ideological confrontation that leads to no common position' between Beijing and European countries. While China and the EU’s fundamental differences over issues such as Beijing’s partnership with Russia and the trade imbalances remain unresolved, some Chinese academics say the growing tension between the U.S. and European countries still offers an opportunity for Beijing and Europe to 'increase mutual trust.' 'The growing tension in transatlantic relations has created a new environment for China to moderate relations with the EU, but it doesn’t mean European countries will reduce their criticism over Beijing’s partnership with Russia or China’s human rights record,' Shen Ding-li, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar, told VOA by phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-aims-to-improve-ties-with-eu-amid-transatlantic-tension/7977635.html	2025-02-17T05:25:00-08:00	
Rubio visits Saudi Arabia as Israel, Hamas move closer to end of first phase of ceasefire	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Saudi Arabia on Monday as part of a tour of the region that includes a focus on the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Rubio was expected to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman amid objections from Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations about U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to move Palestinians out of Gaza. Trump has suggested the Palestinians would go to neighboring countries, with the United States taking over Gaza and redeveloping the territory. Such a plan would seemingly eliminate Trump’s hopes of getting Saudi Arabia to normalize ties with Israel, a move Saudi officials have said will not happen unless there is a pathway for a Palestinian state. The United States fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Rubio saying that Hamas 'must be eradicated' and 'cannot continue as a military or government force.' With the first phase of the ceasefire set to expire in two weeks, Rubio told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a stop in Jerusalem that 'as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.' Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said 'the gates of hell would be open' if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants. The tentative second phase of the ceasefire plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials. Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on February 27, and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law. Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-visits-saudi-arabia-as-israel-hamas-move-closer-to-end-of-first-phase-of-ceasefire-/7977580.html	2025-02-17T03:54:08-08:00

Militant attack kills 6 Benin soldiers, army spokesperson says	COTONOU, Benin — A militant attack on an army position has killed six soldiers in northern Benin, where government troops are trying to curb cross-border assaults by armed Islamist groups, an army spokesperson said. The encounter on Saturday also left 17 militants dead, spokesperson Ebenezer Honfoga told Reuters late on Sunday, without giving further details. The attack follows the killing of dozens of soldiers in a January assault in the northern department of Alibori, which shares a border with insurgency-plagued Niger and Burkina Faso. Benin and coastal neighbor Togo have both suffered attacks in recent years as groups linked to Islamic State and al Qaeda expanded their presence beyond West Africa's central Sahel region to the north.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militant-attack-kills-6-benin-soldiers-army-spokesperson-says/7977503.html	2025-02-17T01:18:37-08:00	
State media: Cairo building collapse kills 10	Cairo, Egypt — A building collapse in the Egyptian capital killed 10 people and injured eight more on Monday, with several others believed to be missing under the rubble, state media reported. Ambulances were dispatched to the scene in the working-class neighborhood of Kerdasa, where civil defense teams searched for people thought to be missing under the rubble, according to the Al-Akhbar Al-Youm newspaper. Eyewitnesses told the state-owned outlet that 'a gas cylinder explosion' caused the collapse, and a police investigation was underway. Building regulations are unevenly enforced in the sprawling metropolis of Cairo, home to over 26 million people. The city has seen a number of deadly building collapses in recent years, both due to the dilapidated state of some and, at times, failure to comply with building regulations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-media-cairo-building-collapse-kills-10-/7977495.html	2025-02-17T00:55:46-08:00

China urges US to 'correct its mistakes' after State Department removes Taiwan web reference	BEIJING/TAIPEI — China on Monday urged the United States to 'correct its mistakes' after the U.S. State Department removed previous wording on its website about not supporting Taiwan independence, which it said was part of a routine update. The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington's opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own. But as well as dropping the phrase 'we do not support Taiwan independence,' the page added a reference to Taiwan's cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the U.S. will support Taiwan's membership in international organizations 'where applicable.' Beijing regularly denounces any international recognition of Taiwan or contact between Taiwanese and foreign officials, viewing it as encouraging Taiwan's separate status from China. The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn in to his second term in the White House. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said the revisions for Taiwan on the U.S. State Department's website were a big step backwards and 'sends a seriously wrong message to Taiwan independence separatist forces.' 'This is yet another example of the United States' stubborn adherence to the erroneous policy of 'using Taiwan to suppress China'. We urge the United States side to immediately rectify its mistakes,' Guo said. The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. 'As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,' a State Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time responding to questions on the updated website wording. 'The United States remains committed to its one China policy,' the spokesperson said, referring to Washington officially taking no position on Taiwan's sovereignty and only acknowledging China's position on the subject. 'The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,' the spokesperson said. 'We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We support cross-Strait dialog, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.' On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his appreciation for what he called the 'support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations.' Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying that only the island's people can decide their future. Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, who set up the People's Republic of China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-us-to-correct-its-mistakes-after-state-department-removes-taiwan-web-reference/7977487.html	2025-02-17T00:17:14-08:00	
China's Xi holds rare meeting with business leaders amid slowing economy, US tensions	BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday spoke at a symposium attended by business leaders including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, state media reported, as Beijing grapples with a slowing economy and growing tensions with the U.S. Other private business leaders who attended the symposium included Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Xiaomi's Lei Jun, BYD's Wang Chuanfu, Unitree's Wang Xingxing, and CATL's Robin Zeng, a video published by CCTV showed. Meituan's Wang Xing, China Feihe's Leng Youbin and Will Semiconductor founder Yu Renrong also attended, the video showed. Tencent's Pony Ma was also there, a source familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the meeting details were not public. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xi delivered a speech after listening to representatives of private companies, official news agency Xinhua said. The report did not provide any details about the symposium, held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment on Monday that would be attended by the country's business leaders, including Alibaba’s Jack Ma. The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally amid an intensifying China-U.S. technology war, the sources had said. The symposium also comes as DeepSeek's AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China's broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets. Xi has long stressed the need for China to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors and wants the country to use AI to drive economic development. But China's efforts have been hampered by export control measures on chips imposed by Washington which is worried Beijing could use advanced semiconductors to boost its military capabilities. 'It's a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the U.S.,' said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. 'The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the U.S.' Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018, six years after he came to power. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing. 'Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the U.S.,' said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis. 'Still, the regulatory environment is the black box. As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-holds-rare-meeting-with-business-leaders-amid-slowing-economy-us-tensions/7977476.html	2025-02-16T23:33:34-08:00	
France hosting European talks on Ukraine	French President Emmanuel Macron is set to host a group of European leaders for talks Monday focused on the situation in Ukraine amid a shift in the U.S. approach to the conflict and suggestions by U.S. officials that Europe would not have a role in peace talks. Among those expected to attend were leaders from Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark. NATO chief Mark Rutte, European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were also due to participate. European leaders have in recent days pledged continued support for Ukraine, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying his government was ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force. 'I do not say that lightly,' he wrote Sunday in the Daily Telegraph. 'I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way.' Starmer said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from further aggression. Costa said last week’s Munich Security Conference showed the clear message that the security of Ukraine and the European Union 'cannot be separated.' 'There will be no credible and successful negotiations, no lasting peace, without Ukraine and without the European Union.' U.S. officials said Sunday they were heading to Saudi Arabia for talks in the coming days with Russian diplomats about ending the war, which began in February 2022 with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed during an hour-long call last week to the immediate start of peace negotiations, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS’s 'Face the Nation' in an interview that aired Sunday, 'A process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing.' 'We'll see in the coming days and weeks if Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, in a way that is sustainable and fair,' Rubio said. Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz said they were headed to Riyadh for the talks, while a Ukrainian minister says that an official delegation has arrived there in preparation for a possible visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The shape of the talks remained uncertain. Rubio said he wasn't even sure who Moscow was sending. 'Nothing's been finalized yet,' he said, adding that the hope was for an opening for a broad conversation that 'would include Ukraine and would involve the end of the war.' Trump’s call with Putin blindsided NATO allies as well as Kyiv, with Zelenskyy later saying that there should be 'no decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine.' Whatever occurs this week in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said that once 'real negotiations' begin, then Ukraine 'will have to be involved.' In an interview with NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that aired Sunday, Zelenskyy said, 'I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. The war in Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses.' Zelenskyy said he told Trump in a call they had last week that Putin is only pretending to want peace. 'I said that he is a liar. And [Trump] said, ‘I think my feeling is that he's ready for these negotiations.’ And I said to him, ‘No, he's a liar. He doesn't want any peace.'' The United States has been Ukraine’s biggest arms supplier during the conflict, but Trump has wavered on continued support and declined during a political debate last year to say that he wants Ukraine to win. Zelenskyy said that without continued U.S. military support, 'Probably it will be very, very, very difficult' to defeat Russia. 'And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance -- low chance to survive without support of the United States.' Russia now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in 2014, the eastern portion of Ukraine pro-Moscow separatists captured after that, and areas Russian forces have taken since February 2022. Some information for this article came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-hosting-european-talks-on-ukraine/7977462.html	2025-02-16T22:29:25-08:00	
US says strike in Syria killed Al-Qaeda affiliate official	WASHINGTON — The U.S. military said Sunday it killed a member of an Al-Qaeda affiliate organization in a precision airstrike in Syria. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said it conducted the strike Saturday 'in Northwest Syria targeting and killing a senior finance and logistics official in the terrorist organization Hurras al-Din (HaD), an al-Qaida affiliate,' according to a statement on X. CENTCOM did not identify its target. The strike was conducted 'to disrupt and degrade efforts by terrorists to plan, organize, and conduct attacks against civilians and military personnel' from the United States and allies, the statement continued. On Jan. 30, CENTCOM killed another senior operative in Hurras al-Din, Muhammad Salah al-Zabir, in an airstrike. The U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group said Hurras al-Din was founded in February 2018. It did not publicly confirm its allegiance to al-Qaida until its dissolution announcement last month. The United States designated Hurras al-Din as a terrorist organization in 2019 and has offered financial rewards for information on several of its members. 'We will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists in order to defend our homeland, and U.S., allied, and partner personnel in the region,' CENTCOM General Michael Erik Kurilla said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-strike-in-syria-killed-al-qaeda-affiliate-official-/7977430.html	2025-02-16T19:37:48-08:00	
New downloads of DeepSeek suspended in South Korea, data protection agency says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's data protection authority on Monday said new downloads of the Chinese AI app DeepSeek had been suspended in the country after DeepSeek acknowledged failing to take into account some of the agency's rules on protecting personal data. The service of the app will be resumed once improvements are made in accordance with the country's privacy law, the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) said in a media briefing. The measure that came into force on Saturday aims to block new downloads of the app, the agency said, though DeepSeek's web service remains accessible in the country. The Chinese startup appointed legal representatives last week in South Korea and had acknowledged partially neglecting considerations of the country's data protection law, the PIPC said. Italy's data protection authority, the Garante, said last month it had ordered DeepSeek to block its chatbot in the country after failing to address the regulator's concerns over its privacy policy. DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When asked about earlier moves by South Korean government departments to block DeepSeek, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told a briefing on February 6 that the Chinese government attached great importance to data privacy and security and protected it in accordance with the law. The spokesperson also said Beijing would never ask any company or individual to collect or store data in breach of laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-downloads-of-deepseek-suspended-in-south-korea-data-protection-agency-says/7977429.html	2025-02-16T19:31:16-08:00	
Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter open the 'Saturday Night Live' 50th anniversary celebration	NEW YORK — Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter opened the 50th anniversary special celebrating 'Saturday Night Live' with a duet of his song 'Homeward Bound.' The 83-year-old Simon has been a constant on 'SNL' since its earliest episodes in 1975 and performed on the first show after the 9/11 attack. He was joined by the 25-year-old pop sensation of the moment, Carpenter. 'I sang this song with George Harrison on 'Saturday Night Live' in 1976,' Simon said. 'I was not born then,' Carpenter said, getting a laugh. 'And neither were my parents,' she added, getting a bigger laugh. Fifty seasons of 'Saturday Night Live' sketches, songs and special guests are being celebrated for the special's landmark anniversary in a Sunday night special. The pop culture juggernaut has launched the careers of generations of comedians, from Bill Murray to Eddie Murphy and Tina Fey to Kristen Wiig. Many of those stars were on hand for 'SNL50: The Anniversary Celebration,' airing live from New York, of course. 'I grew up with the show, you know, and I was born in 1971, and it's lived with me my whole life,' Amy Poehler, who was a cast member from 2001 to 2008,' said on Sunday ahead of the show's start. 'We have a show to do in just under two hours, and being back is an amazing privilege.' The three-hour extravaganza comes after months of celebrations of 'Saturday Night Live,' which premiered Oct. 11, 1975, with an original cast that included John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner. 'After the original cast, we were just going, Those guys just did it all for us,' Adam Sandler, a cast member from 1990-1995, said before the show. 'They crushed it. We watched them at home. They made their movies. We worshiped their movies. And that's all. What we wanted to do is just kind of continue that sort of stuff.' It's become appointment television over the years as the show has skewered presidents, politics and pop culture and been a platform for the biggest musical stars of the moment. As streaming has altered television viewing, 'SNL' sketches, host monologues and short comedy films remain popular on social media and routinely rack up millions of views on YouTube. While NBC has revealed some of the stars expected to appear, many of the special's moments, cameos and music performances remain a surprise. On Sunday, NBC announced more guest appearances including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Leslie Jones, Billy Crystal, Cher, Mike Myers and Alec Baldwin, who holds the title of the person who's hosted 'SNL' the most times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paul-simon-and-sabrina-carpenter-open-the-saturday-night-live-50th-anniversary-celebration/7977425.html	2025-02-16T18:46:39-08:00	
North Korea's Kim makes rare visit to father's tomb	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has paid his respects at a family mausoleum to mark the birthday of his late father and former leader Kim Jong Il, state media KCNA said on Monday. Kim Jong Il's birthday, which falls on Feb. 16, is widely celebrated as a major holiday in North Korea, called the Day of the Shining Star. But it was the first time in four years that the young Kim visited the Kumsusan Palace of Sun in the capital Pyongyang, which houses the embalmed bodies of his father and grandfather, for the anniversary. Accompanied by Kim Yo Jong, his sister and a senior ruling Workers' Party official, among other aides, Kim Jong Un paid homage 'in the humblest reverence,' KCNA said. 'He expressed his solemn will to devote himself to the sacred struggle for the eternal prosperity of the country, the security of the people and the promotion of their well-being,' it said. The Kim dynasty that has ruled North Korea since its founding after World War II and has sought to strengthen their grip on power by building cults of personality around them, though Kim Jong Un has shown signs of increasingly trying to stand more on his own feet without relying on his predecessors. In another dispatch, KCNA said Kim attended a groundbreaking ceremony on Sunday for the final phase of his pet project to build 50,000 new homes in Pyongyang. The ambitious initiative was launched in 2021 as part of Kim's five-year plan to boost the economy and designed to distribute at least 10,000 new apartments in Pyongyang each year, though some analysts have questioned its feasibility amid international sanctions and economic woes. During the ceremony, Kim lauded construction workers and officials for achieving nearly 400% progress last year compared to 2020 and pledged another plan to continue expanding the city. The project would 'usher in a new era of prosperity of Pyongyang in which the ideal streets of the people to be proud of in the world are built every year,' KCNA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-makes-rare-visit-to-father-s-tomb/7977418.html	2025-02-16T18:32:49-08:00	
Trump administration turns to US Supreme Court in bid to fire agency head	President Donald Trump's administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in its bid to fire the head of an independent U.S. agency that protects government whistleblowers, bringing its first legal battle involving Trump's actions to the nation's highest judicial body since he took office in January. The Justice Department asked the court to immediately lift a federal judge's Feb. 12 order that temporarily blocked Trump's removal of Hampton Dellinger as the head of the Office of Special Counsel while litigation continues in the dispute, according to a copy of the filing reviewed by Reuters. The case has not yet been docketed by the court. The federal judge's action blocking the termination is an 'unprecedented assault on the separation of powers,' Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said in the filing. 'This court should not allow lower courts to seize executive power by dictating to the President how long he must continue employing an agency head against his will,' Harris wrote. Appointed by former President Joe Biden, Dellinger's five-year term was set to expire in 2029. He sued after receiving an email on Feb. 7 informing him that Trump had fired him from the watchdog role, 'effective immediately.' Dellinger's lawsuit said Trump exceeded his power in purporting to fire him, given that federal law permits removal only for 'inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.' The Special Counsel's 'ability to protect the civil service and investigate alleged misconduct is needed now more than ever,' Dellinger's lawsuit said. 'Over the preceding three weeks, an unprecedented number of federal employees with civil service protections have been terminated without cause.' U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C. issued a temporary restraining order on Feb. 12, restoring Dellinger to his position pending a further, preliminary order. Jackson said Dellinger was likely to prevail in the suit given that the effort to fire him without identifying any cause 'plainly contravenes' the Special Counsel's job protections under federal law. 'This language expresses Congress's clear intent to ensure the independence of the Special Counsel and insulate his work from being buffeted by the winds of political change,' Jackson wrote in the order. The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the administration's appeal in a 2-1 decision on Saturday, saying it was premature, given that Jackson's order was only temporary. The Special Counsel Office allows whistleblowers to make disclosures about alleged misconduct within federal agencies and investigates complaints of retaliation. It also enforces a U.S. law known as the Hatch Act that limits political participation by federal employees. The move to fire Dellinger was the latest by the Trump administration to expel officials who investigate wrongdoing within the federal government. Trump last month fired 17 inspectors general who serve as independent watchdogs within their agencies, without providing a reason.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-turns-to-us-supreme-court-in-bid-to-fire-agency-head/7977407.html	2025-02-16T18:13:40-08:00	
Two Kenyans allegedly abducted in broad daylight, held for 32 days	Nairobi — Since June 2024 — when a series of mass protests took place in Kenya — 82 cases of alleged forced disappearances were recorded by the Kenyan National Human Rights Commission. Rights groups say some of those alleged victims have been lucky to reunite with their loved ones, but 29 are still missing. While many accuse the police of perpetrating such acts, it's yet to be confirmed who’s behind the abductions. VOA requests for comments from the National Police Service were not answered. Aslam Longton and his brother, Jamil, told VOA they were abducted near their home in the Kitengela Town neighborhood, about an hour from central Nairobi. Earlier that day in August, Aslam said, he felt uneasy and noticed unfamiliar people watching his every move. The brothers were riding together by car when things unraveled. 'At the first corner, there was a Toyota Vitz parked there and opened all the doors, so I couldn't pass there. I reversed the car and came to this place [where VOA was conducting the interview]. When I entered this place, there was a Subaru that came and blocked me here and a Toyota Axio blocked me behind there,' Aslam recalled. The brothers alleged they were approached by heavily armed men they described as appearing to be police officers and told to switch off their car. Aslam then said 'they opened the car, removed me at the steering [wheel], took me very fast in the Subaru. So, my brother started asking them, who are you? Why are you taking my brother?' Jamil Longton said he was not meant to be taken away that day, but when he pressed the officers, even suggesting to call the neighborhood police station, they refused to identify themselves. 'I kept on asking them who are you, why are you taking my brother? I must go with my brother wherever you are taking him. I told them I’ll call the OCS [Officer Commanding Station] at the Kitengela police station to ask him if he’s aware of what you are doing. ... When I attempted to call the OCS, my phone was confiscated by them. I was slapped, my phone switched off and I was also bangled [bundled] into the Subaru,' he also recalled. The brothers say they were handcuffed, blindfolded, taken to a location, and held there for 32 days. Amnesty International and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights confirm the accounts by the two men and say it’s similar to the treatment of other abductees. 'They were telling us they were denied food. They were kept in handcuffs for days. They were stripped naked and were made to lie on concrete floors for days,' KNHRC’s Ernest Cornel told VOA. Aslam said he was abducted because of to his participation in the nationwide, youth-led, GenZ protests last year against a proposed bill that would have increased taxes. The protests expanded into a call for an end to corruption and for the president to resign. The bill was eventually withdrawn. Aslam’s brother did not take part in the protests, but they said they were both repeatedly questioned about its funding source during their captivity. Rights groups accused the Kenyan police of using excessive force against protesters, in some cases abducting government critics. Police deny the allegations. The police also said they had credible evidence criminal gangs had infiltrated the protests and planned to take advantage. About 60 people died and hundreds were arrested. Since last June, 82 people have gone missing and about 29 are still not accounted for, the rights organization said. In December, following more protests in Nairobi to demand the police produce the missing people, President William Ruto condemned the spike in disappearances, saying 'any criminality must be investigated. Whether undertaken by citizens, criminals or undertaken by the police, it must be investigated, and we must get to the bottom of any criminal activity in Kenya.' Meanwhile, at a recent press conference convened by KNHRC, some of the victims, including Aslam and Jamil, said that after their release, they still are being intimidated and called for international investigations. 'They are saying that when they go to [for a] run in the morning, they can see the car following them. They can see cars parked outside of their homes with their engines running and with their lights on and when they confront the occupants of the car, they sped off,' Cornel says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-kenyans-allegedly-abducted-in-broad-daylight-held-for-32-days-/7974876.html	2025-02-16T17:12:56-08:00

China condemns sailing of Canadian warship in Taiwan Strait	Beijing — China's military on Monday condemned the sailing of a Canadian warship in the Taiwan Strait, saying its air and naval forces had monitored and warned the ship, a mission that came just a few days after U.S. Navy ships made a similar mission. The U.S. Navy, and occasionally ships from allied countries like Canada, Britain and France, transits the strait around once a month. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, also says the strategic waterway belongs to it. Canada's actions 'deliberately stirred up trouble' and undermined peace and stability in the strait, the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. 'Theater forces maintain a high level of alert at all times and resolutely counter all threats and provocations,' it added. The Canadian military declined immediate comment. Both the Chinese and Taiwanese governments identified the ship as the Ottawa. Taiwan's defense ministry said on Sunday that the ship had sailed in a northerly direction, adding that Taiwanese forces also kept watch. Taiwan's foreign ministry welcomed the sailing. 'Canada has once again taken concrete actions to defend the freedom, peace and openness of the Taiwan Strait and has demonstrated its firm position that the Taiwan Strait is international waters,' it said on Sunday. Last October, a U.S. and a Canadian warship sailed together through the strait, less than a week after China conducted a new round of war games around the island. Taiwan's democratically elected government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-condemns-sailing-of-canadian-warship-in-taiwan-strait/7977389.html	2025-02-16T16:41:00-08:00	
Argentine lawyers charge President Milei with fraud over cryptocurrency promotion	Montevideo, Uruguay — Argentine lawyers filed fraud charges against President Javier Milei in criminal court Sunday for promoting a cryptocurrency on his social media, one of the lawyers told The Associated Press. On Friday, Milei posted on X about $LIBRA, a coin that he said was aimed at 'encouraging economic growth by funding small businesses and startups.' He deleted the post a few hours later and the value of the currency collapsed, causing millions of dollars in losses to its brief investors, according to financial site Dexscreener. The coin, developed by KIP Protocol and Hayden Davis, could be obtained by accessing a link that directed users to a website called vivalalibertadproject.com, referring to the well-known phrase with which Milei closes speeches and messages on his social media. The President's Office said in a Saturday statement that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency’s development and decided to remove the post to avoid speculation and limit further exposure, following the public reaction to the project’s launch. Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs, told the AP that they saw an illicit association to commit 'an indeterminate number of frauds' in the episode. 'Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president’s actions were essential,' he said. Baldiviezo signed the petition with Marcos Zelaya, another lawyer; the engineer Maria Eva Koutsovitis; and the economist Claudio Lozano, who presided over the Argentine Central Bank during former president Alberto Fernandez’s administration. Criminal justice is expected to assign a judge to the case or refer it to a prosecutor for further investigation Monday. The plaintiffs saw in Milei’s action an operation known in the crypto world as 'rug pull.' This occurs when a developer launches an attractive token to lure investors but later abandons it after funds become overpriced, making the tokens worthless. Baldiviezo also added that Milei violated the Public Ethics Law. 'The President shared a post on his personal accounts announcing the launch of KIP Protocol’s project, as he does daily with many entrepreneurs who wish to launch projects in Argentina to create jobs and attract investments,' the President's Office said. After deleting the post, Milei said on X he was unaware of the currency's development and blamed his political opponents for trying to exploit the episode. 'I was not aware of the details of the project, and after getting informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet),' he said. The President's Office said the country's Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the Executive Branch, would act immediately. The administration also acknowledged that Milei and members of his administration recently met with representatives of KIP Protocol at the presidential office. 'All the information gathered in the investigation will be handed over to the judiciary to determine if any of the companies or individuals linked to the KIP Protocol project committed a crime,' the Milei administration said in the Saturday statement. Hayden Mark Davis, one of KIP Protocol's representatives who met with Milei, blamed the president for the crypto currency's collapse in a video posted on his social media Saturday. 'Despite prior commitments, Milei and his team unexpectedly changed their position, withdrawing their support and deleting all previous posts on social media,' Davis said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentine-lawyers-charge-president-milei-with-fraud-over-cryptocurrency-promotion/7977382.html	2025-02-16T16:20:18-08:00	
Scientists race to discover depth of ocean damage from Los Angeles wildfires	Los Angeles — On a recent Sunday, Tracy Quinn drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to assess damage wrought upon the coastline by the Palisades Fire. The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water's edge. Waves during high tide lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into the ocean as they receded. 'It was just heartbreaking,' said Quinn, president and CEO of the environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of Los Angeles. As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes, businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and more. Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under the sea. 'We haven't seen a concentration of homes and buildings burned so close to the water,' Quinn said. Fire debris and potentially toxic ash could make the water unsafe for surfers and swimmers, especially after rainfall that can transport chemicals, trash and other hazards into the sea. Longer term, scientists worry if and how charred urban contaminants will affect the food supply. The atmospheric river and mudslides that pummeled the Los Angeles region last week exacerbated some of those fears. When the fires broke out in January, one of Mara Dias' first concerns was ocean water contamination. Strong winds were carrying smoke and ash far beyond the blazes before settling at sea, said the water quality manager for the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental nonprofit. Scientists on board a research vessel during the fires detected ash and waste on the water as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) offshore, said marine ecologist Julie Dinasquet with the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Things like twigs and shard. They described the smell as electronics burning, she recalled, 'not like a nice campfire.' Runoff from rain also is a huge and immediate concern. Rainfall picks up contaminants and trash while flushing toward the sea through a network of drains and rivers. That runoff could contain 'a lot of nutrients, nitrogen and phosphate that end up in the ash of the burn material that can get into the water,' said Dias, as well as 'heavy metals, something called PAHs, which are given off when you burn different types of fuel.' Mudslides and debris flows in the Palisades Fire burn zone also can dump more hazardous waste into the ocean. After fires, the soil in burn scars is less able to absorb rainfall and can develop a layer that repels water from the remains of seared organic material. When there is less organic material to hold the soil in place, the risks of mudslides and debris flows increase. Los Angeles County officials, with help from other agencies, have set thousands of feet of concrete barriers, sandbags, silt socks and more to prevent debris from reaching beaches. The LA County Board of Supervisors also recently passed a motion seeking state and federal help to expand beach clean ups, prepare for storm runoff and test ocean water for potential toxins and chemicals, among other things. Beyond the usual samples, state water officials and others are testing for total and dissolved metals such as arsenic, lead and aluminum and volatile organic compounds. They also are sampling for microplastics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that are harmful to human and aquatic life, and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a group of man-made chemicals shown to cause cancer in animals and other serious health effects. Now banned from being manufactured, they were used in products like pigments, paints and electrical equipment. County public health officials said chemical tests of water samples last month did not raise health concerns, so they downgraded one beach closure to an ocean water advisory. Beachgoers were still advised to stay out of the water. Dinasquet and colleagues are working to understand how far potentially toxic ash and debris dispersed across the ocean, how deep and how fast they sunk and, over time, where it ends up. Forest fires can deposit important nutrients like iron and nitrogen into the ocean ecosystem, boosting the growth of phytoplankton, which can create a positive, cascading effect across the ecosystem. But the potentially toxic ash from urban coastal fires could have dire consequences, Dinasquet said. 'Reports are already showing that there was a lot of lead and asbestos in the ash,' she added. 'This is really bad for people so it's probably also very bad for the marine organisms.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/scientists-race-to-discover-depth-of-ocean-damage-from-los-angeles-wildfires/7977145.html	2025-02-16T14:55:56-08:00	
Turkish delegation meets with Kurdish leader in Iraq amid peace efforts	Baghdad — A Turkish opposition party delegation arrived in Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region Sunday against the backdrop of peace efforts between Ankara and a banned Kurdish separatist movement in Turkey. The delegation led by Sirri Sureyya Onder and Pervin Buldan, two senior officials with the pro-Kurdish People’s Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, in Turkey, met with Masoud Barzani, the head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party — the dominant Kurdish party in Iraq — in Irbil Sunday. Barzani’s office said in a statement that they discussed 'the peace process in Turkey' and that the Turkish delegation conveyed a message from Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of Turkey’s banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. Barzani 'stressed the need for all parties to intensify their efforts and endeavors to enable the peace process to achieve the desired results' and reiterated 'his full readiness to provide assistance and support to the peace process in Turkey and make it a success,' the statement said. The DEM party has long pressed for greater democracy in Turkey and rights for the country’s Kurdish population, and to improve conditions for the imprisoned Ocalan. Ocalan, 75, founded the PKK, in 1978, which began an armed insurrection for an autonomous Kurdish state in Turkey’s southeast in 1984, costing tens of thousands of lives. The group is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. The central Iraqi government in Baghdad announced a ban on the group, which maintains bases in northern Iraq, last year. Captured in 1999 and convicted of treason, Ocalan has been serving a life sentence on Imrali Island in the Marmara Sea. The government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has traditionally had an antagonistic relationship with the left-wing DEM party, frequently ousting its elected officials on charges of ties to the PKK and replacing them with state appointed officials. However, this icy relationship began thawing last October, when Erdogan’s coalition partner, far-right nationalist politician Devlet Bahceli suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole, if his group renounces violence and disbands. The peace effort comes at a time when Erdogan may need support from the DEM party in parliament to enact a new constitution that could allow him to stay in power for unlimited terms. The Turkish Constitution doesn't allow Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003 as prime minister and later as president, to run for office again unless an early election is called — something that would also require the support of the pro-Kurdish party. Even as the latest peace efforts are underway, Erdogan’s government has widened a crackdown on the opposition, arresting journalists and politicians. Several elected Kurdish mayors have been ousted from office and replaced with state appointed officials, the latest this Saturday, when the mayor of Van municipality in eastern Turkey was removed from his post and replaced with the state-appointed governor. Meanwhile, conflict is ongoing between Turkish-backed armed groups and Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria. Turkey views the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed military Kurdish alliance in Syria, as an extension of the PKK. The SDF is in negotiations with the new government in Damascus following the ouster of then Syrian President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive. While most former insurgent groups have agreed to dissolve and integrate into the new Syrian army, the SDF has refused so far. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Saturday that the government would reconsider its military presence in northeastern Syria if that country’s new leaders eliminate the presence of the PKK in the area. Also Saturday, Kurds in northeastern Syria staged a mass protest to demand Ocalan's release.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-delegation-meets-with-kurdish-leader-in-iraq-amid-peace-efforts/7977143.html	2025-02-16T14:46:58-08:00	
US Presidents Day: How did it evolve from reverence to retail	Norfolk, Virginia — Like the other Founding Fathers, George Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life. He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king. And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first president Monday, 293 years after he was born. The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the holiday has lost all discernible meaning. Historian Alexis Coe, author of 'You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington,' has said she thinks about Presidents Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his name. 'It’s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to anything that looks or sounds like him?' she remarked in an interview with The Associated Press in 2024. 'Jefferson and Lincoln are presented as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their memorials. And he’s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down to have absolutely no identifiable features.' Here is a look at how things have evolved: Washington's birthdays were celebrated, sometimes Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the Potomac River in Virginia. Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was adopted in 1752, adding 11 days. Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday, according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work. 'If he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,' Coe said. 'Maybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha’s recipe for an indulgent cake. But that’s about it.' Washington’s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when he was president, mostly. Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was rampant, and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including Thomas Jefferson. 'One way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to keep working through his birthday,' Coe said. The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the Comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington’s 50th birthday in 1782. After his death, a market for memorabilia is born Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its distinction from the British crown. He didn’t want to be honored like a king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, told the AP last year. Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure going off into heaven. 'Even in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism with patriotic memory,' said Bruggeman, whose books include 'Here, George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public History of a National Monument.' Making it official with parades and festivals It wasn’t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress established a committee to arrange national 'parades, orations and festivals,' according to the Congressional Research Service. Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for federal employees in the District of Columbia. The official designation for the holiday is Washington’s Birthday, although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date falls nearby, on Feb. 12. A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln’s birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day. But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington’s Birthday. A shift to consumerism By the late 1960s, Washington’s Birthday was one of nine federal holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week, according to a 2004 article in the National Archives’ Prologue magazine. Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day weekends. The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue. Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers 'would have been deeply worried' by how the holiday became taken over by commercial and private interests. 'They were very nervous about corporations,' Bruggeman said. 'It wasn’t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.' Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America, said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions. 'There’s no moment of reflection,' Coe said. Given today’s widespread cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection 'would probably be a good idea.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-presidents-day-how-did-it-evolve-from-reverence-to-retail/7977137.html	2025-02-16T14:32:22-08:00	
Uganda government offers to drop military trial of hunger-striking opponent	Kampala, Uganda — Uganda's government said Sunday it would drop a military trial against opposition figurehead Kizza Besigye, urging him to give up his hunger strike in jail, a minister said. The pledge was promptly rejected as 'suspicious' by Besigye's wife, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima. Besigye, a former ally turned rival of longtime President Yoweri Museveni, went on a hunger strike on February 10 in protest at his detention. Charging him with treason for allegedly threatening national security, the government has vowed to try him in a military court, despite a Supreme Court ruling that such a move against a civilian is unconstitutional. Now, however, 'the government is fast-tracking the transfer of Besigye's case from the court martial to the civil court,' Cabinet spokesperson and information minister Chris Baryomunsi told AFP. 'As a government, we are complying with the ruling of the Supreme Court.' The minister said in an earlier message on X that he had visited Besigye in prison Sunday 'in the presence of his personal doctors' and 'asked him to resume taking food' pending the transfer. The army, which has not yet commented on the announcement, had previously dismissed the Supreme Court ruling and insisted the military trial would go ahead. Besigye appeared in court for a hearing in a separate case Friday looking frail, prompting outrage from his supporters. Baryomunsi declined to say whether Sunday's pledge was prompted by the outcry. Byanyima told AFP on Sunday that she was 'very worried' about her husband's condition.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-government-offers-to-drop-military-trial-of-hunger-striking-opponent/7977116.html	2025-02-16T13:19:53-08:00	
Colombian superstar Shakira cancels concert in Lima after being hospitalized	Lima, Peru — Colombian superstar Shakira canceled her Sunday concert in Lima after being hospitalized with an abdominal condition, the singer said. Shakira shared a statement on her Instagram and X accounts Sunday afternoon, saying she is currently hospitalized and that doctors informed her she was not in condition to perform. 'I am very sad that I will not be able to take the stage today. I have been deeply emotional and excited about reuniting with my beloved Peruvian audience,' she said. The singer arrived in Peru Friday evening, where she was scheduled to perform Sunday and Monday. The country is the second stop on her Latin America tour, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, following two nights in Brazil last week. Latin fans have given Shakira a warm welcome, with crowds gathering at airports to greet her. 'Thank you for such an emotional welcome, Lima!' she posted Saturday on Instagram. In her statement, Shakira said she hopes to recover soon. 'My plan is to perform this show as soon as possible. My team and the promoter are already working on a new date,' she said. The singer is touring in support of her latest album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, in which she channels her highly publicized divorce into music. The record includes the global hit 'Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53' and won Best Latin Pop Album at the 2024 Grammy Awards earlier this month. Shakira’s tour continues across Latin America before heading to Canada and the U.S. in May for a series of concerts through June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombian-superstar-shakira-cancels-concert-in-lima-after-being-hospitalized/7977108.html	2025-02-16T13:09:50-08:00	
Mauritius ex-PM freed on bail in money-laundering probe	Port Louis, Mauritius — A court in Mauritius on Monday released on bail the island's former Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth in a money-laundering probe after seizing suitcases of cash in raids on his alleged accomplices' homes. Police detained the 63-year-old along with his wife Kobita Jugnauth on Saturday and questioned them for several hours, police sources told AFP. Kobita Jugnauth was later released and Pravind Jugnauth was placed under formal arrest in the early hours of Sunday. In court in the capital Port Louis, the ex-premier denied the accusations. The judge released him pending a bail payment of 150,000 rupees ($16,000), in a written ruling seen by AFP. Police and court documents detailed searches at the homes of two other suspects who run a local leisure company. They said officers seized documents bearing the names of the Jugnauths, as well as luxury watches and suitcases of cash. Chagos Islands talks Prime minister from 2017 to 2024, Pravind Jugnauth is a member of one of the dynasties that have dominated the leadership of Mauritius, a stable and relatively prosperous Indian Ocean island nation, since it became independent from Britain in 1968. He oversaw a historic deal with Britain for Mauritius to regain sovereignty over the Chagos Islands following a long-running dispute. He and his Militant Socialist Movement suffered a crushing defeat in tense elections in November. He ceded office to center-left rival Navin Ramgoolam, who became prime minister for the third time. Ramgoolam's government reopened the Chagos negotiations, reportedly seeking greater financial compensation and to renegotiate the length of the proposed lease for a joint U.K.-U.S. military base. Under the Chagos deal, Britain will retain a lease for the base on the island of Diego Garcia. Both Mauritius and Britain have said that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration will have a say on the final terms of the agreement. The base is currently leased by Britain to the United States and has become one of its key military facilities in the Asia-Pacific. During the election campaign, both camps promised to improve the lives of ordinary Mauritians who face cost-of-living difficulties despite strong economic growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mauritius-ex-pm-freed-on-bail-in-money-laundering-probe/7977107.html	2025-02-16T13:03:36-08:00	
US, Ukrainian officials head to Saudi Arabia as talks loom on ending Russia's war	Kyiv, Ukraine — A Ukrainian delegation has arrived in Saudi Arabia for meetings in preparation for a possible visit by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a Ukrainian minister said Sunday, at a time of intense speculation over planned U.S.-Russia talks in the kingdom to end Moscow's war on its neighbor. It also comes as a top U.S. envoy revealed that he and a fellow negotiator appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump were heading to Saudi Arabia. Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who also serves as first deputy prime minister, didn't clarify whether there is a link between Zelenskyy's possible trip and the previously announced U.S.-Russia talks. In a Facebook post, she said that the Ukrainian delegation's focus is on strengthening economic ties, as Kyiv 'prepares to sign important economic agreements with countries in the region.' Svyrydenko didn't say anything about when Zelenskyy might go to Saudi Arabia and who he might meet with. No further details were immediately available. Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, said earlier Sunday that there was no possibility of Ukrainian and Russian representatives meeting directly in the immediate future. In a Telegram post, Yermak said the Ukrainians weren't planning to do so 'until we develop a plan' to end the war and bring about a 'just peace.' Mykhailo Podolyak, another Zelenskyy adviser, on Saturday denied that Ukraine will participate in any planned U.S.-Russia meetings in Saudi Arabia. 'There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing,' Podolyak said on Ukrainian television. But Svyrydenko's remarks came within hours of an announcement by Steve Witkoff, Trump's close ally and special envoy to the Middle East, that high-level meetings were imminent in Saudi Arabia to discuss a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine. Speaking to Fox News Channel's 'Sunday Morning Futures' program, Witkoff said that he and national security adviser Mike Waltz will be 'having meetings at the direction of the president,' and hope to make 'some really good progress with regard to Russia-Ukraine.' Witkoff didn't specify who they would be meeting and what they would discuss, but he said that he was leaving for Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening. Following a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, Trump noted that they 'agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately' on ending the fighting. The president appointed Witkoff and Waltz to lead those talks, alongside U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Earlier this week, Russian officials and state media took a triumphant tone after Trump jettisoned three years of U.S. policy and announced that he would likely meet soon with Putin to negotiate a peace deal in the almost three-year war in Ukraine. Trump's announcement created a major diplomatic upheaval that could herald a watershed moment for Ukraine and Europe. Zelenskyy said that he wouldn't accept any negotiations about Ukraine that don't include his country. European governments have also demanded a seat at the table. Putin has been ostracized by the West since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. In 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian leader. Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy, didn't directly respond to the question about whether Ukraine would have to give up a 'significant portion' of its territory as part of any negotiated settlement. 'Those are details, and I'm not dismissive of the details, they're important. But I think the beginning here is trust-building. It's getting everybody to understand that this war does not belong continuing, that it should end. That's what the president has directed us to do,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-ukrainian-officials-head-to-saudi-arabia-as-talks-loom-on-ending-russia-s-war/7977072.html	2025-02-16T11:50:07-08:00

Conclave' leads the pack, 'Emilia Perez' faces test at Britain's BAFTA film awards	London — Stars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothee Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs. The prizes are closely watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 3, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season. They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem 'I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).' The best film contenders are 'Conclave,' 'Emilia Perez,' Brady Corbet’s 215-minute architecture epic ' The Brutalist,' the James Mangold-directed Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown' and Sean Baker’s Brighton Beach tragicomedy 'Anora.' 'Anora,' about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, is emerging as a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards. 'The Brutalist' has nine BAFTA nominations, while 'Anora,' the sci-fi epic 'Dune: Part Two' and musical 'Wicked' have seven each. 'A Complete Unknown' and Irish-language hip-hop drama 'Kneecap' received six nominations apiece. Nominees in the category of outstanding British film include Andrea Arnold’s 'Bird,' Steve McQueen’s 'Blitz,' Ridley Scott’s 'Gladiator II' and animated adventure 'Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl,' which won the award for best family and children's film. The leading actor favorite is 'The Brutalist' star Adrien Brody, who faces stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in 'A Complete Unknown.' The other male actors nominated are Grant for his creepy role in the horror film ' Heretic,' Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama ' Sing Sing ' and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice.' Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was 'incredibly validating' to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong. 'We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,' Stan said, describing the movie as a 'fair' depiction of the president. Whoever takes the best actress award will be a first-time BAFTA winner. Nominees are Gascon, Demi Moore for body-horror film ' The Substance,' Mikey Madison for 'Anora,' Ronan for 'The Outrun,' Erivo for 'Wicked' and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama 'Hard Truths.' Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would be the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA. British stars on the red carpet had high praise for Jean-Baptiste's blistering performance as a woman beset by depression, and for Moore, already a Golden Globe winner for 'The Substance.' 'I’m very excited for Demi Moore tonight,' said 'Game of Thrones' and 'Severance' star Gwendoline Christie. She said Moore's 'visceral' performance 'transcends so many different boundaries.' What's new and where to watch Britain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white. Most winners are chosen by members of the 8,000-strong U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a short list of nominees. This year's contenders are performers Mikey Madison, Marisa Abela, Jharrel Jerome, David Jonsson and Nabhaan Rizwan. 'Willow' and 'Return of the Jedi' actor Warwick Davis will receive the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry. BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for 'The Last Showgirl,' was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work. Co-star Pamela Anderson will accept the prize for Curtis if she wins. The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate, is attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children. The show will include a performance by grown-up boyband Take That, whose 2008 hit 'Greatest Day' features on the 'Anora' soundtrack. 'Wicked' wizard Jeff Goldblum will play piano during the ceremony’s tribute to people who have died in the past year. The ceremony airs on BBC in the United Kingdom and BritBox in North America and started at 1900 GMT (2 p.m. EST).	https://www.voanews.com/a/conclave-leads-the-pack-emilia-perez-faces-test-at-britain-s-bafta-film-awards/7977060.html	2025-02-16T11:30:01-08:00	
‘Captain America: Brave New World’ soars toward $100 million holiday weekend	Captain America: Brave New World' infused some blockbuster cash into the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by the end of Monday's Presidents' Day holiday. It’s Marvel's first major release since 'Deadpool & Wolverine' broke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some worried was weakening after the poor showing for 'The Marvels.' Playing in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, 'Brave New World' is also a major transition for the 'Captain America' brand: Anointing Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford co-stars as the U.S. president who transforms into the Red Hulk. But 'Brave New World,' directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is currently sitting at 51% 'rotten' on Rotten Tomatoes. It's not the worst in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — 'Eternals' has a 47% rating and 'Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania' has a 46% — but the latest film is on the very low end of the spectrum. In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that it is, 'a highly processed, empty calorie, regret-later candy of a movie.' Audiences were more generous in their opinions. The 'verified audience score' from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend audience. The bar for biggest opening of the year wasn’t terribly high: 'Dog Man' held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch. And 'Brave New World's' showing is the middle range for an MCU film. Not accounting for inflation, it sits between 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and 'Thor: The Dark World.' It also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding the millions spent on marketing and promotion. After only one Marvel movie in 2024, 'Brave New World' is the first of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by 'Thunderbolts(asterisk)' in May and 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' in July. 'The superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,' said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. Second place at this week's box office went to 'Paddington in Peru,' the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13 million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the weekend with $104 million from its international run. Dougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film, which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton's voice, remained intact. Sony and Screen Gems' slasher 'Heart Eyes' landed in third place with $10 million, up 20% from its opening last weekend. Fourth place went to 'Dog Man' with $9.7 million. The Chinese blockbuster 'Ne Zha 2' rounded out the top five. It opened on 660 screens in North America and made $7.2 million. Overall, the box office is up 20% from last year. This weekend also saw the release of a new 'Bridget Jones' movie, subtitled 'Mad About the Boy,' which went straight to Universal’s streaming service Peacock, forgoing theaters in the U.S. In the U.K. and Ireland, it made an estimated $14.9 million, outgrossing 'Captain America: Brave New World.' Universal Pictures International reported $32.3 million in grosses from all 70 territories. The final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Captain America: Brave New World,' $88.5 million. 2. 'Paddington in Peru,' $13 million. 3. 'Heart Eyes,' $10 million. 4. 'Dog Man,' $9.7 million. 5. 'Ne Zha 2,' $7.2 million. 6. 'Love Hurts,' $4.4 million. 7. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $4.2 million. 8. 'One of Them Days,' $3 million. 9. 'Companion,' $1.9 million. 10.

Lebanon says woman killed as Israeli forces fire on returnees to southern Lebanon ahead of ceasefire deadline	BEIRUT — A woman was killed and several other people wounded Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on a group of residents attempting to return to the village of Houla in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese state-run news agency reported. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the incident, which comes two days before the deadline for implementation of a ceasefire agreement that ended the latest war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in late November. It includes a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. The original deadline was in late January but Israel and Lebanon agreed to extend it to Feb. 18. Hours before they agreed to the extension on Jan. 27, hundreds of protesters attempted to enter villages still occupied by the Israeli army to demand its withdrawal, and Israeli forces opened fire in several locations, killing more than 20 people. Israel blamed Hezbollah for sending 'rioters.' It remained unclear whether Israel will fully withdraw from Lebanese territory on Tuesday. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said in a televised speech Sunday that Israel 'must withdraw from all of the Lebanese territory that it has occupied' on Feb. 18. 'There can be no excuses, no five points or other details under any pretext or any title. This is the agreement,' he said. Kassem was referring to a proposal put forward by Israel that its forces would remain in five border points after the deadline. Lebanese officials have so far rejected this. Kassem said it was 'the primary and exclusive responsibility of the Lebanese state at this stage to apply all political pressure' to ensure that Israel withdraws fully. Internal tensions have risen in Lebanon in recent days ahead of the deadline and after Lebanese authorities revoked permission for an Iranian plane that had been set to travel from Tehran to Beirut, leaving dozens of Lebanese passengers stranded. The decision came after Israel had alleged that Iran was sending cash to Hezbollah via civilian flights and said it would 'use all available means' to stop it. The outgoing deputy commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, was injured Friday when protesters attacked a convoy taking peacekeepers to the Beirut airport. Kassem said Hezbollah was 'against the attack on UNIFIL' but also criticized the Lebanese army for tear gassing protesters who gathered 'peacefully' on Saturday. Kassem criticized the Lebanese government for banning Iranian flights, a decision that he said came after Israel threatened to strike the runway if the Iranian plane landed at Beirut airport. 'The problem is not that [Lebanese authorities] are ensuring the safety of civilians at a difficult time,' Kassem said. 'The problem is that this is the implementation of Israel's command. We are facing a real problem. Where is the national sovereignty? Are we employees of Israel, implementing the demands of the occupation?' Also on Sunday, Lebanon's National News Agency reported that an Israeli airstrike hit a bulldozer that was attempting to open roads that had been blocked by the Israeli military near the village of Marwahin. No casualties were reported. The Israeli army said in a statement that it had conducted 'precision, intelligence-based strikes on a number of military sites in Lebanese territory containing rocket launchers and weapons, where Hezbollah activity had been identified.' The Lebanese army, which has taken control of areas that the Israeli forces have withdrawn from, in a statement warned citizens not to try to enter areas where Lebanese troops have not yet deployed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-says-woman-killed-as-israeli-forces-fire-on-returnees-to-southern-lebanon-ahead-of-ceasefire-deadline/7977040.html	2025-02-16T10:48:31-08:00	
US ‘border czar’ unhappy with pace of migrant arrests	U.S. President Donald Trump’s 'border czar' said Sunday he is 'not happy' with the number of undocumented migrants being arrested by immigration agents and deported to their home countries. Tom Homan told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show that 14,000 migrants had been arrested since Trump was inaugurated January 20, but said, 'We’ve got to do a lot more.' Many of those arrested have been flown back to their native lands or sent to the prison on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, while some have been released to live in the United States pending court proceedings. The U.S. estimates that 11 million undocumented migrants are living in the U.S., with Trump pledging during his 2024 run for the presidency to find and deport 'millions' of them. Officials say that the first arrests have targeted migrants convicted of crimes in the U.S. but that anyone living in the country without proper immigration documentation could be targeted. Homan said the number being deported is 'a lot higher' than under the former administration of President Joe Biden, but added, 'We’ve got to get the targeting and production up. It’s hard work.' The Trump administration has tapped law enforcement personnel from several U.S. agencies to augment those at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which normally controls migration issues. In the first days of the Trump administration, there were hundreds of migrant arrests daily and there still are, but just not as many. The Department of Homeland Security reported about 800 arrests a day in late January, topping out at 1,179 on Jan. 26. The figure was fewer than 600 a day in the first two weeks of February. The Trump administration had set a goal of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests a day.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-border-czar-unhappy-with-pace-of-migrant-arrests/7977021.html	2025-02-16T10:16:46-08:00	
UK's Starmer to press Egypt for release of hunger-striking mum’s son	London — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told a mother who has been on hunger strike for 140 days that he will press the Egyptian government to release her son. In a statement Sunday, Starmer confirmed that he met Laila Soueif and said he will do 'all that I can' to secure the release of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a British-Egyptian dual national who has spent more than five years in an Egyptian prison, accused of 'spreading false news' on social media. 'We will continue to raise his case at the highest levels of the Egyptian government and press for his release,' Starmer said. A representative of the family said the meeting took place Friday morning inside the prime minister's offices at 10 Downing Street and that it was the first time the pair had met. Soueif, 68, has been on a hunger strike since Sep. 29, the day her son was supposed to be released, consuming nothing but herbal tea, black coffee and rehydration salts. After more than four months, Soueif has lost around 25 kilograms (55 pounds). She took her campaign directly to the Foreign Office in December, camping out in front of it every weekday to make sure officials notice her. When that yielded no results, she switched in mid-January to the gates of Starmer’s office — the famous black door of 10 Downing Street. 'The great majority of mothers are prepared to die for their children; it just takes different forms,' she said earlier this month. 'Most mothers, if their children are in actual danger, you’re prepared to die.’’ One of Egypt’s most prominent pro-democracy activists, the 43-year-old Abd el-Fattah has spent most of the past 14 years behind bars since taking part in the 2011 uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak. His most recent crime was 'liking' a Facebook post describing torture in Egyptian prisons. Abd el-Fattah has been in custody since September 2019 and was sentenced to five years in prison after a trial before an emergency security court. But when his release date came up last September, Egyptian authorities refused to count the more than two years he had spent in pre-trial detention and ordered him held until Jan. 3, 2027. Thousands of critics of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi have been locked up under dire conditions after unjust trials, human rights groups say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-starmer-to-press-egypt-for-release-of-hunger-striking-mum-s-son/7977019.html	2025-02-16T10:13:19-08:00	
Pope is stable as he recovers from respiratory infection, Vatican says	Rome — Pope Francis had breakfast, read the newspapers and followed Mass on television Sunday after a second night sleeping well at the hospital where the 88-year-old pontiff is being treated for a respiratory tract infection, the Vatican said. Francis' condition was stable, as he continues his unspecified drug therapy, alternating in the afternoon between reading and resting, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. The Argentine pope, a known workaholic who keeps up a grueling pace despite his many ailments, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. It was his fourth hospitalization since his 2013 election and raised questions about his increasingly precarious health. Doctors confirmed that the pope had a respiratory tract infection and prescribed 'absolute rest' alongside unspecified drug therapies. Francis skipped his traditional Sunday noon blessing, declining to even come to his hospital window to wave to a small crowd below that had gathered in hopes of cheering him on. The @Pontifex social media account, which isn't written by the pope himself, thanked people for their prayers on Sunday. 'Thank you for the affection, prayer and closeness with which you are accompanying me in these days,' the post read. Francis had part of one lung removed after a lung infection when he was a young man and is prone to respiratory infections. In 2023, he spent three days at Gemelli to be treated for what he later revealed was an acute case of pneumonia. Despite his Feb. 6 bronchitis diagnosis, Francis had kept up a frenetic pace of late, packing his days with private and public audiences, while taking on the added obligations of steering the Catholic Church through its Holy Year. The Vatican has canceled his events through Monday at least. On Sunday, a Holy Year Mass he was supposed to preside over for visiting artists was instead celebrated by the Vatican culture minister. The Vatican hasn't specified what type of respiratory tract infection the pope has. Sometimes bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs' air sacs. Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids — and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-is-stable-as-he-recovers-from-respiratory-infection-vatican-says-/7977015.html	2025-02-16T10:03:37-08:00	
VOA immigration weekly recap, Feb. 9-15	Editor's note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com. Trump administration moves quickly with mass deportation plans Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared illegal immigration a national emergency. The Trump administration ramped up its mass deportation efforts, expanding the use of expedited removal and using Guantanamo Bay as a detention site for certain migrants. The moves have raised concerns among immigration advocates, who argue that the policies lack transparency and could violate due process rights. VOA’s immigration reporter, Aline Barros, reports. US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts The administration of President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the federal government. On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances last week. The Associated Press reports. With doors closed to US, asylum-seekers turn to a new life in Mexico When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico as she fled Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the United States. But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month, the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans. She decided she would seek protection in Mexico. The Associated Press reports. US deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from other nations as the administration of President Donald Trump takes Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the Central American nation's president said Thursday. 'Yesterday, a flight from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse nationalities of the world,' President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday in his weekly news briefing. He said migrants from China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries were on board. The Associated Press reports. Chicago nonprofit helps undocumented migrants afraid to leave home Amid nationwide immigration raids, a community organization in Chicago is helping undocumented migrants who say they are afraid to leave their homes for fear of being detained. Veronica Villafane narrates this report by Enrique Garcia Fuentes. Arrests for illegal border crossings fall in Texas An idled Border Patrol bus sat empty this past week, on standby for any migrants surrendering near the southern tip of Texas. Agents in two speedboats zipped by pockets of sandy shores, known landing spots for people entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico on inner tubes, but saw nothing suspicious. Once-busy river landings near the Texas border city of Mission were barren of the migrants who previously crossed there, although the riverbank was littered with clothes, plastic bracelets issued by smugglers and a teddy bear on an unusually cold Thursday morning. The Associated Press reports. New York City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal immigration officials to operate at the city's Rikers Island jail following a meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump's border czar. Adams said he will issue an executive order reestablishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the nation's largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under prior administrations. The Associated Press reports. VOA60 Africa - Nigeria: Thousands of refugees return from Chad Thousands of Nigerians who fled to Chad to escape jihadi violence in Nigeria’s northeast have returned after more than a decade.

US: Hamas ‘must be eradicated’	The U.S. fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Hamas 'must be eradicated' and 'cannot continue as a military or government force.' Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem at the start of a regional tour as the first phase of a tenuous Israel-Hamas ceasefire expires in two weeks, with the second segment yet to be negotiated. Rubio, on his first trip to the Middle East as the new top U.S. diplomat, told Netanyahu that 'as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.' Rubio is likely to face continued opposition from Arab nations about U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries and then for Israel to hand over the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the U.S. to own and redevelop. While U.S. allies and adversaries alike have assailed Trump’s Gaza plan, Netanyahu has welcomed it, saying that he and Trump have a 'common strategy' for Gaza's future. Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said 'the gates of hell would be open' if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel, without proving evidence, says it has killed over 17,000 militants. Rubio and Netanyahu met as the first phase of the ceasefire nears its end. In the second phase, the tentative plan calls for Hamas to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated. The tough U.S. stance aligning with Netanyahu’s position could complicate efforts to continue talks with Hamas, which, despite suffering heavy losses in the war, remains intact and in control of Gaza. Some of Netanyahu’s supporters in the Israeli government want to continue the war when the first phase of the ceasefire ends but resuming it could endanger the lives of the remaining hostages. Netanyahu has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile, but Hamas has rejected such a scenario. Meanwhile, despite the ceasefire largely holding, the Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Hamas described the attack as a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal. During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian officials. Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27, and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law. Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region. Rubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates was the leading force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with Israel during Trump's first White House term. Trump hopes to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S. defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7976953.html	2025-02-16T08:44:10-08:00	
Flooding in US Southeast leaves 2 dead while snow, ice and wind cause winter misery elsewhere	LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Much of the United States faced another round of biting winter weather on Sunday, with torrential rains causing intense flooding in Kentucky and resulting in at least two deaths. The northern Plains faced life-threatening cold, and tornado watches were issued for parts of Georgia and Florida. In Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, WKYT-TV reported. Clay County Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry confirmed the fatality but did not provide additional details. Severe storms also swept through parts of Florida and Georgia, where tornado watches were in effect early Sunday, the National Weather Service said. Elsewhere, bone-chilling cold is expected for the Northern Plains with low temperatures into the minus 30s F near the Canadian border. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures in the Dakotas and Minnesota of minus 40 Celsius (minus 40 Fahrenheit) to minus 45.6 C (minus 50 F) are expected. Heavy snowfall amounts were expected in parts of New England and northern New York. In some areas, wind gusts could reach about 97 kph (60 mph) and create 'hazardous whiteout conditions,' the NWS said. Kentucky faces severe flooding The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife said there was an investigation into a death and a rescue operation was under way in Hart County, WNKY-TV reported. The station reported a youth died and a second victim was missing in flooding Saturday evening. The Fish and Wildlife department and the Hart County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for more information from The Associated Press. Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia. Both of the states were under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National Weather Service warned residents to stay off the roads. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday. Flash flooding hit some roads in Bowling Green and parts of western Kentucky could face up to 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) of rain. 'We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have flooded in the past,' Beshear said on social media. Beshear later used social media to update residents on areas in danger of flooding, including Jackson County, and said Kentucky State Police officers were performing wellness checks while shelters were opening in Pike County and Jenny Wiley State Resort Park in Prestonsburg. Beshear said in a post late Saturday that he had written to the White House requesting an emergency disaster declaration and federal funds for impacted areas. The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said it closed its emergency department and was transferring all patients to two other hospitals in the region. The hospital said it would re-evaluate conditions Sunday morning to determine when it can safely reopen. The north fork of the Kentucky River was forecast to crest nearly 4.3 meters (14 feet) above flood stage that afternoon, the weather service said. Photos posted by authorities and residents on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in south-central and eastern Kentucky. In Buchanan County, Virginia, the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides. The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters. 'Stay home if you can,' the office said on Facebook. New England faces snow, then sleet Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest accumulations, possibly 30.5 centimeters (a foot) or more, were expected in upstate New York and portions of northern New England. 'Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch are forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages,' the weather service warned. Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters (4 inches) of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening. Frigid polar vortex Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees C (14 degrees F) over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets. California struggles with mudslides Dry weather returned to southern California after the strongest storm of the year. But the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters (6 feet) of snow over 36 hours. Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flooding-in-us-southeast-leaves-2-dead-while-snow-ice-and-wind-cause-winter-misery-elsewhere/7976927.html	2025-02-16T07:55:08-08:00	
Russian troops intensify attacks on Ukrainian forces in east, military says	KYIV — Russian troops have sharply stepped up their attacks in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv's military said on Sunday, as a NATO official predicted Moscow would increase the pace and intensity of its assaults with talks to end the war approaching. The main attacks were concentrated near the imperiled logistics hub of Pokrovsk, Kyiv said, with U.S. and Russian officials expected to hold talks in the coming days in Saudi Arabia and U.S President Donald Trump pushing for peace. Kyiv's military reported 261 combat engagements with Russia over a 24-hour period on Saturday, easily the largest number recorded this year and more than double the roughly 100 per day it reported in previous days. 'Today was the hardest day of 2025 at the front,' the Ukrainian DeepState military blog wrote late on Saturday. Moscow's troops advanced steadily in the east for much of the second half 2024, announcing the capture of village after village, though the intensity of the fighting dropped in January this year, according to Ukrainian military data. Russian forces have seized a swathe of territory to the south of Pokrovsk and are now pushing upwards to its southwest, threatening a main supply route into the outpost, the capture of which could open up more lines of attack for Russia. Despite being on the backfoot, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reported a 'good result' in the east on Thursday and a military spokesman said Kyiv's forces had recaptured the village of Pishchane, about 5 km to Pokrovsk's south. 'It isn't so much the result of something collapsing for the Russians or some kind of magical weapon being delivered to Ukraine, no. Certain organizational actions were taken to help Ukrainians act more effectively,' Viktor Trehubov, a military spokesman, told Reuters. Ukraine has been using drones for deep strikes on Russia in an effort to inflict pain and strengthen its overall position. Russia has continued to conduct regular drone and missile strikes, while making advances on the ground in the east. 'I would expect a much stronger push. I would expect that we would see ... a lot of Russian efforts to advance,' a NATO official who requested anonymity told Reuters. Though Ukrainian officials are careful to praise Trump, his push to engage directly with the Russians without first consulting with Kyiv and to leave out the Europeans entirely is a cause for alarm in Ukraine and Europe. Kyiv has said it was not invited to take part in the talks in Saudi Arabia and that in any case it wants to devise a joint strategy with its U.S. and European allies before meeting Russian officials. France said on Sunday it would host a summit of European leaders on Monday to discuss the Ukraine war and European security as the continent scrambles to respond concretely to Trump's unilateral approach to the conflict. Zelenskiy gave figures for Russian strikes with aerial bombs and missiles that appeared to suggest they had increased in size in the last week. He said Russia had fired about 1,220 aerial bombs, more than 850 drones and 40 missiles at Ukraine, compared with 1,206, bombs, 750 drones and 10 missiles the week before.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-troops-intensify-attacks-on-ukrainian-forces-in-east-military-says-/7976838.html	2025-02-16T06:05:33-08:00	
Rwanda-backed rebels reach center of east Congo's 2nd major city	BUKAVU, CONGO — Rwanda-backed rebels reached the center of east Congo's second largest city, Bukavu, on Sunday morning and took control of the South Kivu province administrative office after little resistance from government forces, many of whom fled the rebels' advance. Associated Press journalists witnessed scores of residents cheering on the M23 rebels in central Bukavu on Sunday morning as they walked and drove around the city center after a dayslong march from the region's major city of Goma 101 kilometers away, which they captured late last month. Several parts of the city, however, remained deserted with residents indoors. The M23 rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo's mineral-rich east, and are supported by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the U.N. It was not clear if the rebels had taken decisive control of the city of about 1.3 million people. Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels' reach in their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power. Many Congolese soldiers were seen on Saturday fleeing the rebels' advance into Bukavu alongside thousands of civilians amid widespread looting and panic. Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi held a security meeting in the faraway capital of Kinshasa, where officials noted that Bukavu was 'briefly' invaded by M23 but remains under the control of the Congolese army and allies from local militia, the presidency said on X. There were no signs of fighting or of Congolese forces in most parts of Bukavu on Sunday. Tshisekedi has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo's forces are being supported in Bukavu by troops from Burundi and in Goma by troops from South Africa. Burundi's president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest his country will not retaliate in the fighting. In a post on X he said that 'those people who were ready to get profit of the armed attack of Rwanda to Burundi will not see this.' The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said it was committed to 'defending the people of Bukavu' in a Saturday statement that did not acknowledge their presence in the city. 'We call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,' Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance's spokesperson, said in a statement. The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the group is 'fully integrated' into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-backed-rebels-reach-center-of-east-congo-s-2nd-major-city/7976749.html	2025-02-16T02:50:22-08:00	
Austrian city in shock after a deadly knife attack as migration comes in spotlight	VIENNA — The city of Villach in southern Austria is in shock after a man stabbed six passersby in broad daylight, killing a 14-year-old boy and wounding five others, as police tried to establish a motive that put migration in the spotlight. Residents began placing candles at the site of the attack in the city of about 60,000 inhabitants. A group of young people, who knew the boy who died in Saturday's attack, gathered at the crime scene on Sunday morning to mourn and tearfully light candles, local media reported. The 23-year-old suspect, who was detained shortly after the stabbing, is a Syrian with a residence permit in Austria. A 42-year-old man, also a Syrian working for a food delivery company, witnessed the attack from his car. He drove toward the suspect and helped to prevent the situation from escalating, police spokesperson Rainer Dionisio told Austria's public broadcaster ORF. Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen called the attack 'horrific.' 'No words can undo the suffering, the horror, the fear. My thoughts are with the family of the deceased victim and the injured,' he posted on X. The Free Syrian Community of Austria issued a statement on Facebook distancing itself from the attack and expressing its deepest condolences to the victims' families. 'We all had to flee Syria, our home country, because we were no longer safe there — no one left their country voluntarily. We are grateful to have found asylum and protection in Austria,' the association said. 'Finally, we would like to emphasize: Anyone who causes strife and disturbs the peace of society does not represent the Syrians who have sought and received protection here,' the statement concluded. Dionisio said that a motive for the attack was not immediately known and police were investigating the suspect's background. Carnival procession canceled as police gather evidence Villach, a popular tourist destination near the borders of Italy and Slovenia, is known for its laid-back atmosphere, which blends Mediterranean and Alpine traditions. The city hosts annual carnival processions in March and an event on Saturday was canceled in the wake of the attack. The Austrian Ministry of Interior activated a platform for witnesses to upload videos or photos related to the attack. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner is expected in Villach on Sunday for a press conference. Local authorities said a crisis response team will be available to support pupils when schools open on Monday. The victims were all men, with two seriously wounded and two sustaining minor injuries, police said. Later Saturday, police said a fifth person was also injured. Peter Kaiser, the governor of the province of Carinthia, expressed his condolences to the family of the 14-year-old. 'This outrageous atrocity must be met with harsh consequences. I have always said with clarity and unambiguously: Those who live in Carinthia, in Austria, have to respect the law and adjust to our rules and values,' he said. Calls to strengthen migration rules Far-right leader Herbert Kickl wrote on X that he is 'appalled by the horrific act in Villach' and called for a rigorous crackdown on asylum. 'At the same time, I am angry — angry at those politicians who have allowed stabbings, rapes, gang wars and other capital crimes to become the order of the day in Austria. This is a first-class failure of the system, for which a young man in Villach has now had to pay with his life,' Kickl said. 'From Austria to the EU — the wrong rules are in force everywhere. Nobody is allowed to challenge them, everything is declared sacrosanct,' he said, adding that his party had outlined what he viewed as necessary changes to immigration laws in its election platform. Conservative party leader Christian Stocker said on X that the attacker 'must be brought to justice and be punished with the full force of the law.' 'We all want to live in a safe Austria, adding that this means political measures need to be taken to avoid such acts of horror in the future,' he said. The leader of the Social Democrats, Andreas Babler, said, 'Crimes like this one simply should not happen in our society.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/austrian-city-in-shock-after-a-deadly-knife-attack-as-migration-comes-in-spotlight/7976746.html	2025-02-16T02:40:56-08:00	
White South Africans gather in support of Trump and his claims that they are victims of racism	PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — Some white South Africans showed support for President Donald Trump on Saturday and gathered at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria to claim they are victims of racism by their own government. Hundreds of protesters held placards that read 'Thank God for President Trump' and displayed other messages criticizing what they see as racist laws instituted by the South African government that discriminate against the white minority. Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa's Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate private land. The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race and says Trump's claims over the country and the law have been full of misinformation and distortions. Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners — which the order referred to as 'racially disfavored landowners' — when no land has been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. They are only one part of South Africa's white minority. In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were dispossessed of property under the apartheid system of white minority rule and hundreds of years of colonialism before that. 'The people of this country know the pain of forced removals,' Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public good. The Trump administration's criticism and punishment of South Africa has elevated a long-standing dilemma in the country over moves to address the wrongs of centuries of white minority rule that oppressed the Black majority. According to the government, the land law aims to fairly address the inequality that the majority of farmland in South Africa is owned by whites, even though they make up just 7% of the country's population. White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white people. Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk — who was raised in South Africa — has also criticized South Africa’s government and claimed it is anti-white for years, although some have questioned his motivations. He has recently failed to get a license for his Starlink satellite internet service in South Africa because it doesn’t meet the country’s affirmative action criteria. While race has long framed South African politics, the country has been largely successful in reconciling its racially diverse people in the years after apartheid. The current government is made up of a coalition of 10 Black-led and white-led political parties that are working together.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-south-africans-gather-in-support-of-trump-and-his-claims-that-they-are-victims-of-racism/7976735.html	2025-02-16T01:27:56-08:00	
Iran's early recordings revive forgotten sound heritage	TEHRAN, IRAN — In a century-old building in Tehran, Saeed Anvarinejad turned the dial of a vintage radio to tune into some of Iran's earliest recorded sounds, some serving as reminders of the seismic changes that shaped the country's history. Along with a team of fellow enthusiasts, he spent months tracking down the earliest recordings of Iranian music, speeches, interviews, theatrical plays, radio broadcasts and even the hum of daily life from more than a century ago up to the present day. 'Sound is a phenomenon we pay little attention to ... although it's very important,' said Anvarinejad, one of the organizers of the 'SoundScape' exhibition. And 'the era of early sound recording in Iran is a very important time in the socio-political history of the country.' He highlighted the emotional power of early voice recordings, saying they captured 'in a very raw and pure way ... the feeling that people have at that moment,' unlike written records. According to Anvarinejad, the oldest surviving sound recordings from Iran date back to 1898 and 1899, during the reign of Mozaffar al-Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty, which reigned over the country from the late 18th to the early 20th century. His rule saw the unfolding of the Constitutional Revolution, a pivotal moment in Iran's political transformation that established a parliament and constitutional monarchy. 'It was a time when ... a new order was taking shape in the Iranian mind and very important things were happening politically, socially and culturally,' he added. 'We thought it would be good to have a new approach to the sound (from that time) and engage audiences with it.' Upon tuning the wooden-framed antique radio, a chilling broadcast announced the overthrow of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, who had pushed for the nationalization of Iran's oil industry sparking a coup d'etat orchestrated by the United States and Britain. 'This is Tehran! Good news! Good news! People of the cities of Iran, be awake and alert, the traitor Mosaddegh has fled!' crackled the voice of a radio anchor. 'Mysterious void' Other audio included Iran's first recorded call to prayer in either 1912 or 1913, and the 1959 report on the death of Qamar, the first woman singer to perform in public in the country. One striking installation at the exhibition involved a mechanical device mounted on a concrete wall with gears, chains, wheels and a lever which played old recordings of the stringed tar instrument through retro telephone handsets. Another, Mowj Negar, featured printed sound waves arranged in three rows on one wall, with a metal device which moved along the waves. When moved, the device activates melodies from the Qajar and early Pahlavi (1925-79) eras that once echoed through Iran's grand palaces and bustling city streets. Nearby stood a wooden cabinet named 'The Silent Closet,' displaying a series of photos from the World War I -— but without a single accompanying sound. 'There are no sound recordings from Iran during this period, not because technology was unavailable, but likely because the country was in such turmoil that recording sound was not a priority,' said Atabak Axon, another exhibition organizer. 'There was a 12-year silence that remains a mysterious void in Iran's auditory history.' For centuries, sound has played a central role in Persian culture, connecting belief with poetry and identity. For 21-year-old Sarvin Faizian, visiting the exhibition with friends was a deeply moving experience 'as if I was experiencing my parents' past.' Similarly, Fatemeh Sadeghi described feeling overwhelmed by nostalgia, while 63-year-old Kamran Asadi found the exhibition unexpectedly personal. 'It is a very good and intimate atmosphere for me,' he said, lingering on an old song playing in the background. 'It is good for the younger generation to learn where Iran's heritage of music and art came from.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-early-recordings-revive-forgotten-sound-heritage/7975972.html	2025-02-15T23:26:52-08:00	
Breakfast is booming at US restaurants. Is it also contributing to high egg prices?	It's a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos rancheros may be part of the problem. Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another Broken Egg Café celebrated its 100th restaurant last year. Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items containing eggs. Wendy's reintroduced breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs. Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019. In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs. But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to slaughter nearly 159 million chickens, turkeys and other birds — including nearly 47 million since the start of December — is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen. The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment. But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals, 2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024. Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus include eggs. Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he said. The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home use but restaurants needed fewer of them because many of them had to close for a time, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for animal proteins at CoBank. U.S. egg consumption declined for more than five decades before reaching a low of 247 per person in 2008, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As nutritional research and marketing established eggs as an inexpensive protein source instead of heart-clogging cholesterol bombs, per capita consumption of egg products grew to the equivalent of 292 fresh eggs in 2019, the data shows. 'Consumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you're making something with eggs, you know it's fresh,' Earnest said. Before the pandemic reduced demand and bird flu outbreaks impacted supplies, the USDA had forecast that Americans would continue eating more eggs. By 2023, the most recent year for which annual data is available, they were down to 249 eggs per person. Other trends have impacted the economics of eggs. To address animal rights concerns, McDonald's and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments. 'It makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,' Earnest said. The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door. Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association. First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical for the chain's brand and are found in the majority of its offerings, whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and isn't charging extra for them. First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like meat and potatoes, Tomasso said. Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it. 'Eggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of American diets,' Richardson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/breakfast-is-booming-at-us-restaurants-is-it-also-contributing-to-high-egg-prices-/7975967.html	2025-02-15T23:26:12-08:00	
US man sues travel company after hippo kills wife on Zambia trip	A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides. Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit's allegations. The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides — including at least one armed with a rifle — walked away without helping the couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died shortly after, the lawsuit says. 'We're doing this because this should never have happened,' said Paul Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law partner, Nicole Coates. 'There are basic safety standards that businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences here were absolutely devastating.' Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders' death and keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving interviews. The Manderses, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children and a granddaughter. The company's lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or reckless in connection with Lisa Manders' death. He said African Portfolio only arranged the couple's lodging and the owners of the lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides. 'It's a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and is injured or killed. It's awful,' Gould said. 'I think it's important to understand what African Portfolio's role in this is. It's a tour operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces.' He added, 'My client didn't conduct the safari. It arranged it. It booked all the components.' Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa, because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manderses signed for the trip. In a statement, African Portfolio did not directly address the lawsuit. It said Chiawa arranged the walking safari and guests were accompanied by an experienced and highly trained guide, a ranger and an armed National Park scout. It said Chiawa told authorities that safety measures were implemented before the attack and 'repeated warnings' were issued to guests to return to the safety of the vehicle 'during the incident.' Asked whether the guests were warned about the hippo before the attack, African Portfolio said in an email only that 'the statement is an accurate reflection of the events as we understand them.' Gould declined to comment. The company also said its founder flew to Zambia immediately after the attack and joined Chiawa's owner in ensuring that 'everything possible was being done to support the family and all those involved. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family, and everyone else involved in this tragic incident.' The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are 'inherently dangerous activities' because of the unpredictability and sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent, qualified and trained to keep people safe. The suit alleges that African Portfolio 'encouraged and/or permitted' the Manderses to be exposed to an 'avoidable and highly dangerous encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness.' It also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe experience. African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the Manderses before and during the attack, the suit alleges. Hippos are the world's second-largest land mammals after elephants, measuring about 3.5 meters long and about 1.5 meters tall, according to International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs about 3,200 kilograms. Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500. Lisa Manders suffered 'significant premorbid fear and emotional pain, suffering and mental anguish' before her death, the suit says. Craig Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily routines, it says. The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and recklessness. 'He's suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on him and his life,' Slager said. 'And he also has a claim for having witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is unthinkable. It's unimaginable.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-man-sues-travel-company-after-hippo-kills-wife-on-zambia-trip-/7974670.html	2025-02-15T23:25:22-08:00	
With metal detectors, treasure hunters unearth pieces of British history	LONDON — When Malcolm Weale saw the tiny, dirt-covered object he'd unearthed in an English field, he knew it was something special. In his hand was a silver penny minted during the reign of Guthrum, a Viking commander who converted to Christianity and ruled eastern England in the ninth century as Athelstan II. For Weale, finding the first silver coin minted by a Viking ruler in Britain was the pinnacle of decades of hunting with his metal detector in the fields and forests near his home in eastern England. 'I was shaking,' Weale said at the British Museum, where the coin was displayed Tuesday alongside other items unearthed by amateur history hunters in 2023 and 2024. 'I knew that it was a life-changing, incredible, historical find. 'I'd watched the series 'Vikings' on Netflix, and about a week later I've got the Guthrum penny in my hand,' he said. The thrill of finding fragments of history beneath our feet drives detectorists like 54-year-old Weale, who was introduced to the pastime at the age of 7 and 'was hooked.' His find was on show as the museum released its annual report on the Portable Antiquities Scheme, a government-funded project that records thousands of archaeological discoveries made by the public each year. The coin sat alongside a set of 3,000-year-old bronze metalworkers' tools, a seventh-century gold and garnet necklace, and a gold signet ring with an intriguing link to Queen Elizabeth I. They have been officially classed as 'treasure' by a coroner, meaning they will be independently valued and offered to local museums. Discoveries by detectorists, as well as beachcombers and mudlarkers — who search for items on riverbanks — shine new light into corners of British history. The necklace of glittering gold and garnet pendants found in Lincolnshire, central England, reveals the sophistication of Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship, and is surprisingly global. Archaeologist Helen Geake, who serves as a 'finds liaison officer' for the antiquities program, said that it was likely made in England — 'English craftsmen were by far the best in Europe' — with garnets from Sri Lanka. Andy Akroyd, 49, also struck gold when he was out metal detecting near his home in Bedfordshire, central England. 'When I first saw it, I thought 'Oh it's a coin.' Then I saw it's a ring, I was thinking 1980s, cheap sovereign ring,' Akroyd said. It turned out to be a 16th-century signet ring engraved with a phoenix, a mythical bird symbolizing rebirth that was associated with Elizabeth I. Found in an area used as a royal hunting ground in Elizabethan times, it was likely worn, and lost, by one of the queen's supporters. 'When you find it, your journey is just beginning,' Akroyd said. Then come the questions: 'What is this, how is it here?' When items are declared treasure, their value is split between the finder and the owner of the land where it was found. Detectorists occasionally strike it rich — last year, a hoard of 1,000-year-old coins found in southwest England sold for 4.3 million pounds ($5.3 million). But the vast majority are in it for the thrill of discovery, not the money, Weale said. 'You could be a multi-multi-millionaire, but you could never buy that feeling that you feel when you find something,' he said. Both he and Akroyd say that they will soon be back out tramping the fields, in the mud and — this is England, after all — the rain. 'You always find the best stuff when the weather's terrible,' Weale said. Both men extol the mental health benefits of the methodical, slow-paced hobby, popularized to a wider audience by the gentle BBC sitcom 'Detectorists.' 'All I'm thinking about when I'm out metal detectoring is history,' Weale said. 'Kings, queens — I'm totally in the zone. I'm not worried about bills, or even keeping warm. Sometimes I forget to eat.' Akroyd said that some days he just sits, watching hares leap and birds of prey soar in the sky. 'I lost my dad last year. I'll have a chat to my dad when I'm out in the field. 'Come on, Dad — what way now?'' Akroyd said. 'He never finds me anything.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-metal-detectors-treasure-hunters-unearth-pieces-of-british-history-/7974646.html	2025-02-15T23:24:36-08:00	
Photos lost in US disasters find way home with help from people who care	LOS ANGELES — Hollowed-out homes. Cars entombed by mud. Unpeopled roads. Belongings reduced to dirt and debris. It all took a toll on Taylor Schenker. After Hurricane Helene last September, Schenker was upset by the deluge of images of Asheville, North Carolina. 'This storm has taken so much,' she said, 'and it's so jarring to see the photos of the horrible devastation.' So less than a week after the storm, she set out to do something about the wide-scale loss. While helping a friend search for belongings cast downriver, she stumbled on a handful of photos of strangers — mud-caked, curled up in tree branches and stuck under river rocks. The images captured family reunions, newborn babies, weddings, birthday parties, beloved pets and school portraits. 'These tiny photos had been through so much and miraculously had washed up and were in decent enough condition that you could see what they were,' said Schenker, 27. 'It stuck with me.' To reclaim the search phrase 'photos from Helene,' she created an Instagram for 'something positive, which is reuniting people with their memories.' She set up a post-office box, linked up with a volunteer search and rescue crew, and ultimately uncovered more than 500 photos — or what she calls 'little needles in a haystack.' When Schenker made her first match, she got chills. Then, sitting in her car, she cried. Photos found amid muck We hold onto photos to keep memories alive — of people, places and moments that might otherwise fade. Or sometimes are ripped away abruptly. Schenker has since returned more than 70 such images. A stack of them were hand-delivered to Mary Moss, whose car was destroyed by an uprooted tree as she and her husband evacuated the Asheville home where they had lived for almost 40 years. 'It was really kind of overwhelming at first when she handed me those pictures. I just couldn't even speak,' Moss said. 'You don't expect something as fragile as photos to be retrieved.' Months later, they've received some FEMA assistance and found a temporary home, which they're gradually furnishing with church donations. But some things are irreplaceable. 'This is not really about losing the home and all the material stuff in there. But what's been devastating is that that was everything we had of Tommy,' she said of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic disorder. 'It's those memories and the little things, the photos, that you can't replace.' As Schenker later understood it, 'When they lost their home, they lost virtually all proof that this child existed.' 'It is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people's lives,' she said. 'They've literally lost everything and they can't ever recreate those childhood photos.' In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Moss family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old dressed like an angel for a Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in yet another, he's playing at daycare alongside his younger brother Dallas. 'It is just breathtaking,' Moss said. 'This is one thing that the river didn't get to take — or didn't get to keep.' Smoke, water, ash, soot More than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away, in the Altadena foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them with their owners. After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. 'Someone has to do this ASAP,' she remembers thinking to herself. 'And I realized it had to be me — because nobody else was doing it.' Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the deterioration process, he freezes such prints — and advised to not wipe off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, 'driving particles deeper into the material.' Some photos are so brittle, too, that when touched they may disintegrate. In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials, whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot. Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly set out to salvage photos — finding them alongside pages from yearbooks, sheet music, and children's art in nearby parks, neighbors' front yards and a golf course. 'The wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in with precious mementos everywhere you look,' she said. 'It's just absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a unit.' Finding the photographed people Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground. Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to Schwartz. She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival intern at the Corita Art Center — protecting photos in acid-free, glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a temperature-controlled room with good air circulation. Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact. 'It's funny — you formulate these ideas of who the person is,' Schwartz said. 'She was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really friendly and bubbly and lovely — you could tell that just from her photos.' Schwartz's house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it — full of burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles — is otherworldly and changed. 'It looks like the moon. It looks like another planet. It doesn't look like home.' Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived. 'The very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby,' said Simpson. The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy, as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. 'We were both pretty overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that one.' Above all, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. 'When you're picking up people's heirlooms or family photographs, that can be traumatic — even if they're not yours,' he said. When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or hurricanes, and are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide range of emotions — from overwhelmed to outraged to numb sometimes all at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities, and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B. 'Disasters like this really bring out the best in people,' Moss said. 'You know, I can laugh or I can cry about it — and I choose to laugh about it. Fortunately, we didn't lose the most important thing. That's lives.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-photos-lost-in-american-disasters-find-their-way-home-with-a-little-help-from-people-who-care-/7974676.html	2025-02-15T23:23:55-08:00	
Navalny supporters risk reprisals with memorial events a year after death	MOSCOW — A year after Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny died behind bars, his supporters were set to hold memorial events on Sunday, with some risking reprisals by visiting his grave in Moscow. Remembrance events will take place as Russia's opposition movement -- driven into exile by unprecedented repression -- has been plagued by infighting and badly weakened since the loss of its figurehead. Exiled in various countries, its leading members have tried to revive the fight against Vladimir Putin's long reign, including in Russia where criticism of authorities is severely punished. Navalny -- Putin's main opponent -- was declared an 'extremist' by Russian authorities, a ruling that remains in force despite his death in an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16, 2024. In Russia, anybody who mentions Navalny or his Anti-Corruption Foundation without stating that they have been declared 'extremist' is subject to fines, or up to four years in prison for repeated offenses. Navalny's former top aide Leonid Volkov wrote on Telegram that 'Alexei's supporters will hold memorial events all around the world.' 'In some places there will be rallies or marches, in others showings of the documentary Navalny, in others, memorial services,' he added. Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, is set to share memories of her husband at an event in Berlin, where many Russian opposition supporters have settled. 'Wherever you are, in Russia or abroad, we hope very much that you will meet like-minded people on February 16,' Volkov wrote, giving opening hours of Moscow's Borisovskoye cemetery where Navalny is buried. But Russian pro-Kremlin Telegram channels warned supporters against going to the cemetery. 'Big Brother' warning 'We give brief advice to those who plan to go there but are not yet sure -- don't go!' said a post shared by pro-Kremlin journalist Dmitry Smirnov and other channels. The message warns of 'Big Brother and his ever-watchful eye,' with a photo of a security camera sign at the cemetery gates. Russia has not fully explained Navalny's death, which came less than a month before a presidential election that extended Putin's more than two-decade rule, saying that it had happened as he was walking in the prison yard. Until his death, the 47-year-old continued to call for Russians to oppose the Kremlin and denounced Moscow's Ukraine offensive, even from behind bars. 'I took the decision not to be afraid,' he wrote in his autobiography, published after his death in several languages. Russia has branded Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and the regional offices Navalny set up as 'extremist organizations.' Participation in an extremist group is punishable by up to six years in prison and many who campaigned in support of Navalny have been jailed or fled the country. Supporters also risk fines or stints in police cells for publicly displaying 'symbols' of an extremist organization, which has been applied to photos of Navalny or just his name. Four independent journalists are currently on trial for 'participating in an extremist group,' accused of preparing photos and video materials for Navalny's social media channels. Last month, Russia sentenced to several years in prison three lawyers who defended Navalny on an extremism charge for passing on his messages from prison, prompting international condemnation. Call for death probe Yulia Navalnaya has blamed the Kremlin for her husband's death -- which Moscow has denied. Amnesty International has called for an 'investigation conducted by independent and impartial international experts' into his death. Navalny was arrested in 2021 after returning to Russia following medical treatment in Germany for poisoning with Novichok nerve agent. In December 2023 he was transferred to a remote penal colony above the Arctic Circle. After Navalny's death, it emerged that talks on his inclusion in a prisoner exchange had been underway. Putin said in March 2024 that 'a few days' before Navalny's death, he was told of an 'idea to exchange' the prisoner. A White House official later confirmed such talks. Navalny made his name with rousing speeches at huge opposition rallies in Moscow in 2011-13. While Russia's opposition has never had an overall leader, he became its most prominent figure. Navalny faced an avalanche of legal action and received multiple sentences after establishing a network of regional offices and the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which made widely watched video exposes about officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/navalny-supporters-risk-reprisals-with-memorial-events-a-year-after-death/7976720.html	2025-02-15T23:22:17-08:00	
Fistfights, anthem boos in stormy US-Canada ice hockey clash	MONTREAL — Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday. An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded lineups of the North American rivals -- which comes against a backdrop of political tension between the two neighboring countries -- erupted into violence from the opening puck drop at Montreal's Bell Centre. The U.S. squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a fiercely partisan Canadian crowd. With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans booed The Star-Spangled Banner before the game, catcalls that have become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods crossing U.S. borders. Then came three fights in nine seconds. 'I just think it's very indicative of what this means to the players,' U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said. 'There's two teams out there that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective teams and their countries. 'For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way that it occurred -- I think that's an indication of it. What an incredible hockey game.' Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee in the first moments was not prearranged. 'It wasn't planned,' Cooper said. 'That wasn't two coaches throwing guys over and saying 'This is happening' -- none of that happened. That was as organic as it gets.' At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as Canada's Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice. Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and tried to restart the game, only for Canada's Sam Bennett and Brady Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the penalty box. The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American J.T. Miller and Canada's Colton Parayko began the third and final fight. 'Jacked up' Asked about U.S. players having agreed on the fight-filled start beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a move. 'These guys care very much about winning,' he said. 'Brady and Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion -- and they're leaders in so many ways. 'It's just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there's a lot of energy around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play.' Top NHL players from the United States and Canada had not faced off against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the league's best traditionally skipping the world championships and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018 PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. 'It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half,' Cooper said. The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid's goal 5:31 into the first period. But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel's goal at 10:15 of the first period and the U.S. went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin's tally at 13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on Guentzel's empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fistfights-anthem-boos-in-stormy-us-canada-ice-hockey-clash/7976716.html	2025-02-15T22:34:09-08:00	
18 dead in India stampede to catch trains to Hindu mega-festival	NEW DELHI — At least 18 people died during a stampede at a railway station in India's capital late Saturday when surging crowds scrambled to catch trains to the world's largest religious gathering, officials and reports said. The Kumbh Mela attracts tens of millions of Hindu faithful every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj and has a history of crowd-related disasters -- including one last month, when at least 30 people died in another stampede at the holy confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. The rush at the train station in New Delhi appeared to break out Saturday as crowds struggled to board trains for the ongoing event, which will end Feb. 26. 'I can confirm 15 deaths at the hospital. They don't have any open injury. Most [likely died from] hypoxia or maybe some blunt injury but that would only be confirmed after an autopsy,' Dr. Ritu Saxena, deputy medical superintendent of Lok Nayak Hospital in New Delhi told AFP. 'There are also 11 others who are injured. Most of them are stable and have orthopedic injuries,' she said. Broadcaster NDTV reported three more dead from the stampede quoting an official of another hospital in the city. Those dead were mostly women and children. 'I have been working as a coolie since 1981, but I never saw a crowd like this before,' the Times of India newspaper quoted a porter at the railway station as saying. 'People started colliding and fell on the escalator and stairs' when platform for a special train departing for Prayagraj was suddenly shifted, the porter said. Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said a 'high-level inquiry' had been ordered into the causes of the accident. Vaishnaw said additional special trains were being run from New Delhi to clear the rush of devotees. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was 'distressed' by the stampede. 'My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery,' he wrote on X. The governor of the capital territory Delhi, Vinai Kumar Saxena said disaster management personnel had been told to deploy and 'all hospitals are in readiness to address related exigencies.' The six-week Kumbh Mela is the single biggest milestone on the Hindu religious calendar, and officials said around 500 million devotees have already visited the festival since it began last month. More than 400 people died after they were trampled or drowned on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally. Another 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in Prayagraj.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-india-stampede-to-catch-trains-to-hindu-mega-festival/7976713.html	2025-02-15T21:39:44-08:00	
US, South Korea, Japan reaffirm pledge to seek denuclearization of North Korea	MUNICH — The United States, Japan and South Korea renewed their 'resolute' pledge to seek the 'complete denuclearization' of North Korea, according to a joint statement from the three allies released Saturday. The statement came after new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held his first meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Japan's top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. 'The Secretary and Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs),' it said. 'They expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address together the DPRK's nuclear and missile programs, malicious cyber activities including cryptocurrency thefts, and increasing military cooperation with Russia,' it added. The three sent a 'strong warning' that they 'will not tolerate any provocations or threats to their homelands,' and vowed to maintain and strengthen international sanctions against Pyongyang. They also said they were committed to 'the immediate resolution of the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war as well as the issue of separated families.' Largely cut off from the world diplomatically and economically, and under a bevy of sanctions, North Korea with its ongoing nuclear weapons program has been a major thorn in the side of the United States for years. President Donald Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim Jong Un during his first term in office, has said he will reach out again to the North Korean leader, calling Kim a 'smart guy.' Despite Trump's diplomatic overtures, North Korea said in January that its nuclear program would continue 'indefinitely.' Pyongyang also said earlier this month it would not tolerate any 'provocation' by the United States after Rubio called it a 'rogue state' in a radio interview. It has also slammed a visit by a U.S. nuclear submarine to a naval base in South Korea this month as a 'hostile military act.' A summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi collapsed in 2019 over talks on sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in return.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-south-korea-japan-reaffirm-pledge-to-seek-denuclearization-of-north-korea/7976702.html	2025-02-15T19:18:02-08:00	
US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts	SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the federal government. On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances in the last week. It was unclear if they would be replaced. The U.S. Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. Immigration courts are backlogged with more than 3.7 million cases, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Applicants can wait years for their asylum case to be decided. There is support across the political spectrum for more judges and support staff, though the first Trump administration also pressured some judges to decide cases more quickly. The Trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials, including Mary Cheng, the agency's acting director. Sirce Owen, the current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge, has issued a slew of new instructions, many reversing policies of the Biden administration. Last month, the Justice Department halted financial support for nongovernmental organizations to provide information and guidance to people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit. The firings touch on two top Trump priorities: mass deportations and shrinking the size of the federal government. On Thursday, it ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers. Probationary workers generally have less than a year on the job.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-fires-20-immigration-judges-from-backlogged-courts-/7976698.html	2025-02-15T18:31:22-08:00	
US East faces flooding as snow forecast for Northeast, cold in Midwest	LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — Much of the Eastern U.S. endured a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with snowstorms predicted in the Northeast and heavy winds bringing the threat of tornadoes to the Mississippi Valley. The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and people were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off the roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to 20.3 centimeters of rain. Governor Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday. 'We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have flooded in the past,' Beshear said on social media. Photos posted by authorities and users on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in Warren County, Kentucky, and in Buchanan County, Virginia, where the sheriff's office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides. The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters. 'Stay home if you can,' the office said on Facebook. Flash flooding was possible in the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio valleys, the weather service said. In Tennessee, flash flood warnings were issued for much of the middle of the state through the evening. The National Weather Service called the expected rain a 'major, potentially historic, flash flood event.' Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest accumulations — possibly 30.5 centimeters or more — were expected in upstate New York and portions of northern New England. 'Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch (half a centimeter) are forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages,' the weather service warned. Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening. Frigid polar vortex Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets. Forecasters reported 2.5 centimeters of snow falling every hour just north of Denver. The weather service also warned of extreme cold in the Upper Plains over the coming days, with wind chills ranging from minus 34 degree Celsius to as low as minus 51 degrees Celsius in parts of western Montana, North Dakota, northern South Dakota and western Minnesota. People in those areas were urged to stay indoors and make provisions to shelter livestock and other animals. California struggles with mudslides Dry weather returned to Southern California after the strongest storm of the year. But the risk of rockslides and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several homes with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters of snow over 36 hours. Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-east-faces-flooding-as-snow-forecast-for-northeast-cold-in-midwest-/7976695.html	2025-02-15T18:01:40-08:00	
Mali gold mine accident kills at least 48, officials say	BAMAKO, MALI — At least 48 people were killed in the collapse of an illegally operated gold mine in western Mali on Saturday, authorities and local sources told Agence France-Presse. Mali is one of Africa's leading gold producers, and mining sites are regularly the scene of deadly landslides and accidents. Authorities have struggled to control unregulated mining of the precious metal in the country, which is among the world's poorest. 'The death toll is 48 following the landslide,' a local police source said. The victims are mainly young women, including one who was carrying her child on her back. Boubacar Keita, from the Kenieba gold prospectors' association, also counts at least 48 deaths. 'It is an illegal site. There is a lot of complicity in the exploitation of this type of site in the region,' the head of a local environmental organization told AFP, adding that the search for victims was ongoing. Saturday's accident took place at an abandoned site formerly operated by a Chinese company, sources told AFP. In January, a landslide at a gold mine in southern Mali killed at least 10 people and left many others missing, most of them women. Just over a year ago, a tunnel collapsed at a gold mining site in the same region as Saturday's landslide, killing more than 70 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-gold-mine-accident-kills-at-least-48-officials-say-/7976692.html	2025-02-15T17:51:56-08:00	
Chad officials seal schools as measles epidemic hits poor district	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chad health officials have sealed several dozen schools, sent thousands of children and their teachers home, and restricted movements to and from the Bologo district — 400 kilometers south of the capital, N'djamena — to contain a measles epidemic. Officials blame vaccine hesitancy for the rapid measles spread within the past two weeks. State TV reports that thousands of children in Chad's Bologo district have been ordered to stay home for a week as their schools remain closed to prevent measles from spreading. Many churches and mosques in the district are closed too. About 50 cases of measles were confirmed within the past two weeks, said Oumar Mahamat Traore, chief health official in Bologo, appointed by Chad's central government in N'djamena. He said the situation is very concerning because all seven of the hospitals in Bologo district have at least five children receiving treatment for measles. He said parents should make sure all children having high fever, runny nose, red and watery eyes and rashes on their faces and bodies accompanied by small white spots inside the mouth are immediately rushed to the nearest hospital, where they will receive free treatment. Traore spoke to VOA on Saturday by telephone. He said it is difficult to know the number of children affected by the measles epidemic because more than 80% of civilians in Bologo prefer African traditional medicine and go to conventional hospitals only in critical circumstances. Hospitals have not reported any deaths, but some affected children are in critical condition, according to government officials. Chad's government said health workers have been dispatched to Bologo and surrounding towns and villages to educate civilians against popular beliefs that the viral disease is divine punishment for wrongdoing and can be treated only by offering traditional sacrifices to the gods. Health workers are raising awareness that measles can be treated with conventional medicine. The United Nations reports that measles is one of the main causes of death among children in Chad. Outbreaks occur often because vaccination coverage remains low throughout the central African state. Chad’s Health Ministry says vaccine hesitancy is to blame for millions of children not being inoculated against childhood diseases including measles. In 2023, Doctors Without Borders reported that more than 1.3 million children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years old were inoculated against measles. Chad said there were plans with its international partners to inoculate at least 4 million children in the country of close to 18 million people. But armed conflicts and tensions triggered by elections to end a three-year transition that followed the death of President Idriss Deby Itno in 2021 made it impossible for humanitarian agencies to continue vaccination drives. Officials hope that with peace returning and constitutional order reestablished — with the election of Mahamat Idriss Deby as president and the new parliament — more vaccine campaigns will be organized. Measles is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory system that can lead to severe complications and death. The U.N. says it is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. In the absence of specific treatment, vaccination is the most effective medical tool against measles, the World Health Organization said. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive, according to the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-officials-seal-schools-as-measles-epidemic-hits-poor-district/7976693.html	2025-02-15T17:45:11-08:00	
Nun takes top Vatican job running city state administration	ROME — An Italian nun is taking over a top management job in the Vatican: Sister Raffaella Petrini was named Saturday as president of the Vatican City State, making her essentially the governor of the 44-hectare (108-acre) territory in Rome that is home to the Catholic Church. Petrini, 56, had previously been the secretary general of the Vatican administration, which among other things is responsible for the city state's infrastructure and the Vatican Museums, a major source of revenue for the Holy See. She moves into the top job on March 1, following the retirement of Cardinal Fernando Vergez Alzaga, who turns 80 that day. Pope Francis had previously announced Petrini's promotion, part of his effort to place women in decision-making roles in the Vatican to serve as models for the rest of the church. The Vatican officially published the appointment Saturday while the pope was hospitalized with a respiratory tract infection. Last month, Francis named the first woman to head a major Holy See office, appointing another Italian nun, Sister Simona Brambilla, to become prefect of the department responsible for all the Catholic Church's religious orders. While women have been named to No. 2 spots in some Vatican offices, never before have women been named to the top jobs of the Holy See Curia or Vatican City State administration. Catholic women have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men. Francis has upheld the ban on female priests and tamped down hopes that women could be ordained as deacons. But there has been a marked increase in the percentage of women working in the Vatican during his papacy, including in leadership positions, from 19.3% in 2013 to 23.4% today, according to statistics reported by Vatican News. In the Curia alone, the percentage of women is 26%. Critics complain that making women managers of the church doesn't compensate for the continued ban on ordaining them as ministers. In addition to her job running the Vatican City State administration, Petrini also serves as one of three women who are members of the Vatican office that vets bishop nominations. When they were named in 2022 it marked the first time women had had a formal role in the Vatican process of selecting bishops. A member of the Meriden, Connecticut-based Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist religious order, Petrini otherwise keeps a relatively low public profile. But during a 2023 Women's Day speech at Rome's Pontifical Holy Cross university, she acknowledged that her nomination as secretary general of the Vatican City State had raised eyebrows, 'more than I expected in my ingenuity.' 'Even in non-ecclesial organizations, resistance is part of the process of change,' said Petrini, who has also been a professor of welfare economics at Rome's Pontifical Angelicum University.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nun-takes-top-vatican-job-running-city-state-administration-/7976682.html	2025-02-15T17:38:45-08:00	
IRS to lay off thousands of probationary workers in tax season	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two sources familiar with the agency's plans, and the cuts could happen as soon as next week. The Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. It is doing it by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection. It's unclear how many IRS workers will be affected. Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to almost all federal employees through a 'deferred resignation program' to quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30. However, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees. It is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment. Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency. Republicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have called for the U.S. to 'delete entire agencies' from the federal government as part of his plan to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities. Elected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys general from 14 states challenged the authority of DOGE to access sensitive government data and exercise 'virtually unchecked power' in a lawsuit filed Thursday. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that delineate the powers of Congress and the president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/irs-to-lay-off-thousands-of-probationary-workers-in-tax-season/7976685.html	2025-02-15T17:13:15-08:00	
US, Russia officials to meet in Saudi Arabia to start talks on Ukraine	MUNICH/WASHINGTON — U.S. and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia in coming days to start talks aimed at ending Moscow's nearly three-year war in Ukraine, a U.S. lawmaker and a source familiar with the planning said on Saturday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Germany on Friday, said Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Saudi Arabia and Kyiv would not engage with Russia before consulting with strategic partners. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Saudi Arabia, U.S. Representative Michael McCaul told Reuters. It was not immediately clear who they would meet from Russia. Rubio spoke by phone on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and agreed on regular contacts to prepare for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, Russia's Foreign Ministry said. The phone call was held at the initiative of the U.S. side, it added. 'The two sides expressed their mutual willingness to interact on pressing international issues, including the settlement around Ukraine, the situation around Palestine and in general in the Middle East and other regional directions,' the ministry said in a statement. On the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, McCaul said the aim of the talks was to arrange a meeting that included Zelenskyy, Trump and Putin 'to finally bring peace and end this conflict.' A source with knowledge of the plans confirmed the talks in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zelenskyy said on Saturday Ukraine would never accept any peace deals reached behind its back or without Kyiv's involvement. Ukraine has repeatedly said it wants to come together with the United States and Europe to devise a joint strategy before any Trump-Putin meeting. Trump, who took office on January 20, has repeatedly vowed to swiftly end the Ukraine war. He made separate phone calls to Putin and Zelenskyy on Wednesday, leaving Washington's European allies alarmed that they will be cut out of any peace process. Those fears were largely confirmed on Saturday when Trump's Ukraine envoy said Europe won't have a seat at the table, after Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv. Keith Kellogg, special envoy for Ukraine-Russia talks, told the Munich conference that the U.S. would act as an intermediary in the talks, with Ukraine and Russia as the two protagonists. Asked about the prospects of the Europeans being at the table, Kellogg said: 'I'm (from) a school of realism. I think that's not gonna happen.' At a later event at the conference, Kellogg sought to reassure Europeans by declaring this did not mean 'their interests are not considered, used or developed.' But European leaders said they would not accept being shut out of the talks. Zelenskyy said on Friday he would visit the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, but did not say when. However, the Ukrainian leader said he had no plans to meet with U.S. or Russian officials during those visits. Moscow controls a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly advancing in the east for months, while Kyiv's smaller army grapples with manpower shortages and tries to hold a chunk of territory in western Russia. Russia has demanded Kyiv cede territory and become permanently neutral under any peace deal. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured land and wants NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent attack by Moscow. The United States and Europe have given Ukraine tens of billions of dollars in military aid since the war started. Trump has said he backs Ukraine but is seeking security for U.S. funding for Kyiv. The U.S. and Ukraine are negotiating a deal that could open up Ukraine's vast natural wealth to U.S. investment. Three sources said the U.S. proposed taking ownership of 50% of Ukraine's critical minerals. Zelenskyy said on Saturday that the draft deal did not contain the security provisions Kyiv needed. Also on Saturday, France discussed with its allies holding an informal summit of European leaders to discuss Ukraine, a French presidency official said on Saturday, and four European diplomats said the meeting was likely to go ahead on Monday. Speaking on a panel at the Munich conference on Saturday, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski also said that French President Emmanuel Macron had called for a summit of European leaders in Paris. 'President Trump has a method of operating, which the Russians call reconnaissance through battle. You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position, legitimate tactics. And we need to respond,' Sikorski said. The Dutch news agency reported that Prime Minister Dick Schoof would go to Paris on Monday for the summit. It was unclear whether Zelenskyy would be invited.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-russia-officials-to-meet-in-saudi-arabia-to-start-talks-on-ukraine-/7976665.html	2025-02-15T16:48:42-08:00	
Europe will not be part of Ukraine peace talks, US envoy says	MUNICH — Europe won't have a seat at the table for Ukraine peace talks, Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy said on Saturday, after Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv. Trump shocked European allies this week by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin without consulting them or Kyiv beforehand and declaring an immediate start to peace talks. Trump administration officials have also made clear in recent days that they expect European allies in NATO to take primary responsibility for the region as the United States now has other priorities, such as border security and countering China. The U.S. moves have stoked fears that Europeans may be cut out of a peace deal that would also impact their own security, particularly if it is seen as too favorable to Russia. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg told a global security conference in Munich that the U.S. would act as an intermediary in the talks, with Ukraine and Russia as the two protagonists. Asked about the prospects of the Europeans being at the table, Kellogg said: 'I'm (from) a school of realism. I think that's not gonna happen.' Kellogg said that talks aimed at ending the war between Russia and Ukraine could focus on territorial concessions from Russia and targeting Putin's oil revenues. 'Russia is really a petrostate,' he said, adding that Western powers needed to do more regarding effectively enforcing sanctions on Russia. At a later event at the conference, Kellogg sought to reassure Europeans by declaring this did not mean 'their interests are not considered, used or developed.' But European leaders said they would not accept being shut out of the talks. 'There's no way in which we can have discussions or negotiations about Ukraine, Ukraine's future or European security structure, without Europeans,' Finland's President Alexander Stubb told reporters in Munich. 'But this means that Europe needs to get its act together. Europe needs to talk less and do more.' Stubb said the questionnaire the U.S. sent to Europeans 'will force Europeans to think.' A European diplomat said the U.S. document included six questions with one specifically for European Union member states. 'The Americans are approaching European capitals and asking how many soldiers they are ready to deploy,' one diplomat said. France is discussing with its allies the possibility of holding an informal meeting among European leaders on Ukraine to discuss these matters, although nothing has been decided at this stage, a French presidency official said on Saturday. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said it would take place on Monday. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also urged Europeans to get their act together. 'And to my European friends, I would say, get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up (defense) spending,' he said in Munich. In a sign that there is still some degree of international cooperation in the new Trump era, G7 foreign ministers, including the U.S., agreed on Saturday on a statement in which they pledged to continue working together to get a durable peace deal for Ukraine with robust security guarantees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-will-not-be-part-of-ukraine-peace-talks-us-envoy-says-/7976497.html	2025-02-15T16:23:15-08:00	
Lebanon says 25 arrested after attack on UN peacekeepers	BEIRUT — Lebanese authorities said Saturday that more than 25 people have been arrested following an attack on a United Nations convoy that wounded two peacekeepers, including the force's outgoing deputy commander. U.N. and Lebanese officials have condemned Friday's attack, which came as Hezbollah supporters blocked the road to the country's only international airport for a second night over a decision by Lebanon to bar two Iranian flights from landing. On Saturday, an AFP correspondent said tear gas was fired to disperse a crowd that again blocked the road to the airport after the Iran-backed group called for a sit-in. Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar told reporters that 'more than 25 people have been arrested by Lebanese army intelligence,' with another person detained by the security services. 'This does not mean these detainees carried out the attack ... but the investigations will show who is responsible,' he said, adding that violations would be treated 'with all seriousness.' The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon has demanded a 'full and immediate investigation' after one of its vehicles was set on fire in the attack, which wounded outgoing deputy force commander Chok Bahadur Dhakal, who was heading home to Nepal after completing his mission. UNIFIL deputy spokesperson Kandice Ardiel told AFP a second Nepalese peacekeeper was also wounded. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the attack. President Joseph Aoun vowed 'the attackers will receive their punishment,' and said 'security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to upset stability and civil peace.' It remains unclear who was responsible for the attack. Senior Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa said 'what happened with UNIFIL ... is unacceptable.' 'Hezbollah has nothing to do with this matter,' he told Beirut-based pro-Iran broadcaster Al-Mayadeen. Transport Minister Fayez Rasamny said that the government was trying to bring home citizens stranded in Iran on Lebanese flag carrier Middle East Airlines, but Tehran had not provided the necessary permissions. Iran said it was ready for 'constructive talks' with Lebanon on restoring flights, during a telephone call between the two countries' foreign ministers, an Iranian foreign ministry statement said. Israel has repeatedly accused Hezbollah of using Beirut airport to transfer weapons from Iran, claims Hezbollah and Lebanese officials have denied. Lebanon's Directorate General of Civil Aviation said Thursday it had 'temporarily rescheduled' some flights, including from Iran, until February 18. The date coincides with the deadline for Israel to complete its withdrawal from south Lebanon and for Hezbollah to vacate its military positions in the region under a ceasefire deal that began in November and was later extended. On Saturday, the Israeli military carried out an airstrike on south Lebanon that it said targeted a senior militant from Hezbollah's aerial unit. 'The terrorist was targeted after repeatedly violating the understandings between Israel and Lebanon over the past few weeks, including his role in leading the launch of UAVs (drones) towards Israeli territory,' the military said. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said two people were killed and four wounded in the strike on a vehicle in the Iqlim al-Tuffah area. Both sides have accused each other of repeated ceasefire violations since the truce went into effect late last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-says-25-arrested-after-attack-on-un-peacekeepers-/7976488.html	2025-02-15T15:17:58-08:00	
1 dead, 4 injured in stabbing spree by Syrian suspect in Austria	VIENNA — A 23-year-old man stabbed five passersby in southern Austria on Saturday in what police said was a random attack that left a 14-year-old dead, and four others injured. The suspect was detained in the city of Villach, where the attack took place, police said. He is a Syrian national with legal residence in Austria, they said. Two victims were seriously injured and two victims sustained minor injuries, police said. Police spokesperson Rainer Dionisio said a motive was not immediately known. He added that police were investigating the attacker's personal background. 'We have to wait until we get secure information,' he said. A 42-year-old man who works for a food delivery company witnessed the incident from his car, police said. He drove toward the suspect and helped to prevent things from getting worse, Dionisio told Austria's public broadcaster ORF. Peter Kaiser, the governor of the Austrian province of Carinthia, expressed his condolences to the family of the 14-year-old victim. 'This outrageous atrocity must be met with harsh consequences. I have always said with clarity and unambiguously: Those who live in Carinthia, in Austria, have to respect the law and adjust to our rules and values.' Erwin Angerer, a lawmaker for the far-right Freedom Party, said his party had been warning about the situation in Austria as a result of the country's 'disastrous asylum policy.' Austria's Interior Minister Gerhard Karner was expected in Villach on Sunday morning. Police said it wasn't clear whether the suspect acted on his own and continued to search for potential additional suspects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-4-injured-in-stabbing-spree-by-syrian-suspect-in-austria/7976471.html	2025-02-15T14:31:44-08:00	
15 dead in India stampede to catch trains to Hindu festival	NEW DELHI, INDIA — At least 15 people died during a stampede at a railway station in India's capital late Saturday when surging crowds scrambled to catch trains to the world's largest religious gathering, a medical official told AFP. The Kumbh Mela attracts tens of millions of Hindu faithful every 12 years to the northern city of Prayagraj and has a history of crowd-related disasters — including one last month, when at least 30 people died in another stampede at the holy confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. The rush at the train station in New Delhi appeared to break out Saturday as crowds struggled to board trains for the ongoing event, which will end on February 26. 'I can confirm 15 deaths at the hospital. They don't have any open injury. Most (likely died from) hypoxia or maybe some blunt injury but that would only be confirmed after an autopsy,' Dr. Ritu Saxena, deputy medical superintendent of Lok Nayak Hospital in New Delhi to AFP. 'There are also 11 others who are injured. Most of them are stable and have orthopedic injuries,' she said. Defense minister Rajnath Singh said he was 'extremely pained by the loss of lives due to stampede' at the New Delhi railway station. 'In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families. Praying for the speedy [recovery] of the injured,' Singh said in a social media post. The governor of the capital, Vinai Kumar Saxena said disaster management personnel had been told to deploy and 'all hospitals are in readiness to address related exigencies.' Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said additional special trains were being run from New Delhi to clear the rush of devotees. The six-week Kumbh Mela is the single biggest milestone on the Hindu religious calendar, and officials said around 500 million devotees have already visited the festival since it began last month. More than 400 people died after they were trampled or drowned on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest death tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally. Another 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in Prayagraj.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-india-stampede-to-catch-trains-to-hindu-festival-/7976466.html	2025-02-15T14:08:23-08:00	
Central African Republic soldiers kidnapped by mercenaries, advocates allege	BANGUI, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC — Human rights advocates and politicians in Central African Republic claim soldiers who disappeared after being detained last month were kidnapped by mercenaries backed by Russia. The Kremlin has in recent years deepened ties with the gold- and diamond-rich country's military and government. Celestin Bakoyo and Elie Ngouengue — two soldiers who led a Wagner Group-aligned militia fighting rebels in the country's southeast — were reportedly detained on January 24 at a police station in the country's capital. Ernest Mizedio, a politician from the region, told The Associated Press that the two soldiers were among a group arrested earlier by Russian mercenaries tasked with training militia members and incorporating them into the army. 'We searched without success for where they took them,' he said, noting that supporters had inquired with both law enforcement and Russian security contractors about their whereabouts. 'They said they had nothing to offer us and knew nothing of their situation.' Mizedio, a member of one of Central African Republic's opposition parties, said there had been marches and protests decrying the arrests in the country's southeast. Neither Wagner nor the military responded to AP's requests for comment on the disappearance. However, a police officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said mercenaries were gradually vying for position and replacing officers on the ground in conflict zones. Before going missing, the two had come to the capital to open new bank accounts to access their earnings after being integrated into the army. The backlash against their disappearance comes as Russia expands its military and economic presence throughout Africa, using mercenaries to quell rebellion and fight extremists. Joseph Bindoumi, president of Central African Republic's League for Human Rights, denounced the disappearances, called them kidnappings and said even if the soldiers were accused of crimes, their whereabouts should be known. 'We have the right to know if standard procedures are being followed. We have the right to see people to ensure their well-being and to ensure their parents, advocates and lawyers can visit them,' he said. Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries became active. Amid years of conflict between government forces and predominantly Muslim rebels, citizens and officials credited the Russian mercenaries with fighting back armed groups who tried to overtake Bangui in 2021. Yet they've been dogged by reports of recklessly disregarding human rights and civilian welfare. A 2023 investigation from the U.S.-based watchdog group The Sentry found that mercenaries train the army on torture tactics and as part of the fight against armed groups opposed to the government had carried out killings, torture and rape.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-african-republic-soldiers-kidnapped-by-mercenaries-advocates-allege-/7976454.html	2025-02-15T13:55:16-08:00	
US braces for flooding; parts of California face mudslides	SIERRA MADRE, CALIFORNIA — Much of the Eastern United States braced for a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with thunderstorms and melting snow combining to pound the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. The lower Mississippi valley was facing the threat of strong tornadoes. Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and residents were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to eight inches of rain. 'This may be a major, potentially historic, flash flood event,' the NWS said. Heavy snow, meanwhile, was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible, the NWS said. In northern New York, heavy mixed precipitation is expected throughout the weekend. Weather forecasters said residents should expect snow, sleet and ice accumulations of six to 13 inches and wind gusts as high as 72 kilometers per hour (45 miles per hour) late Saturday and Sunday. 'Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice and strong winds. Travel could be very difficult to nearly impossible, the NWS said. California struggles with mudslides In Southern California on Friday, a mountain community near the Eaton Fire burn scar dug out of roads submerged in sludge after the strongest storm of the year swept through the area, unleashing debris flows and muddy messes in several neighborhoods recently torched by wildfires. Dry weather returned to the region but the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued Friday since dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in scorched areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers on Friday were cleaning up the mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. Sierra Madre officials issued evacuation orders for areas affected by the Eaton Fire, warning that fire, police and public works personnel would not enter areas experiencing active mud and debris flows and anyone who remained in a home under evacuation orders would need to shelter in place until areas are deemed safe for city personnel to enter. Residents of the city also had to evacuate during the Eaton Fire, which destroyed 15 homes in the community. In Pacific Palisades on Friday, some residents washed their mud-covered driveways and bulldozers worked to clear mud-coated roads not far from where, just weeks ago, officials moved abandoned cars after people fleeing last month's wildfires got stuck in traffic and fled on foot. Southern California reported 2.5 to 7 centimeters (1 to 3 inches) of rain in coastal areas and valleys and 7.6 to 15.2 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) across the coastal slopes Thursday, said Mike Wofford, a meteorologist with the weather service. The precipitation was badly needed, as much of Southern California remains in extreme or severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. In neighboring Nevada, the weather service said it recorded a measurable amount of rain in Las Vegas, ending a streak of 214 days without precipitation. A storm in the Sierra Nevada mountains dumped 1.8 meters (6 feet) of snow over 36 hours. Two ski patrol staff from Mammoth Mountain were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. More winter weather descending Meteorologists warn that the U.S. is about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains on Saturday and then stick around all next week. In Denver, Colorado, where temperatures are expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) over the weekend, the city has extended its cold weather shelters for those living on the streets. The Denver Coliseum — an arena with some 10,000 seats — will be opened Saturday for additional space, while a free bus will loop between the shelters across the city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-braces-for-flooding-parts-of-california-face-mudslides-/7976445.html	2025-02-15T12:57:47-08:00	
Carafano: 'A free, independent Ukraine is in America's best interest'	WASHINGTON — James Carafano, senior counselor to the president and national security expert at The Heritage Foundation, responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, spoke with VOA's Ukraine Service about the Trump administration's goals and considerations in the negotiation process to achieve peace in Ukraine. He explained that while not a vital interest, a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself is in America's best interests, and he outlined how to achieve this goal. Voice of America: How do you and The Heritage Foundation see ending the war in Ukraine, and what is the strategy behind it? James Carafano, The Heritage Foundation: It is in America's best interest that there be a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself. And the reason for that is the United States. The United States is a global power with global interests and global responsibilities. A peaceful Europe, whole, free and at peace, that is a vital American interest. The transit Atlantic community is important to us. And the number one threat, physical threat to that is the destabilizing actions of Russia. And the most concerning and destabilizing action is the security of the Eastern front of NATO and Ukraine, that is free and independent, that can defend itself is an obstacle to the Russians, whether it's in NATO or not. Now, to be honest, it's not a vital interest in the United States. For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine's occupied by Russia. Now having said that, are we way better off? I mean, way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is 'absolutely.' At this point, what is in America's interest is that the war stops and that there is a ceasefire that is both from a strategic perspective to preserve Ukraine, and that we have to be realistic about Ukraine's capacity to recover territory that's been occupied. But also from a humanitarian perspective, and I think this is very deeply reflected in our president. More Ukrainians dying is never going to reconquer all of Ukrainian territory. A war of attrition is never going to create a stronger Ukraine. I think everybody is focused on what the deal looks like. I think the deals are relevant. Stopping the war is the objective. The real question is, what do we do the day after the war to ensure there's a free and independent Ukraine in the future? VOA: The defense secretary said we don't want Minsk 3.0. Are we falling into the trap of Munich 2.0, where we appease the dictator, give away territories, embolden the aggressor, and end up in a world war? Carafano: I don't think that's the peace that the U.S. envisions. So, I'll tell you what appeasement would be. Appeasement would be giving the Russians something at the negotiating table that they didn't win on the battlefield. That's appeasement. Recognizing that the Russians have territory they have and the inability of the Ukraine [forces] to retake that territory — maybe they trade territory, I don't know — that's called being realistic. VOA: If Russia is allowed to keep its spoils of war, what message would it send to other would-be aggressors? Carafano: That Russia has failed. Russia's goal was to conquer and destroy Ukraine. It failed. Russia's goal was to have NATO fall apart. It failed. If Russia is stopped in Ukraine, and look what they have achieved, they've achieved some marginal territorial gains at the cost of destroying the Russian army, crippling the Russian economy, and making themselves a global pariah. If that's a victory, it's a kind of really weird Pyrrhic victory. VOA: Then, why would [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth articulate these concessions? Carafano: They're not concessions. They are statements of reality. We all know it's true. If you give Putin something at the negotiation table that he wasn't able to take on the battlefield, that is a concession. So, if for example you said, Ukraine has to give up the sovereignty of its territory even its occupied territory, I would say that's a really bad deal. That's a concession. We have never ever forced any country to actually give up the sovereignty of its territory.' VOA: What about [Ukraine`s membership] in NATO? Here is a counterargument: Why Russia should have a veto power over NATO? Carafano: First of all, Hegseth has never said Russia should have a veto power over the entry of Ukraine into NATO. Hegseth has said, 'This is not going to be part of the negotiation and Ukraine is not going to get into NATO now.' That's no different from the Biden policy and that's actually just a reflection of reality. NATO is a consensus organization. Every member has to agree. Every member does not agree. So, we all know, the Russians know, we know, everybody in NATO knows, Ukraine is not going to get NATO membership now.' VOA: What about the future? Carafano: He didn't say that Ukraine shouldn't join NATO in the future. He just said that NATO membership is not going to be part of the negotiation. VOA: So, the main issue here is security guarantees. Carafano: That's also wrong. Somehow that we're going to say something that's going deter Putin in the future. That's nonsense and ridiculous. What's going to deter Putin in the future is, does Ukraine have the capacity to defend itself? VOA: So how do we deter the Russians? Carafano: We have a Ukraine as a country that can defend itself and that is free, and its economy grows, and it builds a defense industrial base. And we strengthen NATO because that will equally deter the Russians. And we do the other things, which by the way Donald Trump is going to do already, whether there's a peace deal or not. Donald Trump is going to put a lot of pressure on the Russians. He's going to lower the price of oil. He's going to increase sanctions. He's going to [do] a lot of things that are going to hamstring the Russian economy. Russia is going to be weaker. He's going to do a lot of things to go after the Iranians. So, the Iranians are going to have a lot less capacity to support the Russians. He's going to do a lot of things to put a lot of pressure on the Chinese. The Chinese are going to be less able to support the Russians. Donald Trump can do a lot to North Korea. Regardless of what happens in the actual peace deal in Ukraine, Trump is going to do a lot to the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans and the Iranians that really diminishes their capacity to sustain this war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/carafano-a-free-independent-ukraine-is-in-america-s-best-interest-/7976425.html	2025-02-15T12:39:11-08:00	
US citizen detained in Russia, accused of drug smuggling	MOSCOW — A Moscow court has ordered a U.S. citizen suspected of drug smuggling held in pre-trial detention for 30 days, the Moscow courts press service said Saturday, days after a Moscow-Washington prisoner swap that the White House called a diplomatic thaw and a step toward ending the fighting in Ukraine. The U.S. citizen, whom Saturday's statement named as Kalob Wayne Byers, was detained after airport customs officials found cannabis-laced marmalade in his baggage. Russian police said the 28-year-old American had attempted to smuggle a 'significant amount' of drugs into the country, the Interfax agency reported, citing Russia's Federal Customs Service. The agency said the American was detained at Moscow's Vnukovo airport after flying in from Istanbul on February 7. Mash, a Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services, said the U.S. citizen faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department. The Washington-Moscow prisoner exchange this month saw Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the United States, returned to Russia in exchange for American Marc Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania who was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a school. Fogel had been serving a 14-year sentence for having what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. President Joe Biden's administration designated Fogel as wrongfully detained in December. President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S. policy toward Ukraine, saying he and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict following a lengthy direct phone call.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-citizen-detained-in-russia-accused-of-drug-smuggling-/7976409.html	2025-02-15T11:44:02-08:00	
US counterterror official warns of growing global threat	WASHINGTON — A senior U.S. counterterrorism official is cautioning that the threat from global jihadists has expanded significantly, although the resources to counter them have declined. Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Donald Trump and senior director for counterterrorism, on Feb. 11 told a Washington conference organized by the American Foreign Policy Council that he based the current threat assessment on several factors. 'Number one, jihadist groups are more geographically dispersed than ever before, with networks extending across the Sahel, Central and East Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia,' he said. 'To cite just one example, West African countries like Benin and Togo, that once had little exposure to jihadi threats, are now seeing jihadi Sunni actors in their territory and elsewhere, affecting their national sovereignty.' Benin and Togo have reported attacks by al-Qaida, an expansion of the violence the terror group is carrying out in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. Gorka said militant groups are increasingly capable and using new forms of technology to execute their deadly missions. Gorka said that militants 'remain highly adaptive entities.' 'If you look at their use of social media, especially encrypted apps to communicate, these individuals have acclimatized to the new technological environment,' he said. One of Trump’s main campaign promises in last year’s election was to tighten security along the U.S. border and deport migrants without legal status. He signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the border. Gorka argued that border vulnerabilities give militants an advantage. 'The global jihadi actors are poised to capitalize on global security vulnerabilities, especially the fact that, for four years, we have had no southern border,' Gorka said. Former President Joe Biden defended his immigration policies during the 2024 presidential election campaign and blamed the Republicans for walking back on a bipartisan immigration bill. Biden said Trump was involved in sinking the bill. The Middle East Gorka said militant groups in the Middle East, including Hezbollah and Hamas, which the United States, Britain and other Western nations have designated as terrorist groups, have been severely marginalized. 'Let's just be blunt — since the heinous, tragic massacre of more Jews than have ever been killed since the end of the Shoah [Holocaust] in 1945, since Oct. 7, our friends in Israel have literally redrawn the map of the region,' he said. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. 'As a result, groups like Hezbollah and Hamas have been radically degraded,' Gorka said. This has paved the way for what? The collapse of the [Bashar al-] Assad regime in Syria, which together represent devastating blows to the greatest global sponsor of terrorism as a nation-state — Iran's capability to hurt our interests and the interests of our friends and partners.' US airstrikes in Somalia Gorka also gave more details about the airstrikes on Feb. 1 that targeted Islamic State group militants in Somalia’s northeastern region of Puntland. The strikes were carried out by the U.S. Africa Command and authorized by Trump and coordinated with Somalia. 'We told the president, ‘There is a cave complex in northern Somalia full of ISIS,' he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. 'We have been surveilling it for years, but the last administration refused to take action.' According to the Africa Command, 14 militants were killed, including Ahmed Maeleninine, who was described as a 'recruiter, financier and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe.' Somali officials said he is from Oman, although the U.S. has not commented on his nationality. 'The person you saw in the footage is not just a foot soldier,' Gorka said as video of the airstrike was played. 'He is a recruiter, trainer and financier for ISIS, one of the guys who is hard to replace. We had been surveilling him for months.' The strikes were carried out by fighter jets launched from the USS Harry S. Truman, which was in the Red Sea at the time. Trump confirmed ordering a precision military airstrikes on the same day. Somali forces in Puntland this week reported success against the militants. Scores were killed after Puntland forces repelled a complex attack from the militants in the early hours of Feb. 11. The U.S. has been training elite Somali forces known as Danab, which means 'lightning.' So far, there has been no publicly known change of US security support to Somalia.

Stars galore celebrate 'Saturday Night Live' in concert	NEW YORK — By the time Cher sang 'If I Could Turn Back Time,' it seemed as if time had indeed been turned back and every single 'Saturday Night Live' musical guest of 50 years had magically found their way to Radio City Music Hall. Of course, it was only a smattering. But 'SNL50: The Homecoming Concert' boasted an epic lineup. It was an evening of memorable solo performances and often fascinating, one-time-only collaborations. The concert, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, was only one element of what has become an enormous celebration of the show’s 50 years in existence, leading up to Sunday’s 'SNL50: The Anniversary Special,' live from Studio 8H. But Friday night was all about music. Return of the 1990s If a decade can win the night, let’s hear it for the 1990s. A classic performance from that decade was most likely to get the Radio City audience on its feet, singing along and pulling out their phones to record. The Backstreet Boys proved irresistible when they broke into 'I Want it That Way.' Snoop Dogg may have sung 'Gin and Juice,' but he was trailed by enough smoke to give nearby audience members a contact high. Wearing a gigantic coat befitting a winter night, Lauryn Hill commanded the stage with Wyclef Jean, and the crowd melted at the first notes of 'Killing Me Softly.' Some comics can do music Naturally, some former 'SNL' cast members reprised old characters, with varying levels of success. The Culps, the stuffy music teachers played by Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer, hit harder and funnier than they ever did on the show. Their attempts at being current were hilarious and they even worked in a few verses of 'Not Like Us,' with a plea for harmony between Kendrick Lamar and Drake. Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell’s 'Lazy Sunday' was welcome, but too short. Lady Gaga was a good sport, replacing Justin Timberlake to sing about a Christmas gift whose title can't be repeated here. But Bill Murray’s lounge singer 'foursome' routine with Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph and Cecily Strong fell a bit flat. They love Michaels 'SNL' creator Lorne Michaels didn’t perform, but he was referred to all night long. 'I love you, Lorne Michaels,' declared Miley Cyrus, dedicating her hit song 'Flowers' to the show's founder. Raitt, finishing 'I Can’t Make You Love Me,' thanked Michaels for having her on the show so many times. 'Let’s give it up for Lorne,' said former cast member Adam Sandler, introducing a collaboration between Post Malone and Nirvana. 'We love you buddy.' And Marcus Mumford, lead singer of the British folk band Mumford & Sons, said he was there to represent Michaels' admirers from across the pond. Creative collaborations The night featured fascinating collaborations that brought together musicians of all kinds. Cyrus teamed with Brittany Howard to sing Queen’s 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love.' Arcade Fire joined with David Byrne, St. Vincent and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to perform David Bowie’s 'Heroes.' Byrne later also collaborated with Robyn, in matching khaki suits, for 'Dancing on My Own' and 'This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody).' And for Raitt's second song, she sat down with Chris Martin, the Coldplay frontman becoming her pianist for 'I Can’t Make You Love Me.' In another collab of sorts, the B-52s were joined on 'Love Shack' by former and current SNL cast members Fred Armisen, Bowen Yang and Sarah Sherman, singing the 'bang bang' lyrics. Lady Gaga collaborated with herself, singing both parts of 'Shallow' and bringing down the house. Most valuable player Questlove is more associated with the 'Tonight' show, but he is proving to be the MVP of these 'Saturday Night Live' anniversary festivities. Not only did the drummer produce the splendid documentary on the 'SNL' musical legacy, but he effortlessly kept the beat with The Roots, his legendary hip-hop group and 'Tonight' show house band, as they covered every style imaginable, from Snoop to Eddie Vedder to Brandi Carlile. Byrne bowed in appreciation. A second Nirvana reunion For the second time in as many weeks, the surviving members of Nirvana reunited. Rather than the quartet of women who fronted the band for the Fire Aid concert, Malone took Kurt Cobain’s place Friday. Their version of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was fierce, a reminder of why the song packed such a wallop when it was first heard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stars-galore-celebrate-saturday-night-live-in-concert/7976367.html	2025-02-15T10:42:28-08:00	
G7 ministers link future Russia sanctions to good-faith talks	MUNICH — G7 foreign ministers agreed Saturday to continuing working together to get a strong peace deal for Ukraine with robust security guarantees and linked future sanctions on Russia to good-faith negotiations by Moscow. 'Any new, additional sanctions after February should be linked to whether the Russian Federation enters into real, good-faith efforts to bring an enduring end to the war against Ukraine that provides Ukraine with long-term security and stability as a sovereign, independent country,' the statement, which includes U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, said after a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. The G7, which also includes France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, Britain and the EU, underscored its commitment to help achieve a durable peace and 'the need to develop robust security guarantees to ensure the war will not begin again.' Possible informal Ukraine summit Meanwhile, France is discussing with its allies the possibility of holding an informal meeting among European leaders on Ukraine, although nothing has been decided at this stage, a French presidency official said Saturday. Speaking on a panel at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said that French President Emmanuel Macron had called for a summit of European leaders in Paris. 'President [Donald] Trump has a method of operating, which the Russians call ‘reconnaissance through battle.’ You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position, legitimate tactics. And we need to respond,' Sikorski said. 'And I'm very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris tomorrow, and I expect them to relate to this in a very serious fashion.' The French presidency official said that if there were to be any such summit, it would not be held Sunday. 'I am glad that the Prime Minister @donaldtusk will go on Monday at the invitation of the President @EmmanuelMacron to a meeting of European leaders. We need to show our strength and unity,' Sikorski later said on X, referring to Polish leader Donald Tusk. It was not clear whether the invite would be sent only to European Union member states or more broadly and whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be invited.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-ministers-link-future-russia-sanctions-to-good-faith-talks/7976347.html	2025-02-15T10:16:53-08:00	
New African Union leader elected as two major crises rage	The leaders of Africa Union countries on Saturday chose a new chief for the branch that runs the organization’s daily operations, as conflicts persist in two of the largest three countries on the continent. At their annual summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the organization’s members elected Djibouti Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali Youssouf as the next chair of the African Union Commission in a secret ballot. Youssouf, who celebrated his 60th birthday a week ago, defeated Kenya’s former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and former Foreign Minister of Madagascar Richard Randriamandrato. The selection took several rounds of voting. Youssouf was a close second in the first and second rounds behind Raila. In the following four rounds, Youssouf took the lead until he became the sole candidate in the seventh round, with an unassailable 33 votes needed for victory in the final. He replaces Moussa Faki Mahamat of Chad, who served two terms as AU commissioner. Youssouf, who has been minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Djibouti since 2005, is the longest-serving foreign minister on the continent. All 55 member states, with the exception of six countries that were suspended from membership, are taking part in the summit. An Ethiopian Foreign Ministry source speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service that 29 presidents, three vice presidents, four prime ministers and a king are in attendance. New chief inherits crises The election of the new chief comes as the conflict in Africa’s second-largest country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, escalates following recent territorial gains by M23 rebels. The M23 forces approached the second-biggest city in eastern DRC, Bukavu, two weeks after seizing the main city of Goma. The DRC accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels, although Rwanda denies supporting M23. The continent’s leaders called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, cessation of hostilities and the reopening of main supply routes and Goma airport. Sudan is another major focal point of conflict that leaders are discussing. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who is at the summit, called on warring parties in Sudan to cease hostilities and protect civilians, including humanitarian workers. Guterres appealed for $6 billion to address the needs of about 26 million Sudanese who need emergency assistance. In an interview with VOA Horn of Africa last year, Youssouf vowed to work on 'silencing the guns' on the continent. 'Silencing the gun, you know, preventing conflicts, resolving those wars and internal crises ... that we are faced with already is one of the priorities,' he said. 'Of course, this is something that we need to work on, and I'll make sure that the commission will concentrate on that particular program.' Youssouf also said he will work to reform the organization, recruit the most qualified and skilled Africans, and make excellence, merit and competence the key principle. 'If you have a good staff at the commission, it will be much easier for all of us to implement the reforms that have already been enacted by our leaders,' he said. Meanwhile, Angolan President Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco took the rotating African Union chairmanship, replacing Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ghazouani.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-african-union-leader-elected-as-two-major-crises-rage/7976339.html	2025-02-15T09:57:51-08:00	
Vatican: Pope spent quiet night in hospital, continues drug therapy	ROME — Pope Francis slept well during a quiet first night in the hospital after being admitted with a respiratory tract infection and was up eating and reading Saturday, the Vatican said. Francis, 88, ate breakfast Saturday morning and read the newspapers while continuing his drug therapy, spokesperson Matteo Bruni said. The Argentine pope was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. It was his fourth hospitalization since his 2013 election and raised questions about his increasingly precarious health. Preliminary tests showed he had a respiratory tract infection and a slight fever. The Vatican canceled his audiences through Monday at least. Francis, who is prone to respiratory infections in winter, was diagnosed with bronchitis Feb. 6 but had continued to hold daily audiences in his Vatican hotel suite. He had presided at an outdoor Mass last weekend and attended his general audience Wednesday. But he has been handing off his speeches for an aide to read aloud, saying he was having trouble breathing. Francis had part of one lung removed as a young man and has battled other health problems. He had 33 centimeters of his large intestine removed in 2021 because of a narrowing of the colon. He had further abdominal surgery in 2023 to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair a hernia. He uses a wheelchair, walker or cane when moving around his apartment and recently fell twice, hurting his arm and chin. Francis is being treated at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital, where popes have a private suite on the 10th floor. He revealed that during a 2023 hospitalization, he was diagnosed with 'an acute and strong pneumonia, in the lower part of the lungs.' Sometimes bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs’ air sacs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-pope-spent-quiet-night-in-hospital-continues-drug-therapy/7976297.html	2025-02-15T09:09:14-08:00	
Iran orders probe into killing of university student during robbery	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran’s vice president ordered a probe Saturday into the killing of a university student after a protest at Tehran University, state media reported. A report by the official IRNA news agency said First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref ordered security officials to probe the case 'immediately.' The move came a day after angry students gathered in protest at a Tehran University dormitory seeking more safety measures. The protest briefly turned violent, and police deployed forces to the gate of the dorm, according to videos on social media. The Associated Press could not independently verify the footage. Protesters, chanting 'Shame on you,' demanded more safety measures at the dorm and its neighborhood, complaining about occasional robberies. On Wednesday, 19-year-old business administration student Amir Mohammad Khaleghi was stabbed by two unknown robbers who stole his backpack in front of the dorm. Khaleghi died in the hospital. Peace returned to the dorm late Friday after authorities vowed to pursue the case with a 'special' order. Although the protest was not politically motivated, such events can ignite unrest as Iranian people under U.S. economic sanctions are dealing with the high price of meeting their daily needs, as well as widespread mismanagement. Iranian universities have a history of protest over the past decades. Most recently, in 2022, universities were major sites of protest over the death of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after she was detained by the morality police for allegedly not wearing the Muslim headscarf correctly. The protests that followed Amini’s death started first with the chant 'Woman, Life, Freedom.' However, the protesters’ cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against the incumbent theocracy. The monthslong nationwide protests, which shook the establishment, ended in early 2023 after a security crackdown during which more than 500 people were killed and over 22,000 detained. In 1999, student protests in Tehran over the government’s closing of a reformist newspaper and a subsequent security force crackdown saw several people killed, hundreds wounded and more arrested.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-orders-probe-into-killing-of-university-student-during-robbery/7976244.html	2025-02-15T08:06:19-08:00	
Chaos, looting break out as rebels push toward major DRC city	GOMA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — Panic swept through eastern Congo’s second-largest city on Saturday as residents fled by the thousands, scrambling to escape the looming advance of Rwanda-backed rebels. Amid chaos and looting, Bukavu braced for what comes next. A day after M23 fighters entered the outskirts of Bukavu — a city of about 1.3 million people that lies 101 kilometers south of rebel-held Goma — some streets were flooded by residents attempting to leave and looters filling flour sacks with what they could find. Most people waited in their home, shocked by what filled the vacuum left by Congolese soldiers who abandoned their posts. 'They set fire to the ammunition they were unable to take with them,' said Alain Iragi, among the residents who fled in search of safety on Saturday. Reports and social media videos showed the region's factories pillaged and prisons emptied while electricity remained on and communication lines open. 'It’s a disgrace. Some citizens have fallen victim to stray bullets. Even some soldiers still present in the city are involved en masse in these cases of looting,' a 25-year-old resident of a neighborhood being looted told The Associated Press. The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, blamed Congolese troops and their allies from local militia and neighboring Burundi for the disorder in Bukavu. 'We call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,' Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance's spokesperson, said in a statement on Saturday. Rebels push south M23, a militia backed by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo’s mineral-rich east. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. While the United Nations and United States consider M23 a rebel group, DRC considers it a terrorist organization. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. Analysts warn that continued instability risks deepening the regional conflict, and several peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community, or SADC, already have been killed since the recent rebel offensive. Congolese authorities and international observers have accused it of sexual violence, forced conscription and summary executions. M23's southward expansion encompasses more territory than rebels had previously seized and poses an unprecedented challenge to the central government in Kinshasa. The rebellion underway has killed at least 2,000 people in eastern Congo and stranded hundreds of thousands of displaced. At least 350,000 internally displaced people are without shelter, the U.N. and Congolese authorities have said. The rebels on Friday also claimed to have seized a second airport in the region, in the town of Kavumu outside Bukavu. The AP could not confirm who was in control of the strategically important airport, which Congolese forces have used to resupply troops and humanitarian groups to import aid. The Congo River Alliance claimed on Saturday that M23 had taken control of the airport to prevent Congolese forces from launch airstrikes against civilians. Government officials and local civil society leaders did not immediately comment, although Congo's Communications Ministry said the rebels had violated ceasefire agreements and attacked Congolese troops working to avoid urban warfare and violence in Bukavu. The reports of looting and disorder come a day after residents told AP that soldiers in Kavumu — the airport town north of Bukavu — had abandoned their positions to head toward the city. The chain of events mirror what transpired last month in the lead-up to the M23's capture of Goma. Congo’s military, despite its size and funding, has long been hindered by shortcomings in training and coordination and recurring reports of corruption. Fears of spreading conflict International leaders are expected to discuss the conflict at the African Union summit in Ethiopia this weekend as DRC President Felix Tshisekedi continues to plead with the international community to intervene to contain the rebels from advancing. However, little progress has been made since the government dismissed a ceasefire that M23 declared last week unilaterally as false. 'Regional escalation must be avoided at all costs,' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Addis Ababa. 'The sovereignty and territorial integrity of [Congo] must be respected.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chaos-looting-break-out-as-rebels-push-toward-major-drc-city/7976234.html	2025-02-15T07:49:52-08:00	
Serbia's striking students, president hold parallel rallies	KRAGUJEVAC, SERBIA — Serbia’s striking students and supporters of populist President Aleksandar Vucic were holding parallel rallies Saturday as both marked the country's Statehood Day with notably contrasting messages. The student-led protest is the latest in a nationwide anti-graft movement that reflects mounting calls for fundamental political changes in the Balkan state, triggered after a concrete canopy on a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad collapsed on Nov. 1, killing 15 people. The rally in the central industrial city of Kragujevac drew tens of thousands of people demanding justice over the accident and respect for the rule of law. The movement has been seeking to root out rampant endemic corruption. Students chose Kragujevac for Saturday's rally because of its history. In 1835, Serbia was still part of the Ottoman Empire, and people in Kragujevac announced a new constitution that sought to limit the powers of the then-rulers. The date is now celebrated as Statehood Day. People from all over the country streamed into Kragujevac for Saturday’s gathering. 'I am here to support this student rebellion, which has grown into a civil rebellion, and to fight for the rule of law and justice in this society, so that Serbia becomes a country where life is dignified,' said a woman from Belgrade who identified herself only by the name Teodora. The students arrived Friday to cheers from the residents. Ahead of the protest, they organized marches in various parts of the country, encouraging people to converge in Kragujevac. Some walked; others ran or cycled. Along their journey, people greeted them with food and refreshments and offered accommodation, many crying and expressing hope for change. The president's rally Meanwhile, in Sremska Mitrovica, a small town northwest of Belgrade, Vucic is expected to recycle a traditional nationalist theme, warning that the West wants to unseat him by force and that this could lead to the breakup of the country. Serbian authorities were set to bus in thousands of supporters from throughout the country as well as neighboring Bosnia. Some opposition activists have said they will try to prevent their arrival. Vucic said on Instagram that his supporters wish to 'defend and save Serbia from those who want to destroy it.' The anti-graft movement is Vucic's biggest challenge in recent years. The president — who has ruled Serbia with a firm grip on power for more than a decade — and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have been previously accused of stifling democratic freedoms, publicly discrediting opponents and rigging elections, according to international vote observers. The canopy disaster, widely believed to have happened due to government corruption, has become a flashpoint for wider discontent with the authoritarian rule, with university students at the forefront of the anti-graft uprising. Their determination, youth and creativity have struck a chord among people widely disillusioned with politicians. Prosecutors have charged 13 people over the canopy fall, and protests have forced the resignation of Serbia’s prime minister. But students have said their protests will continue until their demands for full accountability are met. In the past three months, the president has shifted between accusing the students of working for foreign powers to offering concessions and claiming he has fulfilled each of their demands. But during a trip to the Serb-controlled part of neighboring Bosnia this week, Vucic has reiterated claims about an alleged plot from abroad to overthrow him and his government. The authorities, Vucic said, 'couldn’t believe how much money has been invested to bring down the government in Serbia.' He offered no proof for the claims. Vucic's trip to the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia was apparently designed to stress Serbian unity with the Serbs in Bosnia, where a bid to create a pan-Serb state in the 1990s’ was widely blamed for triggering a bloody war that killed more than 100,000 people killed and displaced millions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-s-striking-students-president-hold-parallel-rallies/7976209.html	2025-02-15T07:31:55-08:00	
US defense secretary's Europe debut irks allies, wins Trump's nod	WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's attention-grabbing overseas debut may have irritated some key Republicans and alienated allies in Europe, where his statements on Ukraine and NATO went down like a lead balloon. But his forceful comments gained him a nod from one key listener: U.S. President Donald Trump. And Hegseth — who on Saturday wraps up a weeklong trip to Belgium, Germany and Poland — delivered a message at the heart of Trump's 'America First' agenda. Speaking at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, Hegseth said that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders was unrealistic, and that the Trump administration does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution to the war triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion. Trump broadly backed Hegseth's remarks on Thursday on NATO membership, saying, 'I think probably that's true,' because, he said, Putin would not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance. 'I thought his comments were good yesterday, and they're probably good today,' Trump said. Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican who leads the Pentagon's main oversight committee in the Senate, had championed Hegseth's nomination throughout a bruising confirmation review in which Democrats united against the nominee and three Republicans joined them, as questions were raised about Hegseth's qualifications, temperament and views about women in combat. Asked whether he spent a lot of political capital getting Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News personality, confirmed, Wicker said: 'I surely did, yes.' Republican Congressman Mike Turner said issues like the future of NATO membership for Ukraine should not be taken off the table. 'We don't need members of the Cabinet, President Trump's Cabinet, to be defining those in the public,' Turner said Friday on CNN. Republican Congressman Don Bacon responded to Hegseth's comments by saying that there should be moral clarity on who started the war. 'There are consequences of rewarding the invader even if its leader foolishly led over 700,000 of its citizens to slaughter,' Bacon said on social media platform X. Uncle Sam or Uncle Sucker? Trump has played down any tensions. On Friday, he said he had not seen Wicker's comments but would reach out to him and Hegseth. 'Roger's a very good friend of mine, and Pete is obviously, he's been doing a great job,' Trump said. Hegseth, in what some analysts saw as walking back his remarks, clarified on Thursday that Trump was the one who would ultimately decide what was on or off the table in the Ukraine talks. Calling Trump the world's best negotiator, Hegseth said it would not be appropriate for him to 'declare what President Trump will do or won't do, what will be in or what will be out.' He also delivered a message that resonates with Trump and his 'America First' agenda: Europe has been taking advantage of the United States. Hegseth spoke about Europe's reliance on costly U.S. military deployments for its defense. Trump has criticized Europe over what he sees as its unfair tariffs against American goods. The United States and European Union have the world's largest commercial relationship, trading $1.55 trillion of goods and services in 2023. Speaking to reporters at NATO headquarters, Hegseth said: 'Make no mistake: President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into 'Uncle Sucker.'' In Trump's first term, NATO was seen as a red line for his Pentagon chiefs. Jim Mattis, his first defense secretary, resigned in part because of Trump's skepticism toward NATO. America's European allies were critical of Hegseth. 'I think that was clumsy. I think that was a mistake,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said, also criticizing Trump. European foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas went further. 'It is appeasement. It has never worked,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-secretary-s-europe-debut-irks-allies-wins-trump-s-nod/7976197.html	2025-02-15T07:06:03-08:00	
Pakistan clashes result in 4 dead soldiers, 15 militants	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan said Saturday that counterterrorism operations in two volatile northwestern districts resulted in the deaths of four soldiers, including an officer, and 15 insurgents during the ensuing clashes. A military statement said the deadly violence erupted when its forces carried out 'intelligence-based' raids on militant locations in Dera Ismail Khan and North Waziristan, which borders Afghanistan. The statement identified the slain militants as 'khwarij,' a term employed by the government for individuals affiliated with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, a globally recognized terrorist organization. Local security sources reported that the soldier fatalities occurred during clashes in the Waziristan area. The official claims about militant casualties could not be verified by independent sources. The TTP did not comment on the reported clashes in the districts, where the militant group routinely attacks security forces and their installations. Pakistan maintains that TTP leaders and fighters use sanctuaries in Afghanistan to orchestrate cross-border terrorism with the help of the neighboring country’s Taliban government, which has not yet received official recognition from any country. The allegations have strained Islamabad's relationship with de facto Afghan leaders in Kabul, who consistently have denied the presence of the TTP or any other foreign terrorist organizations within their territory. 'One of the key issues bedeviling our relations remains the sanctuaries enjoyed by terrorists belonging to the TTP on Afghan territory,' Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told a weekly news conference on Friday. 'We continue to remain engaged with Afghanistan and also make them realize that the long-term potential of the region, the bilateral cooperation and what it can bring for the benefit or welfare of the two countries will remain unmet unless this problem is resolved.' UN backing The latest report by the United Nations Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, released earlier this week, highlights Islamabad’s concerns, stating that the TTP has 'significantly increased' its attacks in Pakistan and from Afghan territory. The report stated that Taliban authorities in Afghanistan 'continued to provide the TTP with logistical and operational space and financial support.' It added that the group 'established new training centers' in the Afghan provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost and Paktika 'while enhancing recruitment within TTP cadres, including from the Afghan Taliban.' The U.N. assessment also emphasized the growing terrorism threat from al-Qaida and the regional Islamic State affiliate operating in Afghanistan since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. 'The Taliban maintained a permissive environment allowing al-Qaida to consolidate, with the presence of safe houses and training camps scattered across Afghanistan,' the report said. It stated that Afghanistan 'remained the main hub' for the regional Islamic State affiliate, known as Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), primarily 'for its recruitment and facilitation.' The spokesperson for the Taliban government dismissed U.N. findings on Friday as 'inaccurate' and contrary to reality. 'The Islamic Emirate [Taliban government] does not allow any foreign, rogue group to operate in Afghanistan, and such groups are not present here,' Zabihullah Mujahid told the local TOLO news channel. 'Unfortunately, some countries and intelligence circles, through organizations like the United Nations and the Security Council, are tarnishing public opinion and waging propaganda and campaigns against Afghanistan,' Mujahid stated, without elaborating.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-clashes-result-in-4-dead-soldiers-15-militants/7976188.html	2025-02-15T06:47:55-08:00	
US Justice Department asks court to dismiss charges against NYC mayor	NEW YORK — The U.S. Justice Department asked a court Friday to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, with a top official from Washington intervening after federal prosecutors in Manhattan rebuffed his demands to drop the case and some quit in protest. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, the department’s second-in-command, and lawyers from the public integrity section and criminal division filed paperwork asking to end the case. They contend that it was marred by appearances of impropriety and that letting it continue would interfere with the mayor’s reelection bid. A judge must still approve the request. The filing came hours after Bove convened a call with the prosecutors in the Justice Department’s public integrity section — which handles corruption cases — and gave them an hour to pick two people to sign onto the motion to dismiss, saying those who did so could be promoted, according to a person familiar with the matter. After prosecutors got off the call with Bove, the consensus among the group was that they would all resign. But a veteran prosecutor stepped up out of concern for the jobs of the younger people in the unit, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the private meeting. The three-page dismissal motion bore Bove's signature and the names of Edward Sullivan, the public integrity section’s senior litigation counsel, and Antoinette Bacon, a supervisory official in the department’s criminal division. No one from the federal prosecutor’s office in Manhattan, which brought the Adams case, signed the document. The move came five days into a showdown between Justice Department leadership in Washington and its Manhattan office, which has long prided itself on its independence as it has taken on Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international terrorism. At least seven prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington quit rather than carry out Bove’s directive to halt the case, including interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon and the acting chief of the public integrity section in Washington. The Justice Department said in its motion to Judge Dale E. Ho that it was seeking to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later. Ho had yet to act on the request as of Friday evening. 'I imagine the judge is going to want to explore what his role is under the rules,' said Joshua Naftalis, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor who is not involved in Adams’ case. 'I would expect the court to either ask the parties to come in person to court or to file papers, or both.' Bove said earlier this week that U.S. President Donald Trump’s permanent, appointed Manhattan U.S. attorney, who has yet to be confirmed by the Senate, can decide whether to refile the charges after the November election. Adams faces a Democratic primary in June, with several challengers lined up. His trial had been on track to be held in the spring. Bove said that continuing the prosecution would interfere with Adams’ ability to govern, posing 'unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies,' the dismissal motion said. Among other things, it said, the case caused Adams to be denied access to sensitive information necessary to help protect the city. Adams pleaded not guilty in September to charges he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor. Although critical in the past, Adams has bonded at times with Trump recently and visited him at his Florida golf club last month. The president has criticized the case against Adams and said he was open to giving the mayor, who was a registered Republican in the 1990s, a pardon. Bove sent a memo Monday directing Sassoon, a Republican, to drop the case. He argued the mayor was needed in Trump’s immigration crackdown and echoed Adams’ claims that the case was retaliation for his criticism of Biden administration immigration policies. Instead of complying, Sassoon resigned Thursday, along with five high-ranking Justice Department officials in Washington. A day earlier, she sent a letter to Trump’s new attorney general, Pam Bondi, asking her to meet and reconsider the directive to drop the case. Sassoon suggested in her letter that Ho 'appears likely to conduct a searching inquiry' as to why the case should be dismissed. She noted that in at least one instance, a judge has rejected such a request as contrary to the public interest. 'A rigorous inquiry here would be consistent with precedent and practice in this and other districts,' she wrote. Seven former Manhattan U.S. attorneys, including James Comey, Geoffrey S. Berman and Mary Jo White, issued a statement lauding Sassoon’s 'commitment to integrity and the rule of law.' On Friday, Hagan Scotten, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan who worked for Sassoon and had a leading role in Adams' case, became the seventh prosecutor to resign — and blasted Bove in the process. Scotten wrote in a resignation letter to Bove that it would take a 'fool' or a 'coward' to meet his demand to drop the charges, 'But it was never going to be me.' He told Bove he was 'entirely in agreement' with Sassoon’s decision. Scotten and other Adams case prosecutors were suspended with pay on Thursday by Bove, who launched a probe of the prosecutors that he said would determine whether they kept their jobs. Scotten is an Army veteran who earned two Bronze medals serving in Iraq as a Special Forces troop commander. He graduated from Harvard Law School at the top of his class in 2010 and clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts. In her letter to Bondi, Sassoon accused Adams’ lawyers of offering what amounted to a 'quid pro quo' — his help on immigration in exchange for dropping the case — when they met with Justice Department officials in Washington last month. Adams' lawyer Alex Spiro said Thursday that the allegation of a quid pro quo was a 'total lie.' 'We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,' Spiro said in an email to reporters. On Friday, Adams added: 'I never offered — nor did anyone offer on my behalf — any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never.' Scotten seconded Sassoon’s objections in his letter, writing: 'No system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives.' The prosecutor, who appeared in court for various hearings in the case, said he was following 'a tradition in public service of resigning in a last-ditch effort to head off a serious mistake.' He said he could see how a president such as Trump, with a background in business and politics, 'might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good, if distasteful, deal.' But he said any prosecutor 'would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-asks-court-to-dismiss-charges-against-nyc-mayor/7976083.html	2025-02-15T03:58:04-08:00	
Zelenskyy calls for creation of ‘Armed Forces of Europe’	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for the creation of a unified European military force, saying the continent must be self-reliant amid a persistent threat from Russia and uncertainty about U.S. support -- a situation he described as 'this new reality.' 'We must build the Armed Forces of Europe so that Europe's future depends only on Europeans and decisions about Europe are made in Europe,' Zelenskyy said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. Amid concerns in Kyiv and Brussels that they could be sidelined in efforts to end Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, resulting in a deal favoring Moscow, he repeated that Ukraine and Europe must be involved in any negotiations. 'Ukraine will never accept deals behind our backs without our involvement,' Zelenskyy said. 'The same rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine -- no decisions about Europe without Europe.' 'We must act as Europe, not as some separate people,' Zelenskyy said. Speaking almost three years after Russia launched the full-scale invasion, he said he would 'not take NATO membership for Ukraine off the table' and said Kyiv would not agree to any ceasefire without real security guarantees. 'If not NATO membership, then conditions to build another NATO in Ukraine,' he said. He questioned the U.S. commitment to Europe, saying: 'Does America need Europe? As a market, yes, as an ally -- I don't know.' Zelenskyy's address came a day after meeting with top U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who stressed the need for a 'durable, lasting peace' in Ukraine in his speech to the conference on Feb. 14. Zelenskyy told Vance that Ukraine wants 'security guarantees' from Washington before any negotiations with Russia on ending almost three years of war. The United States has sent mixed signals on its strategy, sparking worry in Kyiv that Ukraine could be forced into a bad deal that leaves Putin emboldened. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO defense ministers earlier this week that it's 'unrealistic' to expect Ukraine's borders to return to their pre-2014 positions and said NATO membership is not seen by the White House as part of the solution to the conflict. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured territory and says it must receive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent Moscow from attacking again. Speaking in Warsaw on Feb. 14, he again warned that America's European NATO partners would have to do far more for their own defense and to secure a future Ukraine peace. Hegseth also argued that you 'don't have to trust' President Vladimir Putin to negotiate with Russia. Two days earlier U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a 'lengthy and highly productive' phone call with Putin and said they agreed that their teams should begin negotiations immediately. Zelenskyy responded by saying he wouldn't accept any deals made without Ukraine's involvement. Asked in an interview with NBC on Feb. 14 if he believed that Ukraine would be vulnerable in another few years if a ceasefire were reached, Zelenskyy said: 'Yes, I think this can be.' He said Putin wanted to come to the negotiating table not to end the war but to get a cease-fire deal to lift some sanctions on Russia and allow Moscow's military to regroup. 'This is really what he wants. He wants pause, prepare, train, take off some sanctions, because of ceasefire,' Zelenskyy said. Vance, who is representing Trump at the high-profile gathering of world leaders and foreign policy experts, said the United States wants 'the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple years down the road.' There have been a number of 'good conversations' with Ukraine, and more would follow 'in the days, weeks and months to come,' Vance said. Zelenskyy agreed, calling the meeting with Vance 'a good conversation' and said Kyiv wants to work toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine, but added that 'we need real security guarantees.' Some information for this report came from NBC News.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-calls-for-creation-of-armed-forces-of-europe-/7976068.html	2025-02-15T02:38:08-08:00	
No need for one country to control chip industry, Taiwan official says	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — There is no need for one country to control the semiconductor industry, which is complex and needs a division of labor, Taiwan's top technology official said on Saturday after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the island's chip dominance. Trump repeated claims on Thursday that Taiwan had taken the industry and he wanted it back in the United States, saying he aimed to restore U.S. chip manufacturing. Wu Cheng-wen, head of Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council, did not name Trump in a Facebook post but referred to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's comments on Friday that the island would be a reliable partner in the democratic supply chain of the global semiconductor industry. Wu wrote that Taiwan has in recent years often been asked how its semiconductor industry had become an internationally acclaimed benchmark. 'How did we achieve this? Obviously, we did not gain this for no reason from other countries,' he said, recounting how the government developed the sector from the 1970s, including helping found TSMC, now the world's largest contract chipmaker, in 1987. 'This shows that Taiwan has invested half a century of hard work to achieve today's success, and it certainly wasn't something taken easily from other countries.' Each country has its own specialty for chips, from Japan making chemicals and equipment to the United States, which is 'second to none' on the design and application of innovative systems, Wu said. 'The semiconductor industry is highly complex and requires precise specialization and division of labor. Given that each country has its own unique industrial strengths, there is no need for a single nation to fully control or monopolize all technologies globally.' Taiwan is willing to be used as a base to assist 'friendly democratic countries' in playing their appropriate roles in the semiconductor supply chain, Wu said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-need-for-one-country-to-control-chip-industry-taiwan-official-says/7976061.html	2025-02-15T02:11:13-08:00	
Lebanon president vows punishment for attackers of UN peacekeeper	BEIRUT — Lebanese President Joseph Aoun vowed to punish the perpetrators of an attack on a United Nations peacekeeping convoy, with authorities set to hold an emergency meeting Saturday. The U.N. and Lebanese authorities have condemned Friday's attack, which came as Hezbollah supporters for a second night blocked the road to the country's only international airport over a decision barring two Iranian planes from landing there. Aoun 'emphasized that the attackers will receive their punishment' and said 'security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to upset stability and civil peace,' according to a statement from the presidency on X. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has demanded an investigation after one of its vehicles was set on fire during the incident, which wounded Nepalese outgoing deputy force commander Chok Bahadur Dhakal as he was returning home. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam strongly condemned the 'criminal attack' and promised to arrest the perpetrators during a conversation with UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert and UNIFIL Commander General Aroldo Lazaro. Interior Minister Ahmad al-Hajjar has called an emergency security meeting on Saturday at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) and said he visited two injured UNIFIL officers in hospital, emphasizing 'the Lebanese government's rejection of this attack.' The presidency's statement said Aoun had also checked on the deputy commander's condition and emphasized that the incident 'cannot be allowed to be repeated.' Aoun also 'followed up on developments regarding roadblocks, setting fires and riots, and issued directives to the army and security forces to put a stop to these practices,' the statement said, adding that the judiciary 'has begun investigations on the ground.' There was no immediate official comment from Hezbollah. However, the group's ally the Amal movement, led by powerful parliament speaker Nabih Berri, said 'the attack on UNIFIL is an attack on south Lebanon' and that 'blocking roads anywhere is an assault on civil peace.' 'Absolutely unacceptable' The army said Friday that several areas around the airport had seen 'demonstrations marked by acts of vandalism and clashes, including assaults on members of the armed forces and attacks against vehicles.' Videos circulating on social media showed demonstrators, some hooded and carrying Hezbollah flags, attacking a man in military garb and another in civilian clothes near the torched UNIFIL vehicle. U.N. chief Antonio Guterres condemned the incident, a spokesperson said Friday. 'Such attacks are absolutely unacceptable ... The safety and security of UN personnel and property must be respected at all times,' the statement from spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. 'Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law ... and may constitute war crimes,' the statement said, adding that 'UNIFIL must be allowed unrestricted freedom of movement throughout Lebanon in the implementation of its mandated activities.' Israel has repeatedly accused Hezbollah of using Beirut airport to transfer weapons from Iran, claims Hezbollah and Lebanese officials have repeatedly denied. The Iran-backed group has a large popular base in Lebanon, though a year of hostilities with Israel and the ousting of the group's ally Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria have left it weakened. Lebanon's Directorate General of Civil Aviation said Thursday it had 'temporarily rescheduled' some flights, including from Iran, until Feb. 18 as it was implementing 'additional security measures.' The date coincides with the deadline for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from south Lebanon and for Hezbollah to vacate positions there, under a ceasefire deal that began on Nov. 27.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-president-vows-punishment-for-attackers-of-un-peacekeeper/7976054.html	2025-02-15T01:57:07-08:00	
Ukraine would have ‘low chance to survive’ without US support, Zelenskyy says	Ukraine would have a 'very, very difficult' time surviving without U.S. military support to fend off Russia’s invasion, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a interview broadcast the night before he is scheduled to address the Munich Security Conference. 'Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, you know in all the difficult situations, you have a chance,' he told NBC News. 'But we will have low chance -- low chance to survive without support of the United States.' Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine has increased its war production but not enough to make up for what it would lose if it did not have U.S. backing. Zelenskyy on Feb. 14 took part in a day of meetings and news briefings at the Munich Security Conference as efforts to seek a resolution to the war ramp up. The Ukrainian president is scheduled to deliver a speech on diplomacy and prospects for Ukraine's future at the conference on Feb. 15. He will take the spotlight after meeting with top U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who stressed the need for a 'durable, lasting peace' in Ukraine in his speech to the conference on Feb. 14. Zelenskyy told Vance that Ukraine wants 'security guarantees' from Washington before any negotiations with Russia on ending almost three years of war. Zelenskyy said in the interview that he doesn’t want to think about Ukraine not being a strategic partner of the United States because it would damage Ukrainian morale, but added, 'We have to think about it.' The United States has sent mixed signals on its strategy, sparking worry in Kyiv that Ukraine could be forced into a bad deal that leaves Putin emboldened. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO defense ministers earlier this week that it's 'unrealistic' to expect Ukraine's borders to return to their pre-2014 positions and said NATO membership is not seen by the White House as part of the solution to the conflict.

China, Cook Islands sign strategic partnership pact	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China and the Cook Islands on Friday signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement, but the lack of transparency around the details has alarmed New Zealand, the South Pacific state’s closest democratic ally. While details of the agreement remain unclear, public statements from Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown and the islands’ Seabed Minerals Authority signaled that the Cook Islands and China would look to deepen cooperation in areas such as deep-sea mining, infrastructure enhancement, climate resilience, and economic cooperation. The signing of the agreement is part of Brown’s seven-day diplomatic tour to China, during which he visited several Chinese research institutions and met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in the northern city of Harbin. Li said Beijing is willing to 'deepen political mutual trust and expand practical cooperation with the Cook Islands,' while Brown said his country will 'strengthen multilateral coordination on climate change and in other areas, and push for the sustained, in-depth development of the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership.' Analysts say the agreement is Beijing’s latest effort to increase its influence in the Pacific region amid growing tension between some Pacific countries, including the Cook Islands and Kiribati, and such democratic allies as New Zealand and Australia. 'China benefits from friction between longstanding partnerships in the Pacific as it seeks to position itself as an alternative partner,' said Anna Powles, an associate professor in security studies at Massey University in New Zealand. New Zealand has expressed serious concerns about the deal between the Cook Islands and China, criticizing the South Pacific country for lack of transparency and consultation with Wellington over the details. The Cook Islands has a free association agreement with New Zealand, which allows it to manage its foreign affairs while requiring it to consult Wellington on issues related to foreign policy. 'Under our constitutional arrangements, we expect, you know, matters of defense and security to be transparently discussed between partners. That’s all we’re asking for here,' New Zealand’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference Monday. Despite New Zealand’s concerns, Brown has characterized conversations around the deal as 'guided by what is best for the Cook Islands' and said 'there is no need' for Wellington to get involved in the negotiation of the agreement with China. Meanwhile, China said its relationship with the Cook Islands 'does not target any third party, and should not be disrupted or restrained by any third party.' In addition to the lack of transparency and consultation, some experts say the China-Cook Islands agreement could also contain 'dual civil-military use technology and infrastructure.' 'This directly affects New Zealand and Cook Islands’ security and defense,' Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, told VOA in by email. Tensions between Kiribati and democratic allies Tension is also rising between New Zealand and Kiribati, another South Pacific state. After failing to secure a meeting with Kiribati President Taneti Maamau in January, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Wellington would review development funding to Kiribati following the diplomatic snub. 'The lack of political-level contact makes it very difficult for us to agree on joint priorities for our development program and to ensure that it is well targeted and delivers good value for money,' Peters’ office said in a statement issued late last month. In addition to Peters, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles did not secure a meeting with Maamau during a trip to Kiribati last month, but he stuck with the original plan by delivering a patrol boat to the Pacific Island country. Powles in New Zealand said Maamau’s decision not to meet with Peters and Marles may reflect a shift in Kiribati’s diplomatic focus. 'Kiribati’s primary bilateral relationships appear to be Fiji, Nauru, and China, and the lack of engagement with partners such as New Zealand reflects this,' she told VOA by email. Other experts say that while Kiribati and the Cook Islands are not necessarily looking to abandon their partnership with New Zealand, China will be looking to 'capitalize' on recent events. 'China would seek to undermine those relationships and say ‘the West is paternalistic and colonialist and doesn’t genuinely have your interests at heart as China does,’' Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told VOA by phone. Beijing’s attempts to increase diplomatic efforts in the Pacific also come as the United States freezes funding for foreign aid and New Zealand threatens to review development funding for Kiribati. Since most Pacific Island countries rely heavily on foreign aid, Johnson said a potential lack of funding from democratic allies could force countries in the Pacific region to seek support from China. 'China can be responsive when it wants to fill those [funding] gaps,' he said. To counter China’s attempt to increase diplomatic presence in the Pacific region, Parker Novak, a nonresident fellow at the Indo-Pacific Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said democratic countries, including Australia and the United States, should continue to provide support to Pacific Island countries. Australia, the U.S., and other like-minded countries should continue 'to foster positive, consultative relationships that help Pacific Island countries meet their development needs and provide a credible alternative to PRC inducements,' he told VOA by email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-cook-islands-sign-strategic-partnership-pact/7976033.html	2025-02-14T23:51:09-08:00	
Research finds ancient Egyptian mummies smell nice	LONDON — At first whiff, it sounds repulsive: Sniff the essence of an ancient corpse. But researchers who indulged their curiosity in the name of science found that well-preserved Egyptian mummies actually smell pretty good. 'In films and books, terrible things happen to those who smell mummified bodies,' said Cecilia Bembibre, director of research at University College London's Institute for Sustainable Heritage. 'We were surprised at the pleasantness of them.' 'Woody,' 'spicy' and 'sweet' were the leading descriptions from what sounded more like a wine tasting than a mummy-sniffing exercise. Floral notes were also detected, which could be from pine and juniper resins used in embalming. The study published Thursday in the Journal of the American Chemical Society used both chemical analysis and a panel of human sniffers to evaluate the odors from nine mummies as old as 5,000 years that had been either in storage or on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The researchers wanted to systematically study the smell of mummies because it has long been a subject of fascination for the public and researchers alike, said Bembibre, one of the report's authors. Archaeologists, historians, conservators and even fiction writers have devoted pages of their work to the subject — for good reason. Scent was an important consideration in the mummification process that used oils, waxes and balms to preserve the body and its spirit for the afterlife. The practice was largely reserved for pharaohs and nobility, and pleasant smells were associated with purity and deities, while bad odors were signs of corruption and decay. Without sampling the mummies themselves, which would be invasive, researchers from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia were able to measure whether aromas were coming from the archaeological item, pesticides or other products used to conserve the remains, or from deterioration due to mold, bacteria or microorganisms. 'We were quite worried that we might find notes or hints of decaying bodies, which wasn't the case,' said Matija Strlic, a chemistry professor at the University of Ljubljana. 'We were specifically worried that there might be indications of microbial degradation, but that was not the case, which means that the environment in this museum is actually quite good in terms of preservation.' Using technical instruments to measure and quantify air molecules emitted from sarcophagi to determine the state of preservation without touching the mummies 'tells us potentially what social class a mummy was from and and therefore reveals a lot of information about the mummified body that is relevant not just to conservators, but to curators and archeologists as well,' Strlic said. 'We believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections.' Barbara Huber, a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany, who was not involved in the study, said the findings provide crucial data on compounds that could preserve or degrade mummified remains. The information could be used to better protect the ancient bodies for future generations. 'However, the research also underscores a key challenge: The smells detected today are not necessarily those from the time of mummification,' Huber said. 'Over thousands of years, evaporation, oxidation and even storage conditions have significantly altered the original scent profile.' Huber authored a study two years ago that analyzed residue from a jar that had contained mummified organs of a noblewoman to identify embalming ingredients, their origins and what they revealed about trade routes. She then worked with a perfumer to create an interpretation of the embalming scent, known as 'Scent of Eternity,' for an exhibition at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark. Researchers of the current study hope to do something similar, using their findings to develop 'smellscapes' to artificially re-create the scents they detected and enhance the experience for future museumgoers. 'Museums have been called white cubes, where you are prompted to read, to see, to approach everything from a distance with your eyes,' Bembibre said. 'Observing the mummified bodies through a glass case reduces the experience because we don't get to smell them. We don't get to know about the mummification process in an experiential way, which is one of the ways that we understand and engage with the world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/research-finds-ancient-egyptian-mummies-smell-nice/7975974.html	2025-02-14T22:54:04-08:00	
Why is Trump pausing US anti-bribery law?	washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week pausing almost all enforcement of a decades-old U.S. anti-bribery law. The law, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, makes it illegal for both U.S. firms and foreign companies with a U.S. connection to bribe foreign officials. Transparency advocates have credited the U.S. Justice Department's vigorous enforcement of the law over the past two decades with curbing foreign corruption. Critics, including business leaders, however, have long complained that the law puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage in international markets where certain business practices are common. Trump, a longtime critic of the FCPA, voiced those concerns during the Oval Office signing ceremony on Monday. 'It sounds good on paper, but in practicality it's a disaster,' Trump said. 'It means that if an American goes to a foreign country and starts doing business there legally, legitimately or otherwise, it's almost a guaranteed investigation, indictment, and nobody wants to do business with the Americans because of it.' Here is a breakdown of the law and the implications of the executive order for foreign bribery and U.S. business. What is the FCPA? The FCPA is a U.S. law that prohibits companies from providing cash payments or valuable gifts to foreign officials for business advantages. While the law exempts certain 'facilitation payments,' it prohibits the use of third parties to make bribes. The FCPA was enacted in 1977 following post-Watergate investigations that revealed widespread foreign bribery by U.S.-based multinational corporations. Congress, concerned about the impact on U.S. foreign policy and international standing, responded by criminalizing such practices, imposing prison terms and substantial penalties on violators. Though initially focused on American companies, the law's jurisdiction has expanded substantially. It now extends to any foreign business or individual with connections to the U.S. This broad reach enables prosecutors to pursue cases against foreign firms — for example, a Dutch company with a subsidiary based in Ohio accused of paying off Chinese officials through another subsidiary in Thailand. The law has had a significant impact on the development of anti-corruption laws around the world. In 1997, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development used the FCPA as a model for its Anti-Bribery Convention, which now has 46 member countries. While enforcement of FCPA was negligible in the decades following its enactment, the early 2000s marked a significant shift. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the two agencies responsible for enforcing FCPA’s provisions, ramped up enforcement, driven in part by emerging business scandals and new congressional requirements for corporate governance and financial reporting. How has the law been used in recent years? In recent years, U.S. foreign bribery law enforcement has been robust, with the Justice Department and the SEC opening nearly 174 investigations between 2018 and 2021. Last year, the Justice Department alone filed 17 enforcement actions under the law. Latin America has emerged as a particular hot spot for U.S. investigators in recent years. In 2016, two Brazilian companies agreed to pay a combined $3.5 billion after pleading guilty in a sprawling international foreign bribery case. U.S. authorities investigated the case in part because the illicit payments were made through U.S. bank accounts. In 2020, Airbus SE, the European aircraft maker, agreed to pay nearly $4 billion to resolve foreign bribery charges brought in the U.S., Britain and France. Airbus admitted using intermediaries to bribe government officials and airline executives to win lucrative contracts in China and other countries. In January 2024, SAP SE, a German software company with offices in the U.S., agreed to pay $220 million to resolve investigations into bribery payments to South African and Indonesia officials. In December, AAR Corp., an Illinois-based aviation services company, agreed to pay more than $55 million to resolve investigations into bribery payments to government officials in Nepal and South Africa. Several cases have involved India. In November, prosecutors charged three former employees of a Canadian institutional investor in connection with a bribery scheme involving Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and two other executives. Why is Trump pausing FCPA enforcement? Trump, a real estate tycoon-turned-president, has been a vocal critic of the law since well before his first term. In 2012, he called it a 'horrible' and 'ridiculous' statute that impeded U.S. companies’ ability to do business abroad. Despite his criticism, FCPA enforcement actually surged during his first term in office, with 2000 marking a record-breaking year, according to the Morrison Foerster law firm. The executive order frames the pause in enforcement as part of the president's broader agenda to 'advance American economic and national security by eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce abroad.' The order says the FCPA's scope has been 'stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States.' A White House fact sheet on the order released Monday says the 'overenforcement' of the law harms U.S. companies and 'infringes on the President's Article II authority to conduct foreign affairs.' This concern about aggressive enforcement isn't new, said Mike Koehler, a law professor and leading authority on the FCPA, who noted that both Republicans and Democrats have raised similar issues over the past two decades. 'There has been a focus on the quantity of enforcement actions compared to the quality of those enforcement actions,' Koehler told VOA. 'Enforcement has in many cases has gone so far off the rails that this law is being enforced in ways that do put companies at a competitive disadvantage.' Transparency advocates, however, warn that suspending enforcement could deal a significant blow to global anti-bribery efforts. 'This pause will work to the advantage of unscrupulous business actors around the world who until now feared U.S. criminal pursuits,' Transparency International said in a statement calling on other OECD Anti-Bribery Convention members to increase their enforcement following the U.S. shift in policy. What are the implications for investigating foreign bribery? The executive order imposes a six-month freeze on foreign bribery investigations by the Justice Department. Almost all FCPA cases will be suspended while Attorney General Pam Bondi conducts a review and revises enforcement guidelines. The executive order gives Bondi discretion to extend the pause for an additional six months. Bondi, however, has directed federal prosecutors to prioritize FCPA cases involving cartels and transnational criminal organizations. And corporate lawyers were quick to caution clients that the executive order doesn't give them free rein. 'Bribery is still illegal,' attorneys at the Arnold & Porter law firm wrote in an analysis of the executive order. 'The FCPA remains on the books; Congress has not repealed it. And many other state, federal and foreign laws still prohibit bribery.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-is-trump-pausing-us-anti-bribery-law-/7976000.html	2025-02-14T22:52:12-08:00	
Goodyear Blimp at 100: 'Floating piece of Americana' still thrives	DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA — Flying a few hundred feet above the streets and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd. Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie. For some, it's nostalgic. For others, it's a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon. At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday — roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually — to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour. Even though remote camera technologies — drones, mostly — are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2½-mile super speedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event. 'It's great to show the pack racing,' Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday's race. The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It's been at every Daytona 500 since 1962. During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers. Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn't much different than traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph — well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track. 'It's an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,' blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. 'There's nothing like it in the world.' The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp's street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled 'It Was A Good Day.' But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only, even though phones at blimp headquarters — the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio — ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride. As part of the blimp's 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear's airship hangars. It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt. The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps. Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania. But will the blimp survive another 100 years? Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers. But given the blimp's longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come. 'Despite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,' Kervern said. 'It's just an iconic symbol for our nation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/goodyear-blimp-at-100-floating-piece-of-americana-still-thrives-/7974664.html	2025-02-14T22:51:25-08:00	
With doors closed to the US, asylum-seekers turn a new life in Mexico	MEXICO CITY — When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico as she fled Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the United States. But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month, the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans. She decided she would seek protection in Mexico. 'Like almost all Cubans, our objective was to go to the United States,' she said. 'It wasn't in our plans to stay, but now we have to face reality.' Amid a clampdown on asylum under Trump and tightening restrictions in recent years under the Biden administration, Delgado is among a growing number of migrants from across the world to ditch — or at least pause — their ambitions of reaching the U.S., and focus instead on building a life in Mexico. Migrants trying to apply for asylum in Mexico in January more than tripled compared to the monthly average from the previous year, according to an international official with knowledge of the numbers who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. Mexico's refugee agency has not yet published figures for January. 'All of these policies Trump is pushing are leading more people to seek international protection in Mexico,' said Andrés Ramírez, former director of the Mexican Commission for Refugee Aid, which processes asylum cases. Delgado was among hundreds of migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti, Afghanistan and other countries gathering outside the refugee agency in Mexico City after Trump unleashed executive orders last month meant to slash access to asylum and militarize the border. The Associated Press spoke to around a half-dozen people who had asylum appointments in the U.S. through the Biden-era app, CBP One, that Trump canceled on Inauguration Day. They were left stranded on the Mexican side of the border, their dreams of a legal pathway into the U.S. snuffed. Many more said they now intended to seek asylum in Mexico, citing increasingly harsh restrictions in recent years in the U.S. or what they said was anti-immigrant sentiment there. 'Now, it's the Mexican dream,' said a Mexican man helping Haitian friends try to get an appointment this month to apply for asylum in Mexico following the Trump executive orders. Delgado, her partner and many others had put their hopes on pathways opened by the Biden administration to legally seek asylum in the U.S. They said they had no intention of hiring a smuggler to enter the U.S. illegally. They said the risks of returning to Cuba were too great following a government clampdown on protests in recent years. 'Crossing illegally isn't an option for us. We'd rather stay here' in Mexico, Delgado said, adding that if they crossed illegally into the U.S. and were caught 'they'll deport us and they'll send us back to Cuba.' Delgado, who is an architect, and her partner, a doctor, aren't able to work in their fields in Mexico because their training in Cuba is not recognized there, she said. So for now she's washing dishes in a market. Mexico has long opened its doors to refugees and exiles, but asylum applications have soared in recent years, growing from 1,295 in 2013 to a record 140,982 in 2023. That number dipped to 78,975 in 2024, as the CBP One app allowed migrants in southern Mexico to apply for appointments for entry into the U.S. before heading to the northern border. The rise in petitions for asylum in Mexico may not result in an immediate uptick in refugees there as only a couple hundred applications can be processed each day, fueling criticism about Mexico's capacity to take on the burgeoning asylum demand. Amid criticisms over the backlog, President Claudia Sheinbaum has sharply boosted funding for Mexican agencies handling migration and asylum. Venezuelan asylum-seeker Harry Luzardo, 37, said life in Mexico is an improvement after scrambling for years to scrape by in Ecuador and Chile. Ecuador, Chile, Peru and Colombia were once the epicenter of the exodus of 8 million people from Venezuela, fleeing spiraling economic and political crises. But with little international aid and an array of their own economic and security crises, Chile was among countries that began closing their doors to migrants. 'In Chile, you don't receive any kind of support,' Luzardo said, waiting patiently in line earlier this month to make an asylum petition request in Mexico City. 'In Chile, there's nothing for migrants.' Luzardo left Venezuela four years ago, but unable to get legal status to stay and work in Chile, he decided he'd try his luck at reuniting with family in the U.S. Now, with that door closed, Mexico is his plan B. 'For now, I feel good here,' he said. Still, he conceded, he'd rather be in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-doors-closed-to-the-us-asylum-seekers-turn-a-new-life-in-mexico/7974697.html	2025-02-14T22:50:35-08:00

Southern California slammed with debris flows, mudslides	After days of heavy rain, the strongest storm of the year brought dangerous debris flows and rock- and mudslides across Southern California on Friday, including in several areas that last month were ablaze with devastating fires. Some areas in the region received as much as 12 centimeters of rain this week, the National Weather Service said. 'There are plenty of reports of debris flow,' meteorologist Scott Kleebauer of the weather service said Friday. The scorched earth left behind by the fires is now particularly vulnerable to the water-fueled rock- and mudslides, as the vegetation that once anchored the soil was burned away. While this week’s rain is beginning to ease, that does not mean the slides will stop. The drenched soil can continue to move even after the rain subsides. Parts of the iconic Pacific Coast Highway were shut down Thursday because of flooding and mudslides. In Pacific Palisades, a highway intersection was under a meter of sludge. Photographs posted on social media showed parked cars in Pacific Palisades covered in mud up to their windows. Bulldozers have been assigned to the area to clean up the muck. In one harrowing experience Thursday, a member of the Los Angeles Fire Department was driving along the Pacific Coast Highway when a debris flow swept his vehicle into the ocean. Erik Scott, a spokesperson for the fire department, said the driver was able to get out of his vehicle and reportedly suffered only minor injuries. In Sierra Madre, a city of 10,000 that was the site of last month’s Eaton Fire, a boulder-strewn mudslide damaged several homes. 'It happened very quickly but it was very loud, and you could even hear the ground or feel the ground shaking,' Bull Duvall, who has lived in Sierra Madre for 28 years, told The Associated Press. City officials issued an evacuation order warning residents that emergency responders would not enter locations with active mud and debris flows. The National Weather Service confirmed Friday that a weak tornado hit a mobile home community Thursday in Oxnard, California. There were no reports of deaths or injuries at Country Club Mobile Estates, but property damage included ripped roofs and downed power lines. The rain was badly needed in the region, much of which is still suffering from drought. In nearby Nevada, Las Vegas was glad to see rain Thursday, after enduring more than 200 days without precipitation. A National Weather Service Las Vegas post said, 'Las Vegas has officially measured 0.01 inch of rainfall this morning, effectively ending our dry streak of 214 days without measurable rain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/southern-california-slammed-with-debris-flows-mudslides/7975988.html	2025-02-14T18:42:01-08:00	
US deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama	PANAMA CITY, PANAMA — Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from other nations as the Trump administration takes Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the Central American nation's president said Thursday. 'Yesterday a flight from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse nationalities of the world,' President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday in his weekly press briefing. He said there were migrants from China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries, aboard. The president said it was the first of three planned flights that were expected to total about 360 people. 'It's not something massive,' he said. The migrants were expected to be moved to a shelter in Panama's Darien region before being returned to their countries, Mulino said. Asked later Thursday why Panama was acting as a stopover for these deportations, Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Ruiz Hernandez said that it was something the U.S. government had requested. He also said the U.S. government was paying for the repatriations through U.N. immigration agencies. The migrants who arrived Wednesday had been detained after crossing the U.S. border and did not have criminal records, he said. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in Panama. While U.S. President Donald Trump's demands to retake control of the Panama Canal dominated the visit, Mulino also discussed Panama's efforts to slow migration through the Darien Gap and he offered Panama as a bridge to send U.S. deportees back to their countries. Rubio secured agreements on the trip with Guatemala and El Salvador as well, to accept migrants from other nations in what was seen as the laying groundwork for expanding U.S. capacity to speedily deport migrants. Migration through the Darien Gap connecting Panama and Colombia was down about 90% in January compared to the same month a year earlier. Since Mulino entered office last year, Panama has made dozens of deportation flights, most funded by the U.S. government. Ruiz said Thursday that Panama 'has been completely willing to participate and cooperate in this request they have made of us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deports-119-migrants-from-several-nations-to-panama-/7975954.html	2025-02-14T18:00:59-08:00

Helicopter crew might not have heard tower's instructions before crash, say investigators	WASHINGTON — The crew of the Army helicopter that collided in midair with an American Airlines jet near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and also may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers to move behind the plane, investigators said Friday. National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters that the recording from the Black Hawk helicopter cockpit suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew without an understanding of how it should shift position just before the January 29 crash, in which all 67 aboard the two aircraft were killed. 'That transmission was interrupted — it was stepped on,' she said, leaving them unable to hear the words 'pass behind the' because the helicopter's microphone key was pressed at the same moment. The helicopter pilots also may have missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was shifting to a different runway, she said. Homendy said the helicopter was on a check flight that night where the pilot was undergoing an annual test and a test on using night vision goggles. Investigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight. It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the collision, and Homendy warned reporters that many issues were still being investigated. 'We're only a couple weeks out' from the crash, she said. 'We have a lot of work to do.' The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground. William Waldock, professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said stepped-on transmissions — where a pressed microphone key blocks incoming communication — is a well-known problem in aviation. 'It's an old story and it's one of the problems oftentimes with radio communications,' he said. The collision likely occurred at an altitude of about 325 feet, investigators have said, which would put the Black Hawk above its 200-foot limit for that location. Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicated conflicting altitude data, Homendy said, with the helicopter's pilot calling out that they were then at 300 feet, but the instructor pilot saying it was 400 feet, Homendy said. 'We are looking at the possibility there may be bad data,' she said. That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters – one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter's black box captures its radio altitude. The radio altitude at the time of the impact put the Black Hawk at 278 feet, Homendy said. 'But I want to caution, that does not mean that's what the Black Hawk crew was seeing on the barometric altimeters in the cockpit,' she said. Waldock said the helicopter pilots, with their night vision goggles interfering with their peripheral vision, may have wrongly focused on a plane that took off just before the collision. 'If they did indeed lock onto that departing airplane and assume that's the traffic they were supposed to be avoiding, they didn't see the other airplane coming,' he said. The Army has said the Black Hawk crew was highly experienced and accustomed to the crowded skies around the nation's capital.	https://www.voanews.com/a/helicopter-crew-might-not-have-heard-tower-s-instructions-before-crash-say-investigators/7975930.html	2025-02-14T16:39:19-08:00	
Intelligence agencies close in on Islamic State caliph	WASHINGTON — A growing number of countries think they have unmasked the man running the Islamic State terror group’s global operations. A report issued this week by the United Nations Sanctions Monitoring Team, based on U.N. member state intelligence, said there is 'growing confidence' that the IS caliph is Abdul Qadir Mumin, who also heads the terror group’s branch in Somalia. The importance of Mumin to IS’s global operations has not been in doubt. Previous U.N. intelligence reports suggested he had been elevated to lead the Islamic State's general directorate of provinces, essentially giving him control over the group’s African affiliates. But by late last year, officials with U.S. Africa Command told VOA they assessed reports that Mumin was the group’s emir to be credible. That assessment seems to be gaining traction, with many U.N. member states agreeing that IS is trying to adapt to realities on the ground in Iraq and Syria that make moving key officials and functions elsewhere advantageous. 'It may signify a deliberate pivot toward a more decentralized operational structure, further from the core conflict zone,' the report said. Not all countries that contributed intelligence for the report are in agreement. Some remain unconvinced that the terror group, also known as ISIS or Daesh, would readily forsake its core territory in Iraq and Syria. Others question whether IS would allow itself to be led by someone who cannot credibly claim to be descended from the Prophet Muhammad, a criterion applied to past leaders. Survival, however, may be more important. Since the deaths of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019 and his successor in 2022, the terror group has sought to protect its leaders by hiding their identity and by minimizing public appearances. The group has publicly referred to its current leader only by his nom de guerre, as Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, which signifies he has the required lineage. 'Maybe they have now got so used to the fact that the emir, or the caliph, is never seen or heard,' said Edmund Fitton-Brown, a former U.N. counterterrorism official who is a senior adviser for the Counter Extremism Project. 'Maybe they say Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Qurashi is the name we are giving to the caliph,' Fitton-Brown told VOA. 'Nobody will ever know that he's Somali. Nobody will ever hear an African accent. Nobody will ever see an African person.' Already, Abu Hafs has outlasted his direct predecessor, who died after ruling for about six months. And if Abu Hafs is Somalia’s Mumin, he also has managed to survive at least one attempt on his life — a U.S. airstrike in May 2024. This week’s report from the U.N. said that since that strike, Mumin has 'taken measures to limit the group’s exposure to unnecessary external attention.' It also described Mumin’s base of operations, Buur Dhexaad, as a series of caves and defensive structures in the Cal Miskaad range of Somalia’s Golis Mountains, which are thought to provide protection from Western airstrikes. That assumption is being put to the test as Buur Dhexaad appears to be the same area targeted by a new round of U.S. airstrikes earlier this month. U.S. officials said those strikes successfully killed Ahmed Maeleninine, a key external operations leader, and 13 IS operatives. IS-Somalia The U.N. report warned that IS-Somalia, under Mumin’s leadership, has continued to gain influence while strengthening its finances. Intelligence shared from member states indicated IS-Somalia expanded its extortion activities in parts of Somalia under its control and has, in turn, invested the money in improving its military capabilities, including unmanned drones for surveillance and suicide attacks. But the affiliate, which saw its forces surge thanks to an influx of foreign fighters, has seen its growth slow of late. The report said IS-Somalia saw a spike in defections due to 'difficulties in integrating fighters into narrow clan-based structures, cultural barriers and the severity of conditions.' Efforts to intercept would-be foreign fighters before they can reach Somalia also have taken a toll. Syria and Iraq Key members of IS’s leadership may be seeking refuge in Somalia, but there are no indications the terror group has given up its designs on retaking territory in Syria and Iraq. The U.N. report said the terror group still maintains about 1,500 to 3,000 fighters across the two countries, with most operating out of Syria. There are also indications that IS has found ways to take advantage of the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad this past December. Some U.N. member states’ intelligence agencies said some IS operatives leaped into action even as the lead Syrian insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched its assault on the Assad regime. One IS operative, they said, infiltrated the al-Hol displaced-persons camp in northeastern Syria and sneaked out experienced IS fighters by replacing them with teenage boys. The same operative is thought to have reactivated an IS brigade at al-Hol 'tasked with intelligence-gathering, training young people for operations, recruiting and managing funds.' Additionally, the report warned of IS launching increasingly sophisticated attacks against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. IS in Iraq has been weakened by Iraqi counterterrorism pressure, including an operation in August that killed the group’s deputy wali (governor) and 13 other leaders. But the U.N. report said IS 'maintained the ability to operate and replace field commanders.' Afghanistan presence U.N. member states continue to raise concerns about the IS affiliate in Afghanistan, known as IS-Khorasan or ISIS-K. The report called IS-Khorasan 'the most serious threat' to Afghanistan, noting the group’s ability to infiltrate the country’s Taliban rulers and exploit dissatisfaction, especially among poppy farmers and ethnic Tajiks, with the Taliban’s rule. U.N. member states assessed IS has about 4,000 to 6,000 operatives across Afghanistan, and that it is also building capabilities while seeking to bring in more fighters from Central Asia. To make the journey easier, IS-Khorasan set up smuggling routes into Afghanistan through Turkey and through Iran, according to the report. The report noted the ability of IS-Khorasan to reach into Europe and recruit minors. 'The increasing frequency of foiled plots underscored the group’s determination and capacity to conduct attacks of high lethality on European soil, primarily against soft targets and large crowds,' it said. Harun Maruf, Mohamed Olad Hassan and Carla Babb contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/intelligence-agencies-close-in-on-islamic-state-caliph-/7975753.html	2025-02-14T16:03:38-08:00	
Whale swallows, then releases kayaker in Chilean Patagonia	PUNTA ARENAS, CHILE — A humpback whale briefly swallowed a kayaker off Chilean Patagonia before quickly releasing him unharmed. The incident, caught on camera, quickly went viral. Last Saturday, Adrian Simancas was kayaking with his father, Dell, in Bahia El Aguila near the San Isidro Lighthouse in the Strait of Magellan when a humpback whale surfaced, engulfing Adrian and his yellow kayak for a few seconds before letting him go. Dell, just meters away, captured the moment on video. 'Stay calm, stay calm,' he can be heard saying after his son was released from the whale's mouth. 'I thought I was dead,' Adrian told The Associated Press. 'I thought it had eaten me, that it had swallowed me.' He described the 'terror' of those few seconds and explained that his real fear set in only after resurfacing, fearing that the huge animal would hurt his father or that he would perish in the frigid waters. Despite the terrifying experience, Dell remained focused, filming and reassuring his son while grappling with his own worry. 'When I came up and started floating, I was scared that something might happen to my father, too, that we wouldn't reach the shore in time, or that I would get hypothermia,' Adrian said. After a few seconds in the water, Adrian managed to reach his father's kayak and was quickly assisted. Despite the scare, both returned to shore uninjured. Located about 3,000 kilometers (1,600 miles) south of Santiago, Chile's capital, the Strait of Magellan is a major tourist attraction in the Chilean Patagonia, known for adventure activities. Its frigid waters pose a challenge for sailors, swimmers and explorers who attempt to cross it in different ways. Although it's summer in the Southern Hemisphere, temperatures in the region remain cool, with minimums dropping to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) and highs rarely exceeding 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit). While whale attacks on humans are extremely rare in Chilean waters, whale deaths from collisions with cargo ships have increased in recent years, and strandings have become a recurring issue in the last decade.	https://www.voanews.com/a/whale-swallows-then-releases-kayaker-in-chilean-patagonia-/7975746.html	2025-02-14T15:48:35-08:00	
Argentina court issues international arrest warrant for Myanmar military leader	washington — A court in Argentina has issued an international arrest warrant for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmar’s military, for his role in the 2017 genocide against the Rohingya. The court’s decision, announced Thursday, also lists two civilian leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and 22 other military officials. Min Aung Hlaing, who leads Myanmar's military junta after seizing power in a 2021 coup, is at the center of the warrants issued by the court in Buenos Aires. The charges against him include aggravated murder, torture and sexual violence linked to the military’s brutal crackdown on the Rohingya population in Rakhine State, located in western Myanmar bordering with Bangladesh. The Myanmar junta has yet to officially respond to the warrants from the Argentine court. However, in response to VOA's inquiry, junta spokesperson General Zaw Min Tun dismissed Argentina’s legal authority over Myanmar. 'Does Argentina even know Myanmar? The Myanmar government knows Argentina. If Argentina wants to legally criticize Myanmar, it must have judicial authority in the country. I suggest you focus on filling your own vacant judicial positions first,' the spokesperson said in response to a VOA inquiry on the junta’s Viber press group. Since the case was filed in 2019 under the principle of universal jurisdiction, the junta has consistently rejected Argentina’s involvement, maintaining that foreign courts have no authority to prosecute Myanmar’s leaders over the Rohingya issue. The principle of universal jurisdiction allows national courts to prosecute individuals for serious crimes that violate international law. Legal efforts, court decision The Burmese Rohingya Organisation U.K. (BROUK), which filed the initial complaint in 2019, praised the court's ruling as a victory for justice. 'This is a victory for the Rohingya and for international justice,' said Tun Khin, president of BROUK, according to a Friday press statement. 'It shows that no one is above the law, not even the military leaders who have committed genocide.' In 2017, Myanmar’s army launched a brutal offensive against the Muslim Rohingya population in Rakhine State, which is located on the country’s western coast off the Bay of Bengal. The offensive followed attacks on police outposts by insurgent groups. The military’s response involved mass killings, sexual violence and widespread destruction of villages, forcing more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. The United Nations and human rights organizations have described the military’s actions as a genocide. Late last year, the International Criminal Court also issued an arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing for crimes against humanity. While the warrant from Argentina for Min Aung Hlaing is a major development, the court's decision on other leaders has sparked debate. In December 2023, BROUK requested arrest warrants for military officials only, presenting evidence related to their roles in the genocide. No evidence was submitted for Aung San Suu Kyi, who served as state counselor and de facto leader of Myanmar during the 2017 military offensive against the Rohingya, or for former civilian President Htin Kyaw. However, in June 2024, the Argentine prosecutor included them in his request. BROUK then asked the court to reconsider issuing warrants for these civilians, given Burma's political context, but the court dismissed the request. Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned since the military took power in the 2021 coup. Implications of warrant Tomas Quintana, an Argentinian human rights lawyer and former U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar and a key figure in the case, explained the court's stance. 'We felt that at this stage in the investigation, it was not appropriate to seek arrest warrants for civilian leaders like Aung San Suu Kyi,' he told VOA’s Burmese Service in an exclusive interview. 'But the court sided with the prosecutor, deciding to include civilians in the warrants.' Quintana said the ruling was based on legal strategy and evidence available at the time. Aung San Suu Kyi’s role in the genocide is still under investigation by the Argentine court. While the court initially focused on the direct perpetrators of the violence — the military leaders, including Min Aung Hlaing — it later sided with prosecutors to explore the civilian leaders’ responsibility as well. 'This decision marks a shift in international accountability,' Quintana said. 'It is the first time Burma [Myanmar] has been held accountable in a court of law for crimes against the Rohingya.' The investigation, which has spanned four years, was supported by survivor testimonies and documentation from the United Nations Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. The Argentine court’s decision is expected to lead to an Interpol 'red notice,' which would request the detention of Min Aung Hlaing and other Myanmar military leaders worldwide. While the arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing is a significant step, Quintana said there are still challenges ahead. 'Myanmar’s military regime controls the country, so executing these warrants remains difficult,' he said. He called for international cooperation to ensure that officials were held accountable. 'The United Nations and the global community must work together to enforce these decisions.' Despite the setback in including Aung San Suu Kyi in the arrest warrant, the warrants are a powerful symbolic ruling for the Rohingya people, Quintana said, adding that it is also a crucial step in the long process of justice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-court-issues-international-arrest-warrant-for-myanmar-military-leader/7975748.html	2025-02-14T15:38:01-08:00	
M23 rebels advance into eastern DRC's 2nd major city of Bukavu, residents say	GOMA, CONGO — M23 rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo entered the region’s second-largest city of Bukavu on Friday, local and civil society leaders said, the latest ground gained since a major escalation of their yearslong fighting with government forces. The M23 rebels entered the city's Kazingu and Bagira zone and were advancing toward the center of the city of about 1.3 million people, according to Jean Samy, vice president of the civil society in South Kivu. He reported gunfire in parts of the city. Videos posted online appeared to show rebels marching toward the Bagira area. In one of the videos, a voice in the background shouted: 'They are there ... there are many of them.' Hours earlier, the rebels had claimed to have seized a second airport in the region following a dayslong advance, while the U.N. warned that the recent escalation of fighting with government forces has left 350,000 internally displaced people without shelter. Local sources said M23 rebels surrounded the area around Kavumu national airport. They also recounted seeing scores of soldiers fleeing the town as the fighting raged on. The Associated Press could not immediately confirm who was in control of the airport, which is located about 30 kilometers from the city of Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province. Government officials and civil society leaders did not immediately comment. Kavumu airport became a target after the M23 rebels seized the region’s largest city of Goma, including the international airport there, in late January. Goma is a critical trade and humanitarian hub that hosted many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced in the conflict, the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said on social media platform X that the rebels took over Kavumu airport and its surroundings to 'eliminate the threat at the source.' 'The airport posed a danger to the civilian population,' he said. Congo's Communication Ministry issued a statement criticizing the rebels for violating a ceasefire that regional leaders have called for. The rebels were 'imposing an urban war by attacking the positions of the FARDC [Congolese military], who are keen to avoid bloodshed in Bukavu,' the ministry said. The crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the DRC, continues to escalate, with tensions involving the Congolese government and the M23 rebel group. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. Analysts warn that continued instability risks deepening the regional conflict. Several peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community already have been killed since the recent rebel offensive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-rebels-advance-into-eastern-drc-s-2nd-major-city-of-bukavu-residents-say-/7975711.html	2025-02-14T15:10:14-08:00

New York City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail	NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal immigration officials to operate at the city's Rikers Island jail following a meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump's border czar. Adams said he will issue an executive order reestablishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the nation's largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under prior administrations. The Democrat said ICE agents would be focused on assisting the corrections department's intelligence bureau in criminal investigations, particularly those focused on violent criminals and gangs. 'As I have always said, immigrants have been crucial in building our city and will continue to be key to our future success, but we must fix our long-broken immigration system,' Adams said in a statement. 'That is why I have been clear that I want to work with the new federal administration, not war with them, to find common ground and make better the lives of New Yorkers.' Opponents dismissed the move as a 'needless concession' and 'legally dubious.' 'ICE's presence on Rikers serves no legitimate purpose and opens the door to unlawful collusion between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials in violation of our city's well-established sanctuary protections,' Zach Ahmad, senior policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said. Trump's border czar, Thomas Homan, argued that having an ICE presence at local jails is crucial to removing violent criminals who have entered the country illegally. 'For the naysayers, the city council who wants nothing to do with ICE, they need to understand: If we arrest the bad guy at Rikers Island, then the alien's safe, the officer's safe, the community's safe,' he said in an interview with NewsMax after the meeting. Troubled relationship Homan met with Adams at a federal office building in Manhattan as the Republican administration pushes for more help detaining and deporting people accused of crimes. ICE has long had a contentious relationship with New York, which has rules and laws limiting police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Immigration officials, for example, aren't able to request that city jails hold people wanted for civil immigration law violations past when they would ordinarily be released from custody, under city policy. New York City also has passed measures that curtail ICE's access to public schools and other city properties. Adams, who faces a Democratic primary in June, has said he favors loosening these so-called sanctuary policies, but he doesn't have the broad power to do so as mayor. Adams said he talked with Homan about ways to embed more New York police detectives into federal task forces focused on violent gangs and criminal activity, as well as allowing ICE agents to participate in regular meetings with law enforcement agencies in the city. 'We walked away with some real tangible things we can do together, and I'm looking forward to aligning with him and other federal partners to remove dangerous people from our streets,' he said in a radio show interview after the meeting. Mayor under pressure The Democrat is under unique pressure to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. On Monday, the U.S. Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan to dismiss corruption charges against Adams so he could focus on assisting the president's immigration agenda. As of Thursday, the criminal charges remained in place. If the case is ultimately dropped, the Justice Department says it will conduct a review after the November mayoral election to assess whether it should be reinstated. Immigration advocates worry Adams might feel pressure from the Trump administration to disregard or rescind some of the city's sanctuary protections, which come from a patchwork of state and city laws and mayoral executive orders, some stretching back decades. Adams has already ordered city officials to lawfully cooperate with Trump's agenda around immigration and other issues, though the administration's instructions have sparked confusion among some city workers and contractors. Adams confirmed later that he also discussed with Homan restoring more than $80 million meant to defray the city's costs for sheltering homeless migrants that the Federal Emergency Management Agency unexpectedly clawed back Wednesday. 'I'm not happy about losing $80 million, and we had a conversation on that,' he said during a local television interview. The Adams administration has leased several hotels and vacant buildings and repurposed them as migrant shelters as the city has tried to house an estimated 230,000 people who have arrived from the U.S. southern border in recent years. Adams reflects on challenges In a local radio interview after the meeting, Adams also reflected on the week's turn of events with a mix of relief and defiance. 'I did nothing wrong. No American should endure what I had to endure,' he said on WABC, referring to the 'humiliation and embarrassment' of the monthslong federal corruption probe. As he gears up for a bruising primary fight, Adams said he wants New Yorkers to see his resiliency. 'We've all gone through some hard times,' he said. 'No matter what you're going through, have faith in yourself, faith in God, faith in your family, faith in your country, and you will navigate through it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-city-mayor-to-allow-ice-agents-at-rikers-jail-/7975704.html	2025-02-14T14:56:04-08:00	
HHS to lose thousands of workers under probationary job cuts	U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday under the Trump administration’s move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting. In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some probationary staff with specialized skills might be spared. Probationary staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon, according to audio shared with The Associated Press. Among those being cut are nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — roughly one-tenth of the agency's workforce. The Atlanta-based agency's leadership was notified of the decision Friday morning. The verbal notice came from HHS officials in a meeting with CDC leaders, according to a federal official who was at the meeting. The official was not authorized to discuss it and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Some portion of the affected employees are supposed to receive four weeks paid administrative leave, according to the federal official and the recording. HHS officials did not answer questions about the specifics of the layoffs. In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, the department's director of communications, wrote: 'HHS is following the Administration’s guidance and taking action to support the President’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard.' HHS employs more than 80,000 people and runs 13 supporting agencies. Besides the CDC, they include the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration. The department also provides health coverage for nearly half the country through Medicare and Medicaid. Its staff includes scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials. It oversees research of vaccines, diseases and cures. It regulates the medications found in medicine cabinets and inspects the foods that end up in cupboards. With a $9.2 billion core budget, the CDC is charged with protecting Americans from outbreaks and other public health threats. Before the cuts, the agency had about 13,000 employees, including more than 2,000 staffers working in other countries. Historically CDC has been seen as a global leader on disease control and a reliable source of health information, boasting some of the top experts in the world. The staff is heavy with scientists — 60% have master’s degrees or doctorates. Those being fired included all first-year officers — about 50 in total — in the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, according to two agency employees who communicated with some of the affected staffers. The two spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. The EIS, as it is known, was established in 1951 to recruit young doctors and researchers to join the agency for two-year stints as disease investigators. The laid-off first-year officers represent a little less than half the service's current staff. EIS officers often are sent to different states and countries to become primary investigators of outbreaks and emerging health dangers. Many EIS graduates have gone on to leadership jobs at the CDC and at other public health organizations. It’s not only new employees who are subject to probation. Probationary periods also are applied to veteran staffers who, for example, were recently promoted to a new job in management. The layoffs are part of a broad effort by President Donald Trump and billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk to reduce the number of workers across the entire federal government. The job cuts also came one day after Robert F. Kennedy was sworn in to oversee HHS. Dr. Joshua Barocas, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said many of the probationary-status CDC employees are filling vital roles. 'It’s essentially assuming that they are not in a job that is crucial for the success of keeping everyone safe — just because they’ve been there for less than a year or less than six months,' said Barocas, speaking Friday morning during an Infectious Diseases Society of America call with reporters. In a Thursday interview on Fox News, Kennedy was asked if half the HHS staff would be losing their jobs. 'I don’t know anything about 50% of people being cut,' Kennedy said. 'I would be surprised if there were 50% cuts.' He added: 'If you’ve been involved in good science, you have nothing to worry about. If you care about public health, you have nothing to worry about. If you’re in there working for the pharmaceutical industry, I’d say you should move out and work for the pharmaceutical industry.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hhs-to-lose-thousands-of-workers-under-probationary-job-cuts/7975696.html	2025-02-14T14:23:01-08:00	
Up to 2,000 workers laid off at US Department of Energy, sources say	WASHINGTON — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has laid off about 1,200 to 2,000 workers at the Department of Energy, including employees at a power grid office, the nuclear security administration and the loans office, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. Democratic lawmakers also said the layoffs include workers at national labs, hydroelectric plants and Cold War legacy nuclear sites that pose safety risks. The DOE has about 14,000 federal employees and 95,000 contractors. The layoffs of probationary workers come after three people representing billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at the agency last week. Some 325 workers have been let go from the department's National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the U.S. nuclear weapons fleet and works to secure radiological materials around the world, two of the sources said. But those layoffs at NNSA have been 'partly rescinded' to retain essential nuclear security workers, one of the sources said. It was unclear how many of the 325 firings were rescinded. The DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'It's been chaotic for the staff,' one source at NNSA said. 'We just want to focus on national security stuff, and this has distracted us from our work.' The losses at the NNSA occur at a time when nuclear power plants have been at risk in Russia's war on Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, the largest in Europe. The NNSA is still working to secure radiological materials in the region, one source said. 'Not … in the public interest' A copy of a letter seen by Reuters and sent to some DOE employees says: 'DOE finds that your further employment would not be in the public interest. For this reason, you are being removed from your position with DOE and the federal civil service effective today.' The department withdrew laid off workers' access to government-issued laptops and phones just after midnight Eastern Standard Time on Friday, which left many with no way to receive the notifications and no knowledge they had been fired, one source said. Some 45 workers were let go from the Loan Programs Office, which has hundreds of billions of dollars in loan authority for clean energy, nuclear and clean vehicle projects, one source said. Another seven laid off in the Office of General Counsel had been supporting work in clean energy demonstration projects. In addition, 18 of 148 people were let go at the Grid Deployment Office, which seeks to modernize the power grid, making it resilient to extreme weather and able to transmit power from clean energy and fossil fuel-fired power plants. In Washington state, at least a dozen workers at the Hanford nuclear site — a 1940s site for plutonium and uranium production for atomic bombs, now decommissioned but highly contaminated — were laid off, including safety engineers who clean up and monitor the site, according to Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington. 'These reckless firings will slow down critical cleanup work and make workers less safe. Trying to run Hanford with a skeleton crew is a recipe for disaster that could have irreversible impacts,' she said. 'These layoffs will hurt companies, workers and their families across Eastern Washington.' Murray said there were layoffs at other DOE-run facilities in the Pacific Northwest, including the Bonneville Power Administration hydroelectric facility and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which carries out research on everything from nuclear energy to battery storage. Murray's office reported layoffs of more than 600 electricians, scientists and cybersecurity experts at BPA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/up-to-2-000-workers-laid-off-at-us-department-of-energy-sources-say-/7975631.html	2025-02-14T13:29:05-08:00

13 people arrested in Croatia for illegally disposing of hazardous waste	ZAGREB, CROATIA — Thirteen people suspected of illegally importing and disposing of hazardous waste have been arrested in Croatia, the European Union’s law enforcement agency said Friday. The main suspects, two Croatian nationals, are considered high-value targets by Europol, said an agency statement. They are believed to have orchestrated the illegal hazardous waste imports from Italy, Slovenia and Germany to Croatia. Rather than being properly treated, the waste was simply dumped and buried, Europol said. The statement added that at least 35,000 metric tons (38,580 U.S. tons) of waste were illegally disposed of resulting in a profit of at least $4.2 million. The waste was declared as recyclable plastic waste but was 'legally considered dangerous waste,' Europol said. Croatian authorities believe the criminal network also illegally buried and dumped medical waste from Croatian companies, it said. Croatian anti-corruption authorities said in a statement of their own Friday that they have launched an investigation into 10 people and four legal entities suspected of criminal conspiracy, crimes against the environment, tax evasion and money laundering. They said they will seek to keep seven people detained, the state-run HRT television said. The Croatian office tasked with fighting organized crime and corruption said illegal waste disposal has inflicted damage on the environment, including changes in the land configuration that affected plant and tree growth, release of toxic particles in the soil and air, and potential negative effect on people's health. Croatia has suffered 'considerable ecological damage' and still unspecified material damage, the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime said in a statement. Europol said the suspects abused the infrastructures of legal businesses. They would first offer lower prices for disposal and then falsify documentation to transport their cargo to Croatia, allegedly for recycling. Waste trafficking enables criminal networks to obtain huge profits while often causing irreparable damage to the environment, the agency said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-arrested-in-croatia-for-illegally-disposing-of-hazardous-waste/7975458.html	2025-02-14T11:22:43-08:00	
The danger zone: In Colombia’s Catatumbo region, reporting is risky business	WASHINGTON — In a vehicle with his two bodyguards, Cristian Herrera talks about the dangers he faces covering Colombia’s Catatumbo region as he heads to his latest assignment. An independent reporter, Herrera has always worked in this region, the Norte de Santander department. His beat includes coverage of robberies, extortions, kidnappings, corruption, drug trafficking, criminal gangs and illegal armed groups. Since 2014 those assignments have come with a security detail, a necessary addition after constant threats. 'They call me, they send me voice messages, they leave pamphlets or people tell me,' Herrera says. The latest — a voicemail on his phone — said: 'I’m looking for a reporter with a big tongue. We’ll have to cut his tongue.' Often, it is hard to tell who is making the threat. 'We cover so many stories that I don’t know who it is from,' Herrera says. Coverage of the region has always brought risks. As well as illegal armed groups, he tells VOA, 'There is drug trafficking; there are coca crops, coca leaf crops; there are cocaine labs.' Added to those dangers is a flare up in clashes between two rival armed groups: the National Liberation Army and a group known the Central General Staff (Estado Mayor Central-EMC), a group of dissidents from the guerilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The fighting has left more than 56 people dead and more than 54,000 displaced, according to figures released this month by the Norte de Santander government. But just as residents in this region of more than 194,000 need access to news about the fighting, it is becoming harder for media to report safely. The regional media freedom group Fundacion para la Libertad de Prensa, or FLIP, warns that the Catatumbo region conflict silences local reporters. 'The situation in Catatumbo is critical, as it is in the entire department of northern Santander, which unfortunately is becoming the most dangerous place to practice journalism in the country,' Jonathan Bock Ruiz, executive director of FLIP, tells VOA. Few reporters inside the region are able to report about the violence, and for those who live near or in Catatumbo, coverage is extremely dangerous. 'I think as reporters, we are just receiving information of 20% of what is happening,' says Herrera. Journalists 'can't talk about anything' Colombia overall has been improving in media freedom rankings, with a 20-point improvement on the World Press Freedom Index. But it is also still considered one of the riskiest countries for journalists. And one of the most dangerous regions is Catatumbo. Two journalists were killed there last year. On the border with Venezuela, the Catatumbo region is just under 300 kilometers from Cucuta, the capital of Norte de Santander. With numerous national resources and a key coca leaf production region, it has long been a base for criminal groups, paramilitaries and guerrillas. Before FARC demobilized in a peace accord in 2016, militants controlled who gained access. Now things are different. 'You don’t know who’s in charge,' says Herrera. 'There are some organizations that are mixed with migrants who are used as instruments to commit crimes. 'Furthermore, it is an area that has been very abandoned by the state, and so those who exercise control in this region are these illegal armed groups,' he says. Often the safest option is to stay quiet. '[Journalists] can’t talk about the armed conflict, what happens there. They can’t talk about the deaths. They can't talk about drug trafficking. They can't talk about anything,' Herrera tells VOA. 'You have to publish it' Another problem comes from guerrillas or criminal groups that coerce media to serve as spokespersons — and saying 'no' is not an option. 'There is a very serious collective problem, information is used as a weapon of war, as a weapon to make propaganda, to better install the narratives of the different groups, as a way of citizen control,' says Ruiz. Herrera says the media strategy of illegal armed groups is to spread information through social media. 'It happens in El Catatumbo and in Cucuta, illegal armed groups have a digital strategy. They send their messages and start sharing them through social media; they send it to us, and sometimes with threats,' he says. 'They say, ‘You have to publish it,’ and if you say no, they declare you as a military target.' The combination of physical risk, self-censorship and control by armed groups leaves audiences with limited access to independent news. 'This has already happened in the Catatumbo at different times, where community journalists decide to turn off their radio stations. They decide to stop reporting ... where self-protection protocols are not enough to do their work safely with the number of threats and the lack of protection given by the state,' explains Ruiz. In his 20-year career, Herrera has come up against multiple threats, including three kidnap attempts. At times, he left Colombia to ensure his safety. So, security is a priority. 'If I’m going to the Catatumbo, I advise FLIP and my wife, I must check in every two hours, and if five hours pass and I haven’t texted her, something has happened,' he says. Despite the dangers, Herrera said he will not stop reporting. 'All the risks and threats give me more strength to keep going, because that shows that I am doing things right,' he says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-danger-zone-in-colombia-s-catatumbo-region-reporting-is-risky-business/7975256.html	2025-02-14T10:59:54-08:00

IAEA confirms drone attack damaged outer wall of Chernobyl dome	The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Friday that a drone attack damaged an outer wall of the protective dome containing the remains of the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine, starting a fire. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident is considered the worst in history. Ukraine blames Russia for the attack on the site located about 130 kilometers north of Kyiv, which Moscow denies. In a statement on the IAEA website, the agency’s team based at the site reported hearing an explosion at 1:50 a.m. local time. They said smoke and fire were visible from the team’s on-site dormitory. Ukrainian officials informed the team a drone struck the New Safe Confinement (NSC) structure built to prevent a radioactive release from Chernobyl’s damaged reactor and protect it from external hazards. The team reported that firefighters and vehicles arrived at the scene within minutes to begin extinguishing the blaze, which, they said, could be seen intermittently for several hours afterward. The team said it observed a breach in the outer layer of the containment structure caused when the drone exploded on impact. Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory officials Friday confirmed the outer covering of the protective dome sustained damage, and investigations are ongoing to determine the extent of the damage to the interior. The IAEA said radiation levels inside and outside the NSC building remain normal and no casualties were reported. But agency Director-General Rafael Grossi said the incident was 'deeply concerning,' and said it 'underlines the persistent risks to nuclear safety during the military conflict.' An explosion and fire in April 1986, at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant destroyed the reactor building and released large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere. A U.N. report said 31 people died immediately from the explosion, and while the exact number of people who died from subsequent radiation exposure is in dispute, the U.N. reports nearly 8.4 million people in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine were exposed to radiation due to the widespread radioactive fallout. Speaking to reporters Friday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied Russian involvement saying Russia does not conduct strikes on nuclear infrastructure. He called Ukraine’s claim’s 'a provocation.' Fighting around nuclear power plants, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, located near the battle zones in southeastern Ukraine, has repeatedly raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe during three years of war. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-confirms-drone-attack-damaged-outer-wall-of-chernobyl-dome/7975283.html	2025-02-14T09:51:03-08:00	
At Munich Conference, US VP Vance warns European allies of ‘threat from within’	Vice President JD Vance warned European allies attending the security conference in Munich, Germany, against 'the threat from within,' arguing that European governments are exercising extreme censorship and have failed to adequately get a handle on 'out-of-control migration.' 'The threat that I worry the most about vis a vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor,' he said Friday. 'What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.' Vance denounced Romania, a NATO ally, for its recent cancellation of presidential election results over evidence of Russian disinformation. 'If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,' he said. 'I’d ask my European friends to have some perspective.' He also appeared to voice support for right-wing parties that have been banned from joining governments in Europe, saying, 'Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls.' Vance said of all the pressing challenges facing Europe and the U.S. 'there is nothing more pressing than migration.' He blamed the 'series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent and others across the world,' and he highlighted the Thursday attack in Munich where an Afghan national drove a car into a crowd, injuring at least 30 people. The remarks came as a surprise to the audience of leaders and top officials who were expecting Vance to focus on Ukraine and Russia. The vice president only made a passing remark on the issue. The Trump administration is 'very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine,' Vance said. 'And we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense.' Following Vance’s speech, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius rejected Vance’s characterization of European policies. 'If I understand him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regions ... that is not acceptable.' Vance’s remarks are 'an effort to flip the script,' on Europe’s concerns about American democracy, said Kristine Berzina, managing director of GMF Geostrategy North. 'There was shockingly no mention of NATO, no discussion of Ukraine. Instead, it was the presentation of a right-wing vision of democracy days before the German election,' she told VOA. Vance and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio are set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday, on the sidelines of the conference. De-isolating Russia President Donald Trump spoke this week with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin about ending the war in Ukraine, which will mark its three-year anniversary on Feb. 24. Trump said he and the Russian president have 'agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately' to end the war. Speaking to reporters Thursday at the White House, Trump called Kyiv’s NATO membership bid 'impractical' and its desire to win back Russian-occupied territories 'illusionary.' His comments mirror remarks made by his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who said Wednesday at NATO headquarters that it was unrealistic for Ukraine to join NATO — something Zelenskyy argues is central to protecting Ukraine in the long-term, but that Putin has long opposed. Hegseth also called Ukraine's desire to regain territory that it lost to Russia an 'unrealistic objective.' Additionally, Trump said it was a mistake to kick Moscow out of the Group of Seven of industrialized democracies, then known as the G8, following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. 'I'd love to have them back,' Trump said, adding that he and Putin 'agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s nations' and added that they would 'probably' meet in Saudi Arabia in the near future. Russian politicians have welcomed the shift from former President Joe Biden’s policies that aimed to isolate Moscow. 'I am sure that in Kyiv, Brussels, Paris and London they are now reading Trump’s lengthy statement on his conversation with Putin with horror and cannot believe their eyes,' Senior lawmaker Alexei Pushkov wrote on his messaging app Friday. European leaders have said they worry Washington is conceding key agenda items to Putin that would jeopardize Kyiv’s standing toward a potential settlement of the conflict. 'A failed Ukraine would weaken Europe, but it would also weaken the United States,' warned European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke before Vance in Munich. Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Munich, Zelenskyy said his priority is to speak with U.S. and European officials before engaging with the Russians. Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the conference. 'I will be very clear. First, I see the order of meetings and decisions is the United States, Europe then Russia. We’re not against everything but we are supporting this,' Zelenskyy said. Ukraine said that at the Munich meeting, its delegation will present its position on ending the war and explain its vision for achieving a lasting peace. Zelenskyy said that if Trump could bring him and Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer to swap Ukrainian-occupied territory in Russia for Russian-held land in Ukraine. America first The Munich Security Report released ahead of the conference noted that this year’s gathering takes place in the context of an international order that appears to be in flux under Trump’s 'America First' foreign policy. 'Donald Trump’s presidential victory has buried the U.S. post-Cold War foreign policy consensus that a grand strategy of liberal internationalism would best serve U.S. interests,' said the report. It is unclear what the Trump administration’s ultimate strategy is to end the war — a promise the president campaigned on. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Friday ahead of his Munich speech, Vance said Moscow could face more sanctions and even 'military tools' if it refuses to agree a deal ensuring Ukraine's long-term independence. Gaza and the fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas also are likely to be a focus in Munich. Trump recently said that Palestinians should leave Gaza, and the U.S. will take over the enclave — a proposition that several governments have condemned. The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as climate change, energy security and artificial intelligence during the busy three-day conference.

Philippines increases defense efforts amid ongoing tension with China	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — The Philippines is increasing efforts to strengthen defense cooperation with several like-minded democracies amid ongoing tensions with China in the disputed South China Sea. Manila is trying to conclude major defense pacts with Canada and New Zealand and explore possibilities of expanding joint military drills with the United States, its main defense partner. Analysts say the development is part of Manila’s effort to counter China’s aggressive maritime activities near several disputed reefs in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost the entirety as its territory. 'The Philippines is trying to boost their capabilities to sufficiently deter China by putting a lot of emphasis on the Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States while broadening the net of cooperation to other like-minded democracies,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. described the defense pacts with Canada and New Zealand as part of Manila’s efforts to 'build and strengthen' alliances with like-minded countries. 'The status of visiting forces agreement with New Zealand is an important part of … both countries’ and multilateral countries’ initiatives to resist China’s unilateral narrative to change international law,' he told journalists on the sideline of an event on Feb. 6. Meanwhile, the Canadian ambassador to the Philippines, David Hartman, said at a press event on Feb. 7 that the visiting forces agreement would enable Canada to 'have even more substantive participation in joint and multilateral training exercises and operations with the Philippines and allies' in the Indo-Pacific region. Some Philippine analysts describe the signing of the agreements as part of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s efforts to 'reset' the country’s long-term strategic interests. As China continues to challenge different countries’ territorial claims across the Pacific region, 'the Philippines’ efforts to consolidate more agreements with allies fits Manila’s need to defend its maritime territories and safeguard the freedom of navigation in the region,' Joshua Espena, a resident fellow at the Philippine-based International Development and Security Cooperation, told VOA by phone. Since about one-third of global trade passes through the South China Sea, Koh in Singapore said other democratic countries view signing defense agreements with the Philippines as a way to safeguard their strategic and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific region. While the Philippines’ efforts to strengthen defense cooperation with other democracies may not fundamentally change China’s behaviors in the South China Sea, 'it is still a concern for China when you have so many partners being militarily involved with Manila,' Koh told VOA by phone. Apart from negotiating defense pacts with Canada and New Zealand, the Philippines is also looking to expand joint military exercises with the United States. During a call on Tuesday, the Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. and U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown talked about the 'military modernization initiatives, Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement sites and increasing the scope and capacity of joint exercises in the Philippines,' according to U.S. Joint Staff Spokesperson Navy Capt. Jereal Dorsey. In addition to the discussions, the Philippines has conducted a series of joint drills with the U.S. and Canada since last week, a development that China said undermines 'peace and stability in the South China Sea.' While countries around the world are bracing for uncertainties extending from the foreign policy of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, some experts say recent developments suggest the U.S. may continue to uphold its defense partnership with the Philippines. 'The people [that] the Trump administration has put into key security roles are mostly China hawks, so they see the China threat as being very real, and the Philippines remains on the front line [of that threat,]' said Raymond Powell, director of Stanford University’s Sealight project, which tracks Chinese maritime activities across the Indo-Pacific region. He said the Philippines may 'stand to gain' from the Trump administration’s foreign policy direction. Manila 'may have one of the strongest arguments' to convince the U.S. to shift resources to the Indo-Pacific region because 'they are on the front line,' Powell told VOA by phone. As the U.S. and the Philippines continue to uphold their defense cooperation, China has described the partnership as 'extremely dangerous.' 'China will not sit idly by when its security interests are harmed or threatened,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during a regular press conference on Wednesday. To counter the Chinese coast guard’s aggressive operations in the South China Sea, Brawner Jr. said Wednesday that the Philippines hoped to buy two more submarines and BrahMos missiles in India. The Reuters news agency reported that New Delhi is expected to sign a $200 million missile deal with Manila in 2025. Powell said the additional missiles could strengthen the Philippines’ deterrence against China, while Manila may need to put a lot of effort into familiarizing its military forces with the submarines. Despite Philippine President Marcos Jr.’s recent attempt to 'offer a deal' to reduce tension in the South China Sea, Powell said Beijing’s aggressive posture will make it hard for the proposal to materialize. 'We're seeing much heavier [Chinese] Coast Guard and militia activity around Scarborough Shoal, and I don’t see a lessening of tension there,' he said, adding that tensions between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea will likely 'plateau' in the near future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-increases-defense-efforts-amid-ongoing-tension-with-china-/7975137.html	2025-02-14T07:49:26-08:00	
Taiwan pledges chip talks and investment in bid to ease Trump’s concerns	TAIPEI — Taiwan President Lai Ching-te pledged on Friday to talk with the United States about President Donald Trump’s concerns over the chip industry and to increase U.S. investment and buy more from the country, while also spending more on defense. Trump spoke critically about Taiwan on Thursday, saying he aimed to restore U.S. manufacturing of semiconductor chips and repeating claims about Taiwan having taken away the industry he wanted back in the United States. Speaking to reporters after holding a meeting of the National Security Council at the presidential office, Lai said that the global semiconductor supply chain is an ecosystem in which the division of work among various countries is important. 'We of course are aware of President Trump's concerns,' Lai said. 'Taiwan's government will communicate and discuss with the semiconductor industry and come up with good strategies. Then we will come up with good proposals and engage in further discussions with the United States,' he added. Democratic countries including the United States should come together to build a global alliance for AI chips and a 'democratic supply chain' for advanced chips, Lai said. 'While admittedly we have the advantage in semiconductors, we also see it as Taiwan's responsibility to contribute to the prosperity of the international community.' Taiwan is home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, a major supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia, and a crucial part of the developing AI industry. TSMC is investing $65 billion in new factories in the U.S. state of Arizona, a project begun in 2020 under Trump's first administration. TSMC's Taipei-listed shares closed down 2.8% on Friday, underperforming the broader market, which ended off 1.1%. A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity in order to speak more freely, said if TSMC judged it was feasible to increase its U.S. investment, Taiwan's government would help in talks with the United States. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The official added that communications between Taiwan and U.S. economic, security and defense officials at present was 'quite good' and 'strong support from the United States can be felt'. US support The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but is the democratically governed island's most important international backer and arms supplier. Trump cheered Taiwan last week after a joint U.S.-Japan statement following Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's visit to Washington called for 'maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait' and voiced support for 'Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations.' But Taiwan also runs a large trade surplus with the United States, which surged 83% last year, with the island's exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion, driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors. Lai said that the United States is Taiwan's largest foreign investment destination, and that Taiwan is the United States' most reliable trade partner. Trump has also previously criticized Taiwan, which faces a growing military threat from China, for not spending enough on defense, a criticism he has made of many U.S. allies. 'Taiwan must demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves,' Lai said, adding his government is working to propose a special budget this year to boost defense spending from 2.5% of its GDP to 3%. His government is involved in a standoff with parliament, where opposition parties hold a majority, over cuts to the budget, including defense spending. 'Certainly, more and more friends and allies have expressed concern to us, worried whether Taiwan's determination for its self-defense has weakened,' Lai said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-pledges-chip-talks-and-investment-in-bid-to-ease-trump-s-concerns-/7974979.html	2025-02-14T05:50:24-08:00	
Lebanon blocks Iranian passenger flight to Beirut, analysts cite Israeli pressure	Lebanon blocked an Iranian airliner from flying into Beirut Thursday after Israel accused Iran a day earlier of using civilian flights to deliver cash to Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. The chief executive of Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport, Saeed Chalandri, told Iranian state news agency Mehr that the Mahan Air flight to Beirut was canceled before takeoff because Lebanon had not granted it permission to land. In a video posted on X by an Iran-based journalist and deemed credible by VOA Persian, the passengers could be seen waiting in a departure hall designated for religious pilgrims, with one man shouting in frustration at being stuck there. In a Thursday statement published by Lebanon’s National News Agency, Beirut’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation said the government was asking some airlines to 'temporarily reschedule' flights to Lebanon while it implements 'some additional security measures.' The civil aviation office did not immediately respond to a VOA request, emailed Friday, for comment on which airlines had been asked to reschedule and how many flights were affected. The statement said Lebanon also was working with its national carrier, Middle East Airlines, to send a plane to Tehran to bring the stranded passengers home. The moves followed a Wednesday Arabic statement by Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee, accusing Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force of exploiting civilian flights to Beirut airport to smuggle cash to its main proxy, Hezbollah, without oversight by the Lebanese government. Iran’s U.N. Mission in New York did not immediately respond to a VOA request, emailed on Thursday, for comment on the Israeli allegation. Mahan Air is sanctioned by the United States as part of a long-running U.S. effort to target entities that fund and arm Hezbollah. Researcher David Daoud of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies told VOA he has tracked 26 Mahan Air flights from Iran to Beirut since December 1. He said Thursday’s cancelation was the first time Lebanon blocked one the airline’s flights since letting it resume service to Beirut following a November 27 ceasefire in a yearlong conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Hezbollah initiated the conflict with Israel in October 2023 in solidarity with Palestinian terror group Hamas, before agreeing to the ceasefire under pressure from an Israeli offensive that had begun in September 2024 and killed its top leaders. Adraee said Israel provided information to a U.S.-led group monitoring the ceasefire to try to stop Iran flying cash to Hezbollah, which he said already had received some of the funds. But the Israeli military refused to comment on whether it had contacted the ceasefire monitoring group to urge Lebanon to block Thursday’s flight. The ceasefire obliges the Lebanese government to assert sovereignty over the country and prevent Hezbollah and other armed groups from receiving 'arms and related material' through border crossings and attacking Israel. It does not explicitly mention deliveries of cash to Hezbollah. Israel also is obligated to withdraw troops from southern Lebanon as Lebanese government forces deploy in the region. Adraee said the Israeli military 'will not allow [Hezbollah] to build up its forces and will use all available means to enforce the ceasefire understandings and ensure the security of [Israel's] citizens.' It was the strongest statement that Israel has made on Iranian cash deliveries to Hezbollah since the recent conflict began. Daoud said Adraee's warning 'put the Lebanese on notice that the Israelis are watching the Beirut airport and know funds for Hezbollah are coming through these Iranian flights.' 'Suddenly, there is movement at the Beirut airport,' he said, in reference to Lebanese authorities denying landing rights to the Mahan Air flight. 'This is part of a pattern in which the Israelis call out them out, and the Lebanese do something that makes them look like they are acting. But the issue is consistency.' Daoud said Lebanon could demonstrate consistency if it bans Mahan Air from flying to Beirut. Short of that step, he said Lebanon also could subject the airline's passengers and cargo to sustained high scrutiny on arrival. Matthew Levitt, a researcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said in a VOA interview that the Mahan Air flight cancelation is 'welcome news.' 'This is how the Lebanese government will reassert sovereignty over the country, if it continues to move in this direction. And that is not a guarantee,' he said. This article was produced in collaboration with VOA’s Persian service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-blocks-iranian-passenger-flight-to-beirut-analysts-cite-israeli-pressure-/7974835.html	2025-02-14T04:54:07-08:00	
Pope Francis taken to hospital for bronchitis treatment	ROME — Pope Francis was taken to hospital on Friday morning for tests and to continue treatment of his ongoing bronchitis, the Vatican said. 'This morning, at the end of his audiences, Pope Francis was admitted to the Policlinico Agostino Gemelli for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue his treatment for bronchitis, which is still ongoing, in a hospital environment,' it said in a statement. Francis, 88, has been pope since 2013 and has suffered from influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years. Earlier this month, Francis told pilgrims at a weekly audience that he was suffering from a 'strong cold,' which the Vatican later described as bronchitis. The pope has been keeping up his daily schedule of appointments despite his illness, taking meetings at the Vatican residence where he lives. Before going to hospital on Friday, the pope had an official meeting with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Francis suffered two falls recently at his Vatican residence, bruising his chin in December and injuring his arm in January. Rome's Gemelli hospital, the largest in the city, has a special suite for treating popes. Francis spent nine days there in June 2023, when he had surgery to repair an abdominal hernia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-taken-to-hospital-for-bronchitis-treatment/7974812.html	2025-02-14T02:52:02-08:00	
Roadside bomb kills 11 coal miners in southwest Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Authorities in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province said Friday that at least 11 coal mine workers were killed and six injured when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb. The early morning incident occurred near a coal mine in the Harnai district of the insurgency-hit province, which is rich in natural resources. 'The terrorists involved in this incident will be brought to justice soon,' an official statement quoted Provincial Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti as saying. In Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office said he expressed sorrow over the deaths of miners and said his government 'is actively working to eliminate terrorism.' No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing in Balochistan, where ethnic Baloch militants frequently stage insurgent attacks against security forces and workers associated with public and private mining projects. The Baloch Liberation Army, particularly its suicide bomber unit known as the Majeed Brigade, has claimed responsibility for nearly all recent attacks in Balochistan, resulting in the killings of scores of civilians and security forces. At least 18 Pakistani paramilitary troops were killed Jan. 31 when BLA militants assaulted their bus in the province’s Kalat district, marking one of the deadliest days for security forces in recent months. The U.N. Security Council noted in its latest international terror threat assessment report released this week that BLA has been behind 'several high-casualty attacks' in Balochistan. The report quoted two U.N. member states as saying that the 'Majeed Brigade maintained connections with TTP, ISIL-K and ETIM/TIP, including collaborating with the latter in its operational bases in Afghanistan.' TTP stands for Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, a globally designated terrorist group that carries out almost daily attacks in Pakistan, particularly in its northwestern districts near or on the Afghan border. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan, or ISIL-K, is the Afghan branch of the transnational Islamic State terrorist network. The East Turkestan Islamic Movement, or ETIM, is an anti-China militant group operating from sanctuaries in Afghanistan. Balochistan is on Pakistan’s borders with Iran and Afghanistan and has experienced years of attacks attributed to BLA, TTP, and Islamic State loyalists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/roadside-bomb-kills-11-coal-miners-in-southwest-pakistan/7974788.html	2025-02-14T01:22:55-08:00	
Russian drone attack damages Chernobyl nuclear plant's shelter, Zelenskyy says	KYIV, UKRAINE — A Russian drone attack caused significant damage to the radiation shelter of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant overnight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday. Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst civil nuclear catastrophe when one of its four reactors exploded in 1986. That reactor is now enveloped by a protective shelter, known as a sarcophagus, to contain the lingering radiation. The Russian drone struck the shelter of the destroyed power unit at the plant, causing a fire that has since been extinguished, he said. 'As of now, radiation levels have not increased and are being constantly monitored,' Zelenskyy said, adding that an initial assessment had found significant damage. 'The only country in the world that attacks such sites, occupies nuclear power plants, and wages war without any regard for the consequences is today’s Russia,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-damages-chornobyl-nuclear-plant-s-shelter-zelenskyy-says/7974778.html	2025-02-14T00:31:43-08:00	
Hamas expected to name 3 Israeli hostages for release this weekend	The militant group Hamas is expected to release the names of three hostages it will exchange for Palestinian prisoners this weekend, after it expressed its commitment to a ceasefire with Israel. The next release of hostages was cast in doubt after Hamas accused Israel of violations of the agreement and threats of a return to war. 'We are not interested in the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and we are keen on its implementation and ensuring that the occupation [Israel] adheres to it fully,' Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua said. Qanoua also criticized what he called 'language of threats and intimidation' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they do not help the implementation of the ceasefire. The Israeli government later reiterated that Hamas must release three hostages this weekend. 'If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end,' Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said. Hamas earlier this week accused Israel of violating the deal by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed on Saturday, and Trump said Monday that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not returned. On Wednesday, after Israel called up military reservists, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated Trump’s warning. 'If Hamas stops the hostage releases, then there is no ceasefire, and there is war,' he said. He added that the fighting would be more intense and would 'allow the realization of Trump's vision for Gaza.' Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that the United States wanted to hear new proposals from Arab states on Gaza after Trump’s plan received backlash. 'If they’ve got a better plan, now’s the time to present it,' Rubio said on a conservative radio show. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, has freed 21 hostages, and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Both Israel and Hamas stand accused of committing war crimes. The United States on Thursday sanctioned the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court over the ICC’s investigations targeting U.S. officials and alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza.

As Germany election looms, far-right German party continues to gather support	German voters head to the polls this month for an election that will determine who the country’s new chancellor will be. The Feb. 23 poll is a snap election, following the collapse of center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government last year. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, founded in 2013, appears to be gathering strength and support across the country and has emerged as a factor in the election. The party’s popularity has been fueled by dissatisfaction with the large numbers of immigrants in the country. While AfD has evolved to focus its attention on other issues, including the immediate lifting of sanctions against Russia, immigration remains its central theme. Alice Weidel, AfD’s first candidate for chancellor, is a staunch supporter of so-called 'remigration,' a term used to describe the mass deportation of immigrants. Political analysts say Weidel has little chance of becoming chancellor, but as AfD’s popularity has risen, it has forced politicians to rethink their conversations and debates about immigration. AfD won its first parliamentary seats in 2017, with 12.6% of the votes. In 2021, the party had only 10.3% of the votes. It has supporters across the country and its politicians have been elected to 14 of Germany’s 16 state legislatures. Its emergence as a political force occurs at the same time that other far-right parties are rising in Europe, including Austria's Freedom Party and the National Rally in France.

Category 5 cyclone nears Western Australia coast	sydney — Category 5 Cyclone Zelia swirled toward Australia's minerals-rich western coast Friday, with predicted gusts of up to 290 kilometers per hour sparking emergency warnings and port closures. Forecasters said the slow-moving, severe tropical cyclone was moving south toward Port Hedland — one of the world's busiest iron ore loading ports — with landfall expected in the afternoon. 'Very destructive winds of up to 290 kilometers per hour (180 miles per hour) are likely close to the center of the cyclone as it crosses the coast,' the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said. It warned residents of a possible dangerous storm tide as the cyclone made landfall. 'Tides are likely to rise significantly above the normal high tide mark with damaging waves and dangerous flooding of some low-lying areas close to the shoreline,' it said in an update. The cyclone was forecast to land near Port Hedland — about 17 hours' drive north of the state capital, Perth — before tracking inland across sparsely populated mining and cattle country. Initially arriving as a Category 5 cyclone, Zelia was expected to weaken to a Category 4 later in the evening. Pilbara Ports said it had cleared vessels and shut down operations at major minerals export centers Port Hedland and Port Dampier as well as the oil and gas shipping port of Varanus Island. Emergency services in Western Australia told people still in the cyclone's path to shelter in the strongest part of their homes, warning it was now too late to attempt to leave. The northwest coast of Western Australia is the most cyclone-prone region in the country, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. It also has 'the highest incidence of cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere.'

France's Macron urges Syria's interim government to join US-led coalition fighting extremists	PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron urged Syria's interim government to cooperate with a U.S.-led coalition fighting against extremist groups in that region as he hosted a conference Thursday on the Mideast country's future. Macron's comments come amid uncertainty over the United States' commitment to the region. Thursday's conference in Paris among European and Arab nations was the third on Syria since the repressive government of Bashar al-Assad was ousted in December and was attended by Syria's interim foreign minister, Asaad al-Shibani. 'Syria must very clearly continue to fight against all the terrorist organizations that are spreading chaos,' Macron said. 'If Syria decides to offer cooperation' with the international coalition, France would support the move, he added. The Paris conference of foreign ministers and other officials from participating countries was meant to coordinate efforts to support a peaceful transition, as the new government in Damascus underlines its desire to improve relations with the West. Integration of Kurdish-led forces Macron also called on the Syrian interim government to 'fully integrate' the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) into the Syrian transition, calling them 'precious allies.' 'I think your responsibility today is to integrate them and also to allow these forces to join in,' he said. On Thursday, Syrian organizers of a conference in Damascus to chart the country's political future said those talks will include all segments of Syrian society except for the Kurdish-led administration in the northeast and Assad loyalists. Most of the country's former insurgent factions have agreed to dissolve and join the new Syrian army and security services, but the Kurdish-led SDF so far has refused to do the same. SDF forces have been clashing with Turkish-backed groups in northern Syria, and the Kurds are concerned about losing political and cultural gains they have made since carving out their own enclave in the northeast during the country's civil war. Discussions are ongoing between the SDF and the government in Damascus. Billions in aid needed More aid is crucial to achieve a peaceful reconstruction during the post-Assad transition. The country needs to rebuild housing, electricity, water and transportation infrastructure after nearly 14 years of war. The United Nations in 2017 estimated that it would cost at least $250 billion, while some experts now say the number could reach at least $400 billion. With few productive sectors and government employees making wages equivalent to about $20 per month, Syria has grown increasingly dependent on remittances and humanitarian aid. But the flow of aid was throttled after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The effects were particularly dire in the country's northwest, a formerly rebel-held enclave that hosts millions of people displaced from other areas by the country's civil war. Many of them live in sprawling tent camps. The freeze on USAID funding forced clinics serving many of those camps to shut down, and nonprofits laid off local staff. A workshop bringing together key donors from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, the United Nations and key agencies from Arab countries will be held alongside the conference to coordinate international aid to Syria. Doubts about US military support Uncertainty also surrounds the future of U.S. military support in the region. In 2019 during his first term, Trump decided on a partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from the northeast of Syria before he halted the plans. And in December last year, when rebels were on their way to topple Assad, Trump said the United States should not 'dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war.' Now that Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is trying to consolidate his power, the U.S. intentions in the region remain unclear. A U.S. official attended Thursday's conference in Paris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-macron-urges-syria-s-interim-government-to-join-us-led-coalition-fighting-extremists-/7974614.html	2025-02-13T17:22:11-08:00	
Russian Vinnik back in Moscow after prisoner swap, news agency says	Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national convicted of cybercrime and released by U.S. authorities as part of a prisoner swap, arrived in Moscow on Thursday and thanked President Vladimir Putin and others for arranging the exchange, state news agency RIA said. Vinnik, who pleaded guilty in May 2024 to charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, told RIA in a dispatch issued after midnight that he was at home with his family. He said he had flown on a U.S. plane that stopped in Poland and not in Turkey as his lawyer had said. Quoted by RIA, Vinnik thanked Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Russian diplomats and special services, his lawyers 'and especially my family.' He added: 'What can I say? And I can also thank [U.S. President Donald] Trump. On the whole, without him, things would probably have been difficult.' Leonid Slutsky, head of the foreign affairs committee of Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament, told the Tass news agency that Vinnik's return home was 'yet another victory for Russian diplomacy and all services and agencies associated with his liberation.' Unlike previous instances of Russians returning home after a prisoner swap, there was little fanfare around Vinnik's arrival. Vinnik operated a cryptocurrency exchange, BTC-e, through which he was suspected of funneling $4 billion in proceeds from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug rings and other criminal activity. He was freed by the United States from prison in return for Moscow's release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who returned home on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-vinnik-back-in-moscow-after-prisoner-swap-news-agency-says-/7974639.html	2025-02-13T17:17:12-08:00	
Trump administration lays off probationary employees, plans 'large-scale' cuts	washington — The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection — potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers. In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming. The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly. It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs throughout the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for 'large-scale reductions in force.' Elon Musk, whom Trump has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the country to 'delete entire agencies' from the federal government. 'I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,' Musk said as he spoke via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 'If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.' 'Vast unraveling' Paul Light, an expert on the federal government and professor emeritus of public service at New York University, said it seemed like the administration was 'inventing new methods for destroying government capacity.' By laying people off, the government will be able to accomplish fewer things. 'It's a vast unraveling of what federal agencies do,' he said. Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, there were 220,000 workers with under a year on the job as of March 2024, the most recent data available. The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week, and it has included workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education. At least 39 workers were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials. The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the capital region. Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, which offered to pay people until September 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program on Wednesday. However, the number of workers who took the offer was lower than the administration's target, and Trump has made it clear that he would take further steps to lay people off. Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions in the workforce, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss it. The National Science Foundation was told to expect a 25% to 50% reduction in force within two months, while the Housing and Urban Development Department was told to plan for a 50% reduction, the person said. Employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were also bracing Thursday for reductions in their workforce. The order Trump signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring would be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need the approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-lays-off-probationary-employees-plans-large-scale-cuts/7974612.html	2025-02-13T17:10:27-08:00	
Trump takes tit-for-tat trade action with tariffs	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday took what could become his most consequential action involving international trade early in his second administration. Trump, who signed a memorandum calling for reciprocal tariffs, told a group of reporters in the Oval Office that 'if you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs.' The goal is to bring down America’s budget deficit, estimated to be approaching $2 trillion. The president added that the action 'is fair to all. No other country can complain.' Trump ordered Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer, his picks for commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative, respectively, to lead teams to calculate new import taxes on America’s trading partners. To assess the amounts, they are to take into consideration other countries’ tariff rates, subsidies to industry, value-added taxes — which are common in the European Union — regulations and undervaluing of currencies. The EU value-added tax is the 'poster child' for unfair trade, Peter Navarro, the president’s senior counselor for trade, told reporters on Thursday. Modi visit Trump put his signature on the edict just hours before welcoming Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House. India is expected to be one of the countries most affected by the action. India has relatively high tariff and non-tariff barriers on numerous American exports. It has faced pressure from Washington to reduce its 100% tariff on walnuts, the 70% levy on apples and the 60% import tax on dairy products. Other sectors include smartphones, pork and poultry, and medical devices. India reduced a 100% tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles — an iconic brand deeply embedded in the economy of the Midwestern state of Wisconsin — to 50% in 2018. The two countries announced on Thursday an energy agreement to make the United States the primary supplier of oil and gas to India. Trump, alongside Modi, at a Thursday evening news conference said he would pave the way for the United States to sell F-35 Stealth fighter jets to India and the two leaders would work to make tariff cuts in order to reduce America’s nearly $50 billion trade deficit with India. 'Prime Minister Modi and I agreed we would begin negotiations to address the long-standing disparities,' Trump said. Modi said he and Trump have set a 'target of more than doubling our bilateral trade to attain $500 billion by 2030. Our teams will work on concluding very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement.' In response to a reporter’s question about the reciprocal tariffs, Trump confirmed India would also be targeted. 'Whatever India charges, we’re charging them,' he said. Some high-ranking government officials in New Delhi have suggested finding a way to appease the U.S. president amid concern that he could negotiate a sweeping trade deal with India’s neighbor and rival, China, according to Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute’s Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia. If Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, were to forge a sweeping trade pact, 'India could face a double challenge — on the trade/economic front and the strategic big picture front,' Pande told VOA on Thursday. 'India is a country that Trump has railed against in the past, although I don't think it's a particular obsession of his in the way that China is, because China is a major strategic competitor to the United States. Or the way Canada and Mexico are, because they are the bordering countries,' according to Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Since being sworn into office on Jan. 20 for his second nonconsecutive term as president, Trump has moved quickly on the trade front. He imposed, and then put on hold amid further negotiations, across-the-board 25% tariffs on nearly all products from America’s two continental neighbors, Canada and Mexico. He placed a flat 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, which prompted Beijing to respond with countertariffs of 10% to 15% on crude oil, liquefied natural gas, farm machinery and some other U.S. products. Economists say the tariffs cover about $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, while the Chinese tariffs hit $15 billion to $20 billion in American products. Trump characterized his actions as a way to pressure those three countries into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. He also has blamed Canada and Mexico for being lax in preventing migrants from crossing their borders into the U.S. Trump earlier this week announced that effective in March, all steel and aluminum imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, an action analysts predict could significantly raise sticker prices at automotive dealerships in North America. 'Stagflationary shock' Analysts say Trump’s tariff actions will hurt the growth of the U.S. economy this year. 'Tariffs impart a modest stagflationary shock to an economy,' according to a report issued Thursday by financial services provider Wells Fargo. 'The U.S. economy entered 2025 with a fair amount of momentum, but we look for real GDP growth to downshift a bit over the next few quarters as the price-boosting effects of tariffs erode growth in real income, thereby weighing on growth in real consumer spending.' Peter Harrell, who was jointly appointed to the White House National Security Council and National Economic Council in the previous administration of President Joe Biden, said Trump 'promised us he would be a ‘tariff man’ and he is certainly delivering.' 'I think this is only part of the tariffs we are likely to see or at least threatened' over the coming months, Harrell said Thursday morning on 'The Capital Cable,' a livestream program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) Korea Chair. These actions or the threat of them give the Trump administration leverage by having 'a tariff bazooka ready to fire,' said Harrell, currently a Carnegie nonresident fellow. On the same livestream, Philip Luck, director of the CSIS economic program, warned that Trump’s 'Fortress America' will result in Americans paying 'really high costs' due to retaliatory actions by Washington’s trading partners. If the president’s goal is to use such trade actions partly to increase the cash coffers, tariff revenue is approximately 1.5% of government revenue, 'so it’s tiny,' Luck said. The United States is in a dominant position as the largest economy and well-integrated into the global trading system, giving it leverage built up over an 80-year period, but Trump’s actions could squander that goodwill, Luck said. 'We’ve been a reliable partner for a long period of time,' he noted, with the United States traditionally setting tariffs through negotiations involving international groups such as the World Trade Organization. 'There’s a lot of anxiety, bordering on panic in [South] Korea,' because Trump, immediately in his second term, is using tariffs for noneconomic reasons, said Yeo Han-Koo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics 'U.S. policymakers really need to see the strategic angle' amid the regional competition with China and how they can collaborate with Tokyo and Seoul, suggested Yeo, who as South Korea’s trade minister coinciding with Trump’s first term was at the negotiating table across from American officials. Shipbuilding, civil nuclear power and biopharmaceuticals are three sectors where the United States, Japan and South Korea could cooperate to help counter Beijing’s rising trade and military influence, Yeo suggested.

Jailed Georgian journalist: 'I will not bow to this regime'	WASHINGTON — 'I will not bow to this regime,' writes Mzia Amaglobeli from pre-trial detention in the city of Batumi in Georgia. The 49-year-old journalist has been in custody since January 11 and on a hunger strike since January 12 over her detention. Amaglobeli was attending a protest where demonstrations were calling for fresh elections and objecting to the government's suspension of Georgia's EU accession plans. At first, police detained Amaglobeli for putting a sticker on a wall. She was released, only to be arrested later that day for slapping a police officer. Georgia's prime minister and other government officials have said that Amaglobeli should end her hunger strike and apologize for her actions. But media watchdogs believe her arrest is connected to her journalism. Journalist previously threatened Amaglobeli is the founder of the websites Batumelebi and Netgazeti, which focus on political news, investigations and corruption. Both Amaglobeli and her media group have come under pressure and threats previously for their work. Amaglobeli's health has declined after being on a hunger strike for a month, and she is being held in a private clinic under a doctor's supervision, but she remains in custody. Nestan Tsetskhladze, a friend and colleague, told VOA that the journalist plans to remain on her hunger strike until March 4, when she is due to appear in court. 'She is on hunger strike in protest, to show that she won't tolerate this regime,' Tsetskhladze told VOA. 'She is not going to live by this regime's agenda. That is her goal.' Amaglobeli has also written of her position in a letter last month to colleagues that was shared with media. 'Today it is me, tomorrow it could be anyone who dares to dream of a just, democratic European Georgia, untouched by Russian influence, unshaken by oppression,' wrote Amaglobeli. 'I will not bow to this regime. I will not play by its rules.' Hundreds arrested The journalist is one of hundreds of people to be arrested since parliamentary elections in October resulted in nationwide protests. The country's ruling Georgian Dream party officially won the election with around 54% of the vote, but the results were challenged by then-President Salome Zourabichvili and opposition parties, who claimed the elections were rigged. Observers, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said there were reports of voter irregularities. At the time, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, a member of Georgian Dream, called on Zourabichvili to turn over any evidence of rigging to authorities. He said he believed she did not have such evidence. A fresh wave of protests started on November 28, when Kobakhidze announced a suspension of all negotiations with the European Union on Georgia's EU accession until 2028. Police have responded to the protests with force, using water cannons against demonstrators, hundreds of whom have been detained, beaten and treated inhumanely, according to Transparency International Georgia. In Amaglobeli's case, the journalist's legal team says she was mistreated after her second arrest. They say that the police officer whom she slapped was trying to physically abuse her, that he spat in her face and did not let her use the restroom for several hours. Additionally, lawyers were not allowed to see the journalist for three hours. Amaglobeli faces charges of assaulting a police officer. If found guilty, she could face up to seven years in prison. Transparency International Georgia has said a video of the interaction shows the slap 'lacked sufficient force to cause harm,' and doesn't meet the standard for a formal charge. Gulnoza Said of the Committee to Protect Journalists told VOA that it is a 'very serious press freedom violation that she is in detention.' Rachel Denber, deputy director of the Human Rights Watch Europe and Central Asia division, said that, so far, no investigations have taken place into cases of riot police using excessive force or alleged mistreatment of protesters in custody. 'Suddenly, this is where the authorities are putting all of their time and resources and vigor — to punish one person who is a journalist and who has a record of being outspoken,' Denber told VOA. Tsetskhladze, the journalist's friend, believes the government's treatment of Amaglobeli is meant to be a warning for other independent media outlets and journalists in Georgia. 'They are punishing not only Mzia, who slapped a police officer, but also the media outlets she funded, the media in general, journalists and all critical, free people in this country,' he told VOA. At least 50 journalists have been attacked, obstructed and beaten during the protests. Some were hospitalized and their equipment was damaged, according to the Mapping Media Freedom platform.

Federal judge pauses Trump order restricting gender-affirming care for trans youth	BALTIMORE — A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's recent executive order aimed at restricting gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19. The judge's ruling came after a lawsuit was filed earlier this month on behalf of families with transgender or nonbinary children who allege their health care has been compromised by the president's order. A national group for family of LGBTQ+ people and a doctors organization are also plaintiffs in the court challenge, one of many lawsuits opposing one of the many executive orders Trump has issued. Judge Brendan Hurson, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden, granted the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore. The ruling, in effect for 14 days, essentially puts Trump's directive on hold while the case proceeds. The restraining order could also be extended. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order directing federally run insurance programs to exclude coverage for gender-affirming care. That includes Medicaid, which covers such services in some states, and TRICARE for military families. Trump's order also called on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice. The lawsuit includes several accounts from families of appointments being canceled as medical institutions react to the new directive. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argue Trump's executive order is 'unlawful and unconstitutional' because it seeks to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because it violates anti-discrimination laws while infringing on the rights of parents. Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, the lawsuit also alleges the policy is discriminatory because it allows federal funds to cover the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition. Some hospitals immediately paused gender-affirming care, including prescriptions for puberty blockers and hormone therapy, while they assess how the order affects them. Trump's approach on the issue represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people. Trump has used strong language in opposing gender-affirming care, asserting falsely that 'medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child's sex.' Major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support access to gender-affirming care. Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive puberty blockers or hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-judge-pauses-trump-order-restricting-gender-affirming-care-for-trans-youth-/7974321.html	2025-02-13T14:40:50-08:00	
Prosecutors quit after being ordered to end case against New York mayor	NEW YORK — The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan resigned Thursday after refusing a Justice Department order to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Two senior Justice Department officials also quit after the department leadership in Washington moved to seize control of the case. Danielle Sassoon, a Republican serving as interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced her resignation in an email to her staff. The move was confirmed by a spokesperson for the office. Adams' case has yet to be dropped. After Sassoon declined to dismiss the case, the department's public integrity section in Washington was asked to take over, according to a person familiar with the matter. Two senior officials who oversee the unit, including the acting chief, resigned in response, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. The exits came days after a high-ranking Justice Department official directed federal prosecutors in New York to end the case against Adams, a Democrat who was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions and bribes of free or discounted travel from people who wanted to buy his influence. He has pleaded not guilty. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said in a memo Monday that the case should be dismissed so Adams could aid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and campaign for reelection free from facing criminal charges. The primary is four months away and Adams has multiple challengers. Bove had directed that be done as soon as 'practicable,' but there have been no public statements or actions by the prosecution team. On Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she would 'look into' why the case had yet to be dismissed. As of Thursday afternoon, the charges remained in place. In the email to her staff, Sassoon did not give a reason for her resignation. In the note, the contents of which were obtained by The Associated Press, she said she had just submitted her resignation to Bondi. 'As I told her, it has been my greatest honor to represent the United States and to pursue justice as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York,' Sassoon wrote. The Justice Department did not ask Sassoon to resign, according to a department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The department declined public comment on Sassoon's exit. A message seeking comment was left for Adams' attorney, Alex Spiro. A spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government's decision to end the Adams case because of political considerations, rather than the strength or weakness of the evidence, alarmed some career prosecutors who said it was a departure from long-standing norms. The directive from Bove, a former Trump personal lawyer, was all the more remarkable because Bove had been a longtime prosecutor and supervisor in the Southern District and because department leaders are historically reluctant to intervene in cases where charges have been brought — particularly in an office as prestigious as that U.S. attorney's office. Bove's memo also steered clear of any legal basis for the dismissal despite decades of department tradition dictating that charging decisions are to be guided by facts, evidence and the law. Sassoon, a former clerk for the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, was not the prosecutor who brought the case against Adams last year. That was then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, who stepped down after Trump's election victory in November. Sassoon had only been tapped to serve as acting U.S. attorney on January 21, the day after Trump took office. Her role was intended to be temporary. Trump in November nominated Jay Clayton, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to the post, an appointment that must be confirmed by the Senate. That has not happened yet. The Southern District of New York is among the largest and most prominent prosecutor's offices in the U.S., with a long track record of tackling Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international terrorism. It has a tradition of independence from Washington, something that has earned it the nickname 'the sovereign district.' During Trump's first term, the office prosecuted both the president's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and his strategic adviser, Steve Bannon, in separate cases. Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion and campaign finance charges. Trump ended the federal fraud case against Bannon by pardoning him, though nearly identical charges were then brought by state prosecutors. This is the second Justice Department tussle in five years between Washington and New York officials to result in a dramatic leadership turnover. In 2020, William Barr, who served as one of Trump's attorneys general during his first term pushed out Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, in a surprise nighttime announcement. Berman initially refused to resign his position, creating a brief standoff with Barr, but did so after an assurance that his investigations into allies of Trump would not be disturbed. Sassoon joined the U.S. attorney's office in 2016. In 2023 she helped lead the fraud prosecution of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. More recently, she had served as the office's co-chief of criminal appeals. Adams was indicted in September on charges that while he worked as Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks such as expensive flight upgrades, luxury hotel stays and even a trip to a bathhouse. The indictment said a Turkish official who helped facilitate the trips then leaned on Adams for favors, including asking him to lobby the Fire Department to let a newly constructed, 36-story diplomatic building open in time for a planned visit by Turkey's president. Prosecutors said they had proof that Adams personally directed political aides to solicit foreign donations and disguise them to help the campaign qualify for a city program that provides a generous, publicly funded match for small dollar donations. Under federal law, foreign nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. election campaigns. As recently as Jan. 6, prosecutors had indicated their investigation remained active, writing in court papers that they continued to 'uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams.' Bove said in his memo that Justice Department officials in Washington hadn't evaluated the evidence in the case before deciding it should be dropped — at least until after the mayoral election in November. Federal agents also had been investigating other senior Adams aides. It was unclear what would happen to that side of the probe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutors-quit-after-being-ordered-to-end-case-against-new-york-mayor/7974287.html	2025-02-13T14:37:30-08:00	
Trump wants denuclearization talks with Russia and China, hopes for defense spending cuts	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he wants to restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive defense budgets in half. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump lamented the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation's nuclear deterrent and said he hopes to gain commitments from the U.S. adversaries to cut their own spending. 'There’s no reason for us to be building brand-new nuclear weapons. We already have so many,' Trump said. 'You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.' 'We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive,' Trump said. While the U.S. and Russia have held massive stockpiles of weapons since the Cold War, Trump predicted that China would catch up in its capability to exact nuclear devastation 'within five or six years.' He said if the weapons were ever called to use, 'that’s going to be probably oblivion.' Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once 'we straighten it all out' in the Middle East and Ukraine. 'One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi [Jinping] of China, President [Vladimir] Putin of Russia. And I want to say, ‘Let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.' Trump in his first term tried and failed to bring China into nuclear arms reduction talks when the U.S. and Russia were negotiating an extension of a pact known as New START. Russia suspended its participation in the treaty during the Biden administration, as the U.S. and Russia continued on massive programs to extend the lifespans or replace their Cold War-era nuclear arsenals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-wants-denuclearization-talks-with-russia-china-hopes-for-defense-spending-cuts/7974285.html	2025-02-13T14:19:45-08:00

Chinese diplomat visits UK, restarts dialogue	WASHINGTON — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Britain for the first time on Thursday, marking the restart of a diplomatic dialogue mechanism that has been paused for nearly seven years. Wang had talks with Britain's foreign minister and national security adviser and briefly met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The top Chinese diplomat's visit restarts the U.K.-China Strategic Dialogue, which has been frozen since 2018 over human rights abuses in Hong Kong, spying allegations and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that discussions would involve 'areas of bilateral economic cooperation' and security issues such as the war in Ukraine. 'We will also discuss issues where the U.K. and China do not always see eye to eye, and in some cases, the U.K. does have significant concerns,' Lammy said. In the meetings, Wang said that cooperation was increasingly urgent, given the current state of global affairs. 'Under the current situation, it is more important than before for China and the U.K. to demonstrate their responsibilities as major countries, practice multilateralism, support free trade, advocate win-win cooperation, and promote political solutions to hot spot issues, so we can jointly work for the peace and stability of the world,' Wang said through an interpreter. 'It is important that we use channels such as this for robust but constructive discussion, as we are both members of the U.N. Security Council and we'll be better able to understand each other, and each other's perspectives,' Wang added. Wang's visit is another step in the new British labor government's effort to improve its relations with China. Lammy visited China in October, and British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves traveled to Beijing in January to reopen talks of investment between the countries. As British diplomats met with Wang, a small group of demonstrators gathered outside the Chinese Embassy to protest his arrival and Chinese human rights violations. 'We will take this opportunity to call on China, to hope that China can have freedom of speech, human rights and can end its dictatorship rule,' said Cheng Xiaodan, a Chinese immigrant living in England. Members of the crowd held small paper signs with images of Wang and banners that read 'Long live freedom. Long live human rights.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-diplomat-visits-uk-restarts-dialogue/7974252.html	2025-02-13T14:15:49-08:00

VOA Russian: Expert says Trump needs ‘carrot and stick’ with Putin	As U.S. President Donald Trump announced talks to end Russia’s war with Ukraine, Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer in an exclusive interview with VOA Russian describes how Trump will need to use a carrot and a stick to persuade Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire. Bremmer believes that although Trump has far more leverage over Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy than over Putin, the U.S. president can successfully achieve the end of the war by using hard-line approach and negotiating tactics.

Pentagon chief calls on NATO partners to increase role in Europe’s defense	PENTAGON — U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called for NATO’s European members to increase their role in the defense of Europe as the United States focuses on defending the alliance’s Pacific flank. It is a move that he says will likely require European allies to significantly increase defense spending from 2% of GDP to about 5% of GDP. 'We can talk all we want about values. Values are important, but you can't shoot values, you can't shoot flags, and you can't shoot strong speeches. There is no replacement for hard power,' Hegseth told reporters on Thursday at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Last year, NATO’s European allies collectively spent 2% of their GDP, amounting to about $380 billion, for the first time after setting a 2% defense spending goal in 2014. The U.S. currently spends about 3.5% of its GDP on defense. Canada, the other non-European NATO ally, currently spends about 1.4% of its GDP on defense. 'NATO is a great alliance, the most successful defense alliance in history, but to endure for the future, our partners must do far more for Europe's defense,' Hegseth said. He emphasized that deterrence of Chinese aggression 'in the Pacific is one that really can only be led by the United States.' He said the U.S. does not seek conflict with China, nor does it feel that conflict with China is inevitable, but he contended the administration must work with allies to ensure deterrence in the Indo-Pacific is 'hard power deterrence, not just reputational.' Russia-Ukraine war On Wednesday, Hegseth said keeping Ukraine’s pre-invasion boundaries is an 'unrealistic objective' in its war against Russian aggression, as was the expectation that Ukraine would join NATO. He advocated for a negotiated end to the war with security guarantees backed by European and non-European troops that would not include U.S. forces. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Ukraine’s potential membership in NATO and whether it should concede any territory should not be decided before peace talks start, referring to Hegseth’s comments as 'concessions' made by the United States. 'Vladimir Putin responds to strength,' Hegseth said on Thursday when asked whether the U.S. was decreasing Ukraine’s leverage. 'No one's going to get everything that they want, understanding who committed the aggression in the first place,' he added, referring to Putin. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reiterated his support for higher defense spending and appeared to defend Hegseth’s comments on Ukraine not joining the alliance. Rutte said on Thursday that while NATO must 'make sure that Vladimir Putin never ever tries again to attack Ukraine,' he said, 'it has never been a promise to Ukraine that as part of a peace deal, they would be part of NATO.' The European Union’s top diplomat warned that any peace deal struck between the United States and Russia — without Ukraine or the EU — will fail. 'Trump says that the killing should stop. Putin can stop the killing by stopping bombing Ukraine. This is doable if there is a will,' said Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. She added that any agreement without Ukraine at the table amounts to appeasement. Kallas’ comments reflected those of many NATO allies at Thursday’s meeting following U.S. President Donald Trump’s call with Putin and Trump's signaling that talks on Ukraine between the two were imminent. After Thursday’s NATO ministerial gathering, Hegseth travels to Poland for what the Pentagon said will be talks with leaders about 'bilateral defense cooperation, continued deterrence efforts along NATO's eastern flank and Poland's leadership as a model ally in defense investment and burden-sharing in NATO.' Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-calls-on-nato-partners-to-increase-role-in-europe-s-defense/7974207.html	2025-02-13T13:10:12-08:00

Number of accused 'high-threat' migrants at Guantanamo Bay rising	WASHINGTON — The U.S. military is now housing about 68 detainees at its prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as part of an effort to assist the Department of Homeland Security with mass deportations. The commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, shared the updated figure with lawmakers Wednesday, but said he could not yet provide details on how much it will cost to house the growing number of individuals. Admiral Alvin Holsey said those efforts include both the detention of individuals described by DHS officials as 'high-threat criminal aliens' and eventually holding up to 30,000 non-violent migrants slated for deportation. 'We're doing a phased approach,' Holsey told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, adding that the base has the capacity now to hold about 2,500 non-violent migrants. 'We’re working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,' he said. 'We’re not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will come. So, we're waiting at this point.' U.S. Transportation Command told VOA on Monday that there have been at least five flights of migrants to Guantanamo Bay, each aboard a C-17 or C-130 military cargo plane. Most of the flights, according to multiple officials, have carried between 10 and 15 detainees. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the transfer of the third flight of detainees to the detention center, has repeatedly described the men as 'murderers and vicious gang members' from Venezuela and as 'the worst of the worst.' In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing. On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been improperly denied access to lawyers. 'By hurrying immigrants off to a remote island cut off from lawyers, family, and the rest of the world, the Trump administration is sending its clearest signal yet that the rule of law means nothing to it,' according to a statement from ACLU lead attorney Lee Gelernt. 'It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law governs our nation,' he added. According to the ACLU and the other groups, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Eucaris Carolina Gomez Lugo, learned her brother had been sent to Guantanamo Bay only after seeing him in a photo. The group also said she was shocked to learn that the government was alleging he was a member of the Tren de Aragua Venezuelan street gang. DHS dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations. 'There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,' said a senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with VOA. 'If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers & vicious gang members than they do about American citizens—they should change their name,' the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/number-of-accused-high-threat-migrants-at-guantanamo-bay-rising/7974147.html	2025-02-13T12:30:38-08:00

UN report: China expands forced labor in Xinjiang, Tibet	WASHINGTON — A newly released report from the United Nations’ International Labor Organization states that authorities in China are not only using 'vocational skills training and education centers' for forced labor in Xinjiang and Tibet, but also the large-scale transfer of 'surplus' rural workers to state-led labor programs across the country. China called the report 'baseless' and 'false.' Released Monday, the ILO report details how Chinese authorities have intensified efforts to investigate and monitor poverty levels, setting higher targets for cross-provincial labor transfers while pressuring ethnic smallholder farmers to cede their land to large state-led cooperatives. Framed as 'liberating' rural workers, the report said, this process has forced tens of thousands of Uyghurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet into industries such as solar panel production, battery manufacturing, seasonal agriculture and seafood processing under coercive conditions. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the Tibet Autonomous Region are two of China’s five provincial-level autonomous regions. Both are located in the country's western regions. Two systems Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, described the report as 'very up to date' in its assessment of forced labor practices. 'The new report not only corrected previous conceptual errors [the 2022 version], but is very up to date in its assessment,' Zenz told VOA in an emailed response Wednesday. 'ILO attributed all forced labor in Xinjiang to the internment camps' in its previous report. Zenz noted that in February 2022, an ILO report cited observations by the International Trade Union Confederation, or ITUC, on forced labor in Xinjiang but inaccurately suggested that the region’s entire system of coercive labor was based solely on 'internment or ‘re-education’ camps,' or what Beijing calls vocational skills training and education centers, or VSTECs. The ILO’s latest report cites allegations from the ITUC regarding two major coercive labor systems operating in Xinjiang. The first involves the mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in VSTECs, which have since transitioned to long-term imprisonment in regular prisons. Released detainees from the centers, according to the report, are often subjected to forced labor in industries such as textiles and electronics. The second system, as detailed by the report, involves the mass transfer of 'surplus' rural workers into state-led labor programs, moving them away from traditional livelihoods into industries such as solar panel production, battery manufacturing, seasonal agriculture and seafood processing. 'In recent years, based on an intensified campaign of investigating and monitoring the poverty status of millions of rural households, the authorities had raised targets leading to increased cross-provincial labor transfers,' the report states. 'At the same time, local authorities had ‘actively guided’ ethnic smallholder farmers to transfer their agricultural plots to large state-led cooperatives, thus ‘liberating’ ‘surplus’ rural workers for transfer into manufacturing or the service sector.' Coercive labor transfers in Tibet The ILO report also highlights concerns over government-mandated labor transfers of Tibetans. 'These policies would apply coercive methods such as military-style vocational training methods and the involvement of political cadres to have Tibetan nomads and farmers swap their traditional livelihoods for jobs providing measurable cash income in industries such as road construction, mining, or food processing, thereby diluting ‘the negative influence of religion,’' the report said. The ITUC estimates that labor transfers in Tibet have increased significantly, affecting as many as 630,000 workers in 2024. Incentives for local labor brokers and companies have contributed to this rise, reinforcing concerns that Tibetans are being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and cultural traditions. International response In recent years, human rights organizations, government bodies and U.N. agencies have repeatedly called for accountability and transparency regarding labor conditions in Xinjiang and Tibet, urging countries and international companies to reassess their ties to supply chains linked to these regions. The United States has taken a strong stance against Uyghur forced labor with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which took effect in 2022. The law bans imports from Xinjiang unless companies can prove they were not made with forced labor, operating on a 'rebuttable presumption' that all goods from the region are tainted by forced labor. Additionally, the U.S. has imposed sanctions and export controls on Chinese entities linked to forced labor, reinforcing its commitment to human rights and ethical trade while pressuring Beijing to end coercive labor programs. While China has maintained that its policies are aimed at poverty alleviation and economic development, the ILO findings reinforce concerns that these initiatives are mechanisms of repression and control. The ILO Committee of Experts has formally requested China to provide detailed explanations and clarify the measures it has taken to address these allegations. The report concludes by urging Beijing to amend national and regional policies to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are not subjected to forced labor under the guise of employment and deradicalization programs. China’s response Liu Pengyu, spokesperson at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, dismissed the ILO report as 'baseless' and labeled the information as 'false,' aimed at attempting to 'deceive the international community and disrupt the stable development' of Xinjiang and Tibet. 'Some forces keep spreading lies that there are 'forced labor' in Xinjiang and Xizang. The aim is only to smear China's image, denigrate the Chinese government's policies governing Xinjiang and Xizang [Chinese spelling of Tibet], interfere in China's internal affairs, and attempt to deceive the international community and disrupt the stable development of Xinjiang and Xizang,' Liu told VOA in an emailed response late Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-report-china-expands-forced-labor-in-xinjiang-tibet/7974064.html	2025-02-13T11:40:02-08:00	
AI-driven biometric fraud surges in Africa, fueling financial crimes	Nairobi, Kenya — A new report says the emergence of cheap artificial intelligence tools is leading to a wave of biometric fraud in Africa. The report says fraudsters are using AI to create fake documents, voices, and images that facilitate identity theft and financial crimes. In July 2024, Japhet Ndubi, a Kenyan journalist, lost his phone and could not trace it. He replaced the SIM card, bought a new phone, and went on with his life. Four days later, while on a lunch break, he received a text alerting him that he had sent money to a certain number. 'Now I am using a new phone. When I saw money was sent to a certain number, I was surprised because I have my phone here. I called Safaricom to inquire, ‘How come some money is sent to a certain number without my authorization?’ It's when they told me, ‘Are you sure you are not the one who has withdrawn? Because we see a transaction has been carried out and sent to this number, and we can see you have used your fingerprints to withdraw the money,’' he said. The fraudsters even took out a loan that took him months to pay off. Authorities never made an arrest even though his phone was recovered. Nudbi was a victim of biometric fraud — a type of criminal activity where someone copies another person's unique characteristics, like their voice or fingerprints, to impersonate them and gain access to their devices or financial accounts. Smile ID is a U.S.-based company with offices in Kenya that develops software to protect people’s privacy. A report it released late last month says cases of document forgery and deepfakes are on the rise across Africa, as are simpler phishing attempts — all in an effort to steal money from innocent victims. The Smile ID researchers found that fraudsters especially targeted vulnerable people in low-literacy regions through phishing, data breaches, and making purchases through illicit sources. Stolen data is then exploited to create fraudulent bank accounts to be used for money laundering operations. Joshua Kumah, a Ghanaian, received a fake text claiming that money had been transferred to his mobile banking account. The text led to him losing control of his account and SIM card. 'The person told me to follow a short code that the money would be transferred back to him, so I did that without paying attention to the details. So, by the time I realized it was already too late, I had already given him access to my sim card, so I had to report to cancel that sim card. So, I lost the money I had on that sim. I had to start all over again,' he said. Ndubi is still in shock at how his fingerprints were used to access money through his mobile phone. He says that has changed how he uses the device. 'I was very surprised that they were able to use fingerprints, and I kept asking the telecom provider how they were able to access it but they were not able to tell me. So, I even lost faith in the Mpesa mobile banking application; actually, I have never used it,' he said. To prevent fraud, authorities and businesses now sometimes insist that people present themselves physically and produce valid identification cards to prove their identities. As for average Kenyans, many are trying to avoid using mobile apps on their phones, and are checking with banks and telecom operators about any transactions made in and out of their accounts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-driven-biometric-fraud-surges-in-africa-fueling-financial-crimes/7973925.html	2025-02-13T10:36:10-08:00	
US aircraft carrier collides with merchant ship near Egypt	WASHINGTON — The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman was involved in a collision at sea with a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt, the Navy said Thursday. The collision occurred late Wednesday while both ships were moving. It did not result in flooding or injuries aboard the carrier, and there was no damage to the ship's propulsion systems, the Navy said in a statement. None of the crew on the merchant ship, the Besiktas-M, were injured either, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not yet been made public. The Truman, which is based in Norfolk, Virginia, deployed in September to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It had just completed a port call in Souda Bay, Greece.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aircraft-carrier-collides-with-merchant-ship-near-egypt/7973912.html	2025-02-13T10:31:06-08:00	
15 wounded in grenade attack in French bar	French police were searching Thursday for an unidentified man who threw a grenade into a bar late Wednesday in the southeastern Alpine city of Grenoble, wounding 15 people, at least two of them seriously, according to health officials. Regional prosecutor Francois Touret de Coucy told reporters witness at the scene reported that shortly after 8 p.m. local time, the man entered the Aksehir bar in what the prosecutor described as a 'rough' part of the city, tossed in a grenade and fled, without saying a word. The suspect was also reported to have been carrying an assault rifle but did not use it. The prosecutor told the French news agency AFP there was no reason to think the attack was related to terrorism, but the motive is still unknown. He said they are exploring the possibility the attack was drug-related. French Health Minister Yannick Neuder spoke with reporters Thursday at the Grenoble University Hospital where many of the victims were being treated. He described the wounds as mostly 'cuts and organ perforations.' He condemned the attack, which he described as an 'an act of unimaginable violence.' Grenoble Mayor Eric Piolle also spoke to reporters Thursday, expressing his shock at the nature of the attack, calling it 'a new kind of violence.' He said he intended to discuss the incident and the general increase in violent crime with French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, who was reportedly due to visit the crime scene. The bar is in a neighborhood that was part of the Olympic Village when Grenoble hosted the 1968 Winter Olympic Games. Deputy Mayor Chloe Pantel told AFP the bar is 'a spot where locals and people from outside the neighborhood gather, especially to watch soccer matches.' Several Champions League matches were being played Wednesday night.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wounded-in-grenade-attack-in-french-bar/7973924.html	2025-02-13T10:29:16-08:00	
Zelenskyy rejects bilateral US-Russia pact to end Moscow's war against Ukraine	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that his country would not accept any agreement on its fate decided bilaterally by Russia and the United States on how to end Moscow’s three-year war on Ukraine without Kyiv’s involvement. 'We, as an independent country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,' Zelenskyy told reporters as he visited a nuclear plant on his way to the Munich Security Conference, where he plans to meet Friday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. U.S. President Donald Trump spoke Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and they agreed that negotiations to end the war should start immediately, with Trump suggesting the two of them might soon hold a summit in Saudi Arabia. Trump later talked with Zelenskyy and informed him of his discussions with Putin. On Thursday, Zelenskyy said, 'Today it's important that everything does not go according to Putin's plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral' with the U.S. Still, on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said after talking with Trump, 'We discussed many nuances, diplomatic, military, economic, and President Trump informed me of what Putin told him. We believe that America’s power is enough to, together with us, together with all partners, pressure Russia and Putin toward peace.' Zelenskyy said he talked with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday, telling him that 'no negotiations with Putin can begin without a united position from Ukraine, Europe, and the U.S. I emphasized that Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength, with strong and reliable security guarantees, and that NATO membership would be the most cost-effective for partners.' 'Another key guarantee is serious investment in Ukraine’s defense industry. I also warned world leaders against trusting Putin’s claims of readiness to end the war,' Zelenskyy said. Trump said, in all caps on his Truth Social media platform on Thursday, 'Great talks with Russia and Ukraine yesterday. Good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war!!!' Trump’s phone call with Putin came after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told other NATO defense chiefs that Ukraine’s goal of restoring its 2014 borders was unrealistic and that the U.S. does not foresee Ukraine joining NATO, the West’s key military alliance, as part of a negotiated settlement of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Moscow’s forces now hold about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in 2014. Zelenskyy said it was important for the United States and Ukraine to draw up a plan to end the war before talking to the Russian side. Ukraine has said it is working on a Zelenskyy-Trump meeting, but nothing firm has been announced. Zelenskyy said he did not discuss the possibility of NATO membership during his phone call with Trump, although he said he knew that the United States was against the idea. NATO’s 32-nation bloc says it is committed to eventual Ukraine NATO membership but not while the Russia-Ukraine war rages. Russian officials and state-backed media appeared triumphant after Wednesday’s call between Trump and Putin that lasted more than an hour. 'To us, the position of the current [U.S.] administration is much more appealing,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s National Security Council, said in an online statement, 'The presidents of Russia and the U.S. have talked at last. This is very important in and of itself.' Trump in the past has declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war against Russia. On Wednesday, after talking with Putin and Zelenskyy, he said, 'I’m backing Ukraine, but I do want security for our money,' with U.S. officials suggesting recently that Ukraine agree to supply the U.S. with rare earth minerals for manufacture of technology products in exchange for continued military support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-rejects-bilateral-us-russia-pact-to-end-moscow-s-war-against-ukraine-/7973916.html	2025-02-13T10:26:11-08:00	
Trump hosts India's leader, pushes US defense, energy sales	THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump hosts Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House on Thursday, where administration officials say he will seek to boost U.S. defense and energy sales and further strengthen Washington’s relationship with the world’s most-populous nation as China flexes its muscles in the region. 'We will aim to build on defense sales to India to ensure they are prioritizing the use of American technology,' said an administration official in a briefing with reporters Thursday morning. As is custom when briefing journalists, the official is not being named. 'The president is also focused on unleashing American energy to the rest of the world and will prioritize India as a key importer of America's natural resources to power their economy,' the official said. 'The two leaders will discuss how we can improve our trade relationship that brings down our bilateral trade deficit and ensure an expanded fair-trade relationship.' When asked directly about New Delhi’s largest concern — of being caught in the wave of reciprocal tariffs Trump has recently imposed as part of an escalating trade war with the world — a second administration official said, 'What you'll see coming out of a meeting today is further momentum towards a solidified, fair — and I emphasize that word ‘fair’ — bilateral trade arrangement between our two dynamic and growing economies. And the hope would be to have such a deal in place in the calendar year 2025.' That official also touted announcements on 'semiconductors, critical minerals, supply chain resilience and diversification.' Modi said on X that he was 'looking forward to meeting @POTUS Donald Trump and building upon the India-USA Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. Our nations will keep working closely for the benefit of our people and for a better future for our planet.' Analysts say China also looms large in these talks, and the White House added that the two leaders would discuss the elevation of the Quad grouping of the United States, India, Australia and Japan. 'The sharp deterioration in India-China relations after the 2020 Galwan Valley incident,' in which Indian and Chinese troops clashed over road construction in disputed territory, 'undoubtedly encouraged New Delhi to be more enthusiastic about its strategic partnership with Washington,' said Daniel Markey, a senior adviser at the U.S. Institute of Peace. And India-focused analyst Rick Rossow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told VOA about India’s goals. 'As President Trump kind of initiates a trade war against the world, India's got bigger stakes than a lot of countries do in that, and they need to make sure that the relations remain stable,' Rossow said. 'So, they want to be here. They want to be in front. They want to talk about things they can buy from the United States. They want to talk about policies they can resolve and try to make sure that things remain on an even keel, because this relationship, it's important for us. It's vital for India.'

Taliban chief claims Afghan governance rooted in divine commands	ISLAMABAD — The leader of Afghanistan’s governing radical Taliban has defended his policies, including banning female access to education and employment, asserting that they are derived from the 'commands of Allah.' Hibatullah Akhundzada's assertions came days after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced he was seeking arrest warrants for the reclusive Taliban leader, holding him 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' A Taliban statement said that Akhundzada addressed teachers, staff and students at a public university in the southern province of Kandahar on Wednesday during his first known visit to a modern education institution, where he also discussed the significance of his edicts. 'The esteemed supreme leader stated that every decree he issues is based on consultation with scholars and derived from the Quran and Hadith [sayings of Islam’s prophet], and represents commands of Allah,' the Taliban chief was quoted as saying. Akhundzada seldom leaves his office in Kandahar and rules impoverished Afghanistan from there through numerous decrees he has issued over the past three years. He has barred girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and blocked female students from accessing university education. Afghan women are banned from most public and private sector employment nationwide. They are not allowed to travel by road or air without a chaperone and cannot visit public places such as parks, gyms or beauty salons. The Taliban supreme leader stated in his speech on Wednesday that religious schools and universities are essentially the same and emphasized the importance of supporting and safeguarding both types of educational institutions in the country. 'Now it is your turn to make Afghanistan competitive globally with your knowledge and wisdom. Work hard so that foreigners come here to learn from you and use your knowledge to succeed globally,' Akhundzada said. 'Professors and students, you must acquire religious and worldly education but serve religion solely.' The Taliban government, not recognized by any country, has established dozens of new Islamic seminaries, known as madrasas, to promote their strict interpretation of Islamic beliefs and laws, according to observers. In his Jan. 23 declaration, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan stated that his decision to seek Akhundzada’s arrest warrants was based on a thorough investigation and evidence collected. 'Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable. Afghan survivors, in particular women and girls, deserve accountability before a court of law,' Khan said. The Taliban condemned Khan’s action as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.' The international community has refused to accept the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, mainly over their harsh treatment of women and other human rights concerns. The United States and other Western countries have slapped economic sanctions on the country and primarily isolated the Afghan banking sector since the Taliban takeover. Several senior leaders of the Taliban are still listed as terrorist entities by the United Nations. An international conference of Muslim leaders hosted by Pakistan last month condemned 'extremist ideologies' and religious edicts, known as fatwas, that are rooted in cultural norms obstructing girls' education as a 'grave misuse of religious principles to legitimize policies of deprivation and exclusion.' The conference declaration, without naming the de facto Afghan rulers, noted that anyone who rejects or opposes Islamic principles mandating equal education for men and women 'is considered outside the framework of the Islamic Ummah’s [Islamic world’s] concepts and cannot be regarded as part of it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-chief-claims-afghan-governance-rooted-in-divine-commands/7973832.html	2025-02-13T09:30:34-08:00	
Senate panel advances nomination of Kash Patel, Trump's pick to lead FBI	WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on Thursday to advance the nomination of Kash Patel, Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, pushing past Democratic concerns that he would operate as a loyalist for the president and target perceived adversaries of the White House. The committee voted 12-10 to send the nomination to the Republican-controlled Senate for full consideration. It was not immediately clear when the final confirmation vote will occur, but so far even nominees once seen as having uncertain prospects — including new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence — have been able to marshal sufficient support from Republicans eager to fall in line with Trump's agenda. Patel has raised alarm for his lack of management experience compared to other FBI directors and because of a vast catalog of incendiary past statements, which include calling investigators who scrutinized Trump 'government gangsters' and describing at least some defendants charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S Capitol as 'political prisoners.' At his confirmation hearing last month, Patel said Democrats were taking some of his comments out of context or misunderstanding the broader point that he was trying to make, such as when he proposed shutting down the FBI headquarters in Washington and turning it into a museum for the so-called 'deep state.' And Patel denied the idea that a list in his book of government officials, who he said were part of a 'deep state,' amounted to an 'enemies list,' calling that a 'total mischaracterization.' Patel, who was selected by Trump in November to replace Christopher Wray as FBI director, would inherit an agency riven by turmoil amid the recent forced departures of a group of senior executives and by a highly unusual Justice Department demand for the names of all agents who participated in investigations related to Jan. 6. A letter this week from Senator Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the committee, cited undisclosed sources in saying that Patel was covertly involved in that process despite telling the panel at his confirmation hearing that he was unaware of any plans to fire agents. A Patel spokeswoman called the allegations 'gossip' aimed at pushing what she said was a 'false narrative.' Democrats portrayed Patel as a dangerous and inexperienced loyalist who would abuse the FBI's law enforcement powers at a time when the country is facing an escalated threat including from China and international terrorism. 'This is a guy whose judgment is beyond questionable. It's appallingly bad,' said Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. He added: 'Mark my words: this Patel guy will come back to haunt you.' Durbin told his colleagues 'we are inviting a political disaster if we put Kash Patel into this job.' Addressing Republicans on the committee, Durbin said, 'I know you want to vote for all these nominations. I know none of you want a call from Elon Musk reminding you what he might do to somebody who votes the wrong way, but this really gets down to the heart of the future of an agency that is critical to the security of this nation.' Republicans, by contrast, praised Patel as the right person for the job, insisting he was needed to fix an FBI that they claim has been tainted by bias amid criminal investigations into Trump. 'The American people are sick and tired of two tiers of access, tiers of treatment and two tiers of justice. And during the Biden years, this was writ large in the acts of the DOJ and the FBI,' said Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Senator Ashley Moody, a Republican from Florida, said that Patel 'might not have served in the upper echelons of the FBI, but aren't we asking this agency to set a new course? Don't we want a nontraditional candidate at this moment in time, with extensive federal experience?' A former Justice Department prosecutor, Patel attracted Trump's attention during his first term when, as a staffer on the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee, he helped author a memo with pointed criticism of the FBI's investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Patel later joined Trump's administration, both as a counterterrorism official at the National Security Council and as chief of staff to the Defense Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-panel-advances-nomination-of-kash-patel-trump-s-pick-to-lead-fbi/7973808.html	2025-02-13T09:10:09-08:00	
Senate confirms Kennedy for top US health post after close vote	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as President Donald Trump's health secretary, putting the prominent vaccine skeptic in control of $1.7 trillion in federal spending, vaccine recommendations and food safety as well as health insurance programs for roughly half the country. Republicans fell in line behind Trump despite hesitancy over Kennedy’s views on vaccines, voting 52-48 to elevate the scion of one of America's most storied political — and Democratic — families to secretary of the Health and Human Services Department. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, who had polio as a child, was the only 'no' vote among Republicans, mirroring his stands against Trump's picks for the Pentagon chief and director of national intelligence. All Democrats opposed Kennedy. The GOP has largely embraced Kennedy's vision to 'Make America Healthy Again' by directing the public health agencies to focus on chronic diseases such as obesity. Kennedy, 71, whose name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has earned a formidable following with his populist and sometimes extreme views on food, chemicals and vaccines. His audience only grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kennedy devoted much of his time to a nonprofit that sued vaccine makers and harnessed social media campaigns to erode trust in vaccines as well as the government agencies that promote them. With Trump's backing, Kennedy insisted he was 'uniquely positioned' to revive trust in those public health agencies, which include the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes for Health. Last week, Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, said he hoped Kennedy 'goes wild' in reining in health care costs and improving Americans' health. But before agreeing to support Kennedy, potential holdout Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican a doctor who leads the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, required assurances that Kennedy would not make changes to existing vaccine recommendations. During Senate hearings, Democrats tried to prod Kennedy to deny a long-discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. Some lawmakers also raised alarms about Kennedy financially benefiting from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers. Kennedy made more than $850,000 last year from an arrangement referring clients to a law firm that has sued the makers of Gardasil, a human papillomavirus vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. If confirmed as health secretary, he promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son. Kennedy will take over the agency amid a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off — even if temporarily — billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs. On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars for medical research given to universities and hospitals to develop treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. Kennedy, too, has called for a staffing overhaul at the NIH, FDA and CDC. Last year, he promised to fire 600 employees at the NIH, the nation's largest funder of biomedical research.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-kennedy-for-top-us-health-post-after-close-vote/7973781.html	2025-02-13T09:05:28-08:00	
Vance visits Dachau concentration camp ahead of Zelenskyy meeting	DACHAU, GERMANY — U.S. Vice President JD Vance visited the Dachau concentration camp memorial on Thursday, walking the solemn halls with a group that included a Holocaust survivor once held at the site of so much suffering and mass murder and experiencing firsthand a powerful symbol of World War II. The tour came amid an ongoing war in Europe in which Vance is serving as a key conduit for the Trump administration. The vice president on Friday has critical talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the three-year Russia-Ukraine conflict. A light rain and sleet mix fell as the vice president and his wife, Usha Vance, spoke to a group of dignitaries near one of the concentration camp's gates. The couple then listened intently to details about the camp from its director and other museum officials. Among those participating was Abba Naor, a Holocaust survivor who was held at Dachau. The second couple, holding hands, eventually moved inside and to a long concrete room in front of a large map plotting concentration camps. The area was Dachau's administrative room. They next saw the intake room, where those interred arrived at the camp. It included a series of museum cases filled with personal belongings of those who were held there, like watches and government ID cards. 'That's where you started?' Vance said to Naor. Both Joe Biden, during the administration of President Barack Obama, and Mike Pence, in Trump's first term, also visited the Dachau memorial as vice presidents. Vance laid a wreath with a red, white and blue ribbon stenciled with 'We remember' and 'United States of America' embossed in gold lettering at a large sculpture known as the International Monument. Inaugurated in 1968, the monument was designed by Nandor Glid, who was persecuted as a Jew by the Nazis in his home country Yugoslavia and joined the resistance to Nazi occupation forces. On Friday, Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, are set to sit down with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. They'll discuss Trump's intensifying push for Ukraine and Russia to begin negotiations to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II. Talk of the current conflict followed Vance getting a firsthand look at the memorial demonstrating Nazis' World War II-era atrocities and the U.S. and Western allies' slowness to take decisive action to confront Adolf Hitler and the rise of his violent nationalist ideology. Dachau was established in 1933, the year Hitler took power, as one of the first concentration camps. More than 200,000 people from across Europe were held at the camp, and more than 40,000 prisoners died there in horrendous conditions. U.S. soldiers completed the liberation on April 29, 1945. Vance, a Republican, is on a five-day visit to France and Germany, his first overseas travel since becoming vice president last month. The moment at Dachau gave Vance a chance to reflect on the scourges of war just as Trump is ratcheting up his efforts to end the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Trump on Wednesday spoke separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy. Trump said that he and Putin agreed it was time to 'start negotiations immediately' to end the war. And, as Trump announced his agreement on negotiations with Putin, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops. Trump subsequently said he thought that analysis was correct, and he was noncommittal about if Ukraine should be an equal partner if the U.S. and Russia engage in more substantive negotiations to end the war on its soil. Besides his talks with Zelenskyy, Vance is scheduled to deliver a Friday address to the security conference. The war in Europe and NATO members' defense spending are expected to be front and center for the world leaders gathering in Munich. Vance, like Trump, has been a sharp critic of U.S. allies' spending what the administration deems too little on their defense budgets. 'The Trump administration has been clear that we care a lot about Europe,' Vance said during a meeting this week with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. 'But we also want to make sure that we're engaged in a security partnership that's both good for Europe and the United States.' Over nearly three years of war, 50 countries, known as the Ukraine Contact Group, have collectively provided Ukraine with more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance, including more than $66.5 billion from the U.S., which has served as chair of the group since its creation. Trump in his 2024 campaign derided the enormous amount of U.S. military aid poured into Ukraine and vowed to end the conflict within 24 hours of returning to the White House. Since his November election victory over Democrat Kamala Harris, Trump and his advisers have dialed back on their boldest timelines and set a goal of ending the war in about six months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-visits-dachau-concentration-camp-ahead-of-zelenskyy-meeting/7973772.html	2025-02-13T08:52:16-08:00	
Ukraine, US weigh critical minerals agreement	Ukraine and the United States are considering a crucial minerals deal at this week's Munich Security Conference, according to officials from the two countries. After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the proposed agreement as a potential 'long-term security shield' for Ukraine when its war with Russia comes to an end. Zelenskyy confirmed that Ukraine had received the first draft of the agreement and expressed hope that a final deal could be reached in Munich. Ukraine aims to secure continued U.S. support as it tries to stand strong against the ongoing Russian invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has stated his desire to strike a deal for Ukraine’s rare earth mineral resources in return for continued U.S. backing of the Ukrainian war effort. 'I told them (Ukraine) that I want the equivalent [of] like $500 billion worth of rare earth,' Trump told Fox News in an interview aired Monday. Strategic resources in shifting global landscape Global competition for critical raw materials essential for industry has intensified in recent years. CRMs in demand include uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite, nickel and aluminum, as well as rare earth minerals used in an array of high-tech devices. Currently, China is the world’s top supplier of rare earth minerals. According to a recent World Economic Forum report, China supplies about 40% of the European Union’s demand for those resources. Other significant suppliers include Australia, South Africa, Canada and Brazil. The United States and the European Union have worked for years to reduce their reliance on China for the minerals. That’s where Ukraine comes in. The United States maintains a list of 50 critical raw materials, and Ukraine possesses at least 22 of the elements, according to Serhii Voitsehovskyi, a board member of Ukrainian mining investment company BGV. That includes significant deposits of rare earth materials, although the minerals are so far mostly untapped due to the war and a lack of sufficient geological data. Proven reserves include some of the world’s largest deposits of graphite, uranium, titanium and lithium — materials essential for many industries, including renewable energy and defense. 'We have the largest lithium deposits in Europe and significant uranium reserves, which are becoming increasingly valuable as nuclear energy experiences a global resurgence,' Voitsehovskyi said. Roman Opimakh, former general director of the Ukrainian Geological Survey, said that the U.S. has become increasingly desperate for reliable sources of CRMs. 'Over the past few years, the U.S. has seen a 24% reduction in CRM production,' he told VOA. 'At the same time, China has moved to ban direct exports of certain materials, favoring value-added products instead. This creates an urgent need for alternative sources, and Ukraine is well-positioned to fill this gap.' Geological diversity The World Economic Forum estimates that Ukraine's rich geological diversity ranks it among the world’s top 10 mineral resource suppliers, holding about 5% of global reserves. China’s dominance in CRM markets stems from decades of strategic investment. Ukraine hopes to develop a similar long-term vision, using its resources to bolster its economy and enhance integration with Western economies. 'For Ukraine, developing this sector is not just about exports — it’s about building a strong local economy that provides jobs and stability. For our international partners, it’s about securing a reliable and democratic source of these essential materials,' Voitsehovskyi said. The continuing Russian invasion — and any peace deal that left Russia in control of Ukraine’s eastern provinces — might complicate those plans. Opimakh says five to 10 key deposits of critical raw materials are in areas occupied by Russian troops. 'These deposits have reserves, proven reserves,' he said. 'Among them are earth elements and lithium, at least, and manganese.' However, he added, 'a majority of critical minerals are located in territory controlled by the Ukrainian government.' Ukraine’s CRM industry needs development Historically, Ukraine has been a significant player in the mining industry, with substantial operations in coal, iron and other commodities. However, the country’s CRM sector is still in its early stages. Unlike established industries, the development of CRM mining requires advanced exploration and processing technologies, areas in which Ukraine is seeking international investment and expertise. 'Mining and processing CRMs in Ukraine can have a transformative effect on Ukraine's economy, providing jobs, infrastructure development and technological advancements,' Opimakh said. 'At the same time, it enhances global security by reducing dependence on a single supplier.' BGV has already invested $100 million in CRM projects; however, Voitsehovskyi said that scaling up operations requires additional financing. 'Developing a graphite mining project in Balakhivka (Kirovohrad region), for example, requires approximately $450 million in capital expenditures,' he said. As Ukraine seeks to establish itself as a key player in the CRM sector, partnerships with the U.S. and other Western countries will be essential, analysts say. The partnerships would be strategic as well as economic; they would ensure a stable and diversified supply of critical materials for the global market while strengthening Ukraine’s post-war recovery and economic growth resilience. 'We believe in a win-win strategy. Ukraine has the resources, and our partners require these materials. Together, we can develop a sustainable, high-value industry that benefits everyone,' Voitsehovskyi said.

Thai lawyers' council to investigate alleged killing by soldiers	Bangkok — An influential lawyers’ association in Thailand said Thursday it is launching an investigation into the alleged killing of a Myanmar man by Thai soldiers last year, a move it says could lead to lawsuits against any officers involved. The Lawyers Council of Thailand, which accredits the country’s attorneys, announced the probe after accepting a formal complaint about the case from Fortify Rights, an international advocacy group that previously carried out an investigation into the case. In a report published last year, Fortify Rights alleged that three unidentified soldiers brutally beat Aung Ko Ko to death with bamboo rods in Baan Tai village, near the Myanmar border, on January 12, 2024, after disputing his membership in a security patrol team made up of local civilians. The courts never charged any soldiers in the case, but convicted another civilian and Myanmar national, Sirachuch, who goes by one name, with manslaughter in September. Fortify Rights claims Sirachuch is being used as a scapegoat. Sirachuch has said he saw the soldiers attack Aung Ko Ko. 'After the Lawyers Council has taken the complaint, we will then investigate the nature and circumstances of the death of Aung Ko Ko. After that, we will take appropriate legal action,' Council President Wichien Chubthaisong told a press conference in Bangkok announcing the move. 'We will set up a subcommittee to conduct a fact-finding operation, hoping this will lead to the consideration of legal aid services and ensure that justice prevails for the family of Aung Ko Ko,' he added. 'Everyone has the right to have their human rights protected and respected under the law. Citizens in general should not be punished arbitrarily,' the chairman said. Afterward, Wichien told VOA the evidence that Fortify Rights has gathered implicating the army appeared credible and that the council could pursue civil or criminal charges against any soldiers it identifies as suspects. 'With credible evidence and a strong case, I think what we can continue to do is to prosecute other people involved in this case,' he said. Neither the Royal Thai Armed Forces nor the Royal Thai Police, which investigated Aung Ko Ko’s death last year and filed the charges that led to Sirachuch’s conviction, replied to VOA’s requests for comment. Fortify Rights says the army has denied any responsibility for Aung Ko Ko’s death, both to local media and a House of Representatives committee hearing, claiming he was tortured on the Myanmar side of the border before his body was dumped on Thai soil. The rights group denies the army’s claim and says it undermines the authorities’ case against Sirachuch, which rests on Thailand having jurisdiction over an attack by Sirachuch on Aung Ko Ko in Thailand. Sirachuch, who is now serving a prison sentence of three years and four months, confessed to striking Aung Ko Ko once on the back and twice on the shins. Fortify Rights, though, says that falls well short of manslaughter. It says the post-mortem report by the hospital that examined Aung Ko Ko’s body states he died of 'head injuries caused by physical assault,' and that three eyewitnesses to the attack, Sirachuch included, claim it was the soldiers who beat Aung Ko Ko on the head. 'This is a grave miscarriage of justice at multiple levels and we are very heartened to see Thai leaders like Dr. Wichien willing to take a closer look at this case,' Fortify Rights CEO Matthew Smith said at Thursday’s press conference. Afterward, Smith said his group pursued the council’s help because of its influence and connections with Thai authorities, especially its links to the Department of Special Investigation, or DSI. The department is a special Ministry of Justice unit that investigates some of the country’s highest profile and sensitive cases, including those that may involve public corruption and abuse of power. Wichien is on the department’s board of special cases, which guides its work and is chaired by Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. 'So, the fact that the Lawyers Council is willing to take a closer look at this case, we hope, is one important step closer to DSI also doing a formal investigation,' Smith told VOA. 'This is the type of situation where DSI can get involved and actually uncover the truth and ensure actual justice takes place,' he added. 'In some ways, DSI can unravel coverups, and DSI has the skills and ability and the influence and power to ensure justice in these really difficult cases.' In its report on Aung Ko Ko’s death, Fortify Rights says it interviewed 23 people during its investigation, including witnesses, acquaintances and relatives, and spoke with local police. It says he had been living in Thailand for many years and was a well-known member of the community’s civilian security team, known locally as Chor Ror Bor, which is trained and organized by Thai authorities. The report says the soldiers who detained Aung Ko Ko the day he died, and who later beat him, disputed his membership in the team, even after other members arrived to vouch for him. After the attack, it adds, Aung Ko Ko, badly bruised and bloodied, was being helped to the Myanmar border by other locals, on orders from the soldiers, when he collapsed and died of his wounds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-lawyers-council-to-investigate-alleged-killing-by-soldiers/7973681.html	2025-02-13T07:43:51-08:00	
Archaeologists unearth remains of Roman basilica on site of new London skyscraper	LONDON — Work to give 21st-century London yet another skyscraper has uncovered traces — in fact chunks — of the city's origins almost 2,000 years ago. Archaeologists exploring the site of a planned 32-story office tower announced Thursday that they have unearthed the remains of a Roman basilica that once stood at the heart of the city known as Londinium. Excavations in the basement of a building slated to be demolished for the tower at 85 Gracechurch St. uncovered flint, brick and ragstone walls and foundations, up to 1 meter (over 3 feet) wide, 4 meters (13 feet) deep and two millennia old. Sophie Jackson of Museum of London Archaeology called it 'one of the most significant discoveries' in years in London's oldest quarter, the City – the square-mile financial district where modern glass high-rises stand atop the remnants of Victorian, medieval and even earlier structures. What's been uncovered are the foundations of a two-story building, almost as big as an Olympic swimming pool. It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D., about three decades after Roman troops invaded Britain and some 20 years after forces of the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca sacked the fledgling settlement. The basilica was part of the forum — the social, political and commercial heart of Roman London — where people went to shop, mingle, seek justice and hear the latest edicts from political leaders. The newly discovered remains are believed to form part of the tribunal, a raised area of the forum where politicians and officials made decisions about the city's governance. It's the 'beating heart of the city,' said Andrew Henderson-Schwartz, head of public impact at Museum of London Archaeology. 'It kind of towers above the city. And so it's a real symbol of Roman power and authority. 'We're talking about the early stages of London here, but it's a real sign of investment in the city, even in its early infancy,' he said. Developer Hertshten Properties, which owns the site and has planning permission for a new office tower, has agreed to incorporate the remains into its plans and put them on display in a visitor center. Henderson-Schwartz said the extent of the 'absolutely massive' foundations discovered in several test pits suggests an 'extraordinary' level of preservation. Further digging could answer intriguing questions, including why the original forum was only used for 20 years before being replaced by a much larger one, which remained in use until the collapse of Roman rule in Britain three centuries later. Items such as writing tablets, styluses, and even ancient trash could give glimpses into the daily lives of Roman Londoners. Property developers in Britain routinely have to consult archaeologists as part of their planning process, a practice that has uncovered finds from Saxon jewelry to medieval ice skates to the skeletons of 14th-century plague victims. The latest discovery adds to the scant traces of Roman London that can be seen around the city, including a section of ancient wall, a portion of amphitheater beneath the Guildhall and a temple to the god Mithras which lies incongruously under the modern headquarters of information company Bloomberg. 'We do have these little windows into Roman London that are all over the city,' Henderson-Schwartz said. 'But this is really in some ways the site that connects them all together. This is the heart of Rome in London, where all the decisions were made.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/archaeologists-unearth-remains-of-roman-basilica-on-site-of-new-london-skyscraper-/7973638.html	2025-02-13T07:42:14-08:00

UNICEF says armed men in eastern DR Congo raped hundreds of children	Dakar, Senegal — Armed men in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo raped hundreds of children and recruited child soldiers at unprecedented levels, the U.N. children's fund said Thursday, as the conflict in the mineral-rich region intensified in recent weeks. 'In the North and South Kivu provinces, we are receiving horrific reports of grave violations against children by parties to the conflict, including rape and other forms of sexual violence at levels surpassing anything we have seen in recent years,' UNICEF's Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement. 'One mother recounted to our staff how her six daughters, the youngest just 12 years old, were systematically raped by armed men while searching for food,' Russell added. More than 100 armed groups are vying for control of Congo's mineral-rich east in a decades-long conflict that has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. The M23 rebels — the most prominent armed group in the region— captured Goma, the region's largest city, in late January in a major escalation of the yearslong fighting with government forces. During the week of Jan. 27 to Feb. 2, health facilities in the restive region reported 572 rape cases, a more than fivefold increase compared to the previous week, Lianne Gutcher, Chief of Communications at UNICEF in the Democratic Republic of Congo, told The Associated Press. 170 of those treated were children, she added. Armed men perpetrated the rapes but it was unclear what specific armed group or army they belonged to, Gutcher said. 'It is suspected that all parties to the conflict committed sexual violence,' she added. Last week, the United Nations Human Rights Council launched a commission that will investigate the atrocities, including rapes and summary executions, committed by both Congo's army and M23 in eastern Congo since the beginning of the year. On Monday, 84 Congolese soldiers accused of murder, rape and other crimes against civilians in the country's conflict-battered east were put on trial.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unicef-says-armed-men-in-eastern-dr-congo-raped-hundreds-of-children/7973628.html	2025-02-13T07:04:54-08:00	
Pakistan, Turkey to boost strategic ties	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan and Turkey pledged to deepen cooperation in defense, mining, energy and other sectors during the seventh round of the Pakistan-Turkey High Level Strategic Cooperation Council in Islamabad on Thursday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan co-chaired the highest-level bilateral discussion forum with Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif. After the closed-door delegation-level talks Thursday, the two sides exchanged 24 signed documents, including a joint declaration, a few agreements, and several memoranda of understanding. 'We have agreed to further strengthen our relations,' Erdogan said in remarks broadcast live after the talks. The text of the joint declaration was not released. However, a brief statement from Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it 'gives a roadmap for further deepening, diversifying and institutionalizing the strategic partnership between Pakistan and Turkey.' Sharif and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari welcomed the Turkish leader Wednesday night at a military airbase near the capital with much fanfare. From a 21-gun salute to a fighter jet flyby and traditional Pakistani dancers on the motorcade’s route, to a special song honoring Erdogan blaring across TV channels, Islamabad pulled out all the stops for the Turkish president, who returned after five years for a brief visit ending Thursday night. Broad cooperation Both sides agreed to cooperate in air force electronic warfare and to collaborate on defense production, with a memorandum of understanding, or MoU, signed between Turkey’s Secretariat of Defense Industries and Pakistan’s Ministry of Defense Production and another MoU between Turkey’s state-owned Aerospace Industries and Pakistan’s Naval Research and Development Institute. Over the last decade Pakistan and Turkey have ramped up defense production cooperation. That cooperation includes joint production of four MILGEM corvette warships for delivery to Pakistan, helping the South Asian country upgrade its aging fighter jet fleet, and the sharing and transfer of defense technologies. Pakistan and Turkey also agreed to upgrade their existing trade agreement and reiterated a past pledge to boost annual bilateral trade volume to $5 billion from roughly $1.5 billion. In May 2023, the two signed a Preferential Trade Agreement, reducing Pakistani tariffs on 130 product categories, while Turkey cut down tariffs on 261 product lines. Sharif announced Turkish firms will build a special economic zone in Pakistan for industrial production, despite Pakistan’s struggle to attract investment to special economic zones set up as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Both sides agreed on a protocol to amend their existing agreement of cooperation in the field of hydrocarbons and signed an MoU to help Pakistan’s energy transition. The South Asian country is aiming to decrease reliance on expensive foreign fuel and transition to affordable and abundant green energy. Pakistan reached an MoU with Turkey on mining cooperation as well, a sector Islamabad is anxious to bring foreign investment to. Under the bilateral strategic cooperation council, six joint standing committees cover a broad array of sectors, including trade, investment, banking, finance, culture, tourism, energy, defense, agriculture, transportation, communication, IT, health, science and technology, and education. Both sides signed cooperation documents in almost all the fields. In his brief remarks after the talks, Sharif pledged to fight terrorism jointly with Turkey. The Pakistani leader then singled out Afghanistan as a source of the violence. 'Afghanistan is a neighboring country, and we expect that Afghanistan will cooperate in fighting terrorism and not spreading terrorism and in that we are together,' Sharif said. Although Erdogan expressed support for Pakistan’s fight against terrorism in his remarks, the Turkish leader stopped short of naming Afghanistan as a root cause. Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers reject accusation of harboring anti-Pakistan fighters on their soil. Critical timing The two allies held their highest-level dialogue at a critical time in the Middle East. 'We discussed not only our bilateral relations but also regional and global developments extensively,' Erdogan said. The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria has strengthened Ankara’s position in the region, but it has also put Turkey in direct competition with Israel, whose troops have advanced into Syrian territory. 'Turkey understands that increasing defense and strategic ties with countries like Pakistan, another established middle-sized defense power, are even more for interest for Turkey,' Umer Karim, a researcher at the University of Birmingham, told VOA. 'Sharing bilateral defense production technologies and learning is a key aspect,' Karim said. The civil war in Syria also has deeply affected militancy in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Fighters from those countries fought alongside Syrian militias. But Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K, a regional offshoot of the terror outfit IS, has brought more violence to the two South Asian neighbors. With Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, or HTS, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, now controlling Syria, security observers say Ankara and Islamabad need help from each other to manage nonstate actors. 'With Shia militias and movement from various nonstate actors, from Sunni militias moving into Syria as well, and now that the conflict has subsided, their ultimate return and its impact on the region is going to play a tremendous amount of role,' Iftikhar Firdaus, editor of The Khorasan Diary, told VOA. The online platform monitors militant activity. A delegation of Turkish corporate leaders joined Erdogan on the visit to boost trade ties with Pakistan. Sharif and Erdogan also addressed the Pakistan-Turkey Business Forum in Islamabad on Thursday. 'Turkey can explore Pakistan in two ways,' Khurram Schehzad, advisor to Pakistan’s finance minister, told VOA. 'One is as an investment corridor; the second is that Pakistan can become Turkey’s export hub into the Asia-Pacific region.' Schehzad acknowledged that despite deep strategic and people-to-people ties, Pakistan and Turkey have failed to develop a strong economic relationship. 'What I would like to have is, how the follow-up is done post-MoUs and how that MoU is converted into value,' Schehzad said. The previous session of the Pakistan-Turkey High Level Strategic Cooperation Council was held in Islamabad in February 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-turkey-to-boost-strategic-ties/7973580.html	2025-02-13T06:48:11-08:00	
China's fuel demand may have passed its peak, IEA says	London — China's demand for road and air transport fuels may have passed its peak, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said Thursday, citing data showing that the country's consumption of gasoline, gasoil and jet fuel declined marginally in 2024. Combined consumption of the three fuels in China last year was at 8.1 million barrels per day (bpd), which was 200,000 bpd lower than in 2021 and only narrowly above 2019 levels, the IEA said in a monthly report. 'This strongly suggests that fuel use in the country has already reached a plateau and may even have passed its peak,' it said. After decades of leading global oil demand growth, China's contribution is sputtering as it faces economic challenges as well as making a shift to electric vehicles (EVs). The decline in China's fuel demand is likely to accelerate over the medium term, which would be enough to generate a plateau in total China oil demand this decade, according to the Paris-based IEA. 'This remarkable slowdown in consumption growth has been achieved by a combination of structural changes in China's economy and the rapid deployment of alternative transportation technologies,' the IEA said. A slump in China’s construction sector and weaker consumer spending reduced fuel demand in the country, it said, adding that uptake of EVs also weighed. New EVs currently account for half of car sales and undercut around 250,000-300,000 bpd of oil demand growth in 2024, while use of compressed and liquified natural gas in road freight displaced around 150,000 bpd, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-fuel-demand-may-have-passed-its-peak-iea-says/7973458.html	2025-02-13T04:53:27-08:00	
Driver hits crowd in Munich, injuring 20	A driver drove a car into a crowd in Munich, Germany, on Thursday, injuring at least 20 people. Police said the driver was detained and no longer presented a danger. The incident took place as members of a service workers' union held a demonstration. Authorities said two of the people hurt had serious injuries. It was not immediately clear if the incident was intentional or an accident. The city is due to host the Munich Security Conference beginning Friday. Conference organizers issued a statement saying they were 'deeply saddened' by the incident. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driver-hits-crowd-in-munich-injuring-20/7973430.html	2025-02-13T04:25:32-08:00	
Anti-government protest halts air traffic in Belgium	Brussles — Thousands of Belgians took to the streets on Thursday in protest over the new government's planned pension reforms in the first day of a multi-day strike that halted all air traffic in the country. Brussels airport canceled 430 flights on Thursday, a spokesperson said, adding that the disruption to the air traffic sector would last just one day. Protesters held signs with slogans such as 'We're not lemons,' and some displayed plaques featuring Latin phrases, a nod to new Prime Minister Bart De Wever's tendency to include Latin quotes whenever possible. The strike was also expected to disrupt public transport and postal services, with firefighters and military personnel joining the protests as well. The planned pension reform rewards those who work past retirement age, with 35 years of service, while early retirees without 35 years, face a penalty. The new system is less favorable for lower-income earners compared to the previous one, which provided a lump sum based on career length. Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever's government was sworn in on Feb. 3, after eight months of negotiations that resulted in a five-party coalition including right-wing, centrist, and socialist party, Vooruit. The socialist union had warned that a strike would be called if Vooruit joined the predominantly center-right government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anti-government-protest-halts-air-traffic-in-belgium/7973406.html	2025-02-13T03:53:57-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon back in court for impeachment hearing	Seoul — South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol will get another hearing next week before judges decide on whether to formally remove him from office over his martial law decree, the country's Constitutional Court said Thursday. The former prosecutor has remained defiant throughout weeks of hearings, blaming a 'malicious' opposition for his December bid to suspend civilian rule. The attempt only lasted six hours as the opposition-led parliament voted the declaration down and later impeached him over the move. Yoon was detained last month on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested. Thursday's hearing was widely expected -- but not officially confirmed -- to be Yoon's last before the judges go behind closed doors to deliberate upholding his impeachment. But as proceedings wrapped up, the court said it would add another hearing next Tuesday. Prosecutors had argued the 'time was ripe' for the case to be decided while Yoon's lawyer Yoon Kap-keun told the hearing that the impeachment trial 'continues to be conducted in an unlawful and unfair manner.' Yoon's legal team also warned they would 'make a serious decision' if that persists, though they did not specify what action would be taken. 'Unanimous ruling' expected Following the trial, the process could take up to a fortnight. Previously impeached presidents Park Geun-hye and Roh Moo-hyun had to wait 11 and 14 days, respectively, to learn their fates. If the court upholds the impeachment, an election must be held within 60 days to choose a new president. 'Many legal scholars and experts agree that a unanimous ruling in favor of impeachment will be made by the Constitutional Court judges,' Kim Hyun-jung, a researcher at the Korea University Institute of Law, told AFP. But experts had warned that political wrangling could hold up the trial -- prominent Yoon supporters have called for more hearings. Much of Yoon's impeachment trial has centered on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war. Yoon's lawyers told reporters on Thursday that his martial law declaration was 'an act of governance and cannot be subject to judicial review.' Yoon also suggested last week that even if he had ordered the arrest of MPs to prevent them from voting down his decree, it would not legally matter because it had not been carried out. The suspended president's supporters have gathered outside the court throughout his weeks-long trial. Some have held 'Stop the Steal' signs -- borrowing U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric to support unproven claims that recent South Korean elections were manipulated by shadowy foreign forces. Yoon's legal team announced it would officially launch a 'citizen defense team' of supporters seeking to 'save' him and have him reinstated. According to the lawyers, 15,000 people have applied to join the team. Yoon is also facing a separate criminal trial on insurrection charges, for which he faces a prison sentence or the death penalty. That trial is set to begin next Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-back-in-court-for-impeachment-hearing/7973402.html	2025-02-13T03:45:54-08:00	
Chinese apps face scrutiny in US but users keep scrolling	Seoul — As a high school junior in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, Daneel Kutsenko never gave much thought to China. Last month, though, as the U.S. government prepared to ban TikTok – citing national security concerns about its Chinese ownership – Kutsenko downloaded RedNote, another Chinese video-sharing app, which he felt gave him a new perspective on China. 'It just seems like people who live their life and have fun,' Kutsenko told VOAof RedNote, which reportedly attracted hundreds of thousands of U.S. users in the leadup to the now-paused TikTok ban. Kutsenko’s move is part of a larger trend. Even as U.S. policymakers grow louder in their warnings about Chinese-owned apps, they have become a central part of American life. TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, boasts 170 million U.S. users. China’s AI chatbot DeepSeek surged to the top of Apple’s App Store rankings, including those in the United States, for several days after its release last month. Another major shift has come in online shopping, where Americans are flocking to digital Chinese marketplaces such as Temu and Shein in search of ultra-low prices on clothes, home goods, and other items. According to a 2024 survey by Omnisend, an e-commerce marketing company, 70% of Americans shopped on Chinese platforms during the past year, with 20% doing so at least once a week. Multifaceted threat U.S. officials warn that Chinese apps pose a broad range of threats – whether to national security, privacy, human rights, or the economy. TikTok has been the biggest target. Members of Congress attempting to ban the app cited concerns that China’s government could use TikTok as an intelligence-gathering tool or manipulate its algorithms to push narratives favorable to Beijing. Meanwhile, Chinese commerce apps face scrutiny for their rock-bottom prices, which raise concerns about ethical sourcing and potential links to forced labor, Sari Arho Havrén, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research organization, said in an email conversation with VOA. 'It raises questions of how sustainably these products are made,' Havrén, who focuses on China’s foreign policy and great power competition, said. Moreover, he said, 'the pricing simply kills local manufacturers and businesses.' Many U.S. policymakers also warn Chinese apps pose greater privacy risks, since Chinese law requires companies to share data with the government on request. ‘Curiosity and defiance’ Still, a growing number of Americans appear unfazed. Many young people in particular seem to shrug off the privacy concerns, arguing that their personal data is already widely exposed. 'They could get all the data they want. And anyway, I’m 16 – what are they going to find? Oh my gosh, he goes to school? There’s not much,' Kutsenko said. Ivy Yang, an expert on U.S.-China digital interaction, told VOA many young Americans also find it unlikely that they would ever be caught up in a Chinese national security investigation. 'What they’re chasing is a dopamine peak. They’re not thinking about whether or not the dance videos or the cat tax pictures they swipe on RedNote are going to be a national security threat,' Yang, who founded the New York-based consulting company Wavelet Strategy, said. Yang said the TikTok ban backlash and surge in RedNote downloads may reflect a shift in how young Americans see China – not just as a geopolitical rival, but as a source of apps they use in daily life. She also attributes their skepticism to a broader cultural mindset – one shaped by a mix of curiosity, defiance, and a growing distrust of institutions, including conventional media. Jeremy Goldkorn, a longtime analyst of U.S.-China digital trends and an editorial fellow at the online magazine ChinaFile, said growing disillusionment with America’s political turmoil and economic uncertainty has intensified these shifts. 'It makes it much more difficult for, particularly, young people to get worked up about what China’s doing when they feel so horrified about their own country,' Goldkorn said during a recent episode of the Sinica podcast, which focuses on current affairs in China. Polling reflects this divide. A 2024 Pew survey found 81% of Americans view China unfavorably, but younger adults are less critical – only 27% of those under 30 have strongly negative views, compared to 61% of those 65 and older. Digital barrier While Chinese apps are expanding in the United States, in many ways the digital divide remains as impenetrable as ever. China blocks nearly all major Western platforms and tightly controls its own apps, while the U.S. weighs new restrictions on Chinese tech. Though President Donald Trump paused the TikTok ban, his administration has signaled broader efforts to curb China’s tech influence. Trump officials have hinted they could take steps to regulate DeepSeek, the Chinese digital chatbot. The Trump administration also recently signaled it intends to close a trade loophole that lets Chinese retailers bypass import duties and customs checks. Broader challenges Even as Washington debates how to handle the rise of Chinese apps, some analysts say the conversation risks obscuring the deeper issue of the broader role of social media itself. Rogier Creemers, a specialist in digital governance at Leiden University, told VOA that while Chinese apps may raise valid concerns for Western countries, they are just one part of a larger, unaddressed problem. 'There’s a whole range of social ills that emerge from these social media that I think are far more important than anything the Chinese Communist Party could do,' he said, pointing to issues like digital addiction, declining attention spans, and the way social media amplifies misinformation and political unseriousness. 'And that would apply whether these apps are Chinese-owned or American-owned or Tajikistani-owned, as far as I’m concerned,' he added. The United States, Creemer said, has taken a more hands-off approach to regulating online platforms, in part due to strong free speech protections and pushback by the tech industry. Apps or influence? For millions of Americans, the bigger debates about China and digital influence barely register when they open TikTok. Kutsenko said neither he nor his friends have strong opinions about U.S.-China tensions. They just wanted an alternative to TikTok – one that felt fun, familiar, and easy to use. It’s a sign that while policymakers see Chinese apps as part of a growing tech rivalry, for many Americans they’re just another way to scroll, shop, and stay entertained, no matter where they come from.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-apps-face-scrutiny-in-us-but-users-keep-scrolling/7973393.html	2025-02-13T03:36:15-08:00	
Several injured after motorist hits crowd of people in Munich	BERLIN — A motorist has driven a car into a group of people in the German city of Munich, leaving several people injured, police said on Thursday. The Bild newspaper reported that 15 people had been injured. The Munich Security Conference is to start on Friday and U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy are scheduled to arrive later Thursday. A large-scale police operation was underway near the southern city's central train station. Police said on X they were able to detain the driver and did not consider him to pose further threat. The incident appears to have affected people participating in a demonstration linked to a strike organized by the Verdi union, according to the local BR broadcaster. The union said it did not have any information on the incident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/several-injured-after-motorist-hits-crowd-of-people-in-munich/7973359.html	2025-02-13T02:39:33-08:00	
Hamas expresses commitment to ceasefire with Israel	The militant group Hamas expressed its commitment to a ceasefire with Israel on Thursday, as mediators worked to preserve the halt in fighting amid accusations of violations and threats of a return to war. 'We are not interested in the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, and we are keen on its implementation and ensuring that the occupation (Israel) adheres to it fully,' Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua said. Qanoua also criticized what he called 'language of threats and intimidation' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they do not help the implementation of the ceasefire. Hamas earlier this week accused Israel of violating the deal by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed on Saturday, and Trump said Monday that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not returned. On Wednesday, after Israel called up military reservists, the country’s Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated Trump’s warning. 'If Hamas stops the hostage releases, then there is no ceasefire and there is war,' he said. He added that the fighting would be more intense and would 'allow the realization of Trump's vision for Gaza.' Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-expresses-commitment-to-ceasefire-with-israel/7973353.html	2025-02-13T02:32:10-08:00	
Russian drone attack hits Odesa port infrastructure	Ukrainian officials said Thursday a Russian drone attack injured one person and damaged port infrastructure in the southern region of Odesa. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said the attack hit the Izmail area, which is located along the Danube River. Close to the same area, Romania’s Ministry of National Defense said Thursday its systems detected a drone crossing into Romanian airspace before going into Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement it 'strongly condemns these attacks conducted by the Russian Federation against certain Ukrainian civilian infrastructure facilities and elements, which are unjustified and severely breaching the norms of international law.' Moldova, which shares borders with Ukraine and Romania in the same region, reported Thursday that two Russian drones exploded on its soil. Moldovan President Maia Sandu said the incident put the lives of people in her country as risk. 'Russia respects no borders, attacks civilians, spreads terror,' Sandu said on X. 'Its war on Ukraine is criminal. Leave us, peaceful nations, alone.' Ukraine’s military said Thursday it shot down 85 of the 140 total drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava and Sumy regions, the military said. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that drone, artillery and missile attacks damaged 10 houses, along with a business, powerlines and a gas pipeline. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed 83 Ukrainian drones, mostly in regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Nearly half of the drones were shot down over the Bryansk region, where an official said there were no reports of damage or casualties. Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said the attacks damaged several houses in his region. Some information for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-hits-odesa-port-infrastructure/7973347.html	2025-02-13T02:03:10-08:00	
Suicide bombing at Afghan ministry kills 1, injures several	ISLAMABAD — Taliban officials said Thursday a suicide bomb explosion outside a ministry building in the Afghan capital of Kabul killed at least one person and injured several others. The blast occurred when security guards at the entrance to the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing intercepted and killed a suicide bomber, an Interior Ministry spokesperson told VOA. Abdul Mateen Qani confirmed the casualties, saying a member of Taliban security was killed, and three others were wounded in the ensuing explosion. No immediate claims of responsibility were made, but suspicions fell on a regional Islamic State group affiliate, Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K. The attack came two days after IS-K took credit for a suicide bombing outside a bank in the northeastern Afghan city of Kunduz that killed at least five people and wounded several others. Multiple sources reported that the victims of the Tuesday blast were predominantly Taliban security personnel who had assembled to collect their salaries. IS-K has plotted repeated high-profile attacks since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. The violence has killed hundreds of people, including senior Taliban leaders, religious figures and members of the Afghan Shiite community. The back-to-back bombings this week followed the Taliban’s renewed claims that their security forces nearly eliminated IS-K presence in the country, rendering the group incapable of posing a threat within or beyond Afghan borders. The United Nations and independent critics remain skeptical about the Taliban’s assertions. U.N. counterterrorism officials warned during a Security Council meeting on Monday that IS-K is one of the 'most dangerous' Islamic State branches and 'continued to pose a significant threat in Afghanistan, the region and beyond.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/suicide-bombing-at-afghan-ministry-kills-1-injures-several/7973342.html	2025-02-13T01:48:14-08:00

US allies seek clarity on Ukraine support at Munich Security Conference	LONDON — Hundreds of world leaders and delegates are set to attend the Munich Security Conference in Germany this weekend, with conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo high on the agenda, alongside simmering tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. It’s the first major global summit for the new administration in Washington under President Donald Trump and comes amid speculation that his America First agenda could presage significant changes in U.S. foreign policy. US delegation The U.S. delegation includes Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 'We are very happy that we will have a strong representation of both the administration of the new American government there, as well as representation from Congress,' said conference chairman Christoph Heusgen. 'And so, the American point of view will also be presented on stage, as will the European point of view, and that of other regions. And then, and that is what Munich stands for, there will be a dialogue, a discussion about the many issues at hand,' Heusgen told Reuters. Vance is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Munich. Ukraine’s war against Russia’s full-scale invasion is about to enter its fourth year. Zelenskyy said this week he shared a 'common vision' with the Trump administration. 'Of course, there may be different opinions, but a common vision of the main things — of how to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and how to give guarantees of security to Ukraine and Ukrainians,' Zelenskyy told reporters on Monday. 'Unrealistic' However, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that American troops would not be deployed to Ukraine following any ceasefire deal with Russia and ruled out NATO membership for Kyiv. He also described Ukraine’s hopes to return to its pre-2014 borders with Russia as unrealistic. 'European allies must lead from the front,' Hegseth told reporters in Brussels following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. President Trump has made clear he wants a quick end to the war but it’s not clear how that might be achieved. Trump announced Wednesday he and Putin agreed in a phone call to 'immediately' begin negotiations with Ukraine to bring an end to the nearly three-year-conflict. NATO allies Nevertheless, U.S. allies sense a change in tone from the president since his inauguration last month, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based research group. 'Though Trump has said a lot of things to worry a lot of people on tariffs, on trade, on Gaza and so on, he hasn't yet said anything particularly crazy from a European point of view about Ukraine or NATO. He hasn't repeated his threat to pull out of NATO. He said the Europeans should spend more [on defense] but most of us agree with him on that. He hasn't said he's going to cut off all aid for Ukraine,' Grant told VOA. 'One of the issues that will come up in Munich is to what extent the Europeans should help to keep the peace if there is a ceasefire in Ukraine. And certainly, President [Emmanuel] Macron of France, and to some degree the British, and possibly Friedrich Merz who may well be the next German chancellor, are all in favor of sending troops to keep the peace in Ukraine, if there's a peace to be kept,' Grant added. Ukrainian hopes On the streets of Kyiv, some Ukrainians expressed hope that the Munich conference will strengthen Ukrainian ties with the Trump administration. 'We hope that this personal meeting between President Zelenskyy and Vice President Vance will give an opportunity to convey the real situation of what is happening today in the Russian-Ukrainian war,' sociologist Asked Ashurbekov told The Associated Press. Ukrainian journalist Borden Semeniuk was less optimistic. 'The country has been living in expectation for three years, and because of this, belief in this expectation has decreased. ... I would like to see some relief from the situation. But it is impossible to live in the hope that it will 100 percent happen at this meeting,' Semeniuk told AP. Russia and Iran have not been invited to Munich. Last year, the conference organizers said their governments had not shown a serious interest in negotiations. China The official report of the Munich Security Conference cites the 'multipolarization of the international order' — a theme welcomed by China, which is sending a large delegation to the summit. 'The report shows that the international community's acceptance of a multipolar world is on the rise. … China has always called for an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization,' Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday. Earlier this week, the U.S Navy sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait, prompting an angry response from Beijing. China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent months. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that someday will be reunified with the mainland, while Taipei considers the island a sovereign state. Secretary of State Rubio is due to hold a trilateral meeting with allies Japan and South Korea while in Munich. Gaza Conflict in the Middle East will also top the agenda at the Munich conference, amid fears that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is at risk. President Trump’s repeated suggestion that Palestinians should leave Gaza will overshadow the conference, said analyst Charles Grant. 'I don't see it happening because you can't just eliminate 2 million people and put them nowhere at all,' Grant said. 'But I think most European governments are hoping that Trump will just push this for a while, and he'll get bored of it and talk about something else – and hope he will kind of move on and forget it. But so long as he does talk about it, it's very disruptive and creates a lot of ill-feeling between European and many other governments, and the U.S.,' Grant told VOA. The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Climate change, energy security and artificial intelligence also feature on a packed agenda across the three-day conference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-allies-seek-clarity-on-ukraine-support-at-munich-security-conference/7972522.html	2025-02-13T00:09:48-08:00

Gas explosion at Taiwan food court kills 4, leaves 8 hospitalized	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A gas explosion at a department store in Taiwan on Thursday killed four people and left eight hospitalized, fire authorities said. The blast occurred at the food court on the 12th floor of the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store in Taichung city, the Taichung Fire Bureau said. Among the dead were two people visiting from Macau, while a third was severely injured, Macao's Tourism Office confirmed Thursday. Local media reported that they were part of a family of seven who were there for tourism. Dozens of firefighters were deployed to the scene at about 11:30 a.m. Parts of the building's exterior were damaged and scattered fragments were strewn on the streets. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen told reporters at the scene that she felt the shock at her office nearby. She said the fire bureau would focus on a rescue operation first, but an investigation was also underway and officers were checking whether there were other sources of danger. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te said he had asked all relevant government agencies to investigate the cause of the accident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gas-explosion-at-taiwan-food-court-kills-4-leaves-8-hospitalized/7973306.html	2025-02-13T00:01:27-08:00	
China's 2024 coal power construction hits 10-year high, researchers say	SINGAPORE — China started construction on 94.5 gigawatts of coal-fired power in 2024, the highest volume of new builds since 2015, hampering the country's transition away from fossil fuels, researchers said in a report published on Thursday. The world's biggest coal consumer and emitter of climate-warming greenhouse gases had vowed to 'strictly control' coal power over the 2021-25 period, but power shortage concerns have led to a spike in new projects since 2023. 'If coal maintains a high share in China's power system for too long, it will be much harder to achieve a rapid decline in emissions,' said Qi Qin, researcher at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). 'This, in turn, could pose challenges for global climate efforts, especially at a time when countries are expected to increase their ambitions for 2035 targets,' said Qi, the report's lead author. The surge came despite a record-breaking increase in renewable capacity last year and could make it harder to connect clean power to the grid, said the report, published by CREA and the Global Energy Monitor (GEM) think tank. China has retired more than 100 GW of obsolete coal-fired power in the last decade, according to its energy regulator, and new projects can only be built to provide back-up for renewable energy bases. China also commissioned 356 GW of wind and solar last year, meeting its 2030 target of 1,200 GW of renewable capacity six years ahead of schedule. Renewable power, however, is struggling to compete for space on China's grid, with utilization rates falling sharply near the end of last year, Thursday's report said. China has promised to start cutting coal use over the 2026-2030 five-year plan period as it works to bring its emissions to a peak before the end of the decade. This has created incentives for the industry to lock in as much coal capacity as it can ahead of new restrictions that could come into effect as early as next year. 'China's current push for new coal power is primarily driven by industry interests that are advancing coal expansion under the banner of energy security,' said Qi. 'These groups recognize the constraints imposed by the 2030 carbon peak and 2060 carbon neutrality targets and are moving quickly to secure growth before the window narrows,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-2024-coal-power-construction-hits-10-year-high-researchers-say/7973302.html	2025-02-12T23:52:13-08:00	
Syrian minister makes first trip to EU as powers look to aid transition	PARIS — Syria's foreign minister will attend an international conference in Paris on Thursday as regional and Western powers seek to shield the country during its fragile transition amid ongoing instability across the region. Asaad Hassan al-Shibani is leading a delegation for a first trip to the European Union since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad and days after President Emmanuel Macron invited Syria's U.N.-sanctioned President Ahmed al-Sharaa to France. 'This Paris meeting, in a way, is to help create a protective bubble around the Syria crisis, to give them time to resolve it by dissuading the bad losers from destabilizing the country,' a French official said. Regional ministers, including from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Lebanon, will be joined with Western partners, although the United States will have merely a low-level diplomatic presence. The meeting aims to coordinate efforts to bring a peaceful transition, ensuring the country's sovereignty and security, mobilize Syria's main neighbors and partners to coordinate aid and economic support, the French foreign ministry said. It will also discuss transitional justice and the fight against impunity. The conference does not aim to raise funds, which will be left to an annual pledging conference in Brussels in March, but issues such as the lifting of sanctions would be discussed. The EU has moved forward in lifting some sanctions, although that still remains blocked amid opposition from Cyprus and Greece amid concerns over maritime delimitation talks between Syria and Turkey and assurances that sanctions could be restored quickly, two diplomats said. They said they were hopeful a compromise could be reached this month. Ahead of the meeting, main international donors will also take stock of the humanitarian situation, notably in northeastern Syria, where the impact of U.S. aid cuts has had a 'terrifying' impact, according to a European official. Officials also said the subject of Western-backed Kurdish Syrian forces, the central government and Turkey, which deems part of those forces as terrorist groups, would also be discussed. A Turkish diplomatic source said Deputy Foreign Minister Nuh Yilmaz, who will attend the meeting, would 'draw attention to the threats Syria is facing, namely the separatist terrorist organization, and emphasize our country's determination regarding the total clearance of the country from terror elements.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-minister-makes-first-trip-to-eu-as-powers-look-to-aid-transition/7973296.html	2025-02-12T23:10:38-08:00	
NATO defense ministers to discuss military spending, Ukraine aid	NATO defense ministers are set to meet Thursday in Brussels to discuss defense spending targets, boosting their industrial capacity and their support to Ukraine. The ministerial meeting comes amid a U.S. push for NATO allies to commit more of their domestic budgets to defense. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte expressed support for the U.S. position ahead of the talks, saying if allies do not spend more, then they will not have the necessary deterrents against foes such as Russia in place. Rutte also is urging allies to work on boosting defense production capacities in order to boost stockpiles and to be able to provide more for Ukraine’s defense against the Russian invasion that began in early 2022. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group Wednesday that while the U.S. wants a 'sovereign and prosperous Ukraine,' allies must recognize that going back to the Ukrainian borders that existed before Russia moved into Crimea in 2014 is an 'unrealistic objective.' Hegseth advocated for a negotiated end to the war with security guarantees backed by European and non-European troops that are deployed under a non-NATO mission. He ruled out deploying any U.S. troops to Ukraine. Following Thursday’s NATO ministerial, Hegseth heads to Poland for what the Pentagon said will be talks with leaders about 'bilateral defense cooperation, continued deterrence efforts along NATO's eastern flank, and Poland's leadership as a model ally in defense investment and burden-sharing in NATO.'

Modi, Trump to meet with focus on trade, immigration, strategic ties	NEW DELHI — U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks Thursday at the White House. Officials in New Delhi expressed optimism Modi’s visit will herald a renewed and substantive partnership. However, analysts said there will be contentious issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among Trump’s top priorities. Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his taking office, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri – the ministry’s top civil servant — said India-U.S. ties are solid and that 'this has been one of our strongest international partnerships.' Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named India among countries that are 'very big tariff abusers.' In a phone conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, repeated such concerns on Monday. 'India has enormously high' tariffs that lock out imports, he said in an interview with CNBC. New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S., announced earlier this month that it would lower import duties on some items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles and cars. It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods gain Indian market access and boost energy imports from the U.S., analysts say. 'New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,' said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. 'India also bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that will benefit both.' For India, the stakes are high -- the United States is its largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion, with an Indian surplus of about $32 billion in 2023. India has not been affected so far by Trump’s tariff impositions – the latest 25% tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports will have an only marginal affect on India, as New Delhi is a small exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials. Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and technology. In the recent phone conversation with Modi, Trump had called on Modi to increase procurement of U.S.-made security equipment India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has been purchasing more arms from countries such as France, Israel and the United States. 'The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India [security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,' according to Rahul Bedi, a defense analyst in New Delhi. 'There is likely to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.' Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by opposition parties. Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better treatment during future deportations. At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields, such as technology. 'People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our deepening ties with the United States,' Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns about the transport and treatment of the deportees. In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their collaboration in Trump’s first term. Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts say the two countries have convergence on geostrategic issues. 'It was President Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad, which was in a dormant state for about 10 years, and he was solely responsible for reviving it,' said Mahapatra. 'This is an area where both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace, stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/modi-trump-to-meet-with-focus-on-trade-immigration-strategic-ties/7973280.html	2025-02-12T21:51:46-08:00

Austria’s far-right leader fails to form a government after coalition talks collapse	Talks in Austria to form a coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party and the conservative People’s Party collapsed Wednesday after the two sides failed to agree on disputed policy points. The coalition talks were the latest in a series of negotiations that have failed since parliamentary elections were held in September. Herbert Kickl’s Freedom Party, with its anti-immigration platform and opposition to the European Union’s support of Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, took almost 29% of the vote, pushing then-Chancellor Karl Nehammer's People's Party into second place. However, Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen did not give the Freedom Party leader the mandate to form a coalition government until January, after attempts to form a coalition bloc without Kickl’s party failed. There has not been a far-right leading party in Austria’s government since World War II. The president said Wednesday in a nationally televised address that Austria now has four options to move out of its political dilemma. He said a snap election, which would take at least three months to mount, could be held, or a minority government could lead Austria. Another option is for Austrian politicians to engage in talks once again to form a coalition with a majority. The fourth option, the president said, would be for a temporary government of experts to take on the job of leading Austria. Van der Bellen said he will soon discuss the options with fellow politicians to determine which 'could be successful, as quickly as possible, for as long as necessary.' The president also called on the political parties to engage in the spirit of compromise during their negotiations, something he said he felt was missing. Analysts thought the far-right and conservative parties could form a coalition, but challenges emerged during their discussions, including policy differences and ministry assignments. Kickl said in a letter to the president that there was no point in negotiating with the center-left Social Democrats, the only other party with which the Freedom Party could reach a parliamentary majority. 'I do not take this step without regret,' Kickl said in the letter. 'Austria has no time to waste.'

Negotiators work to preserve Israel-Hamas ceasefire	While mediators were working to preserve a fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, Israel called up military reservists and the nation’s defense minister echoed U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not released Saturday. A Hamas official told The Associated Press there were positive signals three hostages would be released as planned, but the group was waiting to hear if Israel would honor the current ceasefire agreement. Egyptian and Qatari mediators were working to preserve the truce, according to Egypt's state-run Al-Qahera News TV, which is close to the country's security agencies. An Egyptian official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said the two sides were working on a deal to preserve the ceasefire, AP reported. The monthlong ceasefire came under threat earlier this week when Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror organization, accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire by continuing airstrikes on people in Gaza and blocking aid. The group said future hostage releases would be postponed. According to Hamas, 92 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began and more than 800 have been wounded. Israel said people have been shot if they approached troops or entered certain areas in violation of the agreement. The United Nations said 1.2 million people have been fed and more than 600,000 have received shelter since the ceasefire began Jan. 19. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said fighting would resume if more captives were not freed on Saturday, and Trump said Monday that 'all hell would break out' if hostages were not returned. On Wednesday, after Israel called up military reservists, the country’s Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated Trump’s warning. 'If Hamas stops the hostage releases, then there is no ceasefire and there is war,' he said. He added that the fighting would be more intense and would 'allow the realization of Trump's vision for Gaza.' Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. 'Hamas ... will not accept the language of American and Israeli threats,' Hamas spokesperson Hazaem Qassem said in a statement. 'Contacts are underway with mediator countries to conclude the implementation of the ceasefire deal.' The U.S. president’s vision has elicited anger from the Arab world. Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected any plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, saying Wednesday that such resettlement would be 'unacceptable.' Aboul Gheit told the World Governments Summit that the proposal to move the roughly 2 million Palestinians out of Gaza would push the region into a cycle of crises with a 'damaging effect on peace and stability.' 'It's unacceptable for the Arab world, which has fought this idea for 100 years,' Aboul Gheit said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II said after talks Tuesday with Trump that he reiterated his country’s 'steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.' 'Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,' Abdullah said on X. He highlighted what he said was Trump’s 'instrumental' role in securing a ceasefire in Gaza and called on the United States and all stakeholders to ensure the halt in fighting holds. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.

North Korea dismantling facility near border for separated families, Seoul says	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea is dismantling a facility at its Mount Kumgang resort used for hosting meetings between families separated after the Korean War, South Korea said on Thursday, in the latest sign of strained tensions between the two Koreas. Seoul's Unification Ministry, which handles affairs between the two Koreas, issued a statement urging North Korea to immediately stop the action at the site near the border. The demolition of the facility is an 'anti-humanitarian act that tramples on the wishes of separated families,' the ministry said, adding that it would consider legal measures over the action and a joint response with the international community. North Korea has been escalating its rhetoric against its southern neighbor in recent years, designating South Korea as a 'hostile state.' Pyongyang also blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border last year, which prompted South Korea's military to fire warning shots at the time. In 2023, Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 military accord designed to curb the risk of inadvertent clashes between two countries that remain technically at war, prompting the South to take a similar step. Nonetheless, there have been recent signs that North Korea may be prepared to reopen to some foreign visitors for the first time in more than five years since the closure of its borders to tourism due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beijing-based Koryo Tours on Thursday said tours to North Korea were 'officially back,' with some of its staff allowed to enter the Rason area in what it hoped would mark the relaunch of tourism.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-dismantling-facility-near-border-for-separated-families-seoul-says/7973247.html	2025-02-12T19:25:09-08:00	
US judge allows Trump to proceed with federal worker deferred retirement	BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS — A federal judge on Wednesday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to carry out its federal worker deferred retirement program as the president moves to overhaul and downsize the U.S. government, handing a setback to unions trying to stop the plan. The decision could clear the way for the Republican president's administration to swiftly try to wrap up the program, though the unions could ask another court to halt the program. U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston dissolved an earlier order he issued that had paused the program at the urging of unions representing more than 800,000 federal employees. O'Toole concluded that the unions lacked legal standing to challenge the rule. The American Federation of Government Employees and other unions have called the administration's deferred resignation offer to more than 2 million federal civilian employees unlawful. 'The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork directive, but are challenging a policy that affects others, specifically executive branch employees,' wrote O'Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton. 'This is not sufficient.' The Office of Personnel Management, which announced the program in a January 28 email titled 'Fork in the Road,' on Monday told employees it intends to close the program to new entrants as soon as legally permissible. As of Friday, about 65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts, according to a White House official, as the Trump administration ramps up plans to engage in wide-ranging job cuts throughout the government. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) National President Everett Kelley called the ruling a setback. 'Importantly, this decision did not address the underlying lawfulness of the program,' he said in a statement. The unions that had filed the lawsuit argued that the plan announced in January was unlawful and that OPM lacked authority to implement the program. Trump, who began his second term as president on January 20, has appointed Elon Musk a 'special government employee' to oversee a sweeping effort called the Department of Government Efficiency with the stated aim of reducing federal spending and reshaping the United States' 2.2 million-strong federal workforce, potentially purging thousands of workers. He also signed an executive order on Tuesday to expand Musk's influence and continue downsizing the federal workforce. Democrats and other critics have accused Musk, who heads electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX, of improperly taking over the federal government. Some federal workers have held protests against Musk's actions. In an email that was sent last month to nearly all federal employees, OPM said employees could choose to resign now and retain all pay and benefits until September 30. The email said employees could remain on the payroll without having to work in person and possibly having their duties reduced or eliminated in the meantime. Interested employees needed only to reply with the word 'resign' to take part. The email's title and contents mirrored a message that Musk, the world's richest man, sent to Twitter employees after he acquired the social media platform, now called X, in 2022. As the deadline approached, the Trump administration had repeated its warning that most federal agencies are likely to be downsized, a message seen by workers as pressure to accept the buyout offer. The unions in their lawsuit argued that OPM's buyout directive was 'stunningly arbitrary' and violated the Antideficiency Act, a federal law that bars agencies from spending more money than Congress appropriated. By encouraging employees to broadly quit without regard to their agency, job duties or institutional memory, OPM is ignoring the adverse consequences resignations could have on the government's ability to function, the unions said. At the request of the unions, O'Toole last week delayed an initial February 6 deadline for employees to resign to Monday. On that day, he put it on hold pending a further order of the court while he considered the case. The unions asked that the deadline be put fully on hold to give them time to seek further relief through the courts and ensure that their members can make informed decisions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-allows-trump-to-proceed-with-federal-worker-deferred-retirement-/7973201.html	2025-02-12T18:31:58-08:00	
Washington forum takes on Central Asia water insecurity	washington — Central Asia has a growing population, rising economic demand and severe water shortages that require greater coordination among governments and international aid groups to build out crucially needed water infrastructure, experts on the region say. 'There is no solution to these water problems without political solutions to regional problems involving regional integration to a unique degree,' Wesley Alexander Hill, lead analyst at the International Tax and Investment Center, said last week at an Atlantic Council forum in Washington. Hill explained that the origins of major rivers in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan largely depend on sources in Russia, China and Afghanistan. He also highlighted China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which has pledged water investments in Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan’s construction of the Qosh Tepa Canal, which threatens to reduce water flow from the Hindu Kush into downstream countries such as Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Central Asian governments over the years have sought water-related agreements with Moscow, Beijing and Kabul. Hill said that modernizing water infrastructure in these countries presents economic opportunities. 'Investing in Central Asian water infrastructure and resources isn’t a charity project,' he said. 'It can actually be quite profitable. There’s plenty of money to be made not just by Chinese and Russian companies, but, hopefully, by American and European companies as well, in areas like relining canals.' Wilder Alejandro Sanchez, president of Second Floor Strategies, underscored the need for 'realistic and rational policy recommendations' to achieve water security in Central Asia. 'We encourage local governments to implement technologies like water-measuring systems, drip irrigation and graywater recycling,' Sanchez told attendees at the forum. He also called for policymakers to ensure accountability and transparency, given Central Asia’s well-documented record of corruption and embezzlement. He suggested that water security projects be monitored by international auditing agencies to build public trust. The Atlantic Council panelists also proposed restructuring the region’s Interstate Commission for Water Coordination, created in 1992, into a more effective Central Asia Water Council or permanent administrative office. The Central Asian governments already have their own initiatives. Tajikistan, for example, leads the Dushanbe Water Process, while Kazakhstan plans to host the Central Asian Water Environmental Summit next year. Sanchez and his colleagues encouraged the Central Asian republics, whose representatives were at the forum, to work not only with the United States but also with European and Asian partners, including the Netherlands, France, South Korea and Japan. Sanchez acknowledged that achieving unity and cooperation remains a challenge, given regional geopolitics and domestic priorities. 'Ultimately, no individual Central Asian state can achieve total water security and water independence without cooperating with its neighbors and significantly improving water management,' he said. For decades, international organizations and researchers have warned about the ecological disaster unfolding in Central Asia, particularly the shrinking of the Aral Sea, which has lost most of its volume since the 1960s. The Caspian Sea, the region’s only remaining major body of water, is also drying up. Ariel Cohen, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who was also on the panel, pointed to deteriorating infrastructure as a key issue. 'A lot of water is lost because modern irrigation technologies are not used. You still have Soviet-era canals, or even pre-Soviet traditional canals, that are just dug into the ground without any protection from evaporation or dissipation,' Cohen said. 'Moving to pipe distribution of water, drip irrigation and sprinklers will probably save 50% of water consumption and move the region toward much more balanced water management.' The experts estimate that modernization will cost billions of dollars, and the question of where that funding will come from remains open. 'If it’s not going to be the U.S., it’s going to be somebody else. The best-case scenario? If it’s not us [the U.S.], it’s the Europeans. Worst-case scenario? It’s the Chinese,' said Cohen. It remains to be seen, other analysts listening to the panel said, whether the Trump administration’s 'America First' policy would support such involvement. 'Often, when we talk about U.S.-Central Asia relations, we focus on the big picture,' said Sanchez. 'We need to diversify engagement between the U.S. and Central Asia.'

Trump orders revamp of US diplomatic corps to ensure it follows his agenda	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revamp the Foreign Service to ensure 'faithful and effective implementation' of Trump's foreign policy agenda. The order, which follows upheaval at the U.S. Agency for International Development, comes as Trump institutes changes to ensure U.S. foreign policy is aligned with his 'America First' agenda. He has also repeatedly pledged to 'clean out the deep state' by firing bureaucrats that he deems disloyal. The order also says failure to implement the president's agenda is grounds for professional discipline, which may result in the termination of personnel. 'The Secretary must maintain an exceptional workforce of patriots to implement this policy effectively,' the order read. 'The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, reform the Foreign Service and the administration of foreign relations to ensure faithful and effective implementation of the President’s foreign policy agenda.' The executive order says the secretary of state will implement reforms in recruiting, performance, evaluation and retention standards to 'ensure a workforce that is committed to faithful implementation of the President’s foreign policy.' It also said the secretary can revamp the programs of the Foreign Service Institute and revise or replace the Foreign Affairs Manual. Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, Trump ordered a freeze of most U.S. foreign aid to ensure it was aligned with his 'America First' policies. Following the order, USAID staff were put on leave and told not to report to work at the agency's headquarters, where signs were covered in tape or removed. The USAID website stopped working, and Rubio was named acting administrator.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-revamp-of-us-diplomatic-corps-to-ensure-it-follows-his-agenda/7973182.html	2025-02-12T16:57:55-08:00

Lawsuit by US rights group seeks access to migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay	washington — The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking access to dozens of migrants flown to a U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to an attorney. ACLU filed the complaint on behalf of families of detainees, who say the detainees themselves cannot sue because they are being held without the ability to communicate with the outside world. The suit seeks immediate phone and video access to detainees, as well as in-person visitation. President Donald Trump, a Republican, kicked off a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office on Jan. 20, including the transfer of dozens of migrants to a detention site on Guantanamo Bay, which is best known for the separate high-security U.S. prison used for suspected foreign terrorists. The lawsuit follows a letter sent by ACLU and other civil and immigrant rights groups to top Trump officials last week, demanding a way to speak to detainees. 'Shipping immigrants off to Guantanamo without access to lawyers or the outside world cannot be reconciled with our country’s laws or principles,' said Lee Gelernt, ACLU lawyer and lead counsel on the case. 'It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law governs our nation.' The lawsuit cites the cases of three Venezuelan men believed to be detained at Guantanamo. Angela Carolina Sequera, one of the plaintiffs, said she was in almost daily contact with her son while he was in a Texas immigration detention center and last spoke to him on Saturday, the complaint stated. On Sunday, she received a call from the detention center saying her son would be sent to Guantanamo. 'Ms. Sequera has made numerous calls to try to locate her son and speak to him, to no avail,' the complaint said. 'She is distraught over the lack of information, and she desires that her son be provided with the ability to communicate with legal counsel regarding his detention at Guantanamo.' The plaintiffs also include four nonprofit legal service providers who said they were unable to represent migrants shuttled to the naval base. The providers have clients in Texas and Florida. The Trump administration has provided few specifics about the detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay but said the first flight carried alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said there is a system at the Guantanamo detention site for migrants to phone lawyers. She questioned the ACLU raising concerns about 'highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers and vicious gang members' rather than U.S. citizens. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the base on Friday, said in a social media post that some of the detainees had allegedly been charged or convicted of homicide, robbery and other crimes. The ACLU lawsuit said the U.S. had never before moved migrants held on civil immigration charges from the U.S. to the Guantanamo Bay base and now held them 'incommunicado, without access to attorneys, family or the outside world.' The complaint said that despite significant public concern, the Trump administration had offered no explanation of its legal authority to move the detainees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lawsuit-by-us-rights-group-seeks-access-to-migrants-sent-to-guantanamo-bay/7972904.html	2025-02-12T15:39:08-08:00

Russia, Ukraine trade blame for IAEA disruptions at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday accused each other of blocking the rotation of staff from the International Atomic Energy Agency at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. Moscow's troops seized the facility, Europe's largest nuclear power station, in the first days of its invasion of Ukraine. Both sides have repeatedly accused the other of risking a potentially devastating nuclear disaster by attacking the site. Staff from the U.N. nuclear watchdog have been based there since September 2022 to monitor nuclear safety. Fighting meant the IAEA staff could not be swapped out as part of a planned rotation on Wednesday, the second such delay in a week, both Kyiv and Moscow said, trading blame for the incident. Inspectors spend around five weeks at the plant in stints before being swapped out in a complex procedure that involves traveling across the front line under supervision from the Russian and Ukrainian militaries. Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhy accused Russia's army of opening fire near where the planned rotation was taking place, saying Moscow's goal was to force the IAEA team to travel through Russian-controlled territory and 'violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Ukrainian army blocked the IAEA team from traveling to an agreed meeting point and were attacking the area with drones, at which point the Russian military withdrew its support team and returned to the station. 'On their return, the convoy carrying Russian military personnel and IAEA experts ... came under attack by drone and mortar strikes,' Zakharova said in a statement. The IAEA staff members were supposed to leave the station on Feb. 5 in a rotation that was also delayed. IAEA head Rafael Grossi was in both Ukraine and Russia last week, where he discussed the issue of rotations with officials from both countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-trade-blame-for-iaea-disruptions-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-/7972887.html	2025-02-12T15:28:54-08:00	
261 trafficking victims rescued from Myanmar scam center	WASHINGTON — More than 260 foreign nationals have been rescued from online scam operations in Myanmar and handed over to authorities in Thailand. The rescue is part of an escalating crackdown on human trafficking and cyber fraud along the two countries' border. A Myanmar insurgent group, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, which recently raided scam centers in the region, handed the victims over to Thai authorities on Feb. 12. DKBA Chief of Staff Major Saw San Aung told VOA's Burmese Service in a telephone interview that the group's forces raided casinos in Myawaddy District, Karen State, in search of trafficked foreign workers. 'On February 11, we identified 261 victims and transferred them to Thai authorities on February 12,' he said. 'We are handing over everyone we find today, but the process is difficult. The [Myanmar] junta's immigration department is making demands, and the terrain is challenging. We have to retrieve the victims ourselves before transferring them to the nearest Thai authorities,' Major Saw San Aung said. A rescue worker and eyewitness who requested anonymity for security reasons told VOA in a phone interview on Wednesday that online scam gangs force victims of trafficking 'to meet monthly earnings targets of up to $50,000. If they failed, they were tortured. They were only allowed to sleep for two to three hours a day and worked nonstop. They were kept in dark cells and subjected to continuous abuse.' Thai officials confirmed that the rescued individuals were taken by boat to Phop Phra, Thailand, before being moved to a secure facility. China pressured to crack down on scammers Tensions between China and Myanmar escalated after Chinese actor Wang Xing was abducted and held captive in Myanmar in January, before eventually being rescued from scam centers in Myawaddy. In response to this incident, China pressured Thailand to crack down on scam networks operating in the region. This pressure is widely believed to be a key factor behind Thailand's decision to cut off electricity and fuel supplies to Myanmar, significantly impacting areas controlled by ethnic Karen armed groups. The Wednesday handover follows another transfer on Feb. 6 when Myanmar's ruling junta and another armed group, the Karen Border Guard Force handed over 61 trafficked individuals, including 39 Chinese nationals, to Thai custody. Among those rescued and returned on Thursday, many were from Africa, including 46 Ethiopians and 33 Kenyans, according to the DKBA. In recent days, Myanmar's military leadership has also highlighted its efforts to crackdown on illegal online gambling and scam operations in cooperation with the international community. In audio message shared with the news media last Friday, military junta spokesperson General Zaw Min Tun said many victims of trafficking were lured with promises of high-paying jobs in computer-related and translation fields. 'They were deceived by the prospect of high salaries and good working conditions. Most of them arrived in Mae Sot from Bangkok before being taken across the border illegally by online money-laundering gangs,' General Zaw Min Tun said. Myawaddy: haven for scam syndicates Myawaddy, located in Karen State along the Thai border, is controlled by Karen armed groups, including the DKBA and the Karen BGF, the latter was previously aligned with the Myanmar military. The BGF-controlled town of Shwe Kokko in particular has turned into a notorious hub for online fraud. As of May 2022, reports indicated that 1,225 Chinese nationals, along with individuals from Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, and the Philippines, were trafficked into Shwe Kokko to work in online scam operations. These victims were lured by fake job offers and later forced into online fraud schemes. Since the Karen BGF severed ties with the Myanmar military and rebranded itself as the Karen National Army last year, the scam operations have faced increased scrutiny. The U.S. Institute of Peace has warned that online scams originating from Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar, are a major security threat and cause significant financial losses in the U.S. In 2023, USIP estimated that Americans lost $3.5 billion to scams from the region. These scams, including forced labor, scams using romantic relationships and other financial crimes, target U.S. residents through fraudulent job applications and false high-tech job ads.

Audit shows Senegal's previous government misreported debt, other key data	DAKAR, SENEGAL — Senegal's Court of Auditors released a long-awaited review of the country's finances on Wednesday that confirmed the previous government misreported key economic data including debt and deficit figures. Senegal's sovereign Eurobonds tumbled following release of the report. 'The work carried out by the Court shows that outstanding debt is higher than that shown in the reporting documents,' the court's report said. The court's report confirmed an audit that had been ordered by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who took office in April 2024. At the end of 2023, the total outstanding debt represented 99.67% of gross domestic product, the court's report said. That compared with a previously recorded figure of 74.41%. The audit ordered by Faye had revealed that Senegal's debt and budget deficit were much wider than former President Macky Sall's administration had reported. As a consequence of the audit, Faye's government decided in June not to present a request for further disbursement under its three-year $1.8 billion credit facility with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF had suspended the program pending the Court of Auditors' review. The IMF said on Wednesday that it would analyze the report and initiate consultations with authorities to address issues raised. 'The IMF remains committed to supporting the authorities moving forward,' an IMF spokesperson said via email. The court's report, which covers public finances from 2019 to March 2024, said it detected other anomalies and data discrepancies between the reported and the actual numbers. 'The deficit calculated and reported to the IMF for the period under review is very far from its real value, if the exact volume of project loan disbursements is taken into account,' the court said in the report. The reviewed budget deficit for 2023 stood at 12.3% of GDP compared with 4.9% reported by the previous administration, the court said. Leo Morawiecki, associate investment specialist for emerging market debt at Abrdn, an investment company, said the debt-to-GDP ratio for 2024 was likely to be in excess of 110% given the large deficit being run. 'In response, the IMF will almost certainly move Senegal from moderate to high risk of debt distress,' he said in a note, adding that the government seemed committed to fiscal consolidation and an IMF program. In a note to investors after the report's release, Senegal's finance ministry said it would centralize management of its public debt and implement strict controls over projects financed from external resources. The ministry will shortly organize a call with global investors, the note said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/audit-shows-senegal-s-previous-government-misreported-debt-other-key-data-/7972823.html	2025-02-12T14:22:23-08:00	
Malawi university students feel impact of US aid freeze	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Public universities in Malawi have ordered all students sponsored by USAID to drop out or seek other sources of funding if they want to remain in school. This follows the 90-day freeze on U.S. foreign assistance recently announced by President Donald Trump. However, Malawi’s government says it is working to ensure that students can continue their education. USAID has provided financial support to thousands of students in several Malawi universities, including the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mzuzu University, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, and the Malawi University of Science and Technology or MUST. James Mphande, the communications manager at MUST, said the U.S. foreign aid freeze is a big blow to several USAID-funded projects the school was implementing. 'And what it means now is that everything has been suspended,' he said. 'So, if we were developing a curriculum, we can’t proceed. If we had some outreach activities, we can’t proceed. If we were in the process of making some procurements, we can’t proceed.' He said some sponsored students may face the impact next semester. 'Fortunately, we are in the middle of a semester. So, probably fees or support for this semester was already sorted out. But for the upcoming semesters or years, it means the students will have to look elsewhere for support or they risk withdrawing,' Mphande said. However, Patience Yamikani Chakwana, a beneficiary of USAID at MUST, told VOA that she is already feeling the impact. Chakwana, a first-year student in business information technology, said the foreign aid suspension was imposed before students received money for their daily upkeep. 'It was really unexpected. It was, like, we have just started school after a week, then we are getting the news,' she said. 'At the time, we didn’t have the money, and the pocket money had not been given. … I heard the news while I was in class. I didn’t know what to do. That was the only hope I had.' Chakwana said USAID was paying for her tuition and accommodation, as well as giving her money for groceries and the internet connection for her mobile phone. She said she now survives on money she borrows from friends. Jessie Kabwila, Malawi’s minister of higher education, said the aid suspension is discouraging, but the Malawi government is working to find other sources to help students. 'We have engaged local partnerships that are in the private sector to see how they can help us. We have also engaged international partners. For example, we have got a standing agreement with the Republic of Morocco. We have also engaged the Czech Republic, and we will be engaging others, too,' Kabwila said. Alexander Kude, deputy director for the Commonwealth Students Association, told VOA that the U.S. foreign aid suspension should be a wake-up call for developing countries to start investing more in education and reduce overdependence on foreign aid. 'Look, the budget that the United States of America uses to fund us through USAID, it’s just a percent of their money and budget. If you look how much that is and where they get it from, why not stand alone and do it ourselves?' Kude said. The Trump administration says it imposed the 90-day freeze to review USAID spending and make sure it aligns with U.S. policy and interests. The freeze will extend through April 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-university-students-feel-impact-of-us-aid-freeze/7972824.html	2025-02-12T14:07:37-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: Kurdish demonstration laws block protesters from entering Irbil	On Sunday, violence erupted at a security checkpoint outside of the Kurdistan Region's capital Irbil after security forces prevented hundreds of protesting teachers from Sulaymaniyah and Halabja provinces from entering the city. The teachers, who are still waiting to receive their December salary payments, told VOA it was their right to take their protests to Irbil as the capital of the Kurdistan Region. Police, however, said the teachers' request to protest was not approved by the Ministry of Interior, and used tear gas, plastic bullets and water cannons to disperse crowds. Hardi Salah, a lawmaker with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, told VOA the incident highlighted the need for the Kurdistan Regional Parliament to amend the region's protest law, which he said allows authorities to prevent any gathering they deem a challenge to their authority. But Muna Nabi Kahveci, the deputy head of the Turkmen Reform Party and former Kurdistan Parliament Secretary with close alliance to the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), denounced any attempt to amend the region's 2010 election law, arguing, 'Protesters were barred from entering Irbil to avoid violent unrest.'

Fire at Rio de Janeiro Carnival costume factory injures 21	RIO DE JANEIRO — A fire broke out Wednesday at a factory making costumes for Rio de Janeiro's Carnival, injuring 21 people in a blow to the famed extravaganza that attracts millions of tourists to the Brazilian city every year. Firefighters scaled ladders to reach a window where desperate workers were calling for help as black smoke bellowed from the building in the north of the city, local media images showed. The area around the factory was cordoned off by authorities as firefighters brought the blaze under control, according to an AFP reporter. The fire department's communication service told AFP that 21 people were hospitalized, 12 of whom were in a serious condition. Earlier, state health secretary Claudia Mello said at least eight people had been intubated and were on artificial respiration. Fire department chief Colonel Luciano Pacheco Sarmento said that those affected were working in a 'precarious manner' and without 'safety conditions.' The building contained 'a lot of highly combustible material,' added Sarmento. 'We have information that there have been fires here before,' he said. 'No way' down A survivor, identified as Roberta, told local media she had been working and sleeping in the building 'since Monday.' The fire 'came from the floor below and we had no way to get down,' she said. Rio de Janeiro's labor ministry announced a probe into working conditions at the factory. The cause of the fire has not been established. Rio's Carnival, famous for parades with lavish costumes and towering floats to the tune of samba music, begins on February 28 and will run until March 8. Preparations last almost the whole year, with the final weeks often very tense as competitors scramble to meet deadlines for the making of costumes and floats. One of the associations for the samba schools that compete in the parades, Liga RJ, expressed its 'deep concern' for the injured. The organization said the Maximus Factory that was hit by the fire was 'an essential space for the Rio Carnival.' 'The impact of this incident directly affects the planning of the Carnival and the entire production chain of its realization,' Liga RJ warned in an Instagram message. 'The League will urgently call its presidents for an extraordinary general assembly to evaluate the situation,' the statement said. Samba schools affected Three samba schools were having their outfits made at the affected factory, although none of them were taking part in the main competition for Carnival champion. Like football, the parade competition has several divisions, and samba schools can be relegated or rise up through the ranks each year. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes said the schools impacted by the fire would not be demoted from their carnival league. 'If they can parade, all three will do so out of competition,' he wrote on the X social media network. Paulo Santi, director of Imperio Serrano, one of the affected schools, said it would carry out its planned parade on March 1 'as if it were competing for the title. Showing the people of Rio that Imperio Serrano will endure.' The samba schools are rooted in Rio's favela urban settlements and each parade tells a story, often dealing with politics, social issues and history. Their parades take place in the Sambadrome, a large, open-air venue where more than 70,000 spectators gather to watch the spectacle with thousands of dancers in shimmering costumes. In 2011, a blaze in the Samba City complex of workshops and warehouses stocking Carnival material wiped out eight months of preparations worth millions of dollars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fire-at-rio-de-janeiro-carnival-costume-factory-injures-21/7972743.html	2025-02-12T13:29:18-08:00

Trump pushes for lower interest rates alongside tariffs	WASHINGTON — As his trade advisers finalized plans to enact reciprocal measures on every country that charges duties on U.S. imports, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he will push for lower interest rates alongside his tariff policies. 'Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!! Lets Rock and Roll, America!!!' Trump said on social media Wednesday morning. To maintain the Federal Reserves’ autonomy from politics, U.S. presidents traditionally avoid even the appearance of meddling in monetary policy and the nation’s interest rates, which is the purview of the central bank. Trump, however, has not shied from the practice. In a videoconference address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Trump said he would 'demand that interest rates drop immediately.' 'I know interest rates much better than they do,' he said of Fed officials. He has ramped up his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he appointed in 2017 for a term that ends in 2026. Trump’s push to lower interest rates is intended to go hand in hand with punitive measures on trading partners. Reciprocal tariffs are 'absolutely a high priority for the president,' White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told reporters Wednesday, promising 'a lot more action on it today.' Hassett said the White House has begun negotiations with other countries early to lay the groundwork for imposing such tariffs, although he acknowledged the details about which sectors or how they will be implemented is a 'work in progress.' Under World Trade Organization rules, member countries have the right to impose tariffs on imports. Countries negotiate those rates at the WTO to determine the maximum tariff rate a member country can impose on imports from other member countries. Inflation, looming trade war U.S. inflation rose to 3% in January, according to government data released Wednesday. Last month, the annual pace was 2.9%. Trump campaigned on lowering high consumer prices he blamed on his predecessor, Joe Biden. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt again attributed the increase to the previous administration. 'This is an indictment on the Biden administration's mismanagement of the inflation crisis and their lack of transparency,' she said during her briefing Wednesday. Trump wants to lower interest rates and inflation, she said. 'He believes that the whole of government economic approach that this administration is taking will result in lower inflation.' However, some economists warn that combining high tariffs and low interest rates will have the opposite effect. Trump's plan reflects a 'misunderstanding of how the economy works,' said Joseph Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 'Tariffs raise prices directly, that is inflationary, but also cutting interest rates is inflationary if you do it excessively,' he told VOA. 'Especially with today's data, cutting interest rates would not be a good idea.' During testimony Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, Powell said the Fed was in no rush to cut interest rates because the economy had stabilized. He noted that inflation, while still above the Fed’s 2% target, was at 2.6% last year, and he said the labor market was cooling without plummeting, with the unemployment rate at 4%. Gagnon also warned of a looming trade war. Trump already had announced Monday his decision to impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports beginning March 12. The duties will hit top U.S. steel supplier Canada, followed by Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Germany. Additionally, Canada is the leader in aluminum exports to the American market. European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Tuesday the move 'will not go unanswered,' saying it will trigger tough countermeasures from the 27-nation bloc, potentially targeting iconic American industries such as bourbon, jeans and motorcycles. EU trade ministers are meeting Wednesday to determine their next moves. China, Mexico and Canada Last week, Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, which the White House said was aimed at halting the flow of fentanyl opioids and their precursor chemicals. On Monday China began slapping retaliatory actions on some American goods, including 15% duties on coal and natural gas imports and 10% on petroleum, agricultural equipment, high-emission vehicles and pickup trucks. The country also immediately implemented restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals, and it launched an antitrust investigation into American tech giant Google. Trump delayed enacting a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada for a month — until March 4 — to allow negotiations over his demands for the U.S. neighbors to secure their borders and stop the flow of the illegal drug fentanyl. The duties could affect about $1.323 trillion in trade imports that come from China, Mexico and Canada, according to U.S. government data. This accounts for 43% of U.S. imports and 5% of the $27 trillion U.S. gross domestic product. If enacted, the new import taxes on Canada, Mexico and China will increase the average tariff rate from its current level of 3% to 10.7% based on contemporary trade patterns, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at financial advisory firm RSM. 'Should the trade skirmishes escalate to include the European Union and turn into an all-out trade war, expect U.S. economic growth to ease back to 2% as the tariffs drag down growth and employment, stoke inflation and widen the current account deficit, all amid higher interest rates,' he wrote on RSM’s Real Economy Blog.

US warns citizens of potential terror threats at key mosque in Pakistan's capital	ISLAMABAD — The United States advised its citizens Wednesday to steer clear of a popular mosque in Pakistan’s capital due to potential terrorist threats. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad issued the threat alert following the emergence of a social media video earlier this week featuring a purported militant operative at the city’s Faisal Mosque, a major tourist destination. The brief video showed the individual displaying a hand-drawn pamphlet featuring the flag of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which the United Nations has listed as a global terrorist organization. The video was shared on Monday via social media affiliated with TTP. The U.S. diplomatic mission has prohibited employees from traveling to the mosque area until further notice. The advisory also urged American citizens to avoid the area, stating that 'TTP militants have issued threats against Faisal Mosque in Islamabad.' The terror threat alert was issued on the day Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Islamabad for a bilateral visit, amid heightened security measures. TTP routinely stages suicide bombings and gun attacks against Pakistani security forces and other official targets, mainly in districts near and on the country’s border with Afghanistan. The violence has killed hundreds of people in recent years. Islamabad has maintained that the group orchestrates terrorist attacks from sanctuaries in Afghanistan and has persistently called on the neighboring country’s Taliban leaders to rein in TTP militants. The Taliban government in Kabul, not recognized by any country, denies the presence of TTP or any other foreign militant organizations on Afghan soil. It claims that no one is allowed to threaten neighboring countries and beyond from Afghanistan. Critics have questioned the Taliban's denial, pointing to the frequent high-profile attacks claimed or attributed to the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), an Afghan affiliate of the transnational Islamic State terrorist network. The violence has killed hundreds of people, including senior Taliban leaders, religious figures and members of the Afghan Shiite community, since the Taliban reclaimed control of the country in 2021. On Monday, U.N. counterterrorism officials warned during a Security Council meeting that IS-K is one of the 'most dangerous' Islamic State branches. 'ISIL-Khorasan has continued to pose a significant threat in Afghanistan, the region and beyond,' Vladimir Voronkov, U.N. undersecretary-general for counterterrorism, told the meeting, using another acronym for IS-K. The latest IS-K-claimed attack occurred on Tuesday when a suicide bomber detonated himself outside a bank in the northeastern Afghan city of Kunduz. Taliban officials said the blast killed five people and injured seven others. Multiple sources reported that the victims were primarily members of the Taliban security forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-warns-citizens-of-potential-terror-threats-at-key-mosque-in-pakistan-s-capital/7972680.html	2025-02-12T12:40:37-08:00	
Federal appeals court upholds singer R. Kelly's convictions, 30-year prison term	NEW YORK — R. Kelly's racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the American singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March. The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking. Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling 'unprecedented,' saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law 'to situations absurdly remote' from the statute's intent. Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago. The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings, and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper. 'Enabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,' the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls. 'Evidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,' the three-judge panel said. The appeals court said it was 'neither arbitrary nor irrational' that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify. 'None of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,' the appeals court said. The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, 'were properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.' Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's 'excellent opinion,' but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available. 'This was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,' Bonjean said. Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit I Believe I Can Fly and the cult classic Trapped in the Closet, a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue. Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex. Widespread outrage over Kelly's sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary Surviving R. Kelly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-appeals-court-upholds-singer-r-kelly-s-convictions-and-30-year-prison-term/7972508.html	2025-02-12T11:55:25-08:00

Zimbabwe to pay displaced, foreign white farmers	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe’s government said Wednesday it will compensate foreign investors who lost assets in the country’s controversial land reforms in the early 2000s but were protected by bilateral investment protection agreements. Zimbabwean Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said in a statement the government will pay 94 former farmers from countries such as Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia. The farmers are covered under Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements, or BIPPAs, that Zimbabwe signed with the farmers’ countries. Ncube said $20 million is being paid out of the 2024 budget and another $20 million would come from the 2025 budget. 'This is a very important issue for our arrears clearance and debt resolution process for Zimbabwe, because some of the countries for which we want support, their farmers, their investors, into Zimbabwe were affected by the land reform program in the early 2000s,' Ncube said. 'But we're only targeting those countries where the BIPPAs were ratified properly.' The aim, he said, is to have cleared the entire $146 million liability for BIPPA farmers by the end of 2028. 'We believe that this is very important for building trust, for honoring our commitments,' he said. Zimbabwe’s government is aiming to rebuild its financial reputation after requesting debt relief and restructuring from international financial institutions and other countries in 2022. According to the African Development Bank, Zimbabwe's total foreign debt is $21 billion — including interest — which it has been failing to service for years. However, Eddie Mahembe, an independent economist based in Harare, says resettled farmers, not the government, should pay the $146 million, to prevent increasing the country’s debt. 'Why is the government paying for the farms which were allocated to individuals?' Mahembe said. 'They are farming. Some are doing tobacco. They've been selling their tobacco over the years, and we are seeing ... that there is now a move toward giving them title deals. Why is the government assuming that debt?' Others are concerned that Harare is paying only former farmers of foreign origin. Displaced white Zimbabwean farmers want to be compensated as well, as per a 2020 agreement. That agreement called for Harare to pay $3.5 billion to the farmers driven off their land under a program backed by then-President Robert Mugabe starting in 2000. Trevor Gifford, former head of Zimbabwe’s Commercial Farmers Union, said, 'Twenty-five years from the start of land reform in Zimbabwe, the majority of displaced title deed holders remain destitute due to the nonpayment of compensation. The government failed to honor its commitment on paying [on time] under the global compensation agreement, which is now expired.' He said the government’s move to give title deeds to the farmers who took over the land will create confusion and keep away foreign investors. 'The issuing of title deeds on top of existing title deeds, which have still not been paid for in terms of the international norms for land reform, is reckless and does not create any confidence for prospective investments in Zimbabwe,' Gifford said. Graham Rae was displaced from his farm about 100 kilometers east of Harare and is now farming in neighboring Zambia. He said that until he is compensated, he will not surrender title deeds to the land for which he was dispossessed. 'You can't steal a car and then sell it to me and think you've washed your hands and now it's a legal car,' Rae said. 'It's still illegal and by the mere fact that I'm buying a stolen car from you, I'm complicit in the theft, so there are going to be lots of problems. I find that fraudulent, I just find that very sad that Zimbabwe has regressed into a basket case where there's no rule of law, and that the rule really is at the barrel of a gun — if you don't agree, you disappear.' For now, the Zimbabwe government says it will issue titles to the resettled farmers so that they can use them to borrow money for capitalization of their businesses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-to-pay-displaced-foreign-white-farmers/7972468.html	2025-02-12T10:35:54-08:00	
Key Islamic State planner killed in airstrike, US and Somali officials say	WASHINGTON — Ahmed Maeleninine, an Omani-born leader of Islamic State, was killed in U.S. airstrikes against the terror group in Somalia earlier this month, officials of the Puntland region said Wednesday. Maeleninine was the main target of the Feb. 1 airstrike against Islamic State hideouts in the semi-autonomous region of northern Somalia. In an interview with VOA Somali, the Puntland state minister for presidency, Abdifitah Mohamed Abdinur, said Somalia and its international security partners had been watching Maeleninine’s movements in the region. 'He was an Omani-born man in his 40s who was wanted for international crimes and his movements and activities have been followed at least for the last two years, as he was hiding in the mountainous area of Puntland,' Abdinur said. 'He was a thorn removed from the flesh of Somalis and the world population, and he eventually tasted what he deserved.' The U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) confirmed late Tuesday that Maeleninine and 13 other operatives linked to the Islamic State — also known as IS, ISIL or Daesh — were killed in the Feb. 1 operation, which it said was run in coordination with the Somali government. In a statement, AFRICOM described Maeleninine as a 'recruiter, financier, and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe.' Abdinur said Puntland officials are still collecting the names and nationalities of the other 13 IS figures killed and will share them with the media when their identities are confirmed. Assessing the success of the U.S. strikes was delayed due to the location of the targets and the terrain — a series of cave complexes in the Cal Miskaad area of Somalia's Golis Mountains. At the time, a Somalia commander told VOA the U.S. strikes had targeted at least 10 locations. Residents in Qandala, a small town in Puntland’s Bari region, not far from the site of the attacks, told VOA that they heard at least seven explosions and saw plumes of smoke and flames. IS has increased its presence in Somalia over the past several years, while IS-Somalia has become a key cog in the IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Africa. The Somali branch has simultaneously become more influential under the leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to head IS's directorate of provinces, overseeing the terror group's affiliates in Africa. Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting as Islamic State's top emir. Others disagree, but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure. VOA’s Jeff Seldin, Harun Maruf and Fadumo Jama contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/key-islamic-state-planner-killed-in-airstrike-us-and-somali-officials-say/7972276.html	2025-02-12T10:34:59-08:00	
RFE/RL journalist released from Belarus jail	WASHINGTON — A journalist with VOA’s sister outlet, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was released from Belarus on Wednesday, after spending more than four years imprisoned in a case that was widely viewed as politically motivated. Andrey Kuznechyk, a journalist with RFE/RL’s Belarus service was released from Belarus on Wednesday, RFE/RL said. RFE/RL President Stephen Capus welcomed Kuznechyk’s release. 'This is a joyous day for Andrey, his wife, and their two young children. After more than three years apart, this family is together again thanks to President Trump. We are also grateful to Secretary Rubio and his team, and to the Lithuanian government for their support,' Capus said in a statement. The terms of the deal were not immediately clear. Kuznechyk had been jailed since November 2021. He was initially sentenced to 10 days in jail on hooliganism charges, which he rejected. When Kuznechyk was due to be released, authorities kept him in prison and added an additional charge of creating an extremist group. In a trial that lasted only one day, a regional court found Kuznechyk guilty in June 2022 and sentenced him to six years in prison. RFE/RL and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees RFE/RL and VOA, consistently rejected the charges against Kuznechyk and called for his release. Belarus ranks among the worst jailers of journalists in the world. As of early December, at least 31 journalists were jailed there over their work, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Another RFE/RL journalist — Ihar Losik — has been jailed in Belarus since 2020 on charges he and his employer reject. 'We remain hopeful that our journalist Ihar Losik will also be released and look to the Trump administration for its continued leadership and guidance,' Capus said in a statement. Three other RFE/RL journalists are currently jailed in Russian-occupied Crimea, Russia and Azerbaijan, all on charges that are viewed as politically motivated. The Belarusian government has embarked on a severe crackdown on independent journalists and other critics ever since longtime President Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in a 2020 presidential election that was widely viewed as rigged. More than 1,200 political prisoners are currently detained in Belarus, according to the rights group Viasna.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rfe-rl-journalist-released-from-belarus-jail-/7972466.html	2025-02-12T10:17:54-08:00

Trump vows to 'immediately' negotiate for end to Ukraine war	President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he and Russia’s leader agreed in a phone call to 'immediately' begin negotiations with Ukraine’s leader to bring an end to the nearly three-year-conflict. 'We will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,' Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. 'I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful.' Trump did not specify what the terms might be to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, in Germany Wednesday for a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, ruled out a key demand by Ukraine’s: eventual membership in NATO. 'The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,' Hegseth said. Trump’s top hostage negotiator on Wednesday credited Trump’s 'great friendship' with Russia’s leader and with Saudi Arabia’s prince as key in releasing American teacher Marc Fogel from Russian custody late Tuesday. 'I think that getting Mark Fogel out was critical and the Russians were very, very helpful in that effort and very accommodating,' Witkoff said, speaking to reporters at the White House. 'And I think that's maybe a sign about how that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin will be in the future and what that may portend for the world at large for conflict and so forth. I think they had a great friendship. And I think now it's going to continue and it's a really good thing for the world.' Trump welcomed Fogel to the White House late Tuesday. He had been detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country. 'I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,' Fogel said as he stood next to Trump at the White House late Tuesday. Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond calling it 'very fair' and very reasonable.' Trump also said another hostage release would be announced Wednesday. Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said earlier Tuesday the United States and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to free Fogel but gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In such deals in recent years, the U.S has often released Russian prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange. Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader geopolitical terms, saying it was 'a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' an invasion Russia launched against its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or wounded on both sides. Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before taking office January 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by the end of April. 'Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States,' Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances. Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying him as wrongfully detained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-vows-to-immediately-negotiate-for-end-to-ukraine-war/7972444.html	2025-02-12T09:54:05-08:00	
Senate approves Trump’s nominee to lead US intelligence	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to overhaul the country’s intelligence apparatus appears set to move forward, with lawmakers confirming Tulsi Gabbard as the nation’s next director of national intelligence. The Senate voted 52-48 in favor of Gabbard on Wednesday, narrowly rejecting concerns about her experience and past statements on leaks of classified intelligence and other matters. Gabbard got support from every Republican senator except for former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who joined Democrats in opposing her confirmation. 'The intelligence community needs to refocus on its core mission — collecting intelligence and providing unbiased analysis of that information,' said Republican Majority Leader John Thune, praising Gabbard on Monday as lawmakers began debating her nomination. 'That’s what Tulsi Gabbard is committed to ensuring,' Thune said. 'And I believe she has the knowledge and leadership capabilities to get it done.' Democrats were less enthusiastic, making last minute pleas to their Republican colleagues to reject Gabbard. 'We simply cannot, in good conscience, trust our most classified secrets to someone who echoes Russian propaganda and falls for conspiracy theories,' said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, addressing lawmakers before Wednesday’s vote. Schumer also alleged that most Republicans secretly agree. 'If we had a secret ballot, Gabbard might get 10 votes,' he said. 'People know. That's why they raise so many questions. But Donald Trump and Elon Musk evidently threaten them, and they're changing their view.' Trump selected Gabbard in November, praising her 'fearless spirit.' But the former Democratic representative from the state of Hawaii and one-time Democratic presidential candidate faced criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Gabbard’s nomination to serve as director of national intelligence advanced to the full Senate by a 9-8 party-line vote in the Senate Intelligence Committee. 'It's fair to say Ms. Gabbard's nomination has generated a bit more interest and attention than do most nominees before this committee,' Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican, acknowledged during Gabbard’s confirmation hearing late last month. During the hearing, Gabbard was questioned repeatedly by Republicans and Democrats about Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor accused of leaking thousands of classified documents before ultimately fleeing to Russia, and specifically about legislation she introduced to pardon him. Each time they asked whether she considered Snowden a traitor, Gabbard declined to answer. 'Senator, my heart is with my commitment to our Constitution and our nation's security,' Gabbard said during once exchange with Republican Senator James Lankford. Senators also questioned Gabbard about a 2017 trip to Syria, during which she met with then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, despite allegations he had used chemical weapons against civilians, and about her comments about Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'I continue to have significant concerns about your judgment and your qualifications,' said Warner, a Democrat. 'Repeatedly, you have excused our adversaries' worst actions, [and] instead often blame them on the United States.' Gabbard, however, managed to find common ground with the committee’s Republican senators, winning over Susan Collins and Todd Young. Young also shared a letter from Gabbard in which she pledged to hold U.S. intelligence employees and contractors accountable for intelligence leaks and to 'not advocate for any protections which should only be extended to lawful and legitimate whistleblowers.' Gabbard further promised to not make any recommendation 'regarding the legal standing of Edward Snowden' to the U.S. attorney general or to Trump. And she pledged to support the use of warrantless surveillance capabilities despite her opposition to the program while she was a lawmaker.

US defense chief: Return to Ukraine's 2014 borders 'unrealistic'	U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO military allies on Wednesday that Ukraine’s hoped-for return to its 2014 borders is an 'unrealistic objective,' and that the United States does not believe that Kyiv membership in NATO is a 'realistic outcome' of a negotiated end to Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine. Speaking in Brussels at NATO headquarters, Hegseth told his fellow defense chiefs, 'We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.' No peace talks have been scheduled, but Hegseth said any durable conclusion to the war must include 'robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again.' 'The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,' he said, which would invoke the military alliance’s mutual defense provision among NATO’s 32 member nations that requires each of them to help defend each other when they are attacked. Kyiv has long sought NATO membership, and the alliance’s other member nations have said they are committed to it, but not while the war rages on. Instead, Hegseth said security guarantees for Ukraine should be backed by 'capable European and non-European troops.' 'If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission, and they should not be covered under Article 5,' he said, referring to the alliance's mutual defense clause. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, supported pro-Russian separatists fighting against Kyiv’s forces in eastern Ukraine in the ensuing years and then launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. It now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s pre-2014 territory. Before taking office to begin his second term in the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict even before being inaugurated. More recently, his aides say he hopes for a peace pact in the first 100 days of his new term, roughly by the end of April. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. was Ukraine’s biggest military benefactor. Trump has often voiced skepticism of continued U.S. support, refusing to say at a political debate last year that he wanted Ukraine to win the war. Now Trump appears intent on getting Europe to assume most of the financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine. He also has suggested that going forward, Ukraine should pay for continued U.S. support by giving the United States access to its rare earth minerals needed to produce technology products. 'Members of this [Ukraine] contact group must meet the moment,' Hegseth said to the assembled group of about 50 member countries that have provided $126 billion worth of weapons and military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion. 'We hear you,' British Defense Secretary John Healey said in response to Hegseth's opening remarks. Hegseth said that NATO members must increase their defense spending to 5% of their national economies, a figure that no NATO country currently allocates. The U.S. is at 3.4%, with Poland the highest NATO country at 4.12%. The current NATO defense spending goal is 2% of each country’s national economy, a figure that 23 of the 32 countries meet, up from six in 2021 after Trump chided other NATO countries about the issue during his first presidential term. Hegseth would not commit the U.S. to the 5% figure, saying it was up to Trump. 'We live in fiscally constrained times,' Hegseth said, and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. But the U.S. defense leader said, 'The United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship [among NATO members] which encourages dependence [on the U.S.]; rather our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security.' NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, June 24-26. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-chief-return-to-ukraine-2014-borders-unrealistic/7972400.html	2025-02-12T09:20:29-08:00	
Rubio heads to Munich amid diplomatic push for Ukraine peace deal	STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to depart Thursday for Munich and later this week will visit the Middle East amid an intensive diplomatic push to end Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, as well as efforts to follow up on U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for the post-war Gaza Strip. Preparations are also underway for Rubio to hold talks with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to people familiar with the plan who spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity. If the meeting takes place as expected, it would be the first U.S.-Japan-South Korea foreign ministerial trilateral under the Trump administration. Ukraine As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches its third year, the U.S. is pursuing multiple diplomatic avenues to secure a peace deal. Although not directly linked to efforts to secure a peace deal, U.S. officials have described Russia’s Tuesday release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel as 'a show of good faith from the Russians' and 'a sign that we are moving in the right direction to end' the brutal war in Ukraine. Rubio has said that the U.S. will reaffirm its determination to end the war during meetings at the Munich Security Conference, a high-profile international security forum running from Feb. 14 to 16. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are set to hold in-person talks in Munich. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, will also attend the conference. Ukraine has said that its delegation will present its position on ending the war and outline its vision for achieving a lasting peace. Meanwhile, negotiations are in progress as Ukraine seeks security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe. Ukraine is willing to offer U.S. companies lucrative reconstruction contracts, Zelenskyy told The Guardian newspaper in an interview this week. He also said that if Trump manages to bring him and Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer a land swap: Ukrainian-occupied territory in Kursk in exchange for Russian-held land in Ukraine. Rare earth minerals Trump has expressed interest in making continued military aid conditional on access to Ukraine's raw materials. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent visited Kyiv on Wednesday for talks on energy and rare earth minerals. He is the first cabinet-level official in the Trump administration to visit the country. More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare earths, nickel and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium and titanium. Russia has gained control over a significant portion of Ukraine's identified mineral resources in the territories it occupies. If Russia permanently seizes that land, Ukraine will lose access to those minerals and other reserves, which would be a blow to both European and U.S. security. First US-Japan-ROK trilateral Rubio’s expected talks with both Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in Munich would take place amid concerns over North Korea’s military ties with Russia, China’s support for Russia’s defense industry, and security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. On Jan. 21, Rubio met with Iwaya in Washington to discuss strengthening U.S.-Japan cooperation against global security threats, including what officials describe as 'China’s destabilizing actions' in the Indo-Pacific. The following day, he spoke with Cho by phone, where both emphasized the need to further trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Japan and South Korea. 'We need to do more and strengthen relationships with our friends around the world,' said Republican Congressman Rob Wittman of Virginia during a discussion hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, on Tuesday. 'We should be concerned about China's growing relationships with countries like Russia,' he added. Wittman serves as the vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. He described the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea as 'transactional,' adding that Moscow’s technology transfers to Pyongyang are not out of the 'goodness of the heart.' The U.S.-Japan-ROK trilateral framework was established under former president Joe Biden’s administration. Experts, including former senior State Department official Rick Waters, note that such trilateral cooperation has become increasingly institutionalized, making it 'hard to reverse' — even amid South Korea’s political turmoil following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment over his brief martial law attempt last December. 'I’d be very surprised if, in four years, we would see anything other than further consolidation' of existing U.S. alliance frameworks in the Indo-Pacific,' Waters said Tuesday at the CSIS event. Middle East Rubio will travel to the Middle East after holding talks with his counterparts in Munich. On Tuesday, he spoke with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ahead of his visit to Abu Dhabi, the country’s capital, next week. They 'discussed the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and the importance of ensuring that Hamas releases all hostages, including American citizens,' according to the State Department. Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the two also 'highlighted the imperative of ensuring that Hamas can never rule Gaza or threaten Israel again' during the call. Trump said this week the Hamas militant group must release all hostages held in Gaza by midday Saturday, or he will propose canceling the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. Rubio is scheduled to travel to Munich, Jerusalem, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi from Feb. 13-18.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-heads-to-munich-amid-diplomatic-push-for-ukraine-peace-deal/7972321.html	2025-02-12T08:34:55-08:00	
White House blocks AP reporter from Oval Office event over ‘Gulf of America’ policy	The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from an event in the Oval Office on Tuesday because the news agency has not altered its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered renamed to the Gulf of America, the news agency said. Julie Pace, the AP’s executive editor, said the White House informed the nonprofit news agency that the AP would be blocked from the Oval Office event if the outlet did not align its editorial standards with Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. An AP reporter attempted to enter the White House event on Tuesday afternoon but was turned away. Later Tuesday night, a second AP reporter was barred from an event in the White House Diplomatic Room. 'As a global news organization, The Associated Press informs billions of people around the world every day with factual, nonpartisan journalism,' Pace said in a statement. 'It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,' Pace said. 'Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.' The White House Correspondents’ Association, or WHCA, also condemned the decision as 'unacceptable.' 'The White House cannot dictate how news organizations report the news,' WHCA President Eugene Daniels said in a statement. The White House did not immediately reply to a VOA request for comment in response to the AP and WHCA statements. Shortly after being inaugurated, Trump signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali, the highest peak in North America. According to his order, the Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali would revert to Mount McKinley — its name before President Barack Obama changed it in 2015. A few days later, the AP announced that the news agency would continue referring to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico while acknowledging the new name Trump had picked. The AP said it made that decision because the gulf has carried the Gulf of Mexico name for more than 400 years and that other countries and international bodies do not need to recognize the name change. However, since the area of the Alaskan mountain lies entirely in the United States and Trump has authority to change the name, the AP said it will use the name Mount McKinley. Thousands of journalists and writers around the world follow the AP’s style. Voice of America typically follows the AP’s style, but VOA’s standards editor announced in late January that the congressionally funded but editorially independent news outlet would begin referring to the body of water as the Gulf of America, in addition to referring to the mountain as Mount McKinley. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-blocks-ap-reporter-from-oval-office-event-over-gulf-of-america-policy/7972268.html	2025-02-12T08:00:25-08:00	
Cost of groceries, gas goes up as US inflation worsens	WASHINGTON — U.S. inflation accelerated last month as the cost of groceries, gas and used cars rose, a disappointment for families and businesses struggling with higher costs and likely underscoring the Federal Reserve's resolve to delay any further interest rate cuts. The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, Wednesday's report from the Labor Department showed, up from 2.9% the previous month. It has increased from a 3½-year low of 2.4% in September. The figures show that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target for roughly the past six months, after it fell steadily for about a year and a half. Elevated prices created a major political problem for former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump pledged to reduce prices in last year's campaign, although most economists worry that his many proposed tariffs could at least temporarily increase costs. The unexpected boost in inflation could dampen some of the business enthusiasm that arose after Trump's election on promises to reduce regulation and cut taxes. Dow futures tumbled 400 points, and all major markets are likely to sell off at the opening bell. Bond yields rose, a sign traders expect inflation and interest rates to remain high. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core consumer prices rose 3.3% in January compared with a year ago, up from 3.2% in December. Economists closely watch core prices because they can provide a better read of inflation's future. Month-to-month inflation Inflation also worsened monthly, with prices jumping 0.5% in January from December, the largest increase since August 2023. Core prices climbed 0.4% last month, the most since March 2024. Grocery prices climbed 0.5% just in January, pushed higher by a 15.2% surge in egg prices, the biggest monthly increase since June of 2015. Egg prices have soared 53% compared with a year ago. An avian flu epidemic has forced many egg producers to cull millions of birds from their flocks. Some stores have imposed limits on egg purchases, and some restaurants have placed surcharges on egg dishes. The cost of car insurance continues to rise and picked up 2% just from December to January. Hotel prices rose 1.4% last month, while the cost of a gallon of gas moved up 1.8%. Inflation often jumps in January as many companies raise their prices at the beginning of the year, although the government's seasonal adjustment process is supposed to filter out those effects. Later Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before the House Financial Services Committee, where he will likely be asked about inflation and the Fed's response to it. The Fed raised its benchmark rate in 2022 and 2023 to a two-decade high of 5.3% to combat inflation. With inflation down significantly from its 9.1% peak in June 2022, it cut its rate to about 4.3% in its final three meetings last year. Interest rates and tariffs Early Wednesday, Trump said on social media that interest rates should be lowered, 'something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!!' Yet the tick up in consumer prices makes it less likely the Fed will cut rates anytime soon. Fed officials are mostly confident that inflation over time will head lower, but they want to see further evidence that it is declining before cutting their key rate any further. The Fed's rate typically influences other borrowing costs for things such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. Inflation's recent uptick is a major reason the Federal Reserve has paused its interest rate cuts, after implementing three of them last year. 'We do not need to be in a hurry' to implement further reductions, Powell said Tuesday in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. The Trump administration's tariff policy could lift prices in the coming months. Trump on Monday imposed 25% taxes on steel and aluminum imports and has pledged to impose more tariffs. Economists at Goldman Sachs forecast that yearly core inflation would fall almost a full percentage point, to 2.3%, by the end of this year, absent any import duties. But they expect tariffs will raise end-of-year inflation to 2.8%. On Tuesday, Powell acknowledged that higher tariffs could lift inflation and limit the central bank's ability to cut rates, calling it 'a possible outcome.' But he emphasized that it would depend on how many imports are hit with tariffs and for how long. 'In some cases, it doesn't reach the consumer much, and in some cases it does,' Powell said. 'And it really does depend on facts that we haven't seen yet.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cost-of-groceries-gas-goes-up-as-us-inflation-worsens/7972230.html	2025-02-12T07:29:23-08:00	
Evacuations in eastern Ukraine's Pokrovsk as Russian forces inch closer	Ukrainian forces are trying to slow down an ongoing Russian advance toward the city of Pokrovsk in Eastern Ukraine's Dontesk region.

UN rights office estimates up to 1,400 killed in crackdown on protests in Bangladesh	Geneva — The U.N. human rights office on Wednesday estimated that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks last summer in a crackdown on student-led protests against the now-ousted former prime minister. In a new report, the Geneva-based office says security and intelligence services 'systematically engaged' in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity and require further investigation. Citing 'various credible sources,' the rights office said it estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed in the protests between July 15 and Aug. 5 — the day longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India amid the uprising. Thousands more were injured in the weeks leading up to and after the protests, and the vast majority of those killed and injured 'were shot by Bangladesh's security forces,' the report said. Over 11,700 people were detained, the report said, citing information from security services. It said that about 12 to 13% of people estimated to have be killed —- or as many as about 180 people — were children. In some cases, 'security forces engaged in summary executions by deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at point blank range,' it said. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk cited signs that 'extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture' were conducted with the knowledge and coordination of the political leadership and top security officials as a way to suppress the protests. The U.N. fact-finding team was deployed to Bangladesh at the invitation of the country's interim leader, the Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, to look into the uprising and violent crackdown. The team of investigators said the interim government has reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with attacks on religious and indigenous groups. The report said 'many perpetrators of acts of revenge, violence and attacks on distinct groups apparently continue to enjoy impunity.' The human rights situation in Bangladesh continues to raise concerns, the U.N. office said. While the government has changed, 'the system has not necessarily changed,' Rory Mungoven, head of the rights office's Asia-Pacific region, told reporters. 'Many officials and people who had served or been appointed under the previous regime continue to function,' he said. Such a situation creates 'a potential conflict of interest' and could impede reforms and accountability, Mungoven added. The investigators issued dozens of recommendations to the government, such as steps to improve the justice system and setting up a witness protection program. It also recommended banning the use of lethal firearms by security forces to disperse crowds unless they are faced with 'imminent threat of death or serious injury.' In a statement after the report was published, Yunus reiterated his government's commitment to upholding the rule of law and said it was crucial to reform the country's law enforcement and justice sectors. 'I call on everyone working inside these institutions to side with justice, the law, and the people of Bangladesh in holding to account their own peers and others who have broken the law and violated the human and civil rights of their fellow citizens,' he said. What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party. A High Court decision in early June that reinstated the quota system was the 'immediate trigger' to the protests, which were also fueled by long standing grievances about economic inequality and a lack of rights, the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-office-estimates-up-to-1-400-killed-in-crackdown-on-protests-in-bangladesh/7972079.html	2025-02-12T05:49:48-08:00

Paul McCartney rocks the Bowery - Inside his surprise NYC concert	New York — Paul McCartney’s previous New York-area performance took place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575. It was probably less than that since McCartney’s sound board and gear — too much to fit backstage — occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage. Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening. 'So, here we are,' McCartney said, grinning. 'Some little gig. New York. Why not?' Later, before launching into 'Let Me Roll It,' he added: 'I can’t quite believe we’re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.' It was not McCartney’s first impromptu concert. The Beatles famously performed in 1969 atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London. Since then, he’s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York. In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles’ famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his 'Egyptian Station.' With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes. For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery. Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. 'I thought: I can do this,' Jaffe said before the show. 'I put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.' Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: 'I don’t actually believe it.' Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom. 'We just got lucky,' Sokoloff said. 'I’m always learning about these things the day after.' McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: 'You don’t need to rehearse!' If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn’t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with 'A Hard Day’s Night' and also performed 'Got To Get You Into My Life,' 'Maybe I’m Amazed,' 'Lady Madonna,' 'Jet,' 'Get Back,' 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,' 'Let it Be' and 'Hey Jude.' 'Blackbird' was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States. 'We were just kids,' McCartney said. 'I’ve got grandchildren older than that now.' In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: 'I Want to Hold Your Hand,' 'From Me to You.' 'It had everything to do with the fans, really,' McCartney said. Before playing the Wings song 'Mrs. Vanderbilt,' McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. 'Let’s hope it gets back to that soon,' he said. Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. 'That was a Beatles scream.' Then he asked for more, saying, 'OK, let’s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.' All in attendance obliged. McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, 'Now and Then,' a ballad penned by Lennon in the late ’70s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson’s 2021 documentary, 'The Beatles: Get Back.' The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York. 'Let’s hear it for John,' he said. McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming 'Saturday Night Live' 50th anniversary festivities. He’s to be a guest on the star-studded television special Sunday. It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has said he’s hoping to finish a new album this year. For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member asked McCartney if it could go all night. 'Some of us need to get some sleep, you know,' he replied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paul-mccartney-rocks-the-bowery---inside-his-surprise-nyc-concert-/7972017.html	2025-02-12T04:33:18-08:00	
Snow and freezing rain pummel the mid-Atlantic while California prepares for likely flooding	Snow, sleet and freezing rain were expected to continue pummeling the central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic states Wednesday, while California readied for a storm that could flood areas ravaged by the recent wildfires. Especially heavy snowfall — up to nearly 25 centimeters — was expected in parts of Virginia and West Virginia, according to the National Weather Service. Ice accumulations could reach more than 8.4 millimeters in Stanleytown, Virginia, and 6.3 millimeters in Glendale Springs, North Carolina. In California, an atmospheric river — a long band of water vapor that can transport moisture from the tropics to more northern areas — was expected to move in late Wednesday, likely flooding urban areas across central and Southern California, according to the weather service. The snowstorm that blew into the mid-Atlantic states on Tuesday caused accidents on icy roads and prompted school closures. By Tuesday night, nearly 12,000 people in Virginia had lost power, according to PowerOutage.us. 'Stay home and off the roads tonight, Virginia,' the Virginia Department of Transportation posted on social media Tuesday night, alongside a meme of Dorothy from 'The Wizard of Oz' saying, 'There’s no place like home.' In parts of Baltimore and Washington, 2.5 centimeters of snow was falling each hour, according to the weather service. All Washington public schools were closed Wednesday due to the weather. Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said Tuesday it had 5,400 workers dedicated to restoring power. About 65 Virginia National Guard soldiers were at facilities along the Interstate 95 and state Route 29 corridors and in southwest Virginia to support the storm response, guard officials said. Another 20 soldiers and members of the Virginia Defense Force were in support roles. Winter storm warnings extended from northwest North Carolina to southern New Jersey, and the snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all rain by Wednesday afternoon as temperatures climb. Meanwhile a separate storm system was expected to dump heavy snow on an area stretching from Kansas to the Great Lakes starting Tuesday night, the weather service said. The Kansas Legislature canceled Wednesday meetings because of the weather, and Gov. Laura Kelly closed state offices in the capital, Topeka. Hundreds of accidents In Virginia, where Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency and schools and government offices were closed Tuesday, state police reported 700 accidents and dozens of injuries Tuesday. Matt Demlein, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, said they can't say definitively that all were weather related. In southern West Virginia, multiple crashes temporarily shut down several major highways Tuesday. Smith’s Towing and Truck Repair responded to at least 15 calls, mostly from tractor-trailer drivers who got stuck on Interstate 64 in Greenbrier County near the Virginia border, dispatcher Kelly Pickles said. 'Basically, they just get sucked over into the median or they go off of the interstate just a little bit on the right-hand side,' she said. 'And they just don’t have enough power in their vehicles to get back onto the road, due to the icy conditions.' ‘Skating rinks instead of roads’ Paige Williams, who owns Downtown Books in Lexington, Virginia, closed her store Tuesday because of the weather. She hoped to reopen Wednesday, noting that Lexington and surrounding Rockbridge County are dependable when it comes to clearing the roads. But with temperatures on either side of freezing Tuesday night and Wednesday, the rain that is supposed to follow could make the roads better or worse. 'It’s just going to depend on where those temperatures go,' Williams said. 'Rain can clear things off. And rain can also freeze. And then you have a lot of skating rinks instead of roads.' Bitter cold temperatures An Arctic air mass stretched from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes. The temperature bottomed out Tuesday morning at minus 35 Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died from cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for homeless people in the city of about 35,000 were out on the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear to anyone who needed them, according to Erickson. 'When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,' Erickson said. In Oregon’s Multnomah County, officials extended a state of emergency through at least Thursday. Five emergency shelters were set to open Tuesday night through Wednesday afternoon. Midweek wind chill readings could dip to minus 12 Celsius in Portland, the weather service said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/snow-and-freezing-rain-pummel-the-mid-atlantic-while-california-prepares-for-likely-flooding-/7972005.html	2025-02-12T04:15:34-08:00

Arab League chief rejects Trump plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza	Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected any plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, saying Wednesday that such resettlement would be 'unacceptable.' Aboul Gheit told the World Governments Summit that U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to move the roughly 2 million Palestinians out of war-ravaged Gaza would push the region into a cycle of crises with a 'damaging effect on peace and stability.' 'It's unacceptable for the Arab world, which has fought this idea for 100 years,' Aboul Gheit said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II said after talks Tuesday with Trump that he reiterated his country’s 'steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.' 'Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,' Abdullah said on X. He highlighted what he said was Trump’s 'instrumental' role in securing a ceasefire in Gaza and called on the United States and all stakeholders to ensure the halt in fighting holds. Trump has discussed a plan under which the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. Other countries in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, have rejected the idea. The status of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was in question Wednesday amid a dispute concerning the next planned release of hostage from Gaza set for Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said if more hostages are not freed by Saturday, then the Israeli military 'will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated.' Trump had earlier suggested canceling the ceasefire agreement if all hostages are not released by Saturday. Trump made his remarks Monday after Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and threatened to delay the release of three hostages set to be freed Saturday. A Hamas official said Tuesday the only way for the captives to be freed was to respect the terms of the truce. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, also said Palestinians were targeted 'with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas' and said Israel has failed 'to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.' A United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange on Saturday calls for the release of three more Israelis in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. In Paris, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Hamas to adhere to the planned hostage release. 'We must avoid at all costs the resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to an immense tragedy,' he said. 'I appeal to Hamas to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages next Saturday.' 'Both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the ceasefire agreement and resume serious negotiations in Doha for the second phase,' Guterres said. The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arab-league-chief-rejects-trump-plan-to-displace-palestinians-from-gaza-/7971978.html	2025-02-12T03:30:29-08:00	
Investigators file criminal complaints against Philippine vice president	MANILA, Philippines — Philippine government investigators filed criminal complaints, including sedition, against Vice President Sara Duterte on Wednesday over her public threat to have the president assassinated if she herself was killed in an escalating political storm. National Bureau of Investigation Director Jaime Santiago said at a news conference that the complaints of inciting to sedition and grave threats against Duterte were filed at the Department of Justice, which would decide whether to dismiss the complaints outright or elevate them to court. The vice president, a lawyer and daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, reacted briefly by saying that she had expected the move by the NBI. She has accused her political rivals of taking steps to prevent her from seeking the presidency when President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s term ends in 2028. The vice president's father himself, whose presidential term ended in 2022, is facing legal troubles. The International Criminal Court has been investigating the widespread killings under a brutal anti-drug crackdown he oversaw while in office as a possible crime against humanity. Sara Duterte ran as Marcos' vice presidential running mate in 2022. Their whirlwind political alliance, however, quickly frayed and deteriorated into a bitter feud in an Asian democracy that has long been hamstrung by clashing political clans. Last week, the vice president was impeached by the House of Representatives on a range of accusations that included her threat to have Marcos, his wife and House Speaker Martin Romualdez killed if she herself were fatally attacked in an unspecified plot that she brought up in an online news conference in November. The impeachment complaint, which was signed by majority of the more than 300 members of the House, which is dominated by Marcos' allies, also included allegations of largescale corruption and misuse of her office's confidential funds. The 24-member Senate plans to tackle the impeachment complaint after Congress reopens in June. The vice president has vaguely denied that what she said amounted to a threat against Marcos, his wife and Romualdez, the president's cousin, but her remarks still sparked a national security alarm at the time and investigations, including by the NBI. The vice president said at a news conference last week that her lawyers were preparing for a legal battle in her upcoming impeachment trial, but she refused to say if resignation was an option so that she could preempt a possible conviction that would bar her from running for president in the future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/investigators-file-criminal-complaints-against-philippine-vice-president/7971948.html	2025-02-12T02:30:28-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: China tightens censorship of short-form video dramas	China's National Radio and Television Administration released a new 'classified and tiered review' system to tighten censorship on microdramas on Feb. 5. Any microdrama themed at 'politics, national security, United Front, diplomacy, ethnicity' will be closely and directly scrutinized by the regulator. Most streaming platforms, required to manage the content themselves, will still be prohibited from distributing or promoting microdramas, unlicensed without a registration number. The latest policy runs contrary to the Chinese government's efforts since early last year to promote the microdrama industry. Why is there a sharp turn now? How will the regulator censor microdramas with sensitive themes? How will the Chinese audience respond to the tightened censorship?

VOA Kurdish: SDF secure and protect al-Hol Camp	Since Bahar al-Assad’s fall in Syria, ISIS has become more active, with attacks against the Syrian Democratic Forces intensifying, particularly in the al-Hol region.

Allies to discuss Ukraine military aid	Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said allies gathering Wednesday in Brussels would discuss the supply of military aid for Ukraine, including accelerating deliveries of key weapons such as air defense systems. Umerov’s comments came ahead of the latest meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a collection of 50 nations that has coordinated supplies for Ukraine’s military since Russia’s 2022 invasion. Umerov said Wednesday’s talks would also include investments in Ukraine’s defense industry and partnerships on projects with European partners. British Defense Secretary John Healey is leading the meeting for the first time, after previous sessions headed by the U.S. defense chief. 'We will step up support for Ukraine, boost deterrence through NATO, and secure peace through strength,' Healey said on X. New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to address the meeting at NATO’s headquarters, a day before a gathering of NATO defense ministers where Hegseth has said he will push for allies to boost their defense spending. 'Our commitment is clear: NATO must be a stronger, more lethal force — not a diplomatic club. Time for allies to meet the moment,' Hegseth said Wednesday on X. Ukraine will remain a focus on Friday, with U.S. Vice President JD Vance expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference.

US, Japan aligned in 'peace through strength' to counter China	WASHINGTON — After the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week, the two nations voiced alignment on Trump's 'peace through strength' approach toward countering China in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said. 'The prime minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security — and I also say – peace through strength all over the Indo-Pacific,' said Trump, at a press conference after his meeting Friday with Ishiba in Washington. 'We agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese economic aggression, which is quite aggressive,' Trump said. Ishiba said: 'Further strengthening the strong and unwavering Japan-U.S. alliance to achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific' is key 'to advance the national interests of both of our countries in synergy and to realize peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.' Analysts say the first official meeting between Trump and Ishiba succeeded in striking agreements on what both leaders consider crucial: combating China's aggression and strengthening their national interests. Security commitment Ishiba continued to forge close ties with the U.S. to maintain multilateral alliance security cooperation close to home in the Indo-Pacific, while Trump secured Japanese investments and purchases. Taken together, analysts say, Ishiba is aligned with Trump's vision of making the U.S. strong at home in his 'America First' approach as a prerequisite for maintaining peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific, a region crucial to Japan's defense. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué went a long way to reaffirm Trump's peace through strength approach to the Indo-Pacific,' said Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué, which President Trump signed off on, highlighted the importance of multilateral networks in the Indo-Pacific,' Weinstein told VOA on Sunday. 'The two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation' with the Quad security dialogue and three separate trilateral ties with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines 'to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific,' Trump and Ishiba said in a joint statement. There were concerns by some that Trump would not support alliance security formations aimed at maintaining peace and security in the region. 'A big concern on the part of the Japanese' was whether the Biden administration's emphasis 'on the centrality of alliance' or the 'so-called multilayered structures' or 'mini laterals' would continue, said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford University. Sneider told VOA on Monday, 'It was reassuring for the Japanese and for those in the U.S. who are worried whether those types of policies would have continuity that there was at least a written affirmation of those things in the joint statement.' In their joint statement, Trump and Ishiba also expressed 'strong opposition' to China's attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea and its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea. They also expressed support for Taiwan's 'meaningful participation in international organizations' and opposed China's efforts to disturb stability across the Taiwan Strait. At a press briefing held in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun, said, 'The part of the U.S.-Japan joint statement on China constitutes open interference in China's domestic affairs and an attack and smear against China, which is also aimed at scaremongering in the region.' Increased investment Trump announced at the press conference that Japan will invest $1 trillion in the U.S., participate in the Alaska LNG project, and invest in, rather than buy, U.S. Steel. In one of the first executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 20, he made Alaskan natural resources open to development and production and its liquefied natural gas available for sale to U.S. allied nations within the Pacific region. Ishiba said, 'An unprecedented investment' from Japan to the U.S. and the Japanese investments in U.S. Steel are 'mutually beneficial' and 'contribute not only to the United States and Japan but also to the whole world.' Weinstein, at Hudson, said, 'The announcement of a trillion dollars in foreign investment in the U.S. was the landmark moment, as was the announcement of the investments in the LNG sector' and 'the pending U.S. Steel investment.' 'Ishiba is supporting what is in Japan's best interest: an alliance with minimal distance between the U.S. and Japan,' he said. 'So he understands he needs to back the America First approach to continue alignment with the Trump administration. A strong America is the best guarantee for global peace and stability.' In explaining what foreign policy would look like under the Trump administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during his confirmation hearing in January, emphasized 'a foreign policy centered on our national interest' and making the U.S. strong first at home as the prerequisite for maintaining peace and security around the world. 'Ishiba respects Trump's America First' policy, but he is also a 'Japan first' prime minister, said Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan Program at the Stimson Center. She told VOA on Friday that 'both leaders gained. Trump got a commitment of increased investment by Japan in the U.S., while Ishiba gained Trump's articulation of the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japanese territory, including the Senkaku Islands, and the joint statement in which U.S.-Japan support for Taiwan was articulated.' In the joint statement, Ishiba and Trump underscored the United States' 'unwavering commitment' to defending Japan using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two also 'reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to undermine Japan's long and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands.' There is 'continuity' from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, Tatsumi said, and that is to make U.S.-Japan ties 'the hub of alliance cooperation and partnership across the Indo-Pacific.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-japan-aligned-in-peace-through-strength-to-counter-china/7971803.html	2025-02-12T00:21:06-08:00	
Deadly Russian missile, drone attacks hit Kyiv	Ukrainian officials said Wednesday Russian forces launched overnight attacks involving ballistic missiles and more than 120 drones, killing at least one person in Kyiv. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three other people also were injured as a result of the attacks. Kyiv emergency services reported fires and other damage at buildings in four districts in the city. Ukraine’s military said missiles also targeted the city of Kryvyi Rih, located in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said on Telegram that Russian attacks damaged a school, hotel, administrative building and three apartment buildings. Ukrainian air defenses shot down six missiles and 71 of the 123 drones that Russian forces deployed, the Ukrainian air force said. Drone intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions. 'Putin is not preparing for peace - he continues to kill Ukrainians and destroy cities,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging app. 'Right now, we need the unity and support of all our partners in the fight for a just end to this war.' Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it shot down three Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-russian-missile-drone-attacks-hit-kyiv-/7971903.html	2025-02-11T23:54:23-08:00	
Pakistan sees economy on long-term recovery path under IMF program	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan's economy is on a path to long-term recovery, thanks to a stabilization program backed by the International Monetary Fund, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said ahead of a first review of a $7-billion IMF bailout set for early in March. The comments came in Sharif's meeting on Tuesday with Kristalina Georgieva on the sidelines of the World Government Summit 2025 in Dubai, his office said in a statement. He underscored the progress made under the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF), which has played a key role in stabilizing Pakistan's economy and set it on the path of long-term recovery, it added. Ahead of the IMF review, the government and central bank have expressed confidence about meeting its targets, even as Pakistan, bolstered by the bailout secured in September, struggles to navigate the recovery. Tuesday's meeting focused on the macroeconomic stability, achieved by the government's agenda for comprehensive reform under the IMF program. Discussions highlighted Pakistan's commitment to adopting structural reforms and maintaining fiscal discipline under the IMF program, Sharif's office said. He reaffirmed his government's resolve to maintain reform momentum, particularly in critical areas such as taxes, energy efficiency and private sector development, it added. A three-member IMF mission, separately, is currently in Pakistan for a an assessment under the EFF program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-sees-economy-on-long-term-recovery-path-under-imf-program/7971891.html	2025-02-11T23:25:23-08:00	
Russia says some of the 300 fishermen stranded on ice floe refused evacuation	Some of the 300 Russian fishermen stranded on an ice floe drifting in the Sea of Okhotsk in the Western Pacific have refused evacuation, Russia's emergency ministry said on Wednesday. A rescue operation with helicopters and vessels has brought 109 of the fishermen ashore, but some refused to be rescued, the ministry said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. 'Some extreme sports enthusiasts are not going to leave without a catch, under any circumstances,' the ministry said. It posted a video showing fishermen walking on snowy ice away from the rescuers. It was unclear why so many fishermen had gathered at the location. About a 10-meter ice crack formed from the Russian village of Malki to the mouth of the Dolinka River in the Sakhalin region, setting the fishermen adrift in the Sea of Okhotsk, the ministry said earlier. Winters in the Sakhalin region in Russia's Far East, which comprises the Sakhalin Island and the chain of the Kuril Islands, are cold, snowy and long, often lasting more than five months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-some-of-the-300-fishermen-stranded-on-ice-floe-refused-evacuation/7971888.html	2025-02-11T23:05:46-08:00	
Teacher questioned in stabbing death of first-grader in South Korea	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean police on Tuesday were questioning an elementary school teacher who allegedly stabbed a first-grader to death in the city of Daejeon. The killing on Monday during after-school care has shocked the nation and prompted the country's acting president to order school safety standards reviewed. The female suspect was receiving medical treatment for self-inflicted wounds following the death of the girl in an audio-visual room on the second floor of the school, said Yuk Jong-myeong, chief of Daejeon's western district police station. The suspect, reported to be in her 40s, told police that she had recently returned to work after a period of leave for health reasons, Yuk said. She told police she has received treatment for depression since 2018. After the first-grade student was reported missing at 5:15 p.m. local time Monday, police and family members searched throughout the school and surrounding areas. Her grandmother found her in the audio-visual room around 5:50 p.m. The girl was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Choi Sang-mok, who is the country's acting leader due to President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment, called for a thorough investigation into the killing and instructed education authorities to 'implement necessary measures to ensure such incidents never happen again.' Visitors laid flowers and condolence letters at the gate of the school, which was closed on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teacher-questioned-in-stabbing-death-of-first-grader-in-south-korea/7971886.html	2025-02-11T22:50:43-08:00	
Giant schnauzer named Monty wins top prize at Westminster Kennel Club	NEW YORK — A giant schnauzer named Monty won the top prize at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show Tuesday night. Monty bested six other finalists to take best in show at Madison Square Garden. The award is considered the most prestigious prize in the U.S. dog show world. Each dog is judged according to how closely it matches the ideal for its breed. Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash prize. Other finalists included a bichon frisé called Neal, a Skye terrier named Archer, a whippet and repeat runner-up known as Bourbon, a shih tzu called Comet who's been a finalist before, a German shepherd named Mercedes, who came in second last year, and an English springer spaniel called Freddie. Monty made the finals for a third year in a row and won the huge American Kennel Club's big show in December. A Westminster win is considered the most prestigious award in the U.S. dog show world. Each dog is judged according to how closely it matches the ideal for its breed. Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash prize. Every dog at Westminster is a titled champion, but they also are household pets. Some also do therapy work, search-and-rescue or other canine jobs. 'A good German shepherd is an all-purpose dog,' said co-breeder and co-owner Sheree Moses Combs of Wardensville, West Virginia. Some of her pups have become service dogs for wounded veterans, she said. 'Dog shows are fun, but that is what our breed is all about,' she said. Big dogs had their day at Westminster on Tuesday, when 'working' breeds had their turns in the ring. First-round competitor Brina, for instance, is a 71.6 kilogram Neapolitan mastiff. 'I've been struck by this breed since I was 12. ... They're so unique,' owner Yves Belmont, Ph.D., said as Brina napped in her crate, equipped with a 7.5-liter water bucket. With their size, jowly heads and guard-dog history, the breed was developed to be imposing. But Belmont, who currently has several of them at his family's Atlanta-area home, said he also is impressed by their intelligence. A trip to Westminster is a reminder of dogs' variety, even just among purebreds. The same day Brina competed, Tyra the miniature bull terrier also strutted her stuff. Formally called GCH CH Rnr's Top Model, she's named after fashion model Tyra Banks. The hardy terrier breed is 'a big dog in a small package, but they always keep you smiling,' said owner and co-breeder Jessica Harrison of Austin, Texas. Asked where the 2-year-old Tyra falls on the mischief meter, Harrison smiled, 'like a nine, for sure.' 'You can't be upset with them because they're just so cute,' she said as Tyra rolled on her back to get a belly rub from a passerby at the Javits Center, the convention venue that hosted the first-round judging of each breed. Regardless which dog gets the trophy at Westminster, others also have scored points with the crowd. During two nights of semifinals, spectators shouted out breeds and names of canine competitors as if they played for one of the pro teams that call the Garden home, the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers. 'Love you, Lumpy!' someone yelled to a Pekingese named Lumpy, who earned laughs for his ambling gait. The arena erupted with cheers for a golden retriever named Tuffy, a representative of a popular breed that has never won. Calaco, a Xoloitzcuintli, got huge applause for a confident performance that also earned him some recognition from the judge. Xoloitzcuintlis, are hairless dogs with deep roots in Mexico. A Doberman pinscher called Penny got whoops of approval from spectators, too. Despite her dignified, focused appearance, Penny can be 'a mush,' breeder and co-owner Theresa Connors-Chan of Ontario, Canada, said earlier in the day. Westminster also featured agility and obedience championships, held Saturday. The agility prize went to a border collie named Vanish, and an Australian shepherd called Willie triumphed in obedience.	https://www.voanews.com/a/giant-schnauzer-named-monty-wins-top-prize-at-westminster-kennel-club/7971860.html	2025-02-11T20:37:52-08:00	
US teacher returns home after being freed by Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed American teacher Marc Fogel to the White House late Tuesday after Fogel was freed from Russia where he had been detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country. 'I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,' Fogel said as he stood next to Trump. Fogel praised the president, U.S. diplomats and lawmakers for working to secure his release. 'I am in awe of what they all did,' Fogel said. Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond calling it 'very fair' and very reasonable.' Trump also said another hostage release would be announced Wednesday. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said earlier Tuesday the United States and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to free Fogel but gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In such deals in recent years, the U.S. has often released Russian prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange. Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader geopolitical terms, saying it was 'a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' an invasion Russia launched against its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or wounded on both sides. Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before taking office Jan. 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by the end of April. 'Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States,' Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances. Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying him as wrongfully detained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-teacher-returns-home-after-being-freed-by-russia/7971848.html	2025-02-11T20:20:52-08:00	
Russia frees American schoolteacher Marc Fogel after four years	WASHINGTON — Russia released American schoolteacher Marc Fogel on Tuesday following an unannounced visit to Moscow by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and he was headed for a White House welcome, U.S. President Donald Trump said. The release of 63-year-old Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since August 2021 and was serving a 14-year sentence, came as Trump seeks to improve relations with Moscow as part of an effort to secure an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump told reporters that Fogel would visit the White House on his return to the U.S. late on Tuesday, and White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said he would also be reunited Tuesday night with his family, who celebrated the news. On a plane home, Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, was shown with a raised glass, a cheese plate and his U.S. passport in a photo posted on social media by Trump's chief hostage envoy Adam Boehler. Asked what the United States gave up in exchange for Fogel, Trump said: 'Not much' and called the release a show of good faith from the Russians. 'We were treated very nicely by Russia. Actually, I hope that's the beginning of a relationship where we can end that (Ukraine) war and millions of people can stop being killed,' Trump said. Fogel was sentenced to 14 years in prison for drug smuggling after he was detained in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport in August 2021 with 17 grams of marijuana in his luggage. The marijuana had been medically prescribed in Pennsylvania, where it is legal, said Martin De Luca, a member of Fogel's legal team. Witkoff's plane was on the ground in Moscow for a few hours before leaving with Fogel onboard, flying through central Europe and back to Washington, De Luca told Reuters. 'We are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home,' the Fogel family said in a statement. 'This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.' Fogel's Russian lawyer Dmitry Ovsyannikov confirmed the release to state news agency RIA. 'For the moment, we don't know on what grounds he was released from where he was serving time - a pardon or something else,' Ovsyannikov told TASS. He told Russia's Interfax news agency that Fogel was last week transferred from a prison in Rybinsk, north of Moscow, to a pre-trial detention center in Moscow ahead of his release. Fogel was left out of a historic swap of prisoners in August that involved 24 prisoners - 16 sent from Russia to the West, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, and eight sent back to Russia from the West. Trump has indicated he has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin but has been vague on the details other than to say he is insistent on ending the three-year-old Ukraine war. 'We're making good progress there. I think, I really think we're making some very good progress,' Trump told reporters about Ukraine on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-frees-american-schoolteacher-marc-fogel-after-four-years/7971848.html	2025-02-11T19:46:59-08:00	
White House fires USAID inspector general after funding oversight warning, officials say	WASHINGTON — The White House fired the inspector general for the U.S. Agency for International Development on Tuesday, several U.S. officials said. The dismissal comes a day after his office warned that the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID had made it all but impossible to monitor $8.2 billion in unspent humanitarian funds. The White House gave no reason for the firing of Inspector General Paul Martin, one of the officials said. The dismissal was first reported by CNN. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Inspectors general are typically independently funded watchdogs tasked with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse at government agencies. The Trump administration earlier purged more than a dozen inspectors general. On Monday, Martin's office issued a flash report warning that the Trump administration's funding freeze and staff actions within USAID had left oversight of the humanitarian aid 'largely nonoperational.' That includes the agency's greatly reduced ability to ensure none of the $8.2 billion in unspent unhumanitarian funds falls into the hands of violent extremist groups or goes astray in conflict zones, the watchdog said. Multiparty lawsuit Separately, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleged that the Trump administration's fast-paced dismantling of USAID is stiffing American businesses on hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills for work that has already been done. The administration's abrupt freeze on foreign aid also is forcing mass layoffs by U.S. suppliers and contractors for USAID, including 750 furloughs at one company, Washington-based Chemonics International, the lawsuit says. 'One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order,' the U.S. businesses and organizations said. An organization representing 170 small U.S. businesses, major suppliers, an American Jewish group aiding displaced people abroad, the American Bar Association and others joined the court challenge. It was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington against President Donald Trump; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; acting USAID Deputy Administrator Peter Marocco, a Trump appointee who has been a central figure in hollowing out the agency; and Russell Vought, Trump's head of the Office of Management and Budget. Marocco defended the funding cutoff and push to put all but a fraction of USAID staff on leave in an affidavit filed late Monday in the lawsuit brought by the workers' groups. 'Insubordination' and 'noncompliance' by USAID staffers made it necessary to stop funding and operations by the agency to allow the administration to carry out a program-by-program review to decide which U.S. aid programs could resume overseas, Marocco wrote. It is at least the third lawsuit over the administration's rapid unraveling of the U.S. aid and development agency and its programs worldwide. Trump and ally Elon Musk have targeted USAID in particular, saying its work is out of line with Trump's agenda. Marocco, Musk and Rubio have overseen an across-the-board freeze on foreign assistance and an agency shutdown under a January 20 executive order by Trump. A lawsuit brought by federal employees associations has temporarily blocked the administration from pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job. The funding freeze and other measures have persisted, including the agency losing the lease on its Washington headquarters. Interceding for farmers The new administration terminated contracts without the required 30-day notice and without back payments for work that was already done, according to a U.S. official, a businessperson with a USAID contract and an email seen by The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal by the Trump administration. For Chemonics, one of the larger of the USAID partners, the funding freeze has meant $103 million in unpaid invoices and almost $500 million in USAID-ordered medication, food and other goods stalled in the supply chain or ports, the lawsuit says. For the health commodities alone, not delivering them 'on time could potentially lead to as many as 566,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and unmet reproductive health needs, including 215,000 pediatric deaths,' the lawsuit says. Meanwhile, seven Republican lawmakers from farm states introduced legislation to safeguard a long-running $1.8 billion food-aid program run by the aid agency, by moving the Food for Peace program under the Department of Agriculture. Farmers, a politically important bloc for the Trump administration, have been affected by the administration's funding freeze as well. Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran, who announced the legislation, over the weekend thanked Rubio for interceding to allow delivery of $560 million in U.S.-grown commodities intended for hunger programs worldwide but stuck in ports because of the administration's abrupt cutoff of foreign assistance spending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-fires-usaid-inspector-general-after-funding-oversight-warning-officials-say-/7971828.html	2025-02-11T19:42:32-08:00	
New York health department confirms first case of new mpox strain	The New York State Department of Health on Tuesday confirmed its first case of the new mpox strain, adding to the global concerns over the spread of the little-known variant. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were three confirmed cases in the country — in California, Georgia and New Hampshire — caused by the clade Ib strain. The agency said the three cases were not linked. The World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years in August, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighboring countries. The New York State Department of Health declined to provide further information on the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-health-department-confirms-first-case-of-new-mpox-strain/7971833.html	2025-02-11T18:44:46-08:00	
DOGE cuts $900M from agency tracking US students' progress	WASHINGTON — A federal research agency that tracks the progress of America's students is to lose $900 million in funding after Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency found no need for much of its work. It's unclear to what degree the Education Department's Institute of Education Sciences will continue to exist after Musk's team slashed scores of contracts. Industry groups said at least 169 contracts were suddenly terminated Monday, accounting for much of the institute's work. The Education Department did not immediately share details on the cuts. Madison Biedermann, an agency spokesperson, said the action will not affect the institute's primary work, including the NAEP assessment, known as the nation's report card, and the College Scorecard, a database of university costs and outcomes. Musk's grip on the Education Department was dealt a setback Tuesday when the agency temporarily blocked DOGE workers from more than a dozen internal systems containing sensitive information. As part of a lawsuit challenging its access, the department agreed to block Musk's team until at least Monday while a judge weighs a broader pause. Advocates sound alarm The cuts to the institute raised alarm among advocates who said it could hurt the accountability of America's education system, leaving the nation in the dark on schools' effectiveness. Historically, achievement gaps have shown low-income students and students of color falling behind their peers. The cuts are counterproductive and destructive, said Rachel Dinkes, president and CEO of the Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education research firms. 'Cutting out at the knees the one independent agency that helps improve student outcomes is ridiculous,' Dinkes said. Biedermann declined to share the names of vendors whose contracts were cut. Cuts under contract clause The Institute of Education Sciences is a central source of information on the health of America's education system. Across the country, it tracks student progress over time and across demographics. It evaluates the effectiveness of federal programs, and colleges and schools rely on its research to improve student outcomes. The cuts appear to have been carried out under a clause allowing IES to end contracts at any time 'for the government's convenience,' according to notices obtained by The Associated Press. Among the projects being cut is a study exploring how to accelerate math learning for students in fourth and fifth grade, according to a document obtained by the AP. Known as ReSolve, the project was being led by research group MDRC. Last month, IES released the latest NAEP results, revealing that America's children have continued to lose ground on reading skills and made little improvement in math in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Activate Research, a small business, lost four contracts and plans to lay off at least 20 of its 28 workers. The company was hired to ensure accuracy and objectivity in reports. When founder Dinah Sparks announced the company was winding down Tuesday, she had a message for her team: 'We are not waste,' she said. 'We did valuable work for the U.S. taxpayer.' Another small business lost multiple contracts after being hired to collect basic information on the nation's schools. The company started laying off workers this week, according to an employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Congress gave the institute about $800 million last year, roughly 1% of the Education Department's annual budget. Associations call to reinstate contracts Two prominent research associations jointly called for the contracts to be reinstated, saying much of IES' work is mandated by Congress and relies on contracts to support its limited staff. The groups said 169 contracts had been cut, curbing the institute's ability to report data on school finances and student outcomes. The institute oversees a wide range of work, including the administration of the NAEP exam and U.S. participation in PISA, an assessment that compares academic progress across nations. It's also a major funder of education research and keeps a database of research that has shown results in improving education. IES shines a light on inequity, and its work is 'more than just numbers and statistics,' said the Education Trust, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. 'Without it, we are left in the dark, unable to see where educational gaps exist or how to close them,' the group said in a statement. Mark Schneider, a former IES commissioner appointed by President Donald Trump in 2018, said the cuts give the new administration a chance to rethink programs that have changed little in decades. 'The question is not what happened on Monday; it's what happens next,' Schneider said. 'If we just swing this sledgehammer, break all this stuff and say, 'OK, done,' then we've wasted an opportunity to fix things.' Democratic Senator Patty Murray, a former teacher and member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said she will be 'sounding the alarm' to fight the cuts. Trump has promised to abolish the Education Department and turn its power over to states and schools. The White House is considering an order that would direct Trump's education chief to dismantle the agency as far as possible while calling on Congress to fully shut it down. It's unclear how far Trump could act on his own to slash the department's spending, much of which is ordered by Congress.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doge-cuts-900m-from-agency-tracking-us-students-progress/7971800.html	2025-02-11T18:27:31-08:00	
Fresh fighting flares in eastern DR Congo	Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo — Fighting erupted Tuesday in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, three days after a call by African leaders for a ceasefire and a brief lull in the conflict. M23 fighters attacked Congolese army positions in South Kivu province at dawn, local and security sources told AFP. The DRC government has designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. Congo accuses Rwanda of supporting the rebels, a charge that Rwanda denies. The resurgence comes after east and southern African leaders called on their general staff to propose a plan for implementing an 'unconditional' ceasefire by Thursday, in a conflict which has killed thousands and driven vast numbers from their homes. The M23 has in recent months swiftly seized tracts of territory in mineral-rich east DRC after again taking up arms in late 2021, in a country plagued by numerous conflicts for decades. The armed group began advancing in South Kivu after taking control of Goma, the capital of neighboring North Kivu province that borders Rwanda, at the end of last month. Clashes took place Tuesday near the village of Ihusi, around 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the provincial capital Bukavu and 40 kilometers from the province's airport, according to security sources. Several local sources reported 'detonations of heavy weapons'. Kavumu airport is used by the Congolese army to transport reinforcements of troops and equipment to the region and its main military base is located nearby. Bukavu has been preparing for an M23 offensive for several days, with schools shuttering in the city Friday as residents began to flee and shops closed over fears of an imminent attack. Banks were still shut in the city Tuesday. The capture of Bukavu would give full control of Lake Kivu to the M23 and Rwandan troops. Almost 300 Congolese soldiers are currently on trial in a military court in the city, for charges including rape, murder and looting. The M23, which claims to want to 'liberate all of Congo' and oust President Felix Tshisekedi, has attempted in recent days to advance into the highlands overlooking the main road to Bukavu to cut off the DRC army's supply lines. But Burundian soldiers, who are in east DRC to support the Congolese army, stopped the M23 advances, security sources said. Around 10,000 Burundian soldiers are deployed in South Kivu, according to a security source. Bujumbura sent at least one additional army battalion to the area Friday, a security source told AFP. The M23 has begun setting up its own administration in Goma, a city of 1 million people, launching recruitment campaigns, including to create a police force. The humanitarian situation in Goma is worsening with no running water in large parts of the city and residents forced to take water from Lake Kivu, where bodies were recovered after the fighting. An increase in cholera cases has been seen in the region, particularly among people displaced by the conflict, UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, said. The city's airport also remains closed despite a United Nations appeal last week to try allow for the transport of humanitarian aid and the wounded. The crisis in east DRC is set to be discussed at an African Union meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on Friday. With the recent intensification of the conflict, calls for de-escalation from the international community have increased amid fears the fighting could lead to a regional war. But diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict that has lasted for more than three years have so far been unsuccessful. The DRC has called for 'targeted sanctions' against Rwanda but with little effect. Kinshasa accuses Kigali of wanting to plunder natural resources in the DRC, such as tantalum and tin used in batteries and electronic equipment, as well as gold. Rwanda denies this, saying it wants to remove armed groups it believes pose a permanent threat to its security, notably the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), created by former Hutu leaders of the 1994 genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda. To add to Kinshasa's woes, an attack by a militia from the Lendu ethnic group in the northeastern Ituri province killed 51 people, local and humanitarian sources told AFP on Tuesday. Members of the Cooperative for the Development of Congo (CODECO) killed 51 mostly displaced people in three adjoining areas of Ituri province on Monday, humanitarian sources and a local community leader, Jules Tsuba, said. CODECO was a peaceful agricultural cooperative before transforming into an armed rebel movement fighting the rival Hema community. Monday's raid was allegedly a response to a strike by a Hema militia earlier in the same area. Different conflicts and rebellions have plagued the country for more than 30 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fresh-fighting-flares-in-eastern-dr-congo/7971820.html	2025-02-11T18:24:20-08:00	
First US Navy ships sail through Taiwan Strait since Trump inauguration	BEIJING — Two U.S. Navy ships sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait this week in the first such mission since President Donald Trump took office last month, drawing an angry reaction from China, which said the mission increased security risks. The U.S. Navy, occasionally accompanied by ships from allied countries, transits the strait about once a month. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, says the strategic waterway belongs to it. China's military said the two U.S. ships, which it named as the destroyer Lyndon B. Johnson and the survey ship Bowditch, had passed through the strait between Monday and Wednesday, adding that Chinese forces had been dispatched to keep watch. 'The U.S. action sends the wrong signals and increases security risks,' the Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army said in a statement early Wednesday. The U.S. Navy confirmed the transit. The last publicly acknowledged U.S. Navy mission in the strait was in late November, when a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flew over the waterway. The last time a U.S. Navy ship was confirmed to have sailed through the strait was in October, a joint mission with a Canadian warship. China's military operates daily in the strait as part of what Taiwan's government views as part of Beijing's pressure campaign. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only Taiwan's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-us-navy-ships-sail-through-taiwan-strait-since-trump-inauguration/7971825.html	2025-02-11T18:23:37-08:00	
US, Japan aligned in 'peace through strength' to counter China	WASHINGTON — After the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week, the two nations voiced alignment on Trump's 'peace through strength' approach toward countering China in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said. 'The prime minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security — and I also say – peace through strength all over the Indo-Pacific,' said Trump, at a press conference after his meeting Friday with Ishiba in Washington. 'We agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese economic aggression, which is quite aggressive,' Trump said. Ishiba said: 'Further strengthening the strong and unwavering Japan-U.S. alliance to achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific' is key 'to advance the national interests of both of our countries in synergy and to realize peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.' Analysts say the first official meeting between Trump and Ishiba succeeded in striking agreements on what both leaders consider crucial: combating China's aggression and strengthening their national interests. Security commitment Ishiba continued to forge close ties with the U.S. to maintain multilateral alliance security cooperation close to home in the Indo-Pacific, while Trump secured Japanese investments and purchases. Taken together, analysts say, Ishiba is aligned with Trump's vision of making the U.S. strong at home in his 'America First' approach as a prerequisite for maintaining peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific, a region crucial to Japan's defense. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué went a long way to reaffirm Trump's peace through strength approach to the Indo-Pacific,' said Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute. 'The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué, which President Trump signed off on, highlighted the importance of multilateral networks in the Indo-Pacific,' Weinstein told VOA on Sunday. 'The two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation' with the Quad security dialogue and three separate trilateral ties with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines 'to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific,' Trump and Ishiba said in a joint statement. There were concerns by some that Trump would not support alliance security formations aimed at maintaining peace and security in the region. 'A big concern on the part of the Japanese' was whether the Biden administration's emphasis 'on the centrality of alliance' or the 'so-called multilayered structures' or 'mini laterals' would continue, said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford University. Sneider told VOA on Monday, 'It was reassuring for the Japanese and for those in the U.S. who are worried whether those types of policies would have continuity that there was at least a written affirmation of those things in the joint statement.' In their joint statement, Trump and Ishiba also expressed 'strong opposition' to China's attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea and its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea. They also expressed support for Taiwan's 'meaningful participation in international organizations' and opposed China's efforts to disturb stability across the Taiwan Strait. At a press briefing held in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun, said, 'The part of the U.S.-Japan joint statement on China constitutes open interference in China's domestic affairs and an attack and smear against China, which is also aimed at scaremongering in the region.' Increased investment Trump announced at the press conference that Japan will invest $1 trillion in the U.S., participate in the Alaska LNG project, and invest in, rather than buy, U.S. Steel. In one of the first executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 20, he made Alaskan natural resources open to development and production and its liquefied natural gas available for sale to U.S. allied nations within the Pacific region. Ishiba said, 'An unprecedented investment' from Japan to the U.S. and the Japanese investments in U.S. Steel are 'mutually beneficial' and 'contribute not only to the United States and Japan but also to the whole world.' Weinstein, at Hudson, said, 'The announcement of a trillion dollars in foreign investment in the U.S. was the landmark moment, as was the announcement of the investments in the LNG sector' and 'the pending U.S. Steel investment.' 'Ishiba is supporting what is in Japan's best interest: an alliance with minimal distance between the U.S. and Japan,' he said. 'So he understands he needs to back the America First approach to continue alignment with the Trump administration. A strong America is the best guarantee for global peace and stability.' In explaining what foreign policy would look like under the Trump administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during his confirmation hearing in January, emphasized 'a foreign policy centered on our national interest' and making the U.S. strong first at home as the prerequisite for maintaining peace and security around the world. 'Ishiba respects Trump's America First' policy, but he is also a 'Japan first' prime minister, said Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan Program at the Stimson Center. She told VOA on Friday that 'both leaders gained. Trump got a commitment of increased investment by Japan in the U.S., while Ishiba gained Trump's articulation of the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japanese territory, including the Senkaku Islands, and the joint statement in which U.S.-Japan support for Taiwan was articulated.' In the joint statement, Ishiba and Trump underscored the United States' 'unwavering commitment' to defending Japan using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two also 'reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to undermine Japan's long and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands.' There is 'continuity' from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, Tatsumi said, and that is to make U.S.-Japan ties 'the hub of alliance cooperation and partnership across the Indo-Pacific.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7971803.html	2025-02-11T17:44:45-08:00	
Appeals court rejects push to reinstate spending freezes on grants, loans	Washington — A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a Trump administration push to reinstate a sweeping pause on federal funding, a decision that comes after a judge found the administration had not fully obeyed an earlier order. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned back the emergency appeal, though it said it expected the lower court judge to act quickly to clarify. The Justice Department had asked the appeals court to let it implement sweeping pauses on federal grants and loans, calling the lower court order to keep promised money flowing 'intolerable judicial overreach.' That ruling came from U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island, the first judge to find that the administration had disobeyed a court order. He is presiding over a lawsuit from nearly two dozen Democratic states filed after the administration issued a boundary-pushing memo purporting to halt all federals grants and loans, worth trillions of dollars. The plan sparked chaos around the country. The administration has since rescinded that memo, but McConnell found Monday that not all federal grants and loans had been restored. Money for things like early childhood education, pollution reduction and HIV prevention research has remained tied up even after his Jan. 31 order halting the spending freeze plan, the states said. McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ordered the Trump administration to 'immediately take every step necessary' to unfreeze all federal grants and loans. He also said his order blocked the administration from cutting billions of dollars in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health, a move announced last week. The Justice Department said McConnell's order prevents the executive branch from exercising its lawful authority, including over discretionary spending or fraud. 'A single district court judge has attempted to wrest from the President the power to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' This state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist for one more day,' government attorneys wrote in their appeal. The states, meanwhile, argued that the president can't block money that Congress has approved, and the still-frozen grants and loans are causing serious problems for their residents. They urged the appeals court to keep allowing the case to play out in front of McConnell. The court battle is unfolding as a string of court losses is increasingly frustrating top administration officials by slowing President Donald Trump's wide-ranging agenda . Judges have also blocked, at least temporarily, Trump's push to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S., access to Treasury Department records by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and a mass deferred resignation plan for federal workers. The Republican administration previously said the sweeping funding pause would bring federal spending in line with the president's priorities, including increasing fossil fuel production, removing protections for transgender people and ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. A different federal judge in Washington has also issued a temporary restraining order against the funding freeze plan and since expressed concern that some nonprofit groups weren't getting their funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/appeals-court-rejects-push-to-reinstate-spending-freezes-on-grants-loans/7971794.html	2025-02-11T17:21:17-08:00	
Vance stakes forceful claim to US leadership in AI	U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on Tuesday vowed that the United States would maintain its leadership position in the development of advanced artificial intelligence and warned leaders of other countries not to adopt regulatory standards that might 'kill' the new technology 'just as it's taking off.' 'The United States of America is the leader in AI, and our administration plans to keep it that way,' Vance told an audience of world leaders at an AI summit in Paris. He said the administration of President Donald Trump 'will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the U.S. with American-designed and manufactured chips.' Vance said that the U.S. is open to collaboration with its allies. 'But,' he said, 'to create that kind of trust, we need international regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than strangles it, and we need our European friends in particular to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.' Regulations criticized The vice president criticized the European Union's regulatory structure, in particular the privacy-focused General Data Protection Regulation and the misinformation-focused Digital Services Act, and he said the Trump administration will not accept foreign governments 'tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints.' Vance also appeared to criticize the effort in Europe to replace power generated by burning fossil fuels with more sustainable sources, saying that countries are 'chasing reliable power out of their nations' at a time when AI systems demand ever-greater access to electricity. 'The AI future is not going to be won by handwringing about safety,' Vance said. 'It will be won by building — from reliable power plants to the manufacturing facilities that can produce the chips of the future.' While dozens of countries in attendance at the summit signed a joint declaration on 'building trustworthy data governance frameworks to encourage development of innovative and privacy-protective AI,' the U.S. and U.K. did not. More calls for reduced regulation Although not as dismissive of regulations and safety concerns as Vice President Vance, other leaders at the summit appeared to agree that the regulatory burden on companies in the AI field should be lightened. French President Emmanuel Macron, the summit's host, said that while safety concerns are important, Europe also needs to make it easier for AI firms there to move quickly and innovate at the same pace as other countries. 'At the national and European scale, it is very clear that we have to resynchronize with the rest of the world,' Macron said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen defended the bloc's privacy regulations and other standards, pointing out that they are meant to help businesses by creating rules that apply uniformly across all 27 member countries. 'At the same time, I know that we have to make it easier, and we have to cut red tape — and we will,' von der Leyen said. Veiled China comments Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, who also attended the summit, said Beijing is prepared to work with other countries to develop AI technology, and it is willing to share its discoveries in the field with the aim of creating 'a community with a shared future for mankind.' In his remarks on Tuesday, Vance did not mention China by name but appeared to warn other nations against engaging in the kind of collaboration that Zhang described. Vance spoke of 'hostile foreign adversaries' that 'have weaponized AI software to rewrite history, surveil users and censor speech' and authoritarian regimes that have 'stolen and used AI to strengthen their military intelligence and surveillance capabilities to capture foreign data and create propaganda to undermine other nations national security.' Partnering with authoritarian regimes, Vance said, 'means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure.' The remarks came at a time when the U.S. is taking wide-ranging action to prevent China from gaining access to the most cutting-edge AI technologies. Recent news reports revealing that a seemingly innovative Chinese AI chatbot known as DeepSeek has been collecting user data and storing it on insecure servers in China has led several nations to restrict access to the service. On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Gou Jiakun said in a press conference: 'We take the safety and security of AI seriously, and support entrepreneurial innovation by Chinese companies, thus contributing China's part to global AI development.' 'We have helped developing countries enhance capacity building, advocating that AI technologies should be open-sourced and there should be greater accessibility to AI services so that the benefits of AI can be shared by all countries. That said, we are against drawing lines along ideological difference, overstretching the concept of national security, or politicizing trade and tech issues,' Gou said. Tech researchers concerned Vance's remarks about excessive AI safety concerns were in sync with actions taken so far by the Trump administration. On the day he took office, President Trump rescinded an executive order signed by his predecessor entitled, 'Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.' Following Vance's remarks Tuesday, U.S.-based artificial intelligence researchers warned that a world in which the U.S. declines to require companies to adopt AI safety precautions could make collaboration with colleagues in countries with stronger protections difficult. 'In order to build effective AI, you have to source data globally, so you have more accurate, complete and representative data sets,' Susan Ariel Aaronson told VOA. She is a professor at George Washington University and co-leader of the National Science Foundation's Trustworthy AI Institute for Law and Society. 'Many AI researchers believe we're running out of data,' Aaronson said. 'The future for these firms, the future [for these] markets are overseas, and so we need rules to govern how we interact with policymakers and users in those markets.' Mona Sloane, a professor at the University of Virginia who leads an AI research lab, told VOA that maintaining access to those data sets is a prevailing concern. 'If you talk to people in the research community in the United States, those folks are acutely worried about access to data sets, about collaborating [internationally] on AI questions, or using AI in their research,' she said. 'There will be very severe implications for research in the United States on AI — but also with AI — by getting cut off from these international conversations,' Sloane said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-stakes-forceful-claim-to-us-leadership-in-ai/7971777.html	2025-02-11T17:18:29-08:00	
Trump pauses enforcement, orders review of foreign corruption act	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has ordered a pause and review of a law that has defined the activities of U.S. business overseas for nearly five decades, claiming that the strict prohibitions against bribing foreign officials strangle American competitiveness in a tough global market. 'It's going to mean a lot more business for America,' Trump said as he signed the order on Monday for the Department of Justice to pause ongoing investigations and review the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for the next six months. The order argues that 'overexpansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement against American citizens and businesses — by our own Government — for routine business practices in other nations not only wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security.' But the latest annual review of the law's enforcement by Stanford Law School says the number of enforcement actions in 2024 were 'well below the ten-year average of 36,' with 26 cases that year filed by the two entities responsible for enforcement — the DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 'This decline suggests that each bribery scheme yielded more unique actions against a corporation and its subsidiaries, employees, and agents, but that fewer separate schemes were targeted for enforcement in 2024,' the report concluded. The president's order garnered criticism from anti-corruption advocates. 'The world must not default to where bribery and corruption are the norm,' Gary Kalman, executive director of Transparency International U.S., said in a statement to VOA. 'A race to the bottom harms both the citizens in the country and the businesses involved in corrupt transactions. Those who do choose to flout the law often face multiple bribery demands that delay or prevent these businesses from obtaining the licenses and permits they need to enter overseas markets. In the end, bribery is a lose-lose proposition.' Bribery is still illegal Private legal experts rushed Tuesday to clarify the order's scope and significance. 'Bribery is still Illegal,' according to the headline of the analysis issued Tuesday morning by Washington-based multinational law firm Arnold & Porter. The eight lawyer-authors go on to say in their analysis that not only does bribery remain illegal under the law, which has not been repealed by Congress, but also under various state, federal and foreign laws. They also note that other countries have boosted their enforcement of anti-corruption laws. 'For now, we recommend that companies wait and see what will happen, and meanwhile continue to focus on compliance,' the lawyers concluded. Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, a constitutional lawyer, said Tuesday that the new order 'puts America on the side of 'routine' corrupt business practices all over the world.' The order, he said, gives corporations 'free rein to pay bribes, kickbacks, and financial tribute to corrupt foreign officials.' His statement also took aim at Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman whose closeness to Trump has put him at the head of efforts to radically reshape the U.S. government and target waste, fraud and corruption through his Department of Government Efficiency. 'The Trump-Musk Administration is making bribery and corruption perfectly legal again,' Raskin wrote in a statement. 'The prices of eggs and other groceries, housing and rent and electricity continue to soar, but it just became a lot cheaper to engage in political corruption.' Musk and his companies have tangled publicly with the SEC and the Department of Commerce, but neither his name nor those of any of the businesses he is associated with appears on either's complete list of FCPA enforcement actions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pauses-enforcement-orders-review-of-foreign-corruption-act-/7971485.html	2025-02-11T17:02:30-08:00

Key Islamic State planner killed in airstrike, US says	WASHINGTON — The main target in a series of U.S. airstrikes against the Islamic State terror group in Somalia earlier this month is dead, according to the most recent assessment by military officials. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) announced late Tuesday that Islamic State attack planner Ahmed Maeleninine was killed along with 13 other high-ranking operatives in the Feb. 1 operation, run in coordination with the Somali government. In a statement, AFRICOM described Maeleninine as a 'recruiter, financier, and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe.' Officials did not provide additional information on Maeleninine's exploits. Assessing the success of the U.S. strikes was delayed due to the location of the targets and the terrain — a series of cave complexes in the Cal Miskaad area of Somalia's Golis Mountains. At the time, a Somalia commander told VOA the U.S. strikes had targeted at least 10 locations. Residents in Qandala, a small town in the Bari region of Puntland not far from the site, told VOA that they could see plumes of smoke and flames, and that they heard at least seven explosions. Islamic State, also known as IS or Daesh, has increasingly played a key role in the terror group's operations in Africa and beyond. Since 2022, Somalia has been home to al-Karrar, one of nine regional Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group's capabilities. As a result, IS-Somalia has become a key cog in the IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Africa. IS-Somalia has simultaneously become more influential under the leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to now head IS's directorate of provinces, overseeing the terror group's affiliates in Africa. Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting as Islamic State's top emir. Others disagree, but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure. The U.S. previously targeted Mumin in May 2024. Recent intelligence assessments have further warned IS-Somalia has more than doubled in size over the past year and may now have as many as 1,600 fighters, bolstered by an influx of fighters from Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier on Tuesday warned that Washington would not hesitate to take action against IS in Somalia and beyond. 'Where we see those growing, plotting or planning with increased capabilities, we will strike,' he said during a visit to AFRICOM headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. He also said the U.S. is open to keeping in place about 500 special operation forces currently stationed in Somalia. 'I want to listen to the commanders on the ground, first and foremost,' Hegseth said. 'The president, he's charged me with, give me your best advice but also keep your ear to the ground of what's most effective.' U.S. President Donald Trump, toward the end of his first term in office in January 2021, withdrew U.S. forces from Somalia. Former President Joe Biden reversed the decision in May 2022, sending about 500 U.S. special operation forces to help Somali forces counter IS and al-Shabab.

Trump signs executive order to continue downsizing federal workforce	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump made a rare appearance with Elon Musk, his most powerful adviser, in the Oval Office on Tuesday before signing an executive order to continue downsizing the federal workforce. The Associated Press reviewed a White House fact sheet on the order, which is intended to advance Musk's work slashing spending with his Department of Government Efficiency. Musk said there are some good people in the federal bureaucracy, but they need to be accountable and called it an 'unelected' fourth branch. 'The people voted for major government reform, and that's what the people are going to get,' he said. 'That's what democracy is all about.' It was Musk's first time taking questions from reporters since he joined the Trump administration as a special government employee with sprawling influence over federal agencies. He's also the world's richest person and the owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Despite concerns that he's amassing unaccountable power with little transparency, Musk described himself as an open book. He joked that the scrutiny was like a 'daily proctology exam.' The White House fact sheet said that 'agencies will undertake plans for large-scale reductions in force and determine which agency components (or agencies themselves) may be eliminated or combined because their functions aren't required by law.' It also said that agencies should 'hire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart from federal service.' There are plans for exceptions when it comes to immigration, law enforcement and public safety. Trump and Musk are pushing federal workers to resign in return for financial incentives, although their plan is currently on hold while a judge reviews its legality. The deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, would allow employees to quit and still get paid until Sept. 30. Administration officials said more than 65,000 workers have taken the offer. Hundreds of people gathered for a rally Tuesday across the street from the U.S. Capitol in support of federal workers. Janet Connelly, a graphic designer with the Department of Energy, said she's fed up with emails from the Office of Personnel Management encouraging people to take the deferred resignation program. She tried to use her spam settings to filter out the emails but to no avail. Connelly said she has no plans to take the offer. 'From the get-go, I didn't trust it,' she said. Connelly said she thinks of her work as trying to do an important service for the American public. 'It's too easy to vilify us,' she said. Others have said fear and uncertainty have swept through the federal workforce. 'They're worried about their jobs. They're worried about their families. They're also worried about their work and the communities they serve,' said Helen Bottcher, a former Environmental Protection Agency employee and current union leader in Seattle. Bottcher participated in a press conference hosted by Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington. Murray said workers 'deserve better than to be threatened, intimidated and pushed out the door by Elon Musk and Donald Trump.' She also said that 'we actually need these people to stay in their jobs or things are going to start breaking.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-executive-order-to-continue-downsizing-federal-workforce-/7971513.html	2025-02-11T15:54:36-08:00

Optimism grows as Niger holds convention on transition plans	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Niger is set to hold a national convention to map out its long-awaited political transition following the July 2023 coup that deposed President Mohamed Bazoum. Junta leader, General Abdourahamane Tchiani, says the dialogue will be inclusive, set governance priorities and determine the transition timeline. Niger's military announced on state television last Saturday that the national convention will take place from February 15-19. Authorities said the meeting is expected to produce a preliminary draft of the transition charter. Junta leader General Abdourahamane Tchiani had initially committed to a three-year transition after seizing power from President Mohamed Bazoum in July 2023. But months of silence on the issue fueled uncertainty among Nigeriens and international observers. Ibrahim Faruk, program coordinator for the African division at Yiaga Africa, said the convention is a step in the right direction. 'This signals the beginning of the timeline for a transition to a democratically elected government in the Republic of Niger,' said Faruk. 'I think why this is important is that democratic stability in the West African subregion has a way of creating a ripple effect. We saw how once there were coups and attempted coups in some of these countries, it caused a ripple effect. But beyond just a return to [a] democratic government, it must also provide the promise of development that comes with democracy as well.' Ahead of the convention, authorities held consultations across Niger's eight regions and formed a national commission to oversee the dialogue. At the end of the meeting, the commission is expected to submit a final report to Tchiani within three weeks. The July 2023 coup triggered widespread condemnation, including threats of military intervention from the regional Economic Community of West African States, known as ECOWAS. Niger's political crisis reflects a broader trend in the Sahel, where military takeovers have become more frequent amid escalating jihadist threats and growing resentment toward civilian governments. Faruk believes Niger could set a positive example. 'Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, who have witnessed unconstitutional change of government — I think one common thread that has been running through these three countries is that there hasn't been adherence to previously agreed transition timelines.' said Faruk. '[So,] I hope that with this step in the Republic of Niger, it will signal to their brothers in Mali and Burkina Faso that indeed there's an importance to return back to democratically elected government.' Mali and Burkina Faso, both under military rule, have extended their transition timelines, despite initially pledging a quicker return to democracy. Mali's military attributes the delay to a second coup in 2021, just months after overthrowing President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. Burkina Faso's junta postponed elections, citing security concerns. Political analyst Ahmed Buhari said a transition plan is a good step, but 'it's very important for us Africans to know that we cannot copy and paste an entire system and expect it to work with different cultural views, values and norms,' he said. 'And that is why I think that we're struggling as a continent to find stability, economic growth, security, and most importantly, identity for our people. Different democracies will work for different people around the world. We must create a democratic environment that is suitable for our current realities and challenges.' Critics warn that prolonged military rule remains a strong possibility in the Sahel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/optimism-grows-as-niger-holds-convention-on-transition-plans/7971421.html	2025-02-11T14:17:14-08:00

Russia frees American serving 14-year marijuana sentence	Marc Fogel, an American teacher detained in Russia since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country, was freed by Moscow on Tuesday and headed back to the United States, the White House announced. The 63-year-old history teacher, who had been serving a 14-year sentence, was expected to be reunited with his family in the eastern state of Pennsylvania by the end of the day. He left Russian airspace aboard the personal aircraft of Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s foreign affairs envoy who helped negotiate his release. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said the U.S. and Russia 'negotiated an exchange' to free Fogel but gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In such deals in recent years, the U.S. has often released Russian prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange. Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader geopolitical terms, saying it was 'a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,' an invasion Russia launched against its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or wounded on both sides. Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before taking office Jan. 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by the end of April. 'Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States,' Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances. Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying him as wrongfully detained. Witkoff is a billionaire New York real estate executive and close friend of Trump’s. He previously had helped negotiate the six-week Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza initiated by Biden in the last months of his presidency. Witkoff also had been secretly negotiating the deal for Fogel’s release. Online flight trackers spotted his presence in Moscow when he flew there on his private jet. With the U.S. leading the way in the West’s opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was the first known trip to Moscow by a senior U.S. official since William Burns, then the Central Intelligence Agency director, flew to the Russian capital in November 2021, in an unsuccessful attempt to keep Russia from invading Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-frees-american-serving-14-year-marijuana-sentence/7971415.html	2025-02-11T13:58:54-08:00	
US withdrawal from UN human rights body draws mixed reactions	Washington — Human rights experts in Washington are divided over whether the U.S. withdrawal from a United Nations body on human rights will hurt North Korea’s already poor human rights situation. Last Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order pulling the U.S. out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, or UNHRC, reintroducing the stance he held during his previous term. The executive order said that the UNHRC has 'protected human rights abusers by allowing them to use the organization to shield themselves from scrutiny,' adding that the council deserves 'renewed scrutiny.' The decision was announced ahead of Trump’s recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited Washington for the first time since Trump’s second inauguration. Since his first term, President Trump has been disapproving of the activities of the U.N. human rights body. In June 2018, the Trump administration criticized the UNHRC for its 'bias against Israel,' stressing the council that year passed resolutions against Israel more than those passed against North Korea, Iran and Syria combined. Negative impact Robert King, who served as the U.S. special envoy for North Korea’s human rights under the Obama administration, said that the U.S. decision to withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council could negatively undermine international efforts to improve human rights conditions in the North. 'It will have a negative impact. The U.N. Human Rights Council has been a very effective body in terms of calling attention to North Korea’s serious human rights abuses,' King told VOA Korean on the phone last week. 'And the fact that the United States will not be an active participant is again a very unfortunate situation.' Roberta Cohen, former deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights, said leaving the UNHRC is 'a short-sighted decision.' Cohen, who also served as senior adviser to the U.S. Delegation to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, said it is important that the U.S. be seated at the council with a vote and be active in mobilizing support for any new initiatives. 'If the reforms are needed and they are, the U.S. should be involved heavily,' Cohen told VOA Korean by phone last week. 'Walking away cedes the floor to your opponents.' Cohen highlighted that the council was where the Commission of Inquiry on the Human Rights in North Korea, or COI, was conceived. The COI is widely considered to be the first systematic and thorough documentation of Pyongyang’s violations of human rights. She added that an update of the COI is to be presented in September for the first time in more than a decade, saying that Washington needs to be part of the process when the report is introduced. However, others question the role of the Human Rights Council in making a real impact on improving North Korea's human rights conditions. 'The Human Rights Council has become a very tragic farce. It was supposed to promote and protect human rights around the world but instead it coddles dictatorships and gives them legitimacy by including them as members of the council,' said Suzanne Scholte, president of the Defense Forum Foundation and a longtime North Korea human rights activist. 'We're not addressing the horrific things that are happening to the North Korean refugees in China that are being shot and executed when they’re returned.' ‘Illegitimate’ members Human rights experts have long criticized Beijing for failing to afford protection to North Korean refugees and forcefully repatriating them to North Korea. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy in Washington, said North Korean human rights issues need to be separated from how Trump wants to deal with the United Nations. 'This is about the Trump administration’s views toward U.N. organizations and how they are being misused by countries such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea,' Maxwell told VOA Korean on Monday via email. 'When these organizations are coerced by members of the so-called axis of upheaval, they are not able to support the people who are suffering true human rights abuses.' Meanwhile, Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow and the SK-Korea Foundation chair at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies in Washington, said the U.S. has other tools to address the North Korean human rights issue. 'Pulling out of the UNHRC won’t make much of a difference practically speaking,' Yeo told VOA Korean via email last week. 'The U.S. has other means and platforms to raise North Korean human rights objections, including its own State Department human rights reports.' The U.S. rejoined the UNHRC shortly after the inauguration of Joe Biden as president in 2021, but the Biden administration decided not to seek a second term as a board member of the council when the three-year membership was to expire at the end of 2024. The move was made amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, which launched a surprise attack on the former a year prior. The State Department explained at the time that the U.S. decided not to pursue a second term at the council 'because we are engaged with our allies about the best way to move forward.' Every March or April, the State Department releases the annual Human Rights Reports, which cover the human rights situations around the world. The document last year said there were credible reports of unlawful killing, enforced disappearances and torture taking place in North Korea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-withdrawal-from-un-human-rights-body-draws-mixed-reactions/7971418.html	2025-02-11T13:57:43-08:00

Trump doubles down on Gaza takeover plan to Jordan's King Abdullah	WASHINGTON — King Abdullah II was at the White House on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his demand that Jordan permanently take in Palestinians and support the United States to take over Gaza — a plan that Trump said will 'be wonderful' for the Middle East. 'You're going to see some great progress,' Trump told the Jordanian king in front of reporters in the Oval Office ahead of their meeting. 'The whole thing will come. It's not a complex thing to do.' He added, 'You're going to have stability in the Middle East for the first time. And the Palestinians, or the people that live now in Gaza, will be living beautifully in another location. They're going to be living safely.' Pressed by a reporter, Trump said that the Palestinians will live 'where we ultimately choose as a group,' which could be 'a parcel of land in Jordan ... a parcel of land in Egypt,' and elsewhere. Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi have rejected Trump’s plans to forcibly relocate an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians from Gaza into neighboring Jordan and Egypt so the U.S. can take over and 'own' the territory. The king declined Trump’s invitation to share his counteroffer with reporters. 'I think we have to keep in mind that there is a plan from Egypt and the Arab countries. We've been invited by [Saudi Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman to discussions in Riyadh,' Abdullah said, stressing the need to find a mutually beneficial solution. 'We're going to have some interesting discussions today,' he said, adding that Jordan is immediately prepared to take in 2,000 children who are sick with cancer and other illnesses. Trump maintained that the United States will not be purchasing Gaza but did not elaborate on his takeover plan. 'We're going to have it, and we're going to keep it, and we're going to make sure that there's going to be peace, and there's not going to be any problem, and nobody's going to question it,' he said. It’s a high-stakes meeting for Abdullah that comes as Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warn that if Hamas does not return Israeli hostages by noon Saturday, the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that was agreed upon Jan. 19 will end. 'I don't think they're going to make a deadline, personally. I think they want to play tough guy. But we'll see how tough they are,' Trump said Tuesday, adding that he rejects the incremental nature of the swap. 'They either have them out by Saturday at 12 o'clock or all bets are off,' he said. The agreement between Israelis and Hamas on the number of hostages being released for Palestinians held in Israeli jails was negotiated for months by the Biden administration together with Qatar and Egypt. Hamas on Monday threatened to delay the next planned release of Israeli hostages because of what it said are Israeli violations of the truce. On Tuesday, Netanyahu said he has ordered the Israeli military to surround Gaza. 'The decision that I passed unanimously in the Cabinet is this: If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will be terminated, and the IDF will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated,' he said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. Aid threats Ahead of the king’s visit to Washington, Trump warned that U.S. assistance to Jordan and Egypt could be in jeopardy if they don’t meet his demands on Gaza. On Tuesday he seemed to backtrack, saying, 'I don't have to threaten that. ... I think we're above that.' Jordan and Egypt are major recipients of U.S. military and economic aid. The U.S. provided Amman with almost $1.7 billion in foreign aid in fiscal 2023, the most recent period with complete data, according to U.S. government information. It gave Cairo about $1.5 billion during the same period. Trump first floated the idea of developing Gaza into what he calls 'the Riviera of the Middle East' during Netanyahu’s visit to the White House last week. The proposal sent shock waves throughout the Middle East and placed Abdullah in a difficult spot between keeping military and diplomatic ties with a key ally and popular support for Palestinians at home. The Jordanian king has been under immense pressure to maintain good relations with the U.S. over the years while absorbing the shocks from Washington’s policy that has drifted toward Israel’s ultra-right parties, particularly since the first Trump administration, said Zaha Hassan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'There is no set of circumstances in which the king will accept Palestinian displacement into Jordan,' Hassan told VOA. 'The issue is existential for the king and his continued reign,' she said. Threat to Jordan’s stability Nearly 3 million Palestinians are in Jordan — refugees and naturalized Jordanian citizens of Palestinian descent who came as refugees during Al-Nakba, the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. An influx of Palestinians from Gaza would dramatically increase strains on an already struggling economy and could upend the fragile demographic balance in Jordanian society, which includes hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees. Palestinians, and those who support their cause in Jordan, will not accept more displacement, said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'This will create domestic unrest,' he told VOA, adding that an influx would include Hamas members and supporters, creating a terror threat for the kingdom that would turn Jordan into a staging ground for attacks on Israel. 'All of these things will create very, very severe threats to Jordan's stability and maybe even survival,' he said. Jordanian officials have rejected the forced relocation of Palestinians as morally wrong. Palestinians are adamant they will not leave the land they consider rightfully theirs. Trump’s plan could also disrupt the fragile peace between Israel and Jordan under a 1994 peace treaty. 'That agreement would be in jeopardy, as it was based on certain guarantees from the U.S. and premised on a political solution for Palestinians, who had signed an interim agreement with Israel a year earlier,' Hassan said. Israeli far-right politicians, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, support Trump’s plan, as do most Israelis, according to a survey by the country’s Channel 12 media. United Nations Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese said Trump’s proposal is 'unlawful, immoral and irresponsible,' and worse than ethnic cleansing. 'It’s inciting to commit forced displacement, which is an international crime,' she said last week at a news conference in Copenhagen. Pressed by a reporter, Trump maintained he will stick to his plan to develop Gaza no matter what alternatives Arab countries may offer. 'I think it's going to be something that's going to be magnificent for the Palestinians. They're going to be in love with it,' Trump said. 'I did very well with real estate. I can tell you about real estate. They're going to be in love with it.'

How pause in US foreign aid is impacting South, Central Asia	WASHINGTON — In Kabul, Afghanistan, a major midwifery program — girls' only higher education option — has closed. Across Pakistan, dozens of development programs have ground to a halt. In Bangladesh, a health research center has laid off more than 1,000 employees. The fallout comes two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration suspended foreign aid amid a widespread review, leaving thousands of development programs in limbo. 'I'm in shock,' said a student at the USAID-funded midwifery school in Kabul, speaking anonymously. 'This was the last remaining option for girls to receive an education and get a job.' 'People keep calling and asking, 'When is the program going to restart?'' said the head of a USAID-backed education nonprofit in Afghanistan, speaking on condition of anonymity. The freeze follows a Jan. 20 executive order issued by Trump that suspended all foreign aid pending a 30-day review. The president said the review was necessary because 'the United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests, and in many cases, antithetical to American values.' The executive order said the current setup 'serves to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries' that undermine 'harmonious' international relations. Now, U.S. government agencies involved in delivering foreign assistance must decide by April 30 to keep, change or end their foreign aid programs. The aid suspension marks a sharp break with decades of U.S. foreign policy. Historically, the U.S. has been the world's biggest foreign aid donor, with $68 billion in aid in 2023. The offices of USAID, the lead foreign aid agency, remain closed. Although the State Department has issued a broad exemption to 'lifesaving' humanitarian programs such as emergency food distribution in Afghanistan, most programs on the ground remain closed. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has taken over as acting head of USAID, said that while he backs foreign assistance, 'every dollar' spent on foreign assistance must advance U.S. national interest. 'We are not walking away from foreign aid,' Rubio told Scott Jennings on Sirius XM Patriot 125 on Monday. 'We are walking away from foreign aid that's dumb, that's stupid, that wastes American taxpayer money.' USAID is recognized globally as a premiere development agency, but critics at home and abroad have long accused it of throwing American taxpayer money into wasteful projects. To highlight this, the White House last week issued a list of USAID programs involving 'waste and abuse,' including $1.5 million 'to advance diversity, equity and inclusion' in Serbia; $47,000 for a 'transgender opera' in Colombia; and $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt. Foreign aid defenders acknowledge the waste, but they argue these projects represent a fraction of the $68 billion U.S. aid program. South Asia Though U.S. aid to South and Central Asian nations has declined recently, the region still gets billions annually, with Afghanistan the largest regional recipient. The country, which received $1.3 billion in 2023, now faces a wave of program shutdowns. While emergency humanitarian aid continues after a brief interruption, development programs from child and maternal health to education have stopped. The impact has been wide-ranging. The United Nations Population Fund has frozen all U.S.-backed programs in Afghanistan, potentially leaving more than 9 million people cut off from health services, according to regional director, Pio Smith. The UNFPA, which Republicans have long accused of promoting coercive family planning practices, relies on U.S. assistance for almost a third of its humanitarian operations. The agency, which denies the charge, is likely to lose all that support, impacting its work across the region. Education is another casualty of the aid suspension in Afghanistan. The American University of Afghanistan, established in 2006 with a USAID grant and now operating out of Qatar, has reportedly suspended classes. A university spokesperson could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile in Bangladesh, the Asian University for Women is scrambling to keep hundreds of Afghan students after U.S. funding dried up. To cover the funding shortfall, the university has launched a $7 million appeal. 'We cannot and will not send these students back to an uncertain and oppressive future,' the university said in a statement. Bangladesh, despite its $437 billion economy, is also feeling the pinch. The country is a U.S. ally and South Asia's largest recipient of U.S. aid after Afghanistan, with more than $500 million supporting a wide range of programs from emergency food assistance to fighting tuberculosis and pandemic influenza. In Pakistan, more than three dozen USAID-funded projects have reportedly shut down in recent days. A burns and plastic surgery center in the northwestern city of Peshawar, built with a $15 million USAID grant, faces an uncertain future. 'At the moment, I don't know what's going to happen to the whole program, but I'm hopeful that the program will move forward,' Dr. Tahmeedullah, the center's director, said in an interview. Central Asia In Central Asia, where five former Soviet Republics received about $235 million in 2023, nearly every USAID-funded program and initiative has been stopped, according to local news reports. 'From what I've gathered, all types of programs and initiatives have been suspended as of now,' said Alisher Khamidov, a Kyrgyzstan-based consultant who follows USAID-projects in the region. The suspensions include critical health initiatives such as USAID's $18 million-$20 million 'TB-Free' programs in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, both launched in 2023. 'This five-year project has special significance for Uzbekistan as it was one of the few projects tackling TB in the country,' Khamidov said in an interview last week with VOA. The State Department did not respond to a VOA question about the current status of U.S.-funded aid operations in South and Central Asia. USAID has poured billions of dollars into many regional development programs since the early 1990s, including initiatives to promote democratization and civil society. Those efforts, however, represent a fraction of the total aid. Today, the agency is largely focused on agriculture and health projects, according to Khamidov. Across the region, USAID programs have long faced allegations of waste and abuse, with numerous examples uncovered by the agency's own inspector general. Nowhere has the alleged abuse been starker than in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have been accused of siphoning of millions of dollars in U.S. aid funneled through U.N. agencies. Some Taliban opponents have welcomed the aid freeze, arguing that it could force the group to accede to international demands. Others, such as former Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh, say it could level the political playing field in the country. 'The dismantling of USAID clears the path for the rise of genuine leaders in Afghanistan,' Saleh wrote on X. Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, says a multibillion-dollar program can inevitably lead to waste and abuse. He told VOA that foreign aid can showcase U.S. goodwill but also cause diplomatic friction over policy and cultural issues. Clark said that though the aid pause should have been less abrupt, a thorough review of the program is necessary. 'It makes sense to stop as a new administration comes in and reassess where the money is going, where it's being allocated,' he said. VOA's Afghan, Deewa and Urdu Services and correspondent Vero Balderas contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-pause-in-us-foreign-aid-is-impacting-south-central-asia/7971248.html	2025-02-11T13:15:35-08:00	
EU, Canada vow to stand firm against Trump's tariffs on metals	The 27-nation European Union and Canada quickly vowed Tuesday to stand firm against U.S. President Donald Trump’s move to impose 25% tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports, verbal sparring that could lead to a full-blown trade war between the traditionally allied nations. 'The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. 'Tariffs are taxes — bad for business, worse for consumers. 'Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered — they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures,' she said. Trump said the steel and aluminum tariffs would take effect on March 12. In response, EU officials said they could target such U.S. products as bourbon, jeans, peanut butter and motorcycles, much of it produced in Republican states that supported Trump in his election victory. The EU scheduled a first emergency video on Wednesday to shape the bloc's response. Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU presidency, said it was 'important that everyone sticks together. Difficult times require such full solidarity.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a conference on artificial intelligence in Paris that Trump’s steel and aluminum levy would be 'entirely unjustified,' and that 'Canadians will resist strongly and firmly if necessary.' Von der Leyen is meeting Tuesday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Paris, where they are expected to discuss Trump's tariff orders. 'We will protect our workers, businesses and consumers,' she said in advance of the meeting. Trump imposed the steel and aluminum tariff to boost the fortunes of U.S. producers. 'It’s a big deal,' he said. 'This is the beginning of making America rich again.' Billionaire financier Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, said the tariff on the imports could bring back 120,000 U.S. jobs. As he watched Trump sign an executive order, Lutnick said, 'You are the president who is standing up for the American steelworker, and I am just tremendously impressed and delighted to stand next to you.' Trump’s proclamations raised the rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. And he restored a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports. South Korea — the fourth-biggest steel exporter to the United States, following Canada, Brazil and Mexico — also vowed to protect its companies' interests but did not say how. South Korean acting President Choi Sang-mok said Seoul would seek to reduce uncertainties 'by building a close relationship with the Trump administration and expanding diplomatic options.' The spokesperson of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said London was 'engaging with our U.S. counterparts to work through the detail' of the planned tariffs. In Monday's executive order, Trump said 'all imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, EU countries and the UK' would be subject to additional tariffs. The same countries are named in his executive order on steel, along with Brazil, Japan and South Korea. 'I'm simplifying our tariffs on steel and aluminum,' Trump said. 'It's 25% without exceptions or exemptions.' Bernd Lange, the chair of the European Parliament's international trade committee, warned that previous trade measures against the U.S. were only suspended and could legally be easily revived. 'When he starts again now, then we will, of course, immediately reinstate our countermeasures,' Lange told rbb24 German radio. 'Motorcycles, jeans, peanut butter, bourbon, whiskey and a whole range of products that of course also affect American exporters' would be targeted, he said. In Germany, the EU's largest economy, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told parliament that 'if the U.S. leaves us no other choice, then the European Union will react united.' But he warned, 'Ultimately, trade wars always cost both sides prosperity.' The European steel industry expressed concerns about the Trump tariffs. 'It will further worsen the situation of the European steel industry, exacerbating an already dire market environment,' said Henrik Adam, president of the European Steel Association. He said the EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports. The United States is the second-largest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports. 'Losing a significant part of these exports cannot be compensated for by EU exports to other markets,' Adam said.

US military not 'abandoning' allies, defense chief says	WASHINGTON — World leaders are making a mistake if they conclude that an effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to review America’s global military posture means Washington is pulling back, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Hegseth Tuesday spoke to reporters in Stuttgart, Germany, home to the headquarters for U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command, the first stop on his first international trip since being sworn-in last month. 'We would be remiss in not reviewing force posture everywhere, but it would be the wrong planning assumption to say America's abandoning something or America's leaving,' Hegseth said. 'No, America's smart to observe, plan, prioritize and project power where we need to deter conflict,' he added. The comments come ahead of key meetings Wednesday and Thursday in Brussels of NATO defense ministers and of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a group of almost 50 countries who have pledged to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia. U.S. defense officials have said Hegseth is expected to press NATO allies to take more of a leadership role in confronting challenges in Europe and also to increase defense spending — something the U.S. defense chief emphasized in Germany. 'The European continent deserves to be free from any aggression. But it ought to be those in the neighborhood investing the most in that individual and collective defense,' Hegseth said. 'That's common sense. 'You defend your neighborhood, and the Americans will come alongside you in helping in that defense,' he said. But whether that means the U.S. will maintain a robust military presence across Europe is unclear. Hegseth said Trump’s push for a 'rapid peace deal in Ukraine' could allow the U.S. to shift resources to counter the rising threat from China in the Indo-Pacific. China threat 'There's just no doubt the communist Chinese ambitious ambitions are robust,' Hegseth told reporters. 'Their view of the world is quite different than ours, and whoever carries that mantle is going to set the tone for the 21st century.' He also called out Beijing for what he called pernicious intentions in Latin America and across Africa. 'America's posture there, along with allies and partners, is going to matter about contesting that space,' he said. Terrorism in Africa Hegseth also left open the possibility that the U.S. could maintain a military presence in Africa, including Somalia, despite Trump’s decision to pull U.S. forces from the country during his first term. 'Africa is very much the front lines of a fight from Islamists,' Hegseth said. 'We're not going to allow them to maintain a foothold, especially to try to strike at America.' The U.S. currently has about 500 special operations forces in Somalia, helping government forces push back against the Islamic State terror group’s Somali affiliate and against al-Qaida linked al-Shabab. 'I want to listen to the commanders on the ground, first and foremost,' Hegseth said, adding that while the U.S. will keep forces where they are needed, there’s a preference to 'do counterterrorism effectively over the horizon.' Earlier this month, U.S. airstrikes targeted a senior Islamic State planner in the Somalia’s Golis mountains. Defense spending Hegseth on Tuesday also pledged to find ways to make U.S. defense spending more efficient, saying he will welcome the help of Elon Musk, the multibillionaire running Trump’s non-governmental Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 'I hope to welcome Elon to the Pentagon very soon,' he said. 'There is waste, redundancies and headcounts in headquarters that need to be addressed.' As an example, Hegseth pointed to Pentagon programs focused on addressing climate change. 'The Defense Department is not in the business of climate change, solving the global thermostat,' he said. 'We're in the business of deterring and winning wars.' He added, however, that efforts to cut waste would not be 'to the detriment of American operational or tactical capabilities.' Even while cutting waste, Hegseth said, the U.S. needs to spend more on defense — calling for spending at least 3% of gross domestic product (GDP). The Trump administration has been calling for NATO allies, many of which have lagged behind the U.S. on military funding, to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-not-abandoning-allies-defense-chief-says-/7971327.html	2025-02-11T12:36:06-08:00

Europe announces plans to ease AI regulations in bid to become heavyweight	Europe says it will ease regulations on artificial intelligence at a key AI summit in Paris on Feb. 11, 2025, that brought together the U.S. and other global tech giants and politicians. But some experts see bigger challenges stalling the bloc’s ambitions to be an AI heavyweight, from the need to pool resources to attracting more investment and talent. After U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive Stargate investment project and China’s DeepSeek startup, Europe wants to get a share of the artificial intelligence pie. Among other announcements at the Paris summit, co-host French President Emmanuel Macron outlined plans for $113 billion in private AI investment. The two-day summit underscored tensions between fears of too much AI regulation and not enough. 'At this moment, we face the extraordinary prospect of a new Industrial Revolution, one on par with the steam engine or Bessemer steel,' U.S. Vice President JD Vance told summit attendees Tuesday. 'But it will never come to pass if overregulation deters innovators from taking the risks necessary to advance the ball.' Macron, who’s been nicknamed France’s startup president, outlined caveats. He said advancing international governance of AI will enable the consolidation of trust, acceleration and innovation in order to set the rules for AI, which are necessary to move forward. Currently, Europe's AI industry lags behind those of the U.S. and China. But the right policies, some experts believe, can help close the gap. 'Europe really has pretty much everything else it needs to lead in AI or other complex technologies,' said Pierre Alexandre Balland, chief data scientist at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. 'The talent is absolutely incredible. … [T]he scale of the European economy is also huge … the education system. Essentially, we see a wind of change in the EU really led by France, and Emmanuel Macron is very much behind that.' Beyond easing EU regulations, Balland sees bigger challenges — such as pooling European research and other resources, calling for investing pension funds to finance AI’s growth, and concentrating on a single AI hub in Europe. 'Paris is absolutely by far the leading AI ecosystem in Europe,' he said. Alicia Garcia-Herrero, senior fellow at Brussels-based Bruegel policy institute, agreed France is leading the way. She believes Europe should narrow its goals — focusing on areas like AI applications for robotics. 'Can the AI make the EU more competitive? No doubt,' Garcia-Herrero said. 'But I think there’s many other issues that need to be solved beyond AI. The most important one is having a single market.' Paris summit organizers have also pushed for commitments on making AI more ethical, accessible and environmentally sustainable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-announces-plans-to-ease-ai-regulations-in-bid-to-become-a-heavyweight-/7971187.html	2025-02-11T11:16:57-08:00	
Gabon courts stand still as magistrates protest working conditions	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Gabon’s courts are effectively closed because the magistrates who run them refuse to work due to what they call poor working conditions and pay. They have rejected pleas by leaders to return to work while waiting for conditions to improve. Civilians say hundreds of people seeking justice have been turned away from the courts for close to a month now. Courts in Gabon traditionally handle cases that include land disputes, marriage disputes, divorce, labor disputes, inheritance and criminal offenses. The courts also authenticate documents and establish certificates of nonconviction for civilians who want to get national identity cards or run for public office. Shopkeeper Narcisse Eboko said he visited the court at the administrative center in Gabon's capital, Libreville, five times within the past 10 days to apply for a certificate of nonconviction, but no one has attended to him. Eboko is surprised that the government is allowing courts, which ensure the protection of human rights and freedoms, to be paralyzed for so long, he told VOA via a messaging app from Libreville on Tuesday. Magistrates in Gabon launched their protests on Jan. 13, saying that they want an immediate application of the general status of their profession, which gives financial and material advantages to guarantee their independence. It is very difficult for magistrates to make fair decisions based on the law without adequate remuneration as stated in Gabon's laws, the magistrates say. Gabon's National Trade Union of Magistrates, or SYNAMAG, said it is surprised there has been no concrete response from the central African state’s government on if there are plans to improve the magistrates’ working conditions. SYNAMAG President Landry Abaga Essono said the union launched protests because Gabon's government refused to improve working conditions of magistrates and declined calls for dialogue. He said the protests will continue until the government improves working conditions. SYNAMAG also blamed the government for failing to improve the functioning of understaffed courts with dilapidated infrastructure, especially in Libreville, Mouila, Port-Gentil, Makokou and Franceville. Justice Minister Paul Marie Gondjout defended the government, saying it is not reluctant to solve the problems and is concerned about the plight of the magistrates and other court workers. He cited a new court building in Ntoum as proof. The country’s financial difficulties make it impossible to raise the $40 million needed to immediately solve the problems presented by the magistrates, Gondjout said on state TV Monday. The government is, however, looking for a way to satisfy some urgent needs of magistrates, he said. Essono did not agree, saying Gabon does not lack the financial means to improve working conditions in a sector as important and sensitive as justice, especially when the courts will be highly important during presidential elections in two months. The vote is expected to end a military transition that began with a coup on Aug. 30, 2023. Essono also pointed out that the government had the resources to increase job benefits for government troops only a few months ago. The magistrates say they have petitioned Gabon's transitional president, General Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, to immediately order his government to improve their living conditions. VOA could not verify whether Nguema had received the request. SYNAMAG said it is calling on citizens to be patient, saying that the protest is necessary to improve the delivery of justice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-courts-stand-still-as-magistrates-protest-working-conditions/7970989.html	2025-02-11T10:33:00-08:00	
Amid USAID debate, Britain offers model for merging aid, diplomacy	London — As Washington debates the future of the U.S. Agency for International Development or USAID amid reports that it may be put under the control of the State Department, analysts say Britain could offer lessons for America on merging diplomacy and aid. The Trump administration last month paused funding for USAID, citing a need to align the agency with the president’s America First policy. British model In 2020, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson merged the Department for International Development (DFID), which oversaw the UK’s foreign aid programs, with the Foreign Office. 'This will unite our aid with our diplomacy and bring them together in our international effort,' Johnson told lawmakers in June 2020. 'The foreign secretary will be empowered to decide which country receives or ceases to receive British aid while delivering a single UK strategy for each country, overseen by the National Security Council, which I chair,' Johnson added. Johnson’s decision could be traced to his previous role as Britain’s foreign secretary, according to Tim Durrant, program director at the Institute for Government in London. 'I think he'd got frustrated that it felt like DFID, and the UK's aid program and agenda, were separate and not always aligned with what he thought the UK's foreign policy priorities should be,' he told VOA. 'I think there was definitely a sense among those on the right of UK politics that DFID was a bit too big for its boots perhaps or needed better oversight.' Aid shock The move caused shock among many in the aid sector, recalled Mark Miller, a senior advisor at the British-based development research group ODI Global. 'I think the immediate reaction was almost one of confusion. Where does the aid sector go next? What is aid for in this new world where it's being controlled in the Foreign Office? Because you now had a set of senior managers in place who were largely focused on supporting the UK's national interest - however you might interpret that - rather than previously, [which was] a very clear mandate where aid was meant to be prioritised towards poverty reduction,' Miller said, adding that the confusion is 'still playing out.' In 2020, a few months after the merger of DFID with the Foreign Office, Britain’s aid budget was cut from 0.7% of gross national income, the highest in the G7 group of developed nations, to 0.5%. Geopolitical priorities Spending was redirected as the government sought to align aid with its political aims. Almost a third of Britain’s aid budget, amounting to some $5.2 billion, was spent on supporting refugees inside the country in 2023. Aid spending also reflected Britain’s geopolitical priorities, said ODI Global’s Miller. 'There was more attention being paid to trying to out-compete, let's say China or Russia, particularly in Asia-Pacific. Trying to upscale investment in these regions, whereas historically aid had been much more focused on Africa,' he said. 'You've also seen budgets that were traditionally focused on social sectors like health, for example, relatively deprioritized towards some of the sectors associated with the UK’s trade and investment relationships. Particularly energy and climate finance has been a big focus,' Miller added. UK lessons The creation of Britain’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, or FCDO, offers lessons for Washington as it mulls the future of USAID. 'In the UK instance, there was a sort of reputational hit. DFID had a very strong brand, as does USAID,' said analyst Durrant. 'There's also the kind of knock-on impact it has on morale and productivity. I think this is particularly going to be the case in the U.S.' 'But there is now a sense that the FCDO is the one voice and that there are people who have both development and diplomacy experience who are representing the UK in countries where the UK is spending development money.' There are practical as well as political lessons from Britain’s merging of diplomacy and aid, said Miller of ODI Global. 'The loss of expertise and how this rather disruptive merger is going - I think there's lessons about how that could be managed more carefully. I think the second thing we saw in the UK was that closing down a department didn't necessarily forge a new consensus on what aid is for,' Miller said. With economic pressures impacting government budgets, political debates over the role of foreign aid continue in London and Washington, noted Durrant. 'What you need is strong institutions, you need UK parliamentary and U.S. congressional oversight. You need people to be able to look through what's being spent and how what impact it's having,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-usaid-debate-britain-offers-model-for-merging-aid-diplomacy/7970771.html	2025-02-11T10:18:53-08:00

US, UK and Australia target Russian cybercrime network with sanctions	WASHINGTON — The U.S., U.K. and Australia on Tuesday sanctioned a Russian web-hosting services provider and two Russian men who administer the service in support of Russian ransomware syndicate LockBit. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and its U.K. and Australian counterparts sanctioned Zservers, a Russia-based bulletproof hosting services provider — which is a web-hosting service that ignores or evades law enforcement requests — and two Russian nationals serving as Zservers operators. Treasury alleges that Zservers provided LockBit access to specialized servers designed to resist law enforcement actions. LockBit ransomware attacks have extracted more than $120 million from thousands of victims around the world. LockBit has operated since 2019, and is the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be prolific, according to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The Treasury Department's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley T. Smith, said Tuesday's action 'underscores our collective resolve to disrupt all aspects of this criminal ecosystem, wherever located, to protect our national security.' LockBit has been linked to attacks on airplane manufacturer Boeing, the November 2023 attack against the Industrial Commercial Bank of China, the U.K.'s Royal Mail, Britain's National Health Service, and international law firm Allen and Overy. Ransomware is the costliest and most disruptive form of cybercrime, crippling local governments, court systems, hospitals and schools as well as businesses. It is difficult to combat as most gangs are based in former Soviet states and out of reach of Western justice. Tammy Bruce, a State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday's sanctions 'underscore the United States' commitment, along with our international partners, to combating cybercrime and degrading the networks that enable cyber criminals to target our citizens.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uk-and-australia-target-russian-cybercrime-network-with-sanctions-/7970957.html	2025-02-11T09:49:02-08:00	
Salman Rushdie testifies about his shock and pain as stranger repeatedly stabbed him on stage	MAYVILLE, N.Y. — Salman Rushdie described in graphic detail Tuesday the frenzied moments in 2022 when a masked man rushed at him on a stage in western New York and repeatedly slashed him with a knife, leaving him with life-threatening injuries. The 77-year-old author addressed jurors on the second day of testimony at the trial of Hadi Matar, 27, who has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and assault in the attack. It was the first time since the attack that Rushdie found himself in the same room with the man accused of trying the kill him. 'I only saw him at the last minute,' Rushdie said. 'I was aware of someone wearing black clothes, or dark clothes and a black face mask. I was very struck by his eyes, which were dark and seemed very ferocious.' Rushdie said he first thought his knife-wielding attacker was striking him with a fist. 'But I saw a large quantity of blood pouring onto my clothes,' he said. 'He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.' Rushdie said he was struck more times in his chest and torso and stabbed in his chest as he struggled to get away. 'I was very badly injured. I couldn't stand up any more. I fell down,' he said. While lying on the stage, he recalled 'a sense of great pain and shock, and aware of the fact that there was an enormous quantity of blood that I was lying in.' 'It occurred to me that I was dying. That was my predominant thought,' he said . His wife, Rachel Eliza Griffiths, cried from her seat in the courtroom's second row. Rushdie was blinded in one eye in the attack and spent months recovering, a process he detailed in a memoir released last year. A speaker who was to appear with Rushdie also was wounded. Jurors heard opening statements Monday, followed by testimony from staffers at the Chautauqua Institution, the nonprofit art and education center where the attack happened about 120 kilometers south of Buffalo. Matar has been in custody since he was subdued by spectators after the attack. The trial is expected to last up to two weeks. Jurors are unlikely to hear about a fatwa issued by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini calling for Rushdie's death, according to District Attorney Jason Schmidt. Rushdie, the author of 'Midnight's Children' and 'Victory City,' spent years in hiding after Khomeini announced the fatwa in 1989 following publication of the novel 'The Satanic Verses,' which some Muslims consider blasphemous Schmidt has said discussing Matar's motive will be unnecessary in the state trial, given the attack was seen by a live audience that was expecting to hear Rushdie present a lecture on keeping writers safe. 'This is not a case of mistaken identity,' Schmidt said during opening statements Monday. 'Mr. Matar is the person who attacked Mr. Rushdie without provocation.' A public defender representing Matar told jurors that the case is not as straightforward as prosecutors have made it out to be. 'The elements of the crime are more than `something really bad happened' — they're more defined,' Lynn Schaffer said. 'Something bad did happen, something very bad did happen, but the district attorney has to prove much more than that.' In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege Matar was driven to act by a terrorist organization's 2006 endorsement of the fatwa. A later trial on federal terrorism charges will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/salman-rushdie-testifies-about-his-shock-and-pain-as-stranger-repeatedly-stabbed-him-on-stage-/7970966.html	2025-02-11T09:46:03-08:00

Trump ally Steve Bannon pleads guilty and avoids jail time in border wall fraud case	New York — Steve Bannon pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a fraud charge related to duping donors who gave money to a private effort to build a wall along the U.S. southern border — a case the conservative strategist has decried as a 'political persecution.' Bannon, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, reached a plea agreement that spares him from jail time in the 'We Build the Wall' scheme as long as he stays out of trouble. Asked how he was feeling as he left the courtroom, Bannon said, 'Like a million bucks.' The deal comes just days after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the Justice Department to investigate what the president called the ' weaponization of prosecutorial power.' The case had been scheduled to go to trial March 4. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office charged Bannon in state court after a Trump pardon in 2021 wiped away federal charges on the same allegations. In November, Judge April Newbauer ruled prosecutors could show jurors certain evidence, including an email they say shows Bannon was concerned the fundraising effort was 'a scam.' Bannon had been planning an aggressive defense strategy and recently hired a new team of attack dog lawyers who sought to portray the case to jurors as a selective and malicious prosecution. In January, Bannon's lawyers filed papers asking Newbauer to throw out the case, calling it an 'unconstitutional selective enforcement of the law.' The judge had been expected to rule on that on Tuesday before Bannon's plea deal made the request moot. Bannon, 71, pleaded not guilty in September 2022 to a state court indictment charging him with money laundering, fraud and conspiracy. He was accused of falsely promising donors that all money given to the We Build the Wall campaign would go toward building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Instead, prosecutors alleged the money was used to enrich Bannon and others involved in the project. The campaign, launched in 2018 after Trump fired Bannon as his chief strategist, quickly raised over $20 million and privately built a few miles of fencing along the border. It soon ran into trouble with the International Boundary and Water Commission, came under federal investigation and drew criticism from Trump, the Republican whose policy the charity was founded to support. Bragg, a Democrat, took up the case after Trump cut Bannon's federal prosecution short with a pardon in the final hours of his first term in the White House. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not state offenses. Early in the fundraising campaign, Bannon pooh-poohed it, prosecutors said at a November hearing. 'Isn't this a scam? You can't build the wall for this much money,' Bannon wrote in an email, according to prosecutor Jeffrey Levinson. He said Bannon went on to add: 'Poor Americans shouldn't be using hard-earned money to chase something not doable.' Two other men involved in the project, Brian Kolfage and Andrew Badolato, pleaded guilty to federal charges and were sentenced to prison. A third defendant, Timothy Shea, was convicted and also sentenced to prison. Bannon went to prison in an unrelated case last year, serving four months at a federal lockup in Connecticut for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. He was released in October. Bondi last week formed a 'Weaponization Working Group' at the Justice Department to examine cases she said appear to have been motivated by 'political objectives or other improper aims,' including Bragg's pursuit of criminal charges against Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-ally-steve-bannon-pleads-guilty-and-avoids-jail-time-in-border-wall-fraud-case/7970825.html	2025-02-11T08:26:04-08:00	
Scores dead as Islamic State attacks military base in Somalia	Nearly 100 people were killed and up to 60 others wounded when members of the Islamic State terror group launched a deadly attack on a military base belonging to security forces from Somalia’s Puntland region, officials said Tuesday. At least 27 Puntland soldiers and more than 70 militants were slain in the fierce fighting around the Togga Jacel area of the Cal Miskaad mountains in Puntland’s Bari region, Puntland security officials told VOA. In an interview Tuesday with VOA’s Somali Service, a spokesperson for Puntland security operations, Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed — known as Fadhigo — said the militants waged suicide attacks on the military base late Monday. 'We have confirmed that at least 27 Puntland soldiers and 70 Islamic State militants, were killed during the attack and subsequent gun battle,' Ahmed said. Ahmed said it was the deadliest attack since Puntland launched an offensive last month against Islamic State groups that have hideouts in the mountains. He said the death toll from the attack could be substantially higher than official figures. 'The death toll, especially that of the militants, could be significantly higher than the number we have provided because they were killed in caves. They were hiding, and we are still assessing,' Ahmed said. According to Puntland security officials, the militants using car bombs and suicide motorbikes launched attacks on the Puntland security base before a fierce gunbattle ensued. 'We knew they were coming as we had prior intelligence tip. They attacked us with car bombs and explosives-laden motorbikes, and then dozens of them engaged in a fierce gunbattle with our soldiers,' Ahmed said. A statement from the Puntland forces said their troops repulsed the attack aimed at taking control of the base. 'Puntland security forces have successfully repelled the enemy attack, and they still remain in their base in Togga Jecel, dealing a significant blow to the extremist group,' the statement said. On Wednesday last week, nearly 70 people were killed, and up to 50 others were wounded, during 24 hours of fighting between the two sides. This latest attack is the deadliest the Islamic State militants have waged on Puntland soldiers. Earlier this month, U.S. warplanes targeted the Islamic State affiliate in Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the airstrike on social media, describing the main target as a 'Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led.' Puntland began a major offensive against Islamic State in December and claims to have since killed nearly 200 Islamic State fighters, dozens of them foreign fighters, and captured villages and bases in the mountainous area controlled by IS.

Iran pardons journalists who covered woman’s death that triggered protests	Iran’s top judicial authority has pardoned two journalists who uncovered the death of a young woman in police custody, the judiciary’s news outlet, Mizan, said Tuesday. The case triggered widespread protests in 2022. Journalists Elaheh Mohammadi and Niloofar Hamedi had been sentenced to 12 and 13 years in prison, respectively, by an Iranian Revolutionary Court in 2023 for their coverage of the death of Mahsa Amini. Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman, died in 2022 while in the custody of Iran’s morality police for allegedly violating the country’s strict dress code for women. The death of the 22-year-old sparked the nationwide 'Woman Life Freedom' uprising, which in turn prompted a harsh crackdown by Iranian authorities. The pardons of the two journalists were applied on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, Mizan said. 'Following the approval by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of a list of pardons that was prepared by the judiciary’s head, these individuals were pardoned,' Mizan said. Both journalists were temporarily released last year after spending 17 months behind bars and later acquitted of the charge of 'collaboration with the U.S.' in an appeals court. Other charges, such as 'colluding against national security' and 'propaganda against the regime,' remained. But the pardons mean those charges have now been cleared, and the legal cases against the journalists are now closed. The jailings of the two journalists underscores the poor state of press freedom in Iran. The country ranks among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, with at least 16 behind bars for their work as of early December 2024, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. Iranian authorities detained at least 95 journalists in the wake of the nationwide protests following Amini’s death, according to CPJ. In 2024, Iran ranked 176 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, where 180 shows the worst press freedom environment.

UN announces death in Yemeni prison of aid worker detained by Houthis	Cairo — The United Nations World Food Program said Tuesday that an aid worker has died in a Yemeni prison three weeks after his detention by Houthi rebels. The announcement came a day after the U.N. suspended its operations in the rebel's stronghold in northern Yemen. The World Food Program said in a statement that one of its staff members died while in detention in northern Yemen. He was one of seven WFP staffers detained by the Houthi rebels on Jan. 23. No cause of death was given. 'Heartbroken and outraged by the tragic loss of WFP team member, Ahmed, who lost his life while arbitrarily detained in Yemen,' WFP executive director Cindy McCain wrote on the X social media platform. She said the worker, who is survived by his wife and two children, 'played a crucial role in our mission to deliver lifesaving food assistance.' A Houthi spokesman didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The 40-year-old worker, who joined the U.N. food agency in 2017, died Monday in a prison in the northern province of Saada, and that the circumstances of his death weren't immediately known, said a WFP official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.N. said Monday it was suspending its humanitarian operations in the northern province of Saada after the Houthis detained eight more U.N. staffers. A U.N. statement said the 'extraordinary' decision to pause all operations and programs in Saada was due to the lack of necessary security conditions and guarantees. It called for the Houthis to release all detained U.N. staff. The rebels have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen's capital. None of the U.N. staffers has been released. The U.N. decision will affect the global response to one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters. Seven U.N. agencies operate in Saada, including the WFP, the World Health Organization and UNICEF, along with several international aid organizations, according to the U.N. humanitarian agency. Yemen's civil war began in 2014, when Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels took control of the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country's north, forcing the government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war in March 2015, backed at the time by the U.S., in an effort to restore the internationally recognized government to power. The war has killed more than 150,000 people including civilians and combatants, and in recent years deteriorated largely into a stalemate and caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The U.N. had projected that over 19 million people across Yemen will need humanitarian assistance this year as many deal with climate shocks, malnutrition, cholera and the economic effects of war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-announces-death-in-yemeni-prison-of-aid-worker-detained-by-houthis/7970653.html	2025-02-11T05:55:51-08:00	
Vance tells Europeans that heavy regulation could kill AI	Paris — U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Europeans on Tuesday their 'massive' regulations on artificial intelligence could strangle the technology, and rejected content moderation as 'authoritarian censorship.' The mood on AI has shifted as the technology takes root, from one of concerns around safety to geopolitical competition, as countries jockey to nurture the next big AI giant. Vance, setting out the Trump administration's America First agenda, said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and strongly opposed the European Union's far tougher regulatory approach. 'We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry,' Vance told an AI summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris. 'We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship,' he added. Vance criticized the 'massive regulations' created by the EU's Digital Services Act, as well as Europe's online privacy rules, known by the acronym GDPR, which he said meant endless legal compliance costs for smaller firms. 'Of course, we want to ensure the internet is a safe place, but it is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,' he said. European lawmakers last year approved the bloc's AI Act, the world's first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology. Vance is leading the American delegation at the Paris summit. Vance also appeared to take aim at China at a delicate moment for the U.S. technology sector. Last month, Chinese startup DeepSeek freely distributed a powerful AI reasoning model that some said challenged U.S. technology leadership. It sent shares of American chip designer Nvidia down 17%. 'From CCTV to 5G equipment, we're all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that's been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes,' Vance said. But he said that 'partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true? Just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley: if you aren't paying for the product, you are the product.' Vance did not mention DeepSeek by name. There has been no evidence of information being able to surreptitiously flow through the startup's technology to China’s government, and the underlying code is freely available to use and view. However, some government organizations have reportedly banned DeepSeek’s use. Speaking after Vance, French President Emmanuel Macron said that he was fully in favor of trimming red tape, but he stressed that regulation was still needed to ensure trust in AI, or people would end up rejecting it. 'We need a trustworthy AI,' he said. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also said the EU would cut red tape and invest more in AI. In a bilateral meeting, Vance and von der Leyen were also likely to discuss Trump's substantial increase of tariffs on steel. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was expected to address the summit on Tuesday. A consortium led by Musk said on Monday it had offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit controlling OpenAI. Altman promptly posted on X: 'no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.' The technology world has closely watched whether the Trump administration will ease recent antitrust enforcement that had seen the U.S. sue or investigate the industry's biggest players. Vance said the U.S. would champion American AI -- which big players develop -- he also said: 'Our laws will keep Big Tech, little tech, and all other developers on a level playing field.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-tells-europeans-that-heavy-regulation-could-kill-ai-/7970615.html	2025-02-11T05:24:13-08:00	
Man recalls burying infants who starved in Sudan's Darfur camp	The U.N. has declared famine conditions in at least five areas of Sudan where it says people are dying daily from starvation and related illnesses. One of those areas includes the besieged Zamzam displacement camp in North Darfur.

Modi to meet Trump with focus on trade, immigration and strategic ties	New Delhi — As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to the United States for a two-day visit starting Wednesday, officials in New Delhi expressed optimism that the visit will herald a renewed and substantive partnership. However analysts said there will be contentious issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among U.S. President Donald Trump’s top priorities. Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his taking office, Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India-U.S. ties are solid and that 'this has been one of our strongest international partnerships.' Modi will reach Washington after visiting France, where he is attending a global conference on artificial intelligence. Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named India among countries that are 'very big tariff abusers.' In a phone conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship. His top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, repeated such concerns on Monday. 'India has enormously high' tariffs that lock out imports, he said in an interview with CNBC. New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S., announced earlier this month that it will lower import duties on some items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles and cars. It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods gain market access to India and boost energy imports from the U.S., say analysts. 'New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,' said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. 'India also bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that will benefit both.' For India, the stakes are high — the U.S. is its largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion, with a surplus of about $32 billion in India’s favor in 2023. India has not been impacted so far by Trump’s tariff impositions — the latest 25 percent tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports will have merely a marginal impact on India, as New Delhi is a small exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials. Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and technology. In the recent phone conversation with Modi, President Trump had called on Modi to increase procurement of American-made security equipment. India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has been purchasing more arms from countries like France, Israel and the United States. 'The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India [security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,' according to Rahul Bedi, defense analyst in New Delhi. 'There is likely to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.' Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by opposition parties. Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better treatment during future deportations. At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields, such as technology. 'People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our deepening ties with the United States,' Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns about the transport and treatment of the deportees. In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their collaboration in Trump’s first term. Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts point out that the two countries have convergence on geostrategic issues. 'It was president Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad, which was in a dormant state for about ten years, and he was solely responsible for reviving it,' said Mahapatra. 'This is an area where both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace, stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/modi-to-meet-trump-with-focus-on-trade-immigration-and-strategic-ties-/7970558.html	2025-02-11T04:38:24-08:00	
Russia, Ukraine strike energy infrastructure	Russia and Ukraine attacked each other’s energy infrastructure overnight, just days before U.S. and Ukrainian officials were set to discuss steps toward ending the nearly three-year war sparked by Russia’s 2022 invasion. Russian strikes damaged natural gas production facilities in Ukraine’s Poltava region overnight, using a combined attack of 19 cruise, ballistic and guided missiles, the Ukrainian air force said. As a result of the attack, Ukraine imposed emergency power restrictions on Tuesday, according to Ukraine energy minister German Galushchenko. 'The enemy launched an attack on gas infrastructure overnight,' Galushchenko said in a post on social media. 'As of this morning, the energy sector continues to be under attack.' Russia, which previously focused its missile and drone attacks on the Ukrainian electricity sector, recently stepped-up attacks on gas storage and production facilities, Reuters reported. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that it had struck an oil refinery in Russia's Saratov region overnight, causing a fire. It said the refinery produces more than 20 types of petroleum products and is involved in supplying the Russian forces. Saratov regional Governor Roman Busargin posted on the Telegram messaging app that a fire at an industrial facility in the region had been extinguished. He did not name the facility. Russia's defense ministry said air defense units intercepted and destroyed 40 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory. Eighteen of the drones were destroyed over the Saratov region, the ministry said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. The rest were downed over four other regions in Russia's south and west, it said. The Russian military also said its forces had taken control of the settlement of Yasenove in eastern Ukraine. Talks between US and Ukraine As U.S. Vice President JD Vance prepares for a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later this week, President Donald Trump suggested that Ukraine 'may be Russian someday.' Trump talked about the war in a Fox News interview that aired Monday. 'They may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,' he said. Trump also discussed trading Ukraine’s natural resources, such as rare minerals, in exchange for U.S. military support. 'We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,' Trump said. 'And they have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.' Trump’s senior advisers are expected to meet with Zelenskyy this week on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg are traveling to Germany for the summit. 'Knowing how the process works, it would probably be better for Zelenskyy if we all met together and talked through it as a group,' Kellogg said in an interview with the Associated Press. Trump on Monday said he'd 'probably' speak with Zelenskyy this week. Information from the Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-strike-energy-infrastructure-/7970514.html	2025-02-11T03:41:04-08:00	
Hamas: Ceasefire is only way to bring back hostages	After U.S. President Donald Trump suggested canceling the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas if all hostages were not returned by Saturday, a Hamas official warned that the only way to bring the captives home was to respect the terms of the agreement. Trump made his remarks Monday after Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and threatened to delay the release of hostages. 'As far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday 12 o'clock — I think it's an appropriate time — I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out,' Trump told reporters at the White House. On Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters and Agence France-Presse that the U.S. president’s remarks complicate the fragile truce. 'Trump must remember that there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties, and this is the only way to bring back the prisoners,' he said. 'The language of threats has no value and only complicates matters.' Hamas said Monday no more hostages would be released until further notice. The group — which is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and several other countries — accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned. Hamas also said Palestinians were targeted 'with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas' and said Israel has failed 'to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.' A United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any delay by Hamas would be 'a complete violation' of the ceasefire agreement. He placed the Israeli military on the highest level of alert. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages and Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. Plan for Gaza Trump has proposed moving Palestinians living in Gaza to an unspecified location outside the territory. Under his plan, the United States would take over Gaza and Palestinians would have no right to return. In an interview with Fox News released Monday, he called his plan for the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a 'real estate development for the future.' 'I would own it,' he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have rejected. Trump was scheduled to meet with Jordan's King Abdullah on Tuesday. 'I do think he'll take' refugees, Trump said Monday of the king. Asked if he would withhold aid from Jordan and Egypt if they declined to do so, Trump said: 'Yeah, maybe, sure, why not... if they don't agree, I would conceivably withhold aid.' King Abdullah has said he rejected any moves to annex land and displace Palestinians. He is expected to tell Trump such a move could spur radicalism, spread chaos in the region, jeopardize peace with Israel and threaten the country's very survival. Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday that Arab states rejected the plan to displace Palestinians and take control of the enclave. Egypt's foreign ministry said Abdelatty stressed the importance of rebuilding Gaza while Palestinians remained there. After the meeting, the U.S. State Department issued a statement that did not explicitly mention Trump's plan but added that Rubio 'reiterated the importance of close cooperation to advance post-conflict planning for the governance and security of Gaza and stressed Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again.' Terms of the ceasefire During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor. On Sunday, Israeli troops withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by fighting. In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated. The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-ceasefire-is-only-way-to-bring-back-hostages-/7970496.html	2025-02-11T03:21:39-08:00

Five killed in suicide bomb blast in northeastern Afghanistan, police say	At least five people were killed when a suicide bomber with explosives strapped to his body detonated outside a bank in northeastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, police said. The blast took place at 8:35 a.m. near the Kabul Bank branch in Kunduz province, killing the bank's security guard and four others including civilians and members of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement, police said. Seven people were wounded, provincial police spokesman Jumma Uddin Khakasr added. He did not say who was believed to be behind the attack and no group has claimed responsibility so far. Militants from the Afghan chapters of Islamic State have waged an insurgency against the Taliban since they returned to power in 2021. Taliban authorities say they have mostly crushed the group, even as it continues to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/five-killed-in-suicide-bomb-blast-in-northeastern-afghanistan-police-say/7970453.html	2025-02-11T01:51:53-08:00	
Virginia governor declares storm emergency as snow and ice bear down on mid-Atlantic states	A wintry mess was bearing down on mid-Atlantic states Tuesday with forecasts of significant snow and ice accumulations prompting warnings of potential power outages. The National Weather Service said travel would become treacherous Tuesday through early Wednesday in much of Virginia and West Virginia. Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm, allowing state agencies to assist local governments. Schools and government offices throughout Virginia were set to be closed Tuesday. The heaviest snow, up to 25.4 centimeters, was forecast in portions of northern and central Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Ice accumulations could range from a glaze in Kentucky and West Virginia to 1.3 centimeters in the Roanoke Valley of southwest Virginia, the weather service said. Power outages and tree damage were likely in places with heavy ice buildups. 'Did you think winter was over? Think again!' the weather service's office in Blacksburg, Virginia, said in a post on the social media platform X. Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said it has requested 700 additional workers from neighboring utilities to assist with problems by Tuesday morning. In northern Virginia, the National Park Service closed a portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a narrow highway that winds its way through woods along the Potomac River. The parkway connects multiple small national park sites and has historically been a trouble spot during winter storms for abandoned cars that created a slalom course for snowplows and other vehicles. Winter storm warnings extended from Kentucky to southern New Jersey, and a flood watch was posted for a wide swath of Kentucky, Tennessee, southwest Virginia and northern Georgia. The snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all rain as temperatures climb by Wednesday afternoon. A separate storm system is set to bring heavy snow from Kansas and Missouri to the Great Lakes on Wednesday, the weather service said. Dangerous cold was forecast Tuesday from an Arctic air mass stretching from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes. The temperature was expected to bottom out Tuesday morning at minus 36 degrees Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died due to cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for the homeless in the city of about 35,000 planned to be out on the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear to anyone who needs them, Erickson said. 'When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,' he said. 'Having all those resources available literally can save their life or keep them from frostbite.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/virginia-governor-declares-storm-emergency-as-snow-and-ice-bear-down-on-mid-atlantic-states/7970427.html	2025-02-11T00:16:20-08:00	
Singapore detains student accused of embracing far-right extremism	SINGAPORE — An 18-year-old Singapore student who was radicalized by violent far-right extremism online and who idolized the gunman behind deadly attacks on two mosques in New Zealand has been detained under the Internal Security Act, the government said. Nick Lee Xing Qiu, identified as an 'East Asian supremacist,' envisioned starting a 'race war' between Chinese and Malays in Singapore, the Internal Security Department (ISD) said in statement issued on Monday. 'At the point of his arrest, Lee's attack ideations were aspirational and he had no timeline to carry them out,' the ISD said, adding investigations into his online contacts had not revealed any imminent threats to Singapore. Lee has been detained since December under the ISA, which allows suspects to be held for up to two years without trial. The ISD said Lee found Islamophobic and far-right extremist content on social media in 2023, and then began actively searching for such content. It said he idolized the gunman who killed 51 people in two mosques in Christchurch in 2019, role-playing as him in an online simulation. 'Lee aspired to carry out attacks against Muslims in Singapore with like-minded, far-right individuals that he conversed with online,' the ISD said. Lee is the third Singaporean youth with far-right extremist ideologies to be dealt with under the ISA, the department said, noting far-right extremism was a growing concern globally. 'Youths may be more susceptible to such ideologies and may gravitate toward the sense of belonging and identity that far-right movements appear to provide,' the ISD said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-detains-student-accused-of-embracing-far-right-extremism/7970405.html	2025-02-10T23:05:07-08:00	
Indonesia general to head state food procurement company, sparking concerns	JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's appointment of an army general to run the national food procurement company has raised concerns about the expansion of military roles under President Prabowo Subianto, with a rights activist saying it also violated military laws. Major General Novi Helmy Prasetya was named chief executive of Bulog, a powerful state logistics company in charge of government-controlled imports of rice and other important food staples, on the weekend, becoming the first active duty general in the role since the authoritarian regime of General Suharto. Under military laws, soldiers are allowed to fill civilian posts only at state institutions in sectors such as defense, security, intelligence and disaster response. They are also not allowed to be involved in politics and business. 'This is a threat to democracy and a violation towards the law,' said Ardi Manto Adiputra, director of Indonesian rights group Imparsial, late on Monday. The armed forces are subject to the military justice system, which is separate from the civilian criminal code, raising issues of oversight and transparency at any government institution run by active duty officers, Adiputra said. State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir said the appointment was a strategic move towards achieving a goal of food self-sufficiency, according to state news agency Antara. The SOE ministry and the presidential communication office did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. The military law does not stipulate penalties for such a breach. However, the appointment can be appealed through a petition to the administrative court. It follows other military appointments in civic works since Prabowo took office in October, a trend that has caused unease among some people as it raises comparisons to Suharto's military-backed regime when the armed forces dominated public life. Prabowo was a military commander under Suharto, his former father-in-law. Suharto was overthrown in 1998. Sana Jaffrey, a research fellow at the Australian National University, noted Prabowo had appointed other active duty officers, such as his cabinet secretary and senior officials at the ministries of agriculture and transportation, which she said showed he trusted the military to help him meet his goals. 'But he's not willing to consider the long-term political consequences of placing active military officers in civilian roles, whether this is at odds with the law or what sort of institutional damage this might cause,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-general-to-head-state-food-procurement-company-sparking-concerns-/7970402.html	2025-02-10T22:52:57-08:00	
Private jets collide at Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, killing 1 person, authorities say	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — One person was killed and others were injured when a private jet owned by Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil collided with another jet Monday afternoon at the Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, authorities said. Neil's jet was landing at the airport when it veered off the runway and collided with another parked plane, Neil's representative Worrick Robinson, IV, said in a statement. There were two pilots and two passengers on Neil’s plane, but he was not among them. 'Mr. Neil’s thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting today,' Robinson said. The arriving jet veered off the runway and collided with the Gulfstream 200 jet that was parked, according to Kelli Kuester, aviation planning and outreach coordinator at the Scottsdale Airport. It appeared that the primary landing gear of the arriving jet failed, resulting in the collision, she said. Kuester said four people were on the arriving jet, which had come from Austin, Texas, and one person was in the parked plane. Two people injured in the collision were taken to trauma centers and one was in stable condition at a hospital, Scottsdale Fire Department Capt. Dave Folio said. He said they were working to recover the body of the person killed in the collision. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody involved in this,' Folio said. The runway has been closed and will remain closed 'for the foreseeable future,' Kuester said. Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowsky said in a statement that she is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the airport, police and federal agencies. 'On behalf of the city of Scottsdale, we offer our deepest condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have been taken to our trauma center for treatment,' she said. 'We will keep all affected by this tragedy in our prayers.' The airport is a popular hub for jets coming in and out of the Phoenix area, especially during big sports weekends like the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament, which attracts huge crowds just a few miles away. The Scottsdale collision comes after three major U.S. aviation disasters in the past two weeks. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And last week a small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome, killing all 10 people on board.	https://www.voanews.com/a/private-jets-collide-at-scottsdale-airport-in-arizona-killing-1-person-authorities-say/7970380.html	2025-02-10T21:40:03-08:00	
Trump imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports	U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on aluminum and steel tariffs that could hit Canada and Mexico, the top two exporters to the U.S., the hardest. Trump’s ongoing trade offensive also provoked chiding from the U.S.’ top competitor, China. VOA correspondent Anita Powell reports from the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-imposes-25-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum-imports/7970363.html	2025-02-10T20:37:02-08:00	
Back to plastic: Trump announces US policy ‘to end the use of paper straws’	President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday declaring that it is 'the policy of the United States to end the use of paper straws.' Former President Joe Biden’s administration, in an attempt to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, announced a plan in July 2024 to replace plastics with reusable, compostable and highly recyclable products. Trump’s order Monday stated that paper straws 'are nonfunctional, use chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple straws.' He also noted that paper straws are often individually wrapped in plastic, which undermines the environmental argument for their use. 'It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,' Trump said Monday as he signed the order. The Biden policy aimed to get plastic straws and other single-use plastics out of federal food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035. Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy 'DEAD!' in a social media post over the weekend. In his Monday order, he instructed agency officials to stop buying paper straws and make sure paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings. He also directed officials to create a national strategy to end the use of paper straws within 45 days. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/back-to-plastic-trump-announces-us-policy-to-end-the-use-of-paper-straws-/7970362.html	2025-02-10T20:01:41-08:00	
US senior advisers to talk with Zelenskyy on Munich sidelines	Senior advisers in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump are preparing to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to an Associated Press interview with retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. Kellogg, a special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said planning continues for talks with Zelenskyy at the annual conference. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Kellogg are among those who could participate in the sideline conversations with Ukraine’s president, AP reported. Trump has been critical about how much the war is costing the U.S. and has said European countries should repay the U.S. for helping Ukraine. During his campaign, Trump said if he were elected president, he would bring a swift end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, but he did not specify how he would accomplish that. Recently, he has said that he wants to make a deal with Ukraine to continue U.S. support in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. On Monday, AP reported the president said there are people currently working on a money-for-minerals-deal with Ukraine. 'We have people over there today who are making a deal that, as we give money, we get minerals and we get oil and we get all sorts of things,' Trump said. Kellogg told AP that 'the economics of that would allow for further support to the Ukrainians.' Meanwhile, Russian drone attacks caused a fire in Kyiv, injured a woman in Sumy and damaged several homes, according to Ukrainian officials. The Russian military reported downing 15 Ukrainian drones overnight, including seven in the Krasnodar region. Nobody was hurt as a result of the fire in Kyiv, which was sparked in a non-residential building, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Five houses were damaged and a woman was reportedly injured in the northeastern city of Sumy, regional governor Ihor Kalchenko said on Telegram. Material from the Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senior-advisers-to-talk-with-zelenskyy-on-munich-sidelines/7970359.html	2025-02-10T19:50:15-08:00	
Trump imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports	White House — President Donald Trump on Monday fired another volley in his ongoing trade war, announcing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers. 'It’s a big deal,' Trump said, the thick black marker in his right hand hovering over the executive order. 'This is the beginning of making America rich again,' he said, dragging his distinctive jagged signature over the paper. Billionaire financier Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, watched from over Trump’s left shoulder in the Oval Office. Trump's trade adviser said this move will help domestic producers and support U.S. economic and national security. Lutnick spoke of the 120,000 jobs this could bring back. 'You are the president who is standing up for the American steelworker, and I am just tremendously impressed and delighted to stand next to you,' Lutnick said. The nuts and bolts Trump’s proclamations raised the rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. And he restored a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s actions also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be 'melted and poured' and aluminum to be 'smelted and cast' in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel. The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported steel for tariffs. Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the measures would help U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America's economic and national security. 'The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America's economic and national security,' he told reporters. 'This isn't just about trade. It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum,' Navarro said. What now? Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action Sunday — and the move drew instant pushback in what is unfolding as a tit-for-tat exchange. Earlier Monday, Beijing enacted additional tariffs on U.S. goods as a countermeasure to Trump’s earlier 10% hike on Chinese goods. 'There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,' said Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 'They harm the interests of the people of both countries. What is needed now is not unilateral tariff increases but equal dialogue and consultation based on mutual respect. We urge the U.S. to correct its wrong practices and stop politicizing and instrumentalizing economic and trade issues.' Most economists believe tariffs raise consumer prices. Scholars of supply chains and logistics say Trump’s move also raises major global policy questions. 'It's not clear whether this is a negotiating strategy, whether this is going to be permanent,' said Professor Sunderesh Heragu of Oklahoma State University. 'Is this only restricted to Canada, Mexico and China as it is now, or is it going to expand to the European Union, for example, or even the BRICS countries, of which, you know, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and 12 or 14 other countries, are part of?' He said these concerns may prompt countries to realign their trade relationships, which will likely alarm producers. 'It clearly causes a lot of confusion, and you know, businesses, again, hate uncertainty,' Heragu said. 'So, they're going to put everything on pause. That means, you know, there could be a decrease in production activity, while at the same time, the tariffs could have inflationary effects.' Some in the automotive industry in Detroit, the U.S.’ 'Motor City,' echoed that concern. 'Sudden tariffs to a system — there isn't a lot of good that comes out of that,' said Glenn Stevens Jr., executive director of MichAuto and vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives at the Detroit Regional Chamber. Studies attempting to understand the impact of these moves yield mixed pictures. The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs will generate around $100 billion each year in federal tax revenue. Another analysis shows they could 'impose significant costs on the broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs and ultimately driving up consumer prices.' Some information for this article came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-imposes-25-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum-imports/7970355.html	2025-02-10T19:23:40-08:00	
Hamas threatens to delay hostage release	Hamas officials accused Israel of violating a ceasefire agreement Monday and threatened to delay releasing more hostages, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to say 'all hell is going to break out' if all the remaining hostages are not turned over by Saturday. The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel. A spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement the militants remain committed to the ceasefire terms 'as long as the occupation adheres to them.' Hamas accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned. The group said Palestinians were targeted 'with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas' and Israel has failed 'to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.' However, a United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any delay by Hamas would be 'a complete violation' of the ceasefire agreement. He placed the Israeli military on the highest level of alert. In Washington Monday, Trump said he would propose canceling the ceasefire agreement if all the remaining hostages being held in Gaza were not released by 12 o’clock Saturday, but he did not specify whether that was noon or midnight, and he did not indicate a time zone. He also said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they don't take Palestinian refugees being relocated from Gaza. Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages while Israel has released more than 730 prisoners. Trump has proposed moving Palestinians living in Gaza to an unspecified location outside the territory. Under his plan for the enclave, they would have no right to return. In an interview with Fox News released Monday, he called his plan for the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a 'real estate development for the future.' 'I would own it,' he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have already rejected. Trump, a billionaire New York real estate magnate before entering politics in 2015, did not say where the Palestinians would be relocated. But when asked by Fox anchor Bret Baier if they would be allowed to return home to Gaza, Trump said, 'No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing.' 'In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever — it's not habitable,' Trump said of Gaza, decimated by 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. In the Fox interview, Trump said he would build 'beautiful communities' for the Palestinians. 'Could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,' Trump said. On Sunday, Israeli troops withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by fighting. Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed Hamas had 'forced the enemy to submit to our demands' and that it thwarted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'Illusion of achieving total victory.' Israeli officials did not disclose how many soldiers withdrew or to where. Troops currently remain along Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later stage of the initial 42-day ceasefire. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor. In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a 'sustainable calm.' But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated. The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.

France seeks AI boom, urges EU investment in the sector	French President Emmanuel Macron wants Europe to become a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, he told a global summit of AI and political leaders in Paris Monday where he announced that France’s private sector has invested nearly $113 billion in French AI. Financial investment is key to achieving the goal of Europe as an AI hub, Macron said in his remarks delivered in English at the Grand Palais. He said the European bloc would also need to 'adopt the Notre Dame strategy,' a reference to the lightning swift rebuilding of France’s famed Notre Dame cathedral in five years after a devastating 2019 fire, the result of simplified regulations and adherence to timelines. 'We showed the rest of the of the world that when we commit to a clear timeline, we can deliver,' the French leader said. Henna Virkkunen, the European Union’s digital head, indicated that the EU is in agreement with simplifying regulations. The EU approved the AI Act last year, the world’s first extensive set of rules designed to regulate technology. European countries want to ensure that they have a stake in the tech race against an aggressive U.S. and other emerging challengers. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to address the EU’s ability to compete in the tech world Tuesday. Macron’s announcement that the French private sector will invest heavily in AI 'reassured' Clem Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, a U.S. company with French co-founders that is a hub for open-source AI, that there will be 'ambitious' projects in France, according to Reuters. Sundar Pichai, Google’s head, told the gathering that the shift to AI will be 'the biggest of our lifetimes.' However, such a big shift also comes with problems for the AI community. France had wanted the summit to adopt a non-binding text that AI would be inclusive and sustainable. 'We have the chance to democratize access [to a new technology] from the start,' Pichai told the summit. Whether the U.S. will agree to that initiative is uncertain, considering the U.S. government’s recent moves to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. U.S. Vice President JD Vance is attending the summit and expected to deliver a speech on Tuesday. Other politicians expected Tuesday at the plenary session are Chinese Vice Premier Zhan Guoqing and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. About 100 politicians are expected. There are also other considerations with a shift to AI. The World Trade Organization says its calculations indicate that a 'near universal adoption of AI ... could increase trade by up to 14 percentage points' from what it is now but cautions that global 'fragmentation' of regulations on AI technology and data flow could bring about the contraction of both trade and output. A somewhat frightening side effect of AI technology is that it can replace the need for humans in some sectors. International Labor Organization leader Gilbert Houngbo told the summit Monday that the jobs that AI can do, such as clerical work, are disproportionately held by women. According to current statistics, that development would likely widen the gender pay gap.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-seeks-ai-boom-urges-eu-investment-in-the-sector-/7970306.html	2025-02-10T17:29:46-08:00	
Justice Dept directs prosecutors to drop charges against New York mayor	The Justice Department on Monday directed federal prosecutors in New York to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, according to a memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove. Bove, a political appointee of President Donald Trump, intervened in the case, saying the indictment of Adams interfered with his 2025 mayoral reelection campaign. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, declined to comment. Prosecutors have not yet indicated to the judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Dale Ho in Manhattan, that they plan to drop the case, court records showed Monday evening. Adams was the subject of a five-count indictment charging him with accepting travel perks from Turkish officials and political donations from foreigners in exchange for taking actions to benefit Turkey. Adams pleaded not guilty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/justice-dept-directs-prosecutors-to-drop-charges-against-new-york-mayor/7970311.html	2025-02-10T17:28:24-08:00	
Musk-led group makes $97.4 billion bid for control of OpenAI	A consortium led by Elon Musk said Monday it has offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, another salvo in the billionaire's fight to block the artificial intelligence startup from transitioning to a for-profit firm. Musk's bid is likely to ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of the startup at the heart of a boom in generative AI technology. Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: 'no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.' Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X, is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a $500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White House. OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best AI models. Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a for-profit structure. Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it was now focused on making money. 'It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,' Musk said in a statement Monday. 'We will make sure that happens.' Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'Musk's bid puts another wrinkle into OpenAI's quest to remove the nonprofit's control over its for-profit entity,' said Rose Chan Loui, executive director of the UCLA Law Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits. 'This bid sets a marker for the valuation of the nonprofit's economic interests,' she said. 'If OpenAI values the nonprofit's interests at less than what Musk is offering, then they would have to show why.' The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund III, Emanuel Capital Management, and Eight Partners. XAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to The Wall Street Journal which first reported Musk's offer earlier Monday. XAI recently raised $6 billion from investors at a valuation of $40 billion, sources have told Reuters. Throwing a wrench 'This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things,' said Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate governance. 'The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds, and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, it's a concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the not-for-profit. If this was a public company, plaintiffs' lawyers would justifiably be lining up down the block to sue that transaction.' OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in its last funding round, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to $40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new funds, Reuters reported in January. Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds. 'Musk's offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit should significantly complicate OpenAI’s current fundraising and the process of converting into a for-profit corporation,' said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson. 'The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors ... OpenAI may not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of OpenAI’s board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could call into question the offer from SoftBank.' Musk's stock in Tesla is valued at roughly $165 billion, according to LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his $44 billion buyout of the social media platform that was called Twitter in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-led-group-makes-97-4-billion-bid-for-control-of-openai/7970292.html	2025-02-10T17:01:16-08:00

Facing backlash over $500K salary, LA's wildfire recovery czar agrees to work for free	LOS ANGELES — Steve Soboroff, a longtime fixture in Los Angeles civic life who is now serving as chief recovery officer for the city’s wildfire comeback, won’t take a salary after facing backlash over plans to pay him $500,000. He would have been paid through charitable donations, not with taxpayer money. Soboroff had defended the proposed salary of half-a-million dollars for three months of work, saying his expertise as a residential property developer made him worth the price. But after criticisms mounted from elected officials and residents, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reversed course over the weekend and said Soboroff would receive no compensation. Soboroff is the city’s former police commissioner. 'Steve is always there for LA. I spoke to him today and asked him to modify his agreement and work for free. He said yes. We agree that we don’t need anything distracting from the recovery work we’re doing,' Bass said in a statement Saturday. She had named him to the recovery czar position on Jan. 17. A message seeking comment was left for Soboroff on Monday. Soboroff, 76, raised his family in the Pacific Palisades area, where nearly 7,000 homes were destroyed by last month's inferno. His son, NBC News journalist Jacob Soboroff, reported from the devastated neighborhood where he grew up. He was initially tasked with leading the first phase of the city’s wildfire rebuilding effort. On Friday though, Bass suggested that the scope of his work could be diminished, saying he would focus primarily on rebuilding the Palisades’ historic business district. Soboroff disputed that notion, saying he is regularly interacting with federal agencies. In addition to developing thousands of homes over decades, Soboroff served on the city’s Board of Police Commissioners and on the city commission that oversees the Department of Recreation and Parks — both volunteer positions. Before the salary reversal, he told the Los Angeles Times that he put aside other real estate and environmental consulting work to take on the role of the city's recovery officer. 'I’ve been doing this for 35 years for free on some of the biggest civic projects for the city of Los Angeles. But nobody ever asked me to drop everything. This time they did,' Soboroff said. 'And I said OK, under the condition that my pay not be taken out of city money, or from any wildfire survivors who would otherwise benefit from that money.' It wasn't clear which charitable organizations would have covered his pay. Los Angeles City Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who sits on the committee overseeing the recovery, called the proposed salary 'obscene.' Soboroff’s original salary was first reported by the Times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/facing-backlash-over-500k-salary-la-s-wildfire-recovery-czar-agrees-to-work-for-free-/7970272.html	2025-02-10T16:33:33-08:00	
What the Westminster show dogs' names mean	They have names that could make a random password generator cry uncle. Meet, for example, GCHG CH Calicops Sassafras Gonnakikurass. 'She’s a saucy girl. Her name says it all,' Fred Ortiz said as he groomed the Brussels griffon to compete Monday at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show. Her name says ... what exactly? Well, ponder the final part, and you may understand what her owners are wryly getting at. But in any event, you can just call her Wrassy. Westminster’s main competition began Monday with breed-by-breed judging that leads to U.S. dogdom's most illustrious best in show prize, awarded Tuesday night. The kennel club held agility and obedience contests Saturday, as well as other events. If show dogs are the aristocrats of the canine world, they often have the names, titles and nicknames to match. Their 'registered,' or formal, names are the ones used for showing. Those long, confounding-sounding appellations are packed with show-dog information. Clumps of capital letters at the beginning, and sometimes also the end, signify the dogs’ achievements in various sports. 'GCHG' and 'CH,' for example, denote various levels of championship in the traditional, breed-by-breed judging. After those titles, the first word in a registered name generally indicates the kennel, or breeding program, that produced the dog. Other kennels or dogs in the pedigree might get a shout-out at the end. Meanwhile, show dogs have 'call names' that they go by on a day-to-day basis. A dog might also have had a different 'puppy name' bestowed by its breeder and later changed by its eventual owner. The portmanteau words and puzzling phrases in registered names are partly meant to avoid duplication with other dogs in registries that go back over a century. But many breeders also use patterns to help them remember which litter was which. Professional dog handlers and sometime miniature schnauzer breeders Rachel Adams and Alberto Montila name their litters in alphabetical order — one litter had names that start with 'A,' the next with 'B,' and so on, Adams said Monday. She was blow-drying a French bulldog named GCHG CH Elysium’s Adventurous Rapscallion D’Assisi, better known as Finn. When Amie McLaughlin picks names for her litters of Norwegian buhunds, she just likes to have pun. 'I like the name to be something that someone looks at and says, ‘Oh, that’s cute,'' said McLaughlin, of Kent, Washington. A dog she bred and guided Monday, GCH CH Cloudpointe Nothing Betta Than This CGC, was born into a fish-themed litter (hence 'Betta,' a type of Southeast Asian fish). He goes by Eirik when he's at home with co-owner Sarah Woodworth in Paloa, Hawaii. GCH CH Aberdeen's Zoltar RN BN-V — just Zoltar, to his friends — has owners who appreciate humor, too. For one thing, they share their Los Angeles-area home with a shaggy, clownish, 120-pound otterhound who likes to cuddle. Comedian and actor Chris Hardwick, who owns the dog with his wife, model and actor Lydia Hearst, named Zoltar for the fortune-telling machine that makes a teenager grow to adult proportions overnight in the movie 'Big.' 'We knew he was going to grow,' and plenty big, explained Hearst. Zoltar got some recognition Monday from the judge, but the dog's cousin Melody, aka GCHS CH Dobhran’s Alexa Play Some Music, won best of breed. Hardwick and Hearst were also cheering on the French bulldog breed winner called Sassy, or GCHS Diva's Sassafras Lass. She and other breed winners were headed into a semifinal round Monday night. Sassy is owned and was co-bred by Hearst's mother, newspaper heir Patricia Hearst Shaw.

Democrats look for ways to oppose Trump administration's changes while in the minority	Democratic lawmakers criticized what they called the Trump administration’s 'extreme' efforts to reshape the U.S. government, vowing to oppose those changes despite limited political capital in both chambers of the U.S. Congress. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the chamber’s floor Monday that Republicans were departing from their campaign pledge not to follow Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for reshaping the U.S. government. 'This year, Republicans have spent all of their time implementing the most extreme parts of Project 2025 and have done nothing to lower the high cost of living,' Jeffries said. Congressional Republicans say Trump is exercising broad presidential authority to reevaluate government agencies. Trump is accomplishing this through Elon Musk, a multibillionaire whom he put in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, whose aim is to reduce federal spending. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to colleagues that Democrats have a four-pronged strategy to oppose the Trump administration’s actions: oversight, litigation, legislation, and communication and mobilization. Schumer also said Democrats would continue to support litigation in the courts to stop the funding freeze and to prevent federal employees from being laid off. Vice President JD Vance criticized those judicial decisions, writing on X, 'If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.' Democratic Senator Chris Murphy responded on X Monday, 'For those of us who believe we are in the middle of a constitutional crisis, this is the meat of it. Trump and Vance are laying the groundwork to ignore the courts — democracy’s last line of defense against unchecked executive power.' Senate Democrats also announced a new whistleblowers portal for federal civil service employees and public servants to disclose information about wrongdoing. In a statement, they said, 'As Senate Republicans refuse to fulfill their constitutional duty to provide a check on the Executive Branch, Senate Democrats remain steadfast in our commitment to uncovering the truth. We are prepared to issue demand letters, preserve public records, conduct public hearings, and pursue legal action where necessary.' Schumer said Democrats would support legislation funding the U.S. government but called on Republicans to negotiate in a bipartisan fashion. A short-term resolution funding the U.S. government expires on March 14. Any bill funding the government past that date needs 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to pass. Republicans currently hold the majority in the chamber with 53 seats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-look-for-ways-to-oppose-trump-administration-s-changes-while-in-the-minority-/7970251.html	2025-02-10T16:20:35-08:00	
As tariffs take effect, Beijing and Washington look back to 2020 deal	New Chinese tariffs on a range of U.S. goods went into effect Monday, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese products last week. Tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum are next. Despite the tariffs and rising tensions, both sides seem reluctant to launch into a full-on trade war, analysts say. Beijing has its plate full battling its own internal economic struggles, and for now President Trump has deferred most of his promised tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing is preparing to offer to return to a so-called 'Phase 1' trade deal that was signed during Trump’s first term. The Trump administration has sent its own signals as well. Trump has called for the Office of the United States Trade Representative to review the first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreement and determine whether Beijing has fulfilled its commitments in the contract. Last week, Jamieson Greer, Trump’s nominee for U.S. trade representative, said he would assess China's compliance with the first phase of the agreement quickly upon his appointment to ensure the implementation of the deal. Greer also said he would use it as a starting point in relations with China. What is the Phase 1 deal? On January 15, 2020, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed the Phase 1 agreement, which laid out several terms for trade between the world’s two biggest economies. The deal called on the United States to cut some of its imposed tariffs on China and included a commitment from Beijing to buy more U.S. products and implement certain reforms. The 96-page agreement, divided into eight sections, placed a big emphasis on reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, and protecting domestic industries by cracking down on Chinese trade practices, such as nontariff trade barriers, intellectual property violations and the forced transfer of technology without adequate compensation. The agreement mandated that China purchase at least $200 billion in U.S. products and services over a two-year period from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. It also required that Beijing stop subsidizing strategic sectors and give fairer treatment to American companies in terms of regulation. Despite those commitments from China, data from a report published in 2022 by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington showed that Beijing did not reach its purchase target. The report also showed that Beijing has completed 57% of the spending laid out in the agreement, a total that is lower than the level of China's purchase of goods from the United States before the U.S.-China trade war. Although China was not expected to fully meet its commitments, the agreement did have some benefits for Washington, as it helped decrease Washington’s trade deficit with Beijing. Starting point Analysts say the agreement may be revisited as a starting point for new trade discussions. 'The two sides need to start somewhere. Phase 1 may at least provide some common language that both sides will be familiar with so as to get that ball rolling,' Chad Brown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, explained to VOA in an emailed response Friday. Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii, says the Phase 1 agreement has two advantages for acting as a foundation for U.S.-China trade discussions. 'First, the two sides reached a similar agreement before, so they know it’s feasible,' he told VOA in an emailed response on Friday. He also explained that using the agreement 'suits both sides’ interests.' 'Trump wants to claim he has resolved the bilateral trade imbalance, which he sees as his primary measure of success,' he explained, noting that this agreement supports that narrative. He added that the deal benefits Beijing by allowing China to avoid making significant structural reforms. Roy, however, adds that several factors make an agreement between Washington and Beijing difficult. 'A major bilateral economic deal would depend on avoiding a strategic crisis, which might occur over Taiwan or the South China Sea, or an encounter between U.S. and Chinese ships or aircraft that escalates, or something like the spy balloon incident,' he said. Early in 2023, the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon floating through U.S. airspace delayed a U.S. diplomatic visit to the country by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The ballon was eventually shot down.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-tariffs-take-effect-beijing-and-washington-look-back-to-2020-deal/7970267.html	2025-02-10T16:18:28-08:00

Arizona adds endangered bat to list of night-flying creatures that frequent the state	FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA — Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive. Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders. Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva-swabbing campaign. The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA — or eDNA — to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home. The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988, and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It is an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants. Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated. 'If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you’re not guaranteed to be successful,' said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. 'By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.' Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall. The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall. Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge. Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months. 'There’s a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what’s in the database,' Riley said. 'A little bit like a Google search — you’ve got your question, you’re asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you’ve got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.' Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats. 'They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,' Lear said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arizona-adds-endangered-bat-to-list-of-night-flying-creatures-that-frequent-the-state/7970013.html	2025-02-10T15:48:53-08:00	
15 cases of measles in Texas county with numerous vaccine exemptions	Fifteen measles cases — mostly in school-aged children — have been confirmed in a small county in West Texas with one of the highest rates of vaccine exemptions in the state. South Plains Public Health District Director Zach Holbrooks said Monday that his department was first notified in late January about the first two cases in Gaines County, which he said were 'two children who had seen a physician in Lubbock.' Some of the cases appear to be connected to private religious schools in the district, said Holbrooks, who cautioned that the investigation is ongoing. 'I wouldn’t say they’re all connected, but our teams are looking into exposure sites and the background of those cases,' he said. Local health officials set up a drive-through vaccination clinic last week and are offering screening services to residents. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. This month, health officials in metro Atlanta are working to contain a measles case that spread to two unvaccinated family members. Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade from .76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year, according to Texas Department of State Health Services data. Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine: Nearly 14% of children from kindergarten through grade 12 had an exemption in the 2023-24 school year, which is more than five times the state average of 2.32% and beyond the national rate of 3.3%. But the number of unvaccinated kids in the county is likely significantly higher, DSHS spokesperson Lara Anton said, because Gaines County has many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are a two-shot series: The first is recommended at 12 to 15 months old and second between 4 to 6 years old. The vaccine is required to attend most public schools in the U.S. But vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks. Lawmakers across the country have proposed various vaccine requirement changes at a time when anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is awaiting confirmation as the secretary of Health and Human Services. One of the early Gaines County cases traveled to neighboring New Mexico while they were still infectious, Anton said, but there were no immediate reports of infection. New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott said the agency has been in communication with Texas officials but there was no known exposure to measles in his state. 'We're going to watch this very closely,' Nott said. Two cases of measles were reported in early January in the Houston area, but Holbrooks said the West Texas cases don't appear to be connected. Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cases-of-measles-in-texas-county-with-numerous-vaccine-exemptions-/7970000.html	2025-02-10T15:38:20-08:00	
On sidelines of AI Summit in Paris, unions denounce its harmful effects	PARIS — In front of political and tech leaders gathered at a summit in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron called for a strategy on Monday to make up for the delay in France and Europe in investing in artificial intelligence (AI) but was faced with a 'counter-summit' that pointed out the risks of the technology. The use of chatbots at work and school is destroying jobs, professions and threatening the acquisition of knowledge, said union representatives gathered at the Theatre de la Concorde located in the Champs-Elysees gardens, less than a kilometer from the venue of the Summit for Action on Artificial Intelligence. Habib El Kettani, from Solidaires Informatique, a union representing IT workers, described an 'automation already underway for about ten years,' which has been reinforced with the arrival of the flagship tool ChatGPT at the end of 2022. 'I have been fighting for ten years to ensure that my job does not become an endangered species,' said Sandrine Larizza, from the CGT union at France Travail, a public service dedicated to the unemployed. She deplored 'a disappearance of social rights that goes hand in hand with the automation of public services,' where the development of AI has served, according to her 'to make people work faster to respond less and less to the needs of users, by reducing staff numbers.' Loss of meaning 'With generative AI, it is no longer the agent who responds by email to the unemployed person but the generative AI that gives the answers with a multitude of discounted job offers in subcontracting,' said Larizza. This is accompanied by 'a destruction of our human capacities to play a social role, a division into micro-tasks on the assembly line and an industrialization of our professions with a loss of meaning,' she said, a few days after the announcement of a partnership between France Travail and the French startup Mistral. 'Around 40 projects' are also being tested 'with postal workers,' said Marie Vairon, general secretary of the Sud PTT union of the La Poste and La Banque Postale group. AI is used 'to manage schedules and simplify tasks with a tool tested since 2020 and generalized since 2023,' she said, noting that the results are 'not conclusive.' After the implementation at the postal bank, La Banque Postale, of 'Lucy,' a conversational robot handling some '300,000 calls every month,' Vairon is concerned about a 'generative AI serving as a coach for bank advisers.' ‘Students are using it’ On the education side, 'whether we like it or not, students are using it,' said Stephanie de Vanssay, national educational and digital adviser of the National Union of Autonomous Unions (UNSA) for primary and secondary school. 'We have indifferent teachers, worried teachers who are afraid of losing control and quality of learning, skeptics, and those who are angry about all the other priorities,' she said. Developing the critical thinking of some 12 million students is becoming, in any case, 'an even more serious concern and it is urgent to explain how to use these tools and why,' de Vanssay said. The Minister of National Education Elisabeth Borne announced on Thursday the launch of a call for tenders for an AI for teachers, as well as a charter of use and training for teachers. 'No critical thinking without interactions and without helping each other to think and progress in one's thinking, which requires intermediation,' said Beatrice Laurent, national secretary of UNSA education. 'A baby with a tablet and nursery rhymes will not learn to speak.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-sidelines-of-ai-summit-in-paris-unions-denounce-its-harmful-effects-/7970005.html	2025-02-10T15:37:15-08:00	
US judge keeps block on Trump federal buyout plan in place for now	BOSTON/WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge kept his block on President Donald Trump's buyout plan for federal employees in place on Monday while he considers whether to impose it for a longer period of time. The decision by U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston prevents Trump's administration from implementing the buyout plan for now, giving a temporary victory to labor unions that have sued to stop it entirely. More than 2 million federal civilian employees had faced a midnight deadline Monday to accept the proposal. It is unclear when O'Toole will rule on the request by the unions. The buyout effort is part of a far-reaching plan by Trump and his allies to reduce the size and rein in the actions of the federal bureaucracy. Trump, who returned to the presidency on Jan. 20, has accused the federal workforce of undercutting his agenda during his first term in office, from 2017 to 2021. Unions have urged their members not to accept the buyout offer — saying Trump's administration cannot be trusted to honor it — but about 65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts as of Friday, according to a White House official. Reuters has been unable to independently verify that number, which does not include a breakdown of workers from each agency. The offer promises to pay employees their regular salaries and benefits until October without requiring them to work, but that may not be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14, and there is no guarantee that salaries would be funded beyond that point. At a court hearing, U.S. Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton called the buyout plan a 'humane off-ramp' for those frustrated by Trump's decision to reduce the size of the workforce and end the ability of many of them to work from home. But a lawyer for the unions said the plan had been carried out in a 'slap dash' fashion with little regard to how it might disrupt operations at agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. 'They failed to consider the continued functioning of government,' lawyer Elena Goldstein said. The administration had initially proposed a deadline of last Thursday before O'Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton, extended it so he could consider the case. Trump has tasked Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, with overseeing the purge of federal employees through his Department of Government Efficiency, which is not an actual government agency. Musk's actions have sown panic among federal workers and prompted public protests. His actions also have led to a flood of calls to U.S. lawmakers by voters worried about the access that Musk's team has been given to sensitive information in government computer systems that contain data on federal payments to Americans and personal details of federal workers. Several lawsuits The unions and Democratic attorneys general have brought lawsuits challenging Trump's rapid remaking of government and won some initial victories. A union that represents Consumer Financial Protection Bureau workers has filed a lawsuit seeking to block acting chief Russell Vought's move to suspend CFPB activities, one of several legal challenges that Trump's administration now faces. Democratic attorneys general from 22 U.S. states filed a lawsuit on Monday in Boston challenging sharp cuts to federal grant funding for universities, medical centers and other research institutions by the Trump administration. An effort to hollow out the U.S. Agency for International Development is partially on hold after a judge's ruling. Trump's effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal loans, grants and other financial assistance has also been paused in a separate case. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Monday ruled that the administration must restore all domestic funding while he considers the case. On Saturday, a judge temporarily blocked Musk's entity from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments at the Treasury Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-keeps-block-on-trump-federal-buyout-plan-in-place-for-now/7969998.html	2025-02-10T15:36:33-08:00	
Trump signs executive orders on steel, aluminum tariffs	Washington — President Donald Trump moved to substantially raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday, canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers Canada, Mexico, Brazil and other countries in a move that could boost the risk of a multifront trade war. Trump signed proclamations that raised the tariff rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. His action reinstates a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel imports and aluminum imports that had been entering the U.S. duty free under quota deals, exemptions and thousands of product exclusions. The proclamations were extensions of Trump's 2018 Section 232 national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers. A White House official said the exemptions had eroded the effectiveness of these measures. Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be 'melted and poured' and aluminum to be 'smelted and cast' in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel into the U.S. The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported steel for tariffs. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro said the measures would help U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America's economic and national security. 'The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America's economic and national security,' he told reporters. 'This isn't just about trade. It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum.' Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action on Sunday, adding that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-executive-orders-on-steel-aluminum-tariffs/7970007.html	2025-02-10T15:35:06-08:00	
2 US deportation flights head to Venezuela, alleged gang members aboard	Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants deported from the United States — the first since a January deal between the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro — are heading to Venezuela, the South American country's government said Monday. The flights, run by Venezuelan airline Conviasa, are part of a plan to repatriate thousands of migrants who fled Venezuela 'because of economic sanctions and the campaigns of psychological warfare against our country,' the government statement said. Some of the people on the flight are allegedly involved in illegal activities with the Tren de Aragua gang, the statement said and will be vigorously investigated for criminal ties. Trump envoy Richard Grenell met with Maduro in Caracas on Jan. 31, where the two men discussed migration and sanctions, among other issues. Grenell left the South American country with six Americans who had been held by Venezuelan authorities. The Trump administration has said it is a priority to deport members of Tren de Aragua from the U.S. and Trump himself said after Grenell's visit that Maduro agreed to receive all Venezuelan illegal migrants and provide for their transportation back home. The Venezuelan government says it destroyed Tren de Aragua within its borders in 2023. Trump's administration has also moved to remove deportation protection from about 348,000 Venezuelans in the U.S., who could lose work permits and then be deported in April. More than 7 million Venezuelan migrants have left their country in recent years amid a sustained economic and social collapse blamed by the government on sanctions by the United States and others. Maduro and several allies have been indicted by the United States on drug trafficking charges and international observers and the country's opposition say a July election which gave Maduro his third term was fraudulent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deportation-flights-head-to-venezuela-alleged-gang-members-aboard/7970003.html	2025-02-10T15:26:24-08:00	
UN Security Council raises alarm over rising IS-K threat from Afghanistan	Islamabad — United Nations counterterrorism officials warned during a Security Council meeting Monday that an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains a significant threat to regional and global security. The discussion centered on the threat posed by Islamic State, also known as Daesh, and its regional offshoots to international peace and security. The Afghan-based Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) was highlighted as one of the 'most dangerous branches' of the transnational terrorist group. It has carried out repeated high-profile attacks targeting Afghan civilians and members of the country’s de facto Taliban rulers. 'ISIL-Khorasan has continued to pose a significant threat in Afghanistan, the region and beyond,' Vladimir Voronkov, U.N. undersecretary-general for counterterrorism, told the meeting, using another acronym for IS-K. He stated that IS-K supporters had plotted attacks in Europe and were actively seeking to recruit individuals from Central Asian countries. 'There were also reports of small numbers of foreign terrorist fighters continuing to travel to Afghanistan,' Voronkov said. He renewed a U.N. appeal for all member states to come together to prevent the South Asian country from 'again becoming a hotbed of terrorist activities.' While addressing the meeting, U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea described IS-K as a significant global threat. 'We remain concerned about ISIS-K's capabilities to plot and conduct attacks, as well as sustain recruitment campaigns, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan,' Shea stated, using another acronym for IS-K. Chinese envoy Fu Cong cautioned without elaborating that terrorists linked to IS-K, al-Qaida and the anti-China East Turkestan Islamic Movement 'are very active' in Afghanistan and 'are colluding with each other.' 'China calls on the Afghan interim government to take visible and verifiable action to disintegrate and eliminate all terrorist organizations entrenched in Afghanistan,' Fu said, referring to the Taliban government, which is not recognized by any country. Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's ambassador to the U.N., attributed the increasing threat of IS-K to the hasty withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO troops from Afghanistan in 2021. 'The growing activity of ISIL-Khorasan is no coincidence. While hastily leaving Afghanistan, NATO troops abandoned vast quantities of weapons and equipment there, which then fell into the hands of ISIL inter alia [among other things],' Nebenzya asserted. Munir Akram, Pakistan’s envoy to the U.N., questioned the validity of U.S. claims that IS-K is conducting recruitment campaigns in his country. He cited U.N. findings that Afghanistan is 'the main hub for ISIL-K’s recruitment and facilitation' and rejected 'any imputation that there is any such recruitment in Pakistan.' Taliban authorities have not responded to the U.N. assertions but have persistently downplayed IS-K activities in the country, claiming that no foreign terrorist groups operated on Afghan soil. De facto Afghan leaders assert that Taliban counterterrorism forces have nearly eliminated IS-K hideouts, and the group can no longer pose a threat to Afghanistan or other nations from its territory. However, IS-K has routinely conducted and claimed attacks targeting members of the Afghan Shiite community and the Taliban. Last December, an IS-K suicide bomber targeted and killed Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban’s minister of refugees, along with several of his associates inside his ministry in Kabul, the Afghan capital. This marked the most high-profile assassination since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in August 2021, following the withdrawal of NATO troops from the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-raises-alarm-over-rising-is-k-threat-from-afghanistan/7969985.html	2025-02-10T14:59:39-08:00	
ICC opens inquiry into Italy over release of Libyan warlord	THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS — Judges at the International Criminal Court have officially asked Italy on Monday to explain why the country released a Libyan man suspected of torture, murder and rape rather than sending him to The Hague. Italian police arrested Ossama Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, last month but rather than extraditing him to the Netherlands, where the ICC is based, sent him back to Libya aboard an Italian military aircraft. 'The matter of state’s non-compliance with a request of cooperation for arrest and surrender by the court is before the competent chamber,' the court’s spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah said in a statement. Addressing parliament last week, Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio defended the decision to send al-Masri home, claiming the ICC had issued a contradictory and flawed arrest warrant. The court, he said, 'realized that an immense mess was made,' he told lawmakers. Al-Masri was arrested in Turin on the ICC warrant on Jan. 19, the day after he arrived in the country from Germany to watch a soccer match. The Italian government has said Rome’s court of appeals ordered him released on Jan. 21 because of a technical problem in the way that the ICC warrant was transmitted, having initially bypassed the Italian justice ministry. The ICC said it does not comment on national judicial proceedings. Al-Masri’s arrest had posed a dilemma for Italy because it has close ties to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli as well as energy interests in the country. According to the arrest warrant, al-Masri heads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Defense Force, which acts as a military police unit combating high-profile crimes including kidnappings, murders as well as illegal migration. Like many other militias in western Libya, the SDF has been implicated in atrocities in the civil war that followed the overthrow and killing of longtime Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Additionally, any trial in The Hague of al-Masri could bring unwanted attention to Italy’s migration policies and its support of the Libyan coast guard, which it has financed to prevent migrants from leaving. In October, the court unsealed arrest warrants for six men allegedly linked to a brutal Libyan militia blamed for multiple killings and other crimes in a strategically important western town where mass graves were discovered in 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-opens-inquiry-into-italy-over-release-of-libyan-warlord/7969989.html	2025-02-10T14:57:05-08:00	
Trump calls for halting penny production, saying it's too expensive	RICHMOND, VIRGINIA — The lowly penny, the forgotten mainstay of coin jars and car cupholders everywhere, may soon be no more. President Donald Trump announced Sunday he's ordered his administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin, whose buying power is long past its prime. Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost — currently almost 4 cents per penny, according to the U.S. Mint — and limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which costs almost 14 cents to mint. Trump's surprise order comes after decades of unsuccessful efforts to pitch the penny. 'Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny. But sometimes traditions get ridiculous,' the Farmers' Almanac said in its 1989 edition. Here's a look at some questions surrounding Trump's order. Can Trump really order the Treasury to stop minting pennies without Congress' approval? Yes, according to legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe, the Carl M. Loeb University Professor of Constitutional Law Emeritus at Harvard University. U.S. code gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to mint and issue coins 'in amounts the secretary decides are necessary to meet the needs of the United States.' If Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent decides the amount necessary for the penny is zero, he's within his legal rights, Tribe said. 'Unlike a lot of what the new administration has been doing pursuant to the flood of executive orders since January 20, this action seems to me entirely lawful and fully constitutional,' Tribe said, referring to the aggressive executive action Trump's taken on other issues since taking office. Congress, which dictates currency specifications like the size and metal content of coins, could make Trump's order permanent through law. But past congressional efforts to ditch the penny have failed. Pennies are mostly made of zinc, and the American zinc lobby has been a major opponent to suggestions that the penny be eliminated. How many pennies are in circulation? It depends on what you mean by circulation. Pennies are the most popular coin made by the U.S. Mint, which reported making 3.2 billion of them last year. That's more than half of all the new coins it made last year. MIT Professor Jeff Gore, who founded Citizens to Retire the Penny, said coins are supposed to stay in circulation for about 30 years and that in the last three decades the U.S. Mint has made about 250 billion pennies. But, he says, 'because nobody wants to use pennies, they fall out of active circulation much faster than other coins.' If pennies sit in drawer for a decade, Gore asks, 'Does that qualify as being in circulation?' Will Americans miss pennies? Experience in other countries suggests no. Canada started phasing out its penny a dozen years ago and urged store owners to round prices to the nearest nickel for cash transactions. Electronic purchases were still billed to the nearest cent. The move came after New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and others dropped their lowest-denomination coins. After dropping the penny or its equivalent, those countries have not looked back. What comes next? Trump's order, which he announced in a social media post as he was departing New Orleans after watching the first half of the Super Bowl, was the latest in his administration's rapid-fire efforts to cut government costs. 'Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time,' Trump wrote in his post, which was light on details about plans for a post-penny future. After Canada stopped minting new pennies, it began recycling them for their 'valuable' copper and zinc, according to a 2022 report from the Canadian Mint.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-calls-for-halting-penny-production-saying-it-s-too-expensive-/7969975.html	2025-02-10T14:39:24-08:00	
Boston man cleared of US charges he acted as Chinese agent	Boston — A jury found a Boston man not guilty on Monday of U.S. charges that he acted as an unlawful agent of China's government by supplying officials information about individuals, dissidents and groups in the local Chinese community. Litang Liang, 65, was acquitted in federal court of charges that he acted as an unregistered Chinese agent in a case brought in 2023 that U.S. authorities had portrayed as part of their commitment to counter efforts by China's government ato silence its critics abroad. Liang, a China-born U.S. citizen, had denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. His lawyer during the trial called the charges 'ridiculous' and called them an effort to chill the free speech of a local community activist who advocated for the 'reunification' of democratically governed Taiwan with mainland China -- a view in harmony with China's leaders. 'Justice has finally arrived,' Liang told reporters through a translator following the verdict. U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, whose office pursued the case, said in a statement that while prosecutors 'respect the jury's decision, we are disappointed in (Monday's) verdict.' Liang had worked at a hotel and for years had been an active member in his union as well as a community organizer and activist in the Chinese-American community in Boston, according to his lawyer, Derege Demissie. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Kistner told jurors on Friday during closing arguments in the case that China's government sought out Liang because it 'wanted someone already involved in the community who knew the people who were there.' Prosecutors said Liang from 2018 to 2022 provided Chinese officials with information on individuals and shared details about dissidents and groups with pro-Taiwan leanings. Prosecutors said that in 2018, after traveling to Beijing for meetings with an arm of the Chinese Communist Party, Liang founded the New England Alliance for the Peaceful Unification of China, which focused on promoting China's goals with Taiwan. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future. Prosecutors said Liang, also at the direction of Chinese officials, in 2019 organized a counter-demonstration against pro-democracy protesters, and in 2022 provided an official with a Chinese agency, tasked with investigating political dissidents, information on two potential local recruits. Demissie in his closing argument to the jury countered that Liang made no secret of his activism and that his prosecution infringed on Liang's right to free speech under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. 'This case would have meant nothing if it did not involve China,' Demissie said. 'That's what this is about. And it had the purpose of scaring people, and it achieved that purpose.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7969980.html	2025-02-10T14:37:25-08:00	
UN halts aid work in Houthi rebels' stronghold in Yemen after staff detentions	CAIRO — The United Nations said Monday it suspended its humanitarian operations in the stronghold of Yemen’s Houthi rebels after they detained eight more U.N. staffers, affecting the global response to one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. In a statement, the U.N. said the 'extraordinary' decision to pause all operations and programs in northern Saada province was due to the lack of necessary security conditions and guarantees. A spokesperson for the Houthis didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The rebels in recent months have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen’s capital. None of the U.N. staffers have been released. The U.N. statement said the pause in operations is meant to give the Houthis and the world body time to 'arrange the release of arbitrarily detained U.N. personnel and ensure that the necessary conditions are in place to deliver critical humanitarian support' in rebel-held areas. It said the latest detained U.N. staffers — taken late last month — included six working in Saada, on Yemen’s northern border with Saudi Arabia. Seven U.N, agencies operate in Saada, including the World Food Program, the World Health Organization and UNICEF, along with several international aid organizations, according to the U.N. humanitarian agency. The U.N. late last month suspended all travel into Houthi-held areas. The war in Yemen has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians. The Iranian-backed Houthis have been fighting Yemen’s internationally recognized government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they descended from their stronghold in Saada and took control of Sanaa and most of the north. The U.N. had projected that over 19 million people across Yemen will need humanitarian assistance this year as many deal with climate shocks, malnutrition, cholera and the economic effects of war. The rebels have imprisoned thousands of people during the war. In recent months, they also intensified their crackdown on dissent, including recently sentencing 44 people to death. In January, the Houthis unilaterally freed 153 war detainees as one of several overtures to ease tensions after the ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Such prisoner releases have been viewed as a means to jump-start talks over permanently ending Yemen’s war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-halts-aid-work-in-houthi-rebels-stronghold-in-yemen-after-staff-detentions-/7969962.html	2025-02-10T14:26:36-08:00

US judge says Trump administration violated order lifting spending freeze	A U.S. judge on Monday said President Donald Trump's administration violated a court order lifting a broad freeze on federal spending and directed the government to immediately release any withheld funds. U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, had already blocked the funding freeze with a temporary restraining order on Jan. 31, but a group of Democratic state attorneys general who sued to block the move said last week that the government was still withholding funds. The Trump administration on Monday said it is appealing. 'The broad categorical and sweeping freeze of federal funds is, as the court found, likely unconstitutional and has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to a vast portion of this country,' McConnell said on Monday. 'These pauses in funding violate the plain text of the TRO.' McConnell said all funding must be restored at least until he can hold a hearing on the states' motion for a longer-term order. On Feb. 6, a lawyer with the office of Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James told McConnell that state agencies were still having difficulty accessing federal funds, including billions of dollars for infrastructure projects under the Inflation Reduction Act. The Trump administration had told states it believed the order did not apply to certain environmental and infrastructure spending, and that some payments were delayed for 'operational and administrative reasons.' However, McConnell said his order had been 'clear and unambiguous' in applying to all funding frozen in response to sweeping executive orders by Trump. The states originally sued the administration over a memorandum from the White House's Office of Management and Budget announcing a wide-ranging freeze of federal spending. Soon after the lawsuit was filed, OMB rescinded that memo. The memo was part of a larger Trump administration push to tighten federal spending and reshape the federal bureaucracy, which has sparked a flurry of lawsuits. In a separate case over Trump's push to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, federal employee unions have accused the administration of violating a court order reinstating USAID workers who were placed on administrative leave.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-ordered-to-restore-all-frozen-federal-spending/7969952.html	2025-02-10T14:11:17-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: China courts India as Trump, Modi vow to deepen ties	Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the U.S. on Wednesday. President Donald Trump announced Modi's White House visit as India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing, where they agreed to restore bilateral ties and resume direct flights and pilgrimages by Indian pilgrims to a holy site in Tibet. While Modi's government has shifted toward populist policies, China launched an aggressive public relations campaign in 2024 to improve its standing with India. Analysts view China's diplomatic push as a response to the deepening U.S.-India partnership and Beijing's desire to maintain regional influence, particularly given expected tensions with the Trump administration.

However, more and more researchers have begun to question the security of DeepSeek. They worry that the price of DeepSeek's low-cost research and development may be a lack of security, and its security vulnerabilities may be exploited by criminals. It is particularly weak in preventing malicious exploitation, such as being manipulated into providing instructions for creating bioweapons. In addition, studies found that DeepSeek has been extremely careless in protecting and encrypting sensitive user data.

US defense chief headed to Europe for NATO, Ukraine meetings	Pentagon — New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is headed to Europe, his first international trip since taking office last month. Hegseth departed from Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington, early Monday, for stops in Germany, Belgium and Poland. In Germany, the defense secretary is scheduled to visit the headquarters for U.S. European Command, and U.S. Africa Command, getting updates on developments in both regions. From Germany, Hegseth will travel to Brussels for the NATO Defense Ministerial and a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday and Thursday. U.S. defense officials say Hegseth is expected to press U.S. allies in Europe to increase their defense spending and take more of a leadership role for challenges facing Europe. He is also expected to echo U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for a diplomatic end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is about to enter its third year. The meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — a group of almost 50 countries who have pledged to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia — is the first to take place during the new Trump administration and will be the first led by a country other than the U.S. This week’s meeting, the 26th, will be led by Britain. Britain’s Defense Ministry, in a statement Thursday said the meeting will focus on 'priorities for Ukraine as the international community continues to work together to support Ukraine in its fight against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion.' The Pentagon, in a statement previewing Hegseth’s participation in the meeting, said in addition to emphasizing Trump’s push for a diplomatic resolution to the war, the secretary, 'will also highlight the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to Ukraine.' Following the meetings in Brussels, Hegseth is scheduled to travel to Poland to meet with leaders there and visit with U.S. troops. Of note, the U.S. defense secretary said he is skipping the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, which bills itself as 'the world's leading forum for debating international security policy,' which gets underway Friday. 'We're not going to the Munich Security Conference,' Hegseth told defense officials and troops at a town hall meeting last Friday at the Pentagon. 'We're instead going to Poland to see the troops out there and we're going to Germany to see EUCOM and AFRICOM,' he said. 'I would much rather talk to troops than go to cocktail parties. That's my job.' Instead, the U.S. is set to be represented in Munich by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-defense-chief-headed-to-europe-for-nato-ukraine-meetings/7969820.html	2025-02-10T12:12:04-08:00

51 dead in Guatemala after bus plunges off bridge	Guatemala City — At least 51 people are dead after their bus plunged off a bridge Monday on the outskirts of Guatemala’s capital, said Hector Flores, who was helping coordinate the municipal government's response. Firefighting spokesperson Edwin Villagran said a multi-vehicle crash sent the bus off the bridge before dawn, trapping survivors. Many of the victims pulled from the wreckage were seriously injured. Volunteer firefighting spokesman Oscar Sanchez said children were among the victims. The densely packed bus had come from Progreso department, northeast of the capital on a busy route into the city when it plunged from Puente Belice, a highway bridge that crosses over a road and creek. The bus fell 35 meters into a sewage-polluted stream. It landed upside down and half-submerged in water. Guatemala City fire department spokesperson, Carlos Hernandez, said the bodies of 36 men and 15 women had been sent to a provincial morgue set up for the accident. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo declared three days of national mourning and deployed the country's army and disaster agency to assist response efforts. 'I stand in solidarity with the families of the victims who today woke up to heartbreaking news. Their pain is my pain,' Arevalo said on social media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guatemala-bus-accident/7969667.html	2025-02-10T10:58:06-08:00	
Space telescope spots rare 'Einstein ring' of light	CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA — Europe's Euclid space telescope has detected a rare halo of bright light around a nearby galaxy, astronomers reported Monday. The halo, known as an Einstein ring, encircles a galaxy 590 million light-years away, considered close by cosmic standards. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. Astronomers have known about this galaxy for more than a century and so were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring, reported in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. An Einstein ring is light from a much more distant galaxy that bends in such a way as to perfectly encircle a closer object, in this case a well-known galaxy in the constellation Draco. The faraway galaxy creating the ring is more than 4 billion light-years away. Gravity distorted the light from this more distant galaxy, thus the name honoring Albert Einstein. The process is known as gravitational lensing. 'All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically. This one is particularly special, because it's so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful,' lead author Conor O'Riordan of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said in a statement. Euclid rocketed from Florida in 2023. NASA is taking part in its mission to detect dark energy and dark matter in the universe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/space-telescope-spots-rare-einstein-ring-of-light/7969600.html	2025-02-10T09:57:56-08:00	
Opening statements begin in trial of man accused of trying to kill Salman Rushdie	Mayville, New York — Lawyers began delivering opening statements Monday at the trial of the man charged with trying to fatally stab author Salman Rushdie in front of a lecture audience in western New York. Rushdie, 77, is expected to testify during the trial of Hadi Matar, bringing the writer face-to-face with his knife-wielding attacker for the first time in more than two years. Rushdie, the Booker Prize-winning author, had been about to speak about keeping writers safe from harm in August 2022 when Matar ran toward him on the stage at the Chautauqua Institution Amphitheater. Matar stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times in the neck, stomach, chest, hand and right eye, leaving him partially blind and with permanent damage to one hand. The Indian-born British-American author detailed the attack and his long, painful recovery in a memoir, 'Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder,' released last year. Rushdie had worried for his safety since his 1989 novel 'The Satanic Verses' was denounced as blasphemous by many Muslims and led to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death. Rushdie spent years in hiding, but had traveled freely over the past quarter century after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree. The trial is taking place as the 36th anniversary of the fatwa — Feb. 14, 1989 — approaches. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, is charged with attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty. A jury was selected last week. Matar was in court throughout the three-day process, taking notes and consulting with his attorneys. He calmly said, 'Free Palestine' while being led in to court Monday past members of the media taking photographs and video. Matar's defense faced a challenging start after it was announced that his lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness and would not attend the start of the trial. Judge David Foley refused a defense request to postpone opening statements, instead instructing an associate of Barone to deliver the defense's opening statement in his place. Once testimony is underway, the trial is expected to last a week to 10 days. Jurors will be shown video and photos from the day of the attack, which ended when onlookers rushed Matar and held him until police arrived. The event's moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded. Matar told investigators he traveled by bus to Chautauqua, about 120 kilometers south of Buffalo. He is believed to have slept in the grounds of the arts and academic retreat the night before the attack. Matar's attorney has not indicated what his defense will be. In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization's endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death. A later trial on the federal charges — terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization — will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo. Rushdie has been one of the world's most celebrated authors since the 1981 publication of 'Midnight's Children,' winner of the Booker Prize. His other works include the novels 'Shame' and 'Victory City,' which he had completed shortly before the 2022 stabbing, and the 2012 memoir 'Joseph Anton,' in which he wrote about his time in hiding. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group's then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opening-statements-begin-in-trial-of-man-accused-of-trying-to-kill-salman-rushdie/7969468.html	2025-02-10T07:44:47-08:00	
Third federal judge blocks Trump's birthright citizenship order	Concord, New Hampshire — A third federal judge on Monday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New Hampshire comes after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and Maryland last week. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that Trump's order violates the Constitution and 'attempts to upend one of the most fundamental American constitutional values.' Trump's Republican administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States and therefore are not entitled to citizenship. The administration is appealing the Seattle judge's block on Trump's executive order. At the heart of the lawsuits in the three cases is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man, wasn't a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed. In 1898, in a case known as United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the U.S. Supreme Court found the only children who did not automatically receive U.S. citizenship upon being born on U.S. soil were children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli, or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas and Canada and Mexico are among them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/third-federal-judge-blocks-trump-s-birthright-citizenship-order/7969406.html	2025-02-10T07:08:58-08:00	
Romanian President Iohannis announces resignation after pressure by populists	Bucharest, Romania — Romanian President Klaus Iohannis announced his resignation on Monday following mounting pressure from populist opposition groups, two months after a top court annulled a presidential election in the European Union country. 'To spare Romania from this crisis, I am resigning as president of Romania,' he said in an emotional address, adding that he will leave office on Feb. 12. Iohannis, 65, held the presidential role since 2014 and served the maximum of two five-year terms. But his presidency was extended in December after the Constitutional Court canceled the presidential race two days before a Dec. 8 runoff. That came after the far-right populist Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round, after which allegations emerged of Russian interference and electoral violations. Several opposition parties, including the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR), the nationalist SOS party and the Party of Young People — but also some members of the reformist Save Romania Union party — sought Iohannis' ouster through a motion filed to Parliament. Some lawmakers from the governing coalition were also expected to vote in favor. 'This is a useless endeavor because, in any case, I will leave office in a few months after the election of the new president,' Iohannis said. 'It is an unfounded move because I have never — I repeat, never — violated the constitution. And it is a harmful endeavor because ... everyone loses, and no one gains.' He added that the consequences of his ouster would be 'long-lasting and highly negative' for Romania, an EU member since 2007, and a NATO member since 2004. 'None of our partners will understand why Romania is dismissing its president when the process for electing a new president has already begun,' he said. New dates have been set to rerun the presidential vote with the first round scheduled for May 4. If no candidate obtains more than 50% of the ballot, a runoff would be held two weeks later, on May 18. It is not yet clear whether Georgescu will be able to participate in the new election. After his resignation announcement, clashes broke out between Georgescu supporters and police in front of the government building in the capital, Bucharest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-president-iohannis-announces-resignation-after-pressure-by-populists/7969345.html	2025-02-10T06:33:36-08:00	
Kosovo prime minister looking for allies for new Cabinet after failing to win parliament majority	PRISTINA, Kosovo — Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti’s leftwing party won most seats in the weekend parliamentary election but was left without a majority in the house, forcing it to look for an ally to form the next government, according to preliminary results released Monday. The vote on Sunday was key in determining who will lead Kosovo as talks on normalizing ties with rival Serbia remain stalled and foreign funding for one of Europe’s poorest countries is in question. The election marked the first time since independence in 2008 that Kosovo’s parliament completed a full four-year mandate. It was the ninth parliamentary vote in Kosovo since the end of the 1998-1999 war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists that pushed Serbian forces out following a 78-day NATO air campaign. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo’s independence. With 88% of the votes counted, Kurti’s Self-Determination Movement Party, or Vetevendosje!, had won 41.3%, according to the Central Election Commission, the election governing body. The Democratic Party of Kosovo, or PDK, whose main leaders are detained at a Netherlands-based international criminal tribunal in The Hague and accused of war crimes, won 21.8% of the vote. Next, with 17.8% support is the Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, the oldest party in the country. The LDK lost much of its support after the death in 2006 of its leader, Ibrahim Rugova. The Alliance for Kosovo’s Future of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj garnered 7.7% of the votes. Still, Kurti was upbeat, though his remarks gave nothing away about who he plans to ask to join his coalition government. 'The people won. Vetevendosje! won. We are the winners who will form the next Cabinet,' Kurti told journalists as his supporters took to the streets to celebrate. The commission’s webpage was down temporarily on Sunday as it was overloaded 'due to the citizens’ high interest to learn the results,' election body said. Results were collected manually. A preliminary turnout after 92% of the votes counted was 40.6% — about 7% lower than four years ago. The new 120-seat parliament reserves 20 seats for minorities regardless of election results, 10 of them for the Serb minority. Kurti’s new term will face multiple challenges after Washington recently announced it was freezing foreign aid and the European Union, almost two years ago, suspended funding for some projects and initiatives. He also is under pressure to increase public salaries and pensions, improve education and health services, and fight poverty. Kosovo, with a population of 1.6 million, is one of the poorest countries in Europe with an annual gross domestic product of less than $6,000 per person. Kurti also is likely to try and repair ties with Western powers, at odds since his Cabinet took several steps that raised tensions with Serbia and Kosovo's ethnic Serbs, including the ban on the use of the Serbian currency, the dinar, and dinar transfers to Kosovo's Serbs. Kosovo’s ethnic Serb minority depends on Belgrade’s social services and payments. The United States, the European Union and the NATO-led stabilization force in Kosovo, or KFOR, have urged the government in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, to refrain from unilateral actions, fearing the revival of inter-ethnic conflict. In Sunday's election, Srpska Lista, the main party of the ethnic Serb minority, won 2.8% of the vote — just over half of its winnings four years ago. The party's leader, Zlatan Elek, said it was 'the absolute winner of this election,' and thanked Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic for the 'strong support for our people.' KFOR had increased its presence in Kosovo after last year’s tensions with Serbia, as well as ahead of the election. A team of 104 observers from the EU, 18 from the Council of Europe and about 1,600 others from international or local organizations, monitored the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kosovo-prime-minister-looking-for-allies-for-a-new-cabinet-after-failing-to-win-parliament-majority-/7969195.html	2025-02-10T03:38:05-08:00	
Russia drone attacks spark fire, damage homes	Russian drone attacks caused a fire in Kyiv, injured a woman in Sumy and damaged several homes, according to Ukrainian officials. Meanwhile, the Russian military reported downing 15 Ukrainian drones overnight, including seven in the Krasnodar region. Nobody was hurt as a result of the fire in Kyiv, which was sparked in a non-residential building, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Five houses were damaged and a woman was reportedly injured in the northeastern city of Sumy, regional governor Ihor Kalchenko said on Telegram. While fighting continued, a group of U.S. officials from President Donald Trump's administration were set to travel to Europe this week for discussions that would include the war in Ukraine. Vice President JD Vance was scheduled to attend an artificial intelligence summit in France before attending the Munich Security Conference with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Munich event, billed as 'the world's leading forum for debating international security policy,' is expected to focus on prospects for peace in Ukraine as well as discussions of other global conflicts. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will visit the headquarters of two military commands, then meet with NATO defense ministers. He’ll also attend a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, where he 'will reiterate President Trump's commitment for a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine as quickly as possible,' according to the Pentagon. Material from Reuters and Agence France-Presse was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-drone-attacks-spark-fire-damage-homes/7969133.html	2025-02-10T02:54:44-08:00	
High-stakes AI summit in Paris: World leaders, tech titans and challenging diplomatic talks	PARIS — Major world leaders are meeting for an AI summit in Paris, where challenging diplomatic talks are expected as tech titans fight for dominance in the fast-moving technology industry. Heads of state, top government officials, CEOs and scientists from around 100 countries are participating in the two-day international summit from Monday. High-profile attendees include U.S. Vice President JD Vance, on his first overseas trip since taking office, and Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing. 'We’re living a technology and scientific revolution we’ve rarely seen,' French President Emmanuel Macron said Sunday on national television France 2. France and Europe must seize the 'opportunity' because AI 'will enable us to live better, learn better, work better, care better and it’s up to us to put this artificial intelligence at the service of human beings,' he said. Vance's debut abroad The summit will give some European leaders a chance to meet Vance for the first time. The 40-year-old vice president was just 18 months into his time as Ohio’s junior senator when Donald Trump picked him as his running mate. Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children — Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel — for the trip to Europe. They were greeted on French soil Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy’s charge d’affaires, David McCawley. On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the menu. Vance, like President Donald Trump, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office. Vance will attend later this week the Munich Security Conference, where he may meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Leaders in Europe have been watching carefully Trump’s recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends — an idea that’s been flatly rejected by Arab allies. Fostering AI advances The summit, which gathers major players such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, aims at fostering AI advances in sectors like health, education, environment and culture. A global public-private partnership named 'Current AI' is to be launched to support large-scale initiatives that serve the general interest. The Paris summit 'is the first time we’ll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,' said Linda Griffin, vice president of public policy at Mozilla. 'I see it as a norm-setting moment.' Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, noted an opportunity to shape AI governance in a new direction by 'moving away from this concentration of power amongst a handful of private actors and building this public interest AI instead.' However, it remains unclear if the U.S. will support such initiatives. French organizers also hope the summit will lead to major investment announcements in Europe. France is to announce AI private investments worth a total of $113 billion over the coming years, Macron said, presenting it as 'the equivalent' of Trump's Stargate AI data centers project. Indian PM co-hosting the summit India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is co-hosting the summit with Macron, in an effort to involve more global actors in AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a U.S.-China battle. India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid 'perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world.' Macron will also travel Wednesday with Modi to the southern city port of Marseille to inaugurate a new Indian consulate and visit the ITER nuclear research site. France has become a key defense partner for India, with talks underway on purchasing 26 Rafale fighter jets and three Scorpene submarines. Officials in New Delhi said discussions are in final phase and the deal could be inked in a few weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/high-stakes-ai-summit-in-paris-world-leaders-tech-titans-and-challenging-diplomatic-talks-/7969168.html	2025-02-10T02:49:06-08:00	
China hopes the aging Dalai Lama can 'return to right path'	BEIJING — China hopes the Dalai Lama can 'return to the right path' and is open to discussions about the Nobel Peace laureate's future, as long as certain conditions are met, the foreign ministry said on Monday. The exiled leader of Tibetan Buddhism, who turns 90 this year, fled Tibet in 1959 for India after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, but has expressed a desire to return to Tibet before he dies. China is open to talks about the future of the Dalai Lama if he abandons his position of splitting the 'motherland,' a foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told a regular press conference. Guo was responding to a request for comment on the death of the spiritual leader's elder brother Gyalo Thondup, who had previously acted as his unofficial envoy in talks with Chinese officials. Gyalo Thondup died on Sunday, aged 97, in his home in the Indian town of Kalimpong. The Dalai Lama needs to openly recognize that Tibet and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China, whose sole legal government is that of the People's Republic of China, Guo said, using the country's official name. The Dalai Lama stepped down in 2011 as the political leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, which Beijing does not recognize. Official talks with his representatives have stalled since. As the Dalai Lama ages, the question of his successor has also become increasingly urgent. China insists it will choose his successor as Tibet's spiritual leader. But the Dalai Lama says he will clarify questions about the succession, such as if and where he will be reincarnated, in line with Tibetan Buddhist belief, around the time of his 90th birthday in July. A new book by the Dalai Lama, due out in March to coincide with the anniversary of the uprising, is expected to outline a framework for the future of Tibet 'even after I am gone,' he has said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-hopes-the-aging-dalai-lama-can-return-to-right-path-/7969144.html	2025-02-10T01:56:36-08:00	
Almost all nations miss UN deadline for new climate targets	PARIS — Nearly all nations missed a UN deadline Monday to submit new targets for slashing carbon emissions, including major economies under pressure to show leadership following the U.S. retreat on climate change. Just 10 of nearly 200 countries required under the Paris Agreement to deliver fresh climate plans by Feb. 10 did so on time, according to a UN database tracking the submissions. Under the climate accord, each country is supposed to provide a steeper headline figure for cutting heat-trapping emissions by 2035, and a detailed blueprint for how to achieve this. Global emissions have been rising but need to almost halve by the end of the decade to limit global warming to levels agreed under the Paris deal. UN climate chief Simon Stiell has called this latest round of national pledges 'the most important policy documents of this century.' Yet just a handful of major polluters handed in upgraded targets on time, with China, India and the European Union the biggest names on a lengthy absentee list. Most G20 economies were missing in action with the United States, Britain and Brazil -- which is hosting this year's UN climate summit -- the only exceptions. The US pledge is largely symbolic, made before President Donald Trump ordered Washington out of the Paris deal. Accountability measure There is no penalty for submitting late targets, formally titled nationally determined contributions (NDCs). They are not legally binding but act as an accountability measure to ensure governments are taking the threat of climate change seriously. Last week, Stiell said submissions would be needed by September so they could be properly assessed before the UN COP30 climate conference in November. A spokeswoman for the EU said the 27-nation bloc intended to submit its revised targets 'well ahead' of the summit in Belem. Analysts say China, the world's biggest polluter and also its largest investor in renewable energy, is also expected to unveil its much-anticipated climate plan in the second half of the year. The United Arab Emirates, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, New Zealand, Andorra, Switzerland and Uruguay rounded out the list of countries that made Monday's cut-off. The sluggish response will not ease fears of a possible backslide on climate action as leaders juggle Trump's return and other competing priorities from budget and security crises to electoral pressure. Ebony Holland from the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development said the US retreat was 'clearly a setback' but there were many reasons for the tepid turnout. 'It's clear there are some broad geopolitical shifts underway that are proving to be a challenge when it comes to international cooperation, especially on big issues like climate change,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/almost-all-nations-miss-un-deadline-for-new-climate-targets/7969128.html	2025-02-10T01:17:33-08:00	
Indonesia launches $183 million free health screening to prevent early deaths	JAKARTA — Indonesia launched an annual free health screening on Monday, a $183 million initiative to prevent early deaths that the country's health ministry said was its biggest ever undertaking. Under the program, all Indonesians will eventually be entitled to a free screening on their birthday, the ministry said. The screening, which is not mandatory, includes blood pressure, tests to determine the risk of heart problems or stroke, and eye tests, the ministry said. The program is initially targeting children under 6 and adults aged 18 and over, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin told Reuters last week. The leading causes of death in the world's fourth most populous nation include stroke, heart disease, and tuberculosis, data from the World Health Organization shows. Budi said the $184 million allocation for the program was about $62 million less than originally planned after President Prabowo Subianto ordered budget cuts to help fund election promises, including giving free meals to school children. At a health center in Jakarta on Monday, about 30 people had signed up for the screening on the first day. Teacher Ramika Dewi Saragih said she underwent checks on her breasts, cervix, eyes, and more and was not apprehensive. 'I was really looking forward to this,' the 33-year-old said, adding that more people should take up the opportunity. A health ministry spokesperson said the target for the checks this year was 100 million people. Budi said the program was intended to promote preventive care as Indonesians tended to check for illnesses only when they already had them. 'Our culture is checking when we're already sick ... that cuts closest to the grave,' he said. He said the program was the biggest the ministry had ever undertaken, surpassing COVID-19 vaccinations. Budi added the screening, which is to be rolled out at more than 20,000 health centers and clinics, also includes mental health tests to determine signs of depression or anxiety. Researchers at the University of Indonesia's Economic and Social Research Institute warned the program could risk burdening the country's already-strained local health centers, citing uneven distribution of drugs or doctors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-launches-183-million-free-health-screening-to-prevent-early-deaths/7969114.html	2025-02-10T00:08:10-08:00	
Chinese marriages slid by a fifth in 2024, fanning birthrate concerns	HONG KONG — Marriages in China dropped by a fifth last year, the biggest drop on record, despite manifold efforts by authorities to encourage young couples to wed and have children to boost the country's declining population. More than 6.1 million couples registered for marriage last year, down from 7.68 million a year earlier, figures from the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed. Declining interest in getting married and starting a family has long been blamed on the high cost of childcare and education in China. On top of that, sputtering economic growth over the past few years has made it difficult for university graduates to find work and those that do have jobs feel insecure about their long-term prospects. But for Chinese authorities, boosting interest in marriage and baby-making is a pressing concern. China has the second-biggest population in the world at 1.4 billion but it is aging quickly. The birth rate fell for decades due to China's 1980-2015 one-child policy and rapid urbanization. And in the coming decade, roughly 300 million Chinese - the equivalent of almost the entire U.S. population - are expected to enter retirement. Measures taken last year by authorities to tackle the problem included urging China's colleges and universities to provide 'love education' to emphasize positive views on marriage, love, fertility and family. And in November, China's state council or cabinet, told local governments to direct resources towards fixing China's population crisis and spread respect for childbearing and marriages 'at the right age.' Last year saw a slight rise in births after a lull due to the pandemic and because 2024 was the Chinese zodiac year of the dragon - with children born that year considered likely to be ambitious and have great fortune. But even with the increase in births, the country's population fell for a third consecutive year. The data also showed that more than 2.6 million couples filed for divorce last year, up 1.1% from 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-marriages-slid-by-a-fifth-in-2024-fanning-birthrate-concerns/7969113.html	2025-02-10T00:05:37-08:00	
UK Anglicans meet after Church of England hit by scandals	LONDON — The Church of England's elected governing body will gather Monday at a time of 'unprecedented crisis' following a number of sexual abuse scandals. The meeting of the General Synod will see members debate the Makin Review, a damning report which set out a series of failings around a Christian camp leader and serial abuser, John Smyth. On Tuesday, a debate on a new way to handle safeguarding will also be held. The meeting comes a month after the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby stepped down as head of the world's Anglicans over failures in the Church of England's handling of the Smyth case. 'There's never been anything like this in our lifetime, because the Church is in an unprecedented crisis,' Synod member Ian Paul told the domestic PA news agency. Paul said 'the crisis we're facing now is a result of gradual erosion over years of trust and confidence and lack of openness, lack of transparency. 'And suddenly the rafters, the rotten rafters, break, the roof collapses.' Paul was one of the people behind a petition last year calling on Welby to resign. Welby announced his resignation in November after an independent probe found that he 'could and should' have formally reported decades of abuse by Church-linked lawyer Smyth to authorities in 2013. 'Prolific' abuser' Smyth, who organized evangelical summer camps in the 1970s and 1980s, was responsible for 'prolific, brutal and horrific' abuse of up to 130 boys and young men, according to the independent Makin Review. It concluded the Church of England -- the mother church of Anglicanism -- covered up the 'traumatic physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual attacks,' which occurred in Britain, Zimbabwe and South Africa over several decades. Stephen Cottrell, who became Archbishop of York in 2020, has temporarily replaced Welby while also tainted by scandal himself. In December, the 66-year-old faced calls to stand down over claims he mishandled a sexual abuse case during his time as the Bishop of Chelmsford, in southeastern England. Priest David Tudor remained in his post despite Cottrell knowing that the Church had banned him from being alone with children and had paid compensation to a sexual abuse claimant, the BBC reported. Cottrell has said he is 'deeply sorry that we were not able to take action earlier' but defended his actions. In a fresh blow last month, the Bishop of Liverpool, John Perumbalath, said he was stepping down after a broadcaster aired allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. Perumbalath denied wrongdoing but said in a statement a 'rush to judgment and my trial by media... has made my position untenable'. He said a church safeguarding team had investigated the allegations and had found them 'unsubstantiated' and the first allegation was investigated by the police who decided to take no further action. Ahead of the synod meeting, Andrew Graystone, an advocate for abuse survivors, called on church leaders at the four-day meeting in London to show 'radical humility.' 'No one wants another hand-wringing apology; no one wants another 'lessons learned' review; no one wants another reminder of how hard it is to be a bishop. 'We don’t want any more words at all. Instead, we want radical humility from the Archbishop (Cottrell) downwards.' The Anglican Church is the established state church in England and dates back to King Henry VIII's split from the Roman Catholic Church in the 1530s. King Charles III, its supreme governor, appoints archbishops on the advice of the prime minister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-anglicans-meet-after-church-of-england-hit-by-scandals/7969111.html	2025-02-10T00:02:08-08:00	
Ecuador's conservative incumbent and a leftist lawyer advance to presidential runoff	GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador — Ecuador will choose its next president in a runoff election after conservative incumbent Daniel Noboa and leftist lawyer Luisa González garnered enough votes Sunday to beat 14 other candidates. The contest, set for April 13, will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency. Noboa and González are now vying for a full four-year term, promising voters to reduce the widespread criminal activity that upended their lives four years ago. The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses were a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years could turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserved more time in office. Noboa, an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, and González, the protégée of Ecuador's most influential president this century, were the clear front-runners ahead of the election. Figures released by Ecuador's National Electoral Council showed that with 80% of ballots tallied, Noboa received more than 3.71 million votes, or 44.43%, while González earned over 3.69 million votes, or 44.17%. The 14 other candidates in the race were far behind them. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. Electoral authorities reported that more than 83% of the roughly 13.7 million eligible voters cast ballots. Crime, gangs and extortion Under Noboa's watch, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023 to 38.76 per 100,000 people last year. Still, it remained far higher than the 6.85 per 100,000 people in 2019, and other crimes, such as kidnapping and extortion, have skyrocketed, making people fearful of leaving their homes. 'For me, this president is disastrous,' said Marta Barres, 35, who went to the voting center with her three teenage children. 'Can he change things in four more years? No. He hasn't done anything.' Barres, who must pay $25 a month to a local gang to avoid harassment or worse, said she supported González because she believes she can reduce crime across the board and improve the economy. Noboa defeated González in the October 2023 runoff of a snap election that was triggered by the decision of then-President Guillermo Lasso to dissolve the National Assembly and shorten his own mandate as a result. Noboa and González, a mentee of former President Rafael Correa, had only served short stints as lawmakers before launching their presidential campaigns that year. To win outright Sunday, a candidate needed 50% of the vote or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the closest challenger. More than 100,000 police officers and members of the military were deployed across the country to safeguard the election, including at voting centers. At least 50 officers accompanied Noboa, his wife and their 2-year-old son to a voting center where the president cast his ballot in the small Pacific coast community of Olón. Testing the limits of laws and norms of governing Noboa, 37, opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father's Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission. As president over the past 15 months, some of his mano dura, or heavy-handed, tactics to reduce crime have come under scrutiny inside and outside the country for testing the limits of laws and norms of governing. His questioned tactics include the state of internal armed conflict he declared in January 2024 in order to mobilize the military in places where organized crime has taken hold, as well as last year's approval of a police raid on Mexico's embassy in the capital, Quito, to arrest former Vice President Jorge Glas, a convicted criminal and fugitive who had been living there for months. His head-on approach, however, is also earning him votes. 'Noboa is the only person hitting organized crime hard,' retiree German Rizzo, who voted to get the president reelected, said outside a polling station in Samborondón, an upper-class area with gated communities separated from the port city of Guayaquil by a river. 'Things are not going to change' González, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. He was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal. González was a lawmaker from 2021 until May 2023, when Lasso dissolved the National Assembly. She was unknown to most voters until Correa's party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election. Quito's University of the Americas professor Maria Cristina Bayas said Sunday's result was 'a triumph' for Correa's party because pre-election polls projected a wider difference between Noboa and González. Esteban Ron, dean of the Faculty of Social and Legal Sciences at the International University SEK in Quito, said Noboa will be forced to reengineer his campaign at the risk that he may have already reached his vote ceiling. Ron attributed the outcome to the problems Noboa faced during his administration. Waiting for her turn to vote in Guayaquil, architecture student Keila Torres said she had not yet decided who to vote for. None, she said, will be able to lower crime across Ecuador due to deep-rooted government corruption. 'If I could, I wouldn't be here,' said Torres, who witnessed three robberies in public buses over the past four years and barely escaped a carjacking in December. 'Things are not going to change.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-s-conservative-incumbent-and-a-leftist-lawyer-advance-to-presidential-runoff/7969082.html	2025-02-09T22:00:24-08:00	
Chile issues evacuation alerts as wildfires rage in the country's south	SANTIAGO, Chile — Chilean authorities on Sunday issued two evacuation alerts for the southern region of La Araucanía as wildfires raged. At least one person has died. The country's government said the move aims to protect more than 860,000 people. Chile's government ordered the evacuation in regions of imminent risk, urging residents to leave their homes and seek refuge in safe areas. It did not provide figures on damage or number of people evacuated following a request from The Associated Press. Authorities confirmed the death of an 84-year-old woman who had been evacuated but eventually returned home. La Araucanía, south of capital Santiago, has faced a wave of forest fires that have spread rapidly due to high temperatures, strong winds and drought. Authorities issued a red alert in several parts of the region as firefighting teams fight against the flames. Chile's President Gabriel Boric, who ordered a curfew in affected regions on Saturday, said recently some fires are 'deliberate' and urged an investigation. Police arrested five people this weekend in connection with the case. Wildfires have recently devastated 33,406 hectares in Chile, 44% less than last year, authorities said. Much of those blazes are in La Araucanía. Temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) this weekend boosted the wildfires in the region. Dozens of people were killed last year and over 1,000 homes were destroyed due to forest fires in the Valparaiso region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chile-issues-evacuation-alerts-as-wildfires-rage-in-the-country-s-south/7969076.html	2025-02-09T21:46:26-08:00	
Colombia government in crisis after president calls for Cabinet resignations	Bogota, Colombia — Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Sunday called for his ministers and other senior officials to step down, as tensions soared in the government days after he lambasted his team on live television. The demand came after Petro on Tuesday subjected his Cabinet to a five-hour public dressing down on state TV, accusing several officials, including his trade, education and health ministers, of falling behind on the delivery of key projects. 'I have requested the resignation of ministers and directors of administrative departments,' Petro posted on social media platform X. 'There will be some changes in the Cabinet to achieve greater compliance with the program ordered by the people.' Earlier Sunday, Colombia's environment minister Susana Muhamad became the second Cabinet member in a week to step down after the contentious meeting, in which Petro said the government had been underperforming. Several ministers have complained about the presence at the meeting of Armando Benedetti, one of Petro's closest aides, who is being investigated over illegal campaign financing during the president's 2022 election race and who has been accused by his ex-wife of domestic abuse. They also expressed disapproval of the appointment as foreign minister of Laura Sarabia, Petro's scandal-hit former chief of staff, who has had a meteoric rise within the government. She was implicated in an investigation into the largest corruption scandal in the government and was involved in a case of alleged illegal wiretapping against her nanny. The day after the Cabinet meeting, culture minister Juan David Correa resigned, as did Jorge Rojas, the head of the state agency DAPRE, which manages large amounts of state funds. Muhamad, who hosted last year's UN COP16 conference on biodiversity in the city of Cali and was generally viewed as a capable pair of hands in the erratic Petro's left-wing government, was one of the few to earn the president's praise during the meeting. Muhamad told the online channel Los Danieles that her decision to quit was 'difficult' and said it was motivated by Benedetti's involvement in the running of the state. During Tuesday's meeting she had complained 'as a feminist and a woman' against his presence. Muhamad has been one of the stars of Petro's administration at a time when he is seeking to claim a leading role in global climate diplomacy. She had been touted as a possible candidate to succeed the highly unpopular Petro, Colombia's first-ever leftist president, when his term ends in 2026. The political shake-up also comes just weeks after some ministers took office, including Sarabia, and the ministers for finance, information and transport.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-government-in-crisis-after-president-calls-for-cabinet-resignations/7969075.html	2025-02-09T21:44:26-08:00	
Court grants request to block detained Venezuelan immigrants from being sent to Guantanamo	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — A federal court on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending three Venezuelan immigrants held in New Mexico to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba as part of the president's immigration crackdown. In a legal filing earlier in the day, lawyers for the men said the detainees 'fit the profile of those the administration has prioritized for detention in Guantanamo, i.e. Venezuelan men detained in the El Paso area with (false) charges of connections with the Tren de Aragua gang.' It asked a U.S. District Court in New Mexico for a temporary restraining order blocking their transfer, adding that 'the mere uncertainty the government has created surrounding the availability of legal process and counsel access is sufficient to authorize the modest injunction.' During a brief hearing, Judge Kenneth J. Gonzales granted the temporary order, which was opposed by the government, said Jessica Vosburgh, an attorney for the three men. 'It's short term. This will get revisited and further fleshed out in the weeks to come,' Vosburgh told The Associated Press. A message seeking comment was left for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. The filing came as part of a lawsuit on behalf of the three men filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, and Las Americas Immigrant Advisory Center. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a lawless prison in the central Venezuelan state of Aragua more than a decade ago and has expanded in recent years as millions of desperate Venezuelans fled President President Nicolás Maduro 's rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that flights of detainees had landed at Guantanamo. Immigrant rights groups sent a letter Friday demanding access to people who have been sent there, saying the base should not be used as a 'legal black hole.' White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that more than 8,000 people have been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. Trump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million people in the U.S. illegally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/court-grants-request-to-block-detained-venezuelan-immigrants-from-being-sent-to-guantanamo/7969074.html	2025-02-09T21:34:16-08:00	
Philadelphia defeats Kansas City in Super Bowl	The Philadelphia Eagles dominated the Kansas City Chief in this year’s Super Bowl, defeating the reigning champions by a score of 40-22. The Chiefs had been slightly favored to win the game, going into the American football showdown with hopes of winning their third consecutive National Football League title. But the Eagles held the Chiefs scoreless until late in the third quarter. By that time, the Philadelphia team already had 34 points on the board at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was named the game’s MVP. President Donald Trump attended the matchup, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. Before the game, the president issued a press release stating that 'football is America’s most popular sport—for good reason—it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities.' 'This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom heroically defended by our military service members, law enforcement officers, and first responders,' he noted. The Super Bowl was estimated to attract more than 120 million viewers, with 30-second advertisements costing a record $8 million. Before the kickoff, a ceremony honored those killed and wounded in a truck-ramming New Year’s Day terror attack in New Orleans on Bourbon Street, as well as first responders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philadelphia-defeats-kansas-city-in-super-bowl/7969042.html	2025-02-09T19:46:37-08:00

Anora' wins at Producers and Directors Guild Awards	Did a wide-open Oscar race just get a front runner? Sean Baker's Brooklyn comedy 'Anora' took top honors at both the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night, catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely watched Academy Awards precursors. Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged 'Anora' as the front runner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. But after several films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden Globe winners 'The Brutalist' and 'Emilia Perez,' 'Anora' reemerged in a big way over the weekend. Baker's film also won best picture at the Critics Choice Awards on Friday. Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The PGA's top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times. The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees. The guild also named RaMell Ross' 'Nickel Boys' best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut. Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard's 'Emilia Perez' is the lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy. Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation's 'The Wild Robot' cleaned up with nine awards including best film. 'The Wild Robot' will be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy Awards.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anora-wins-at-producers-and-directors-guild-awards/7968987.html	2025-02-09T16:17:58-08:00	
Super Bowl commercials rely on comedy, nostalgia to avoid potential missteps	Most of the commercials airing during this year’s Super Bowl are going for laughs, with advertisers betting that America could use a little break. As the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs hit the field in New Orleans, a parade of silly ads will hit airwaves Sunday. Many companies put their ads online ahead of the game, but some held out to maintain an element of surprise. Humor dominates in the ads released so far. Four old ladies go on a joy ride with WeatherTech, while Eugene Levy's eyebrows fly off and buzz around after he eats some Little Caesars. Sloths have a case of the Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. A man's tongue starts dancing to celebrate cold foam from Nestlé Coffee Mate. British singer Seal becomes an actual seal, sad that he can't hold Mountain Dew with his flippers. Actor Glenn Powell does a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while comedian Nate Bargatze clones himself and hires an opera singer because he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey takes a lighthearted stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise take a slow cruise in a convertible so they can enjoy Häagen-Dazs ice cream bars. Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for advertisers. Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials features a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire. 'That’s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,' Calkins said. 'Safe advertising isn’t the advertising you notice or remember.' And advertisers can't afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly 80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year. Here are some of the themes of this year's Super Bowl ads: Heartwarming nostalgia Budweiser brings back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad, including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reenact their famous scene from 1989's 'When Harry Met Sally,' except this time Sally is expressing her enthusiasm for Hellmann's mayonnaise. The Muppets search for accommodations with Booking.com, while an Instacart ad features a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asks what the world would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from 'Frozen,' Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes. Advertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect products to positive cultural moments, she said. Celebrity mashups Putting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can also broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob Ultra, actors Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs. Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson team up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning have a block party with Bud Light. A slew of celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig and Charlie XCX, appear in an ad for Uber Eats. Linli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there's a risk of diminishing returns. Celebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don’t remember which brand they're advertising, Xu said. Serious moments It isn't all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year. Pharmaceutical company Novartis urges women to get early detection for breast cancer. Dove warns that half of girls who quit sports have been criticized for their body type. Hims & Hers, a telehealth company, talks about America's obesity epidemic. For the third Super Bowl in a row, Come Near — a nonprofit that promotes the teachings of Jesus — is running an ad as part of its He Gets Us campaign. The ad, featuring Johnny Cash's cover of 'Personal Jesus,' shows everyday people being helpful and heroic. And the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, has a stark ad featuring Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other, in an effort to show how pointless hate is. Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message. But for the most part, advertisers went with humor, she said. 'We just had an election year and there’s a lot of discussion around divisiveness,' she said. 'People might be wanting to see some unity, everybody coming together as a country.' Artificial intelligence arrives Several Super Bowl ads make the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner team up for an ad wearing Meta 's smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitches GoDaddy Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And Google's '50 States, 50 Stories' campaign will show viewers a small business from their state that's using Google's Gemini AI assistant. But Cirkul, a water bottle brand, pokes fun at AI, showing comedian Adam Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on his phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/super-bowl-commercials-rely-on-comedy-nostalgia-to-avoid-potential-missteps/7968981.html	2025-02-09T16:01:08-08:00	
Westminster show's canine athletes get their piece of Super Bowl weekend	New York — They're at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go airborne. And they went all out for this weekend's championship. Sorry — no, they're not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They're the agility dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by showcasing agility and other dog sports. Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States' most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro football's Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both competitions' dates shifted in recent years. 'I always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl 'the Westminster of football,' ' quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers. The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than the Super Bowl, after all. And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and Westminster's green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year. (Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show, including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.) Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago. 'We never thought we'd be here. And now we're here,' Martin, of Austin, Texas, said Saturday. A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about 300 champion-level canines. 'She's very intuitive, very natural — probably smarter than me,' handler Emily Klarman of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, told a Fox interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically. A special award for the best mixed-breed competitor went to Gable, handled by Kayla Feeney of Lima, New York. Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show's first event with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillon mix named Nimble, who competed again this year. She's an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short. His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time for agility after realizing she'd adopted a super-energetic dog who opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when bored. 'He's always exciting — he does ridiculous things,' Ondeyka said as he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down time between agility runs. 'We have fun, regardless what happens.' While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly Labradoodle mix, used to be 'afraid of the world' but now is excited to go to agility classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said. Saturday's competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane to a 7-pound (0.9-kilogramg) papillon, and they included such lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish farmdog. They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without making mistakes. Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and went through them again. Westminster's traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night. That's for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible for Saturday's obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in 2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey. Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super Bowl — because he was confident the Eagles would prevail. There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund. The show also featured Westminster's first demonstration of flyball, a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball. 'It's a lot of organized chaos,' Hillary Brown said after competing with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York, Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break were a standard poodle, a border collie and a whippet-border collie mix. 'It's a blast. The dogs love it,' Brown said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/westminster-show-s-canine-athletes-get-their-piece-of-super-bowl-weekend/7968742.html	2025-02-09T15:41:10-08:00	
Aga Khan, leader of Ismaili Muslims, laid to rest in Egypt during private burial	Aswan, Egypt — The Aga Khan IV was laid to rest on Sunday at a private ceremony in Aswan, Egypt. The death of Prince Karim -- the 49th hereditary imam of the Shiite Ismaili Muslims -- was announced Tuesday by the Aga Khan Development Network and the Ismaili religious community. His son, 53-year-old Rahim Al-Hussaini, has been named as the Aga Khan V, the spiritual leader of the world's millions of Ismaili Muslims, according with his father's will. On Saturday, a private funeral service took place at the Ismaili community center in Lisbon attended by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Spain's King Emeritus Juan Carlos and Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. The Aga Khan is considered by his followers to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad and is treated as a head of state. The governor of Aswan welcomed Prince Karim's family at the southern Egyptian's provinces airport on Saturday. 'When his will was opened, it was found that he had requested to be buried in Aswan near his grandfather, Sultan Muhammad Shah, and his grandmother, Om Habiba,' said Maj. Gen. Ismail Kamal. Ismaili mourners marched as bells rang during the burial ceremony in the country's southern Aswan province, as Prince Karim's body was taken in a van. They carried his body, draped in a white shroud, and placed it on a yacht on the Nile River. Prince Karim, 88, was given the title of 'His Highness' by Queen Elizabeth in July 1957, two weeks after his grandfather, the Aga Khan III, unexpectedly made him heir to the family's 1,300-year dynasty as leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect. The late Aga Khan evolved over decades into a business magnate and a philanthropist, moving between the spiritual and the worldly with ease. He was a defender of Islamic culture and values, but also widely regarded as a builder of bridges between Muslim societies and the West. The Aga Khan Development Network deals mainly with issues of health care, housing, education and rural economic development. It says it works in over 30 countries and has an annual budget of about $1 billion for nonprofit development activities. Ismailis lived for many generations in Iran, Syria and South Asia before also settling in east Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East, as well as Europe, North America and Australia more recently. They consider it a duty to donate up to 12.5% of their income to the Aga Khan as steward.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aga-khan-leader-of-ismaili-muslims-laid-to-rest-in-egypt-during-private-burial/7968738.html	2025-02-09T15:31:43-08:00	
German chancellor candidates clash on Trump, the far-right and NATO	Berlin — Europe is prepared to respond 'within an hour' if the United States levies tariffs against the European Union, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a pre-election debate with his conservative challenger Friedrich Merz. In the first duel ahead of the Feb. 23 election, Merz portrayed Scholz as a ditherer who had led Germany into economic crisis, while the Social Democrat presented himself as an experienced leader in command of the details. Asked if the EU was ready with a targeted response if the U.S. imposed tariffs, Scholz, well behind Merz in the polls, said, 'Yes ... We as the European Union can act within an hour.' U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to enact tariffs against the United States' largest trading partners, accusing them of free-riding on American prosperity. Trade policy is an EU competence, run by the European Commission in Brussels. Trump and the far-right Alternative for Germany, endorsed by his confidante Elon Musk, overshadowed the debate. Merz, far ahead in the polls and the favorite to become Germany's next chancellor, expressed reluctance to raise taxes or borrow to reach the NATO alliance's defense spending target of 2% of gross domestic product, far short of the 5% Trump is demanding. When Scholz said that would not be enough, Merz signaled his openness to discuss scrapping Germany's totemic spending cap — despite a manifesto pledge to keep the constitutional debt braked. The two clashed over the AfD, with Scholz warning that Merz could not be trusted not to govern with the party. Merz ruled that out, blaming what he called Scholz's 'left-wing' policies for fueling the far-right party's rise to second in the polls.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-chancellor-candidates-clash-on-trump-the-far-right-and-nato/7968734.html	2025-02-09T15:20:31-08:00	
Trump to announce 25% steel, aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that he will announce on Monday new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., which would come on top of existing metals duties in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately. Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free quotas, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Former President Joe Biden extended these quotas to Britain, Japan and the European Union, and U.S. steel mill capacity utilization has dropped in recent years. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that the new tariffs would come on top of the existing duties on steel and aluminum. Trump on Friday announced that he would impose reciprocal tariffs — raising U.S. tariff rates to match those of trading partners — on many countries this week. He did not identify the countries, but the duties would be imposed 'so that we're treated evenly with other countries.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-announce-steel-aluminum-tariffs-in-latest-trade-escalation/7968731.html	2025-02-09T15:12:44-08:00	
49 migrant bodies found in 2 mass graves in southeastern Libya	Cairo — Libyan authorities have uncovered nearly 50 bodies from two mass graves in the country’s southeastern desert, officials said Sunday, in the latest tragedy involving people seeking to reach Europe through the chaos-stricken North African country. The first mass grave with 19 bodies was found Friday in a farm in the southeastern city of Kufra, the security directorate said in a statement, adding that authorities took them for autopsy. Authorities posted images on its Facebook page showing police officers and medics digging in the sand and recovering dead bodies that were wrapped in blankets. The al-Abreen charity, which helps migrants in eastern and southern Libya, said that some were apparently shot and killed before being buried. A separate mass grave, with at least 30 bodies, was also found in Kufra after raiding a human trafficking center, according to Mohamed al-Fadeil, head of the security chamber in Kufra. Survivors said nearly 70 people were buried in the grave, he added. Authorities were still searching the area. Later Sunday, authorities said they freed 76 migrants from the trafficking center and arrested three people — a Libyan and two foreigners — on suspicion of detaining and torturing migrants. Prosecutors ordered the suspects to remain in detention pending investigation. Migrants’ mass graves are not uncommon in Libya. Last year, authorities unearthed the bodies of at least 65 migrants in the Shuayrif region, 350 kilometers (220 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli. Libya is the dominant transit point for migrants from Africa and the Middle East trying to make it to Europe. The country was plunged into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime autocrat Muammar Gadhafi in 2011. Oil-rich Libya has been ruled for most of the past decade by rival governments in eastern and western Libya, each backed by an array of militias and foreign governments. Human traffickers have benefited from more than a decade of instability, smuggling migrants across the country’s borders with six nations, including Chad, Niger, Sudan Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia. Once at the coast, traffickers pack desperate migrants seeking a better life in Europe into ill-equipped rubber boats and other vessels for risky voyages on the perilous Central Mediterranean Sea route. Rights groups and U.N. agencies have for years documented systematic abuse of migrants in Libya including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture. The abuse often accompanies efforts to extort money from families before migrants are allowed to leave Libya on traffickers’ boats. Those who have been intercepted and returned to Libya — including women and children — are held in government-run detention centers where they also suffer from abuse, including torture, rape and extortion, according to rights groups and U.N. experts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrant-bodies-found-in-2-mass-graves-in-southeastern-libya/7968727.html	2025-02-09T15:02:00-08:00	
Chiefs chase Super Bowl 'three-peat' as Trump attends NFL showpiece	New Orleans, Louisiana — The Kansas City Chiefs aim for a historic hat-trick of Super Bowl titles on Sunday when they take on the Philadelphia Eagles in front of a star-studded crowd in New Orleans headed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump will become the first sitting president ever to attend the NFL showpiece when he takes his seat among a sell-out crowd of around 74,000 fans at the Superdome for the biggest annual event in the American sporting calendar, which kicks off at 5:30pm local time (2330 GMT). Pop superstar Taylor Swift will also be in the VIP seats to watch as her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his fellow Chiefs bid to become the first team in history to lift three consecutive Vince Lombardi Trophies. Trump's presence at the NFL showpiece will mean even tighter security than normal around an event which was already bolstered by a heavy police presence following a New Year's Day attack which left 14 people dead and many more injured on the Big Easy's famous Bourbon Street. Trump has had a strained relationship with the NFL stretching back several decades, and triggered uproar during his first time in 2017 when he attacked the patriotism of players who kneeled during the playing of the U.S. national anthem in a protest against racial injustice. Speaking in a pre-game interview aired on Fox News, Trump said his decision to attend this year's Super Bowl was for the good of the country. 'I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the President be at the game,' Trump told Fox. 'It's an iconic day. It's going to be a great game, two great teams, and let's see what happens,' Trump added, revealing that he was tipping Kansas City for victory, citing the record of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is eyeing his fourth Super Bowl win. 'When a quarterback wins as much as he's won, I have to go with Kansas City,' Trump said. 'I have to go with Kansas City.' Trump was due to fly into New Orleans from Florida, where he reportedly played a round of golf with Tiger Woods earlier Sunday. A schedule released by the White House said he is expected to leave the Superdome at around 8.05pm local time, well before the game reaches its conclusion. Super Bowl fans on Sunday welcomed Trump's attendance at the game. 'I think it is awesome, congratulations to him for being the first President to make it,' Bob Benderovich, a Philadelphia Eagles fan from Fort Myers, Florida, told AFP. Chiefs favorites As always, the Super Bowl crosses over into popular culture and the half-time show this year will feature hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar, who had a clean sweep at last Sunday's Grammys, winning in all five categories for which he received nominations. Bookmakers and casinos meanwhile are taking odds on whether Chiefs star Kelce will propose to pop icon Swift after what might be his final game in the NFL. For the more serious punters, the oddsmakers have the Chiefs as slight favorite for the game, a rematch of the Super Bowl from two years ago which the Chiefs won by three points. They defended their title last year, beating the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas and putting them one win away from an unprecedented 'three-peat.' The 29-year-old Mahomes will become one of just four quarterbacks in National Football League history to have won more than three Super Bowls should he triumph again, having first led the Chiefs to Super Bowl glory in 2020. But the Eagles have added serious offensive firepower since their defeat two years ago with mobile quarterback Jalen Hurts joined by the game-changing speed and power of running back Saquon Barkley. The Chiefs put the finishing touches to their game preparations Saturday with a 30-minute walkthrough of a mock game. Chiefs coach Andy Reid saluted his team's attitude to training over the whole week since arriving in Louisiana. 'I thought the guys worked hard, they got done what they needed to get done,' Reid said. The Eagles had a similarly relaxed final session before going to the Superdome on Saturday for a team photo. Head coach Nick Sirianni said his Eagles were 'hungry' and 'ready to roll.' 'We're ready for the challenge against a really good team,' Sirianni said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chiefs-chase-super-bowl-three-peat-as-trump-attends-nfl-showpiece/7968725.html	2025-02-09T14:40:55-08:00	
Trump official orders consumer protection agency to stop work	Washington — The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting down an agency that was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, directed the CFPB, in a Saturday night email confirmed by The Associated Press, to stop work on proposed rules, to suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since President Barack Obama pushed to include it in the 2010 financial reform legislation that followed the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The email also ordered the bureau to 'cease all supervision and examination activity.' Since the CFPB is a creation of Congress, it would require a separate act of Congress to formally eliminate it. But the head of the agency has discretion over what enforcement actions to take, if any. Yet Elon Musk commented, 'CFPB RIP' on social media site X on Friday. And the CFPB homepage on the Internet was down Sunday, replaced by a message reading 'page not found.' Also late Saturday, Vought said in a social media post that the CFPB would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, adding that its current reserves of $711.6 million are 'excessive.' Congress directed the bureau to be funded by the Fed to insulate it from political pressures. 'This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off,' Vought said on X. The CFPB says that it has obtained nearly $20 billion in financial relief for U.S. consumers since its founding in the form of canceled debts, compensation, and reduced loans. Last month, the bureau sued Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts — and 'cheating' customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result. Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, an advocacy group, said, 'that's why Wall Street’s biggest banks and Trump’s billionaire allies hate the bureau: it’s an effective cop on the finance beat and has stood side-by-side with hundreds of millions of Americans — Republicans and Democrats — battling financial predators, scammers, and crooks.' The administration's move against the CFPB also highlights the tensions between Trump's more populist promises to lower costs for working-class families and his pledge to reduce government regulation. During the campaign, Trump said he would cap credit card interest rates at 10%, after they had soared to record levels above 20%, on average, as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates in 2022 and 2023. The CFPB had started work on how that proposal would be implemented. The bureau can still take complaints, but it can’t conduct exams or pursue existing investigations, according to a person familiar with the agency who insisted on anonymity to discuss CFPB business. The memo is also interpreted as blocking it from communicating with companies it regulates, consumer advocates or other outside groups. Musk’s team would also have access to complaints, investigations and regulatory oversight data. The access raises uncomfortable questions if Musk’s company X launches a payments system as the CFPB has data on competitors such as Cash App, the person said. Vought's email follows a similar directive from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Feb. 3 and is the latest move by the Trump administration to rapidly curtail the work of federal agencies that they have deemed excessive. Obama spearheaded the creation of the bureau in the wake of the 2007-2008 housing bubble and financial crisis, which was caused in part by fraudulent mortgage lending. It was the brainchild of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has attracted lawsuits from large banks and financial industry trade associations. 'Vought is giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to scam families,' Warren said. Last week, Warren called on Trump to work with the bureau to protect Americans from de-banking, the practice of banks shutting down customer accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational risks to the banks. Vought's email said that President Donald Trump had made him acting director of the CFPB on Friday. Trump fired the previous director of the bureau, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1. Vought was an architect of Project 2025, a policy blueprint for the Trump White House that Trump tried to disavow during last year's campaign. Under Chopra, the CFPB approved rules to cap overdraft fees by banks, limit junk fees, and has proposed restrictions on data brokers selling personal information such as Social Security numbers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-official-orders-consumer-protection-agency-to-stop-work/7968717.html	2025-02-09T13:51:53-08:00

White House defends efforts to shut down foreign aid agency	White House national security adviser Michael Waltz on Sunday defended President Donald Trump’s plan to shut down the country’s chief foreign aid agency, contending that 'all too often' it was not aligned with U.S. strategic interests and wastes money. Waltz told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that the U.S. Agency for International Development programs, often food and humanitarian assistance across the world, 'are not in line with strategic U.S. interests like pushing back on China. They're doing all kinds of other things that frankly, aren't in line with strategic interests or the president's vision.' Moreover, he said, 'Often, all too often, only cents on the dollar actually makes it to people in need, between the big contractors, the subcontractors, the local contractors, the dollars aren't being used … wisely. We need to take a hard look at it. We need to move quickly, and that's exactly what's being done.'.' Trump this past week ordered the 10,000-worker agency shut down with fewer than 300 of them expected to eventually be retained as the agency’s programs are either shifted to State Department control or terminated. A federal judge in Washington on Friday ordered a temporary halt to plans to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job. On the same day, workers pried the name of the agency letter by letter off the entryway of its headquarters in Washington. Democrats in Congress have been critical of the changes regarding USAID, with some pledging to stall Trump’s Cabinet nominees and leverage their votes on a new government spending bill, in protest. The effort to shut down USAID was the most visible result of Trump dispatching billionaire Elon Musk and his aides to review programs and the legitimacy of spending at dozens of federal government agencies. Trump offered virtually all the government’s 2.3 million civilian workers a chance to resign and continue to get paid through Sept. 30 without working, but a federal judge paused the offer until he holds a new hearing Monday afternoon on its legality. The White House said 65,000 workers, 2.8% of the government’s civilian workforce, accepted the offer to quit and be paid not to work, far fewer than the 5- to 10% figure Musk and his cost cutters were hoping for. Trump said all government agencies would be subject to financial reviews, including one of the biggest targets, the Defense Department, where Musk has billions of dollars of contracts. Waltz said a review of Pentagon spending was especially necessary. 'Everything there seems to cost too much, take too long and deliver too little to the soldiers… we do need great minds, and we do need business leaders to go in there and absolutely reform the Pentagon's acquisition process,' he said. Waltz, a former congressman from the southern state of Florida, said, 'I, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, held up a bag of bolts that would cost 100 bucks … in a hardware store, that cost $90,000 to the United States Air Force and the American people have said enough, enough with the bloat and the waste….' 'For our barracks and our soldiers, we need all the efficiency we can get in the Pentagon, and I think the American people and the soldiers will welcome' a spending review, he said.' On another matter, Waltz said 'sensitive conversations' are occurring on how to end Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine. 'We will have our secretary of state, our secretary of defense, our vice president, our special envoy in Europe this week talking through the details of how to end this war,' Waltz said. 'And that means getting both sides (to) the table.' Waltz said the discussions would include future U.S. aid to Ukraine, possibly in exchange for Kyiv supplying the U.S. with its rare earth minerals — necessary for the manufacture of high-tech goods. 'Those conversations are going to happen this week. And I think an underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this conflict going forward,' Waltz said. 'President Trump is going to end it. And then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-defends-efforts-to-shut-down-foreign-aid-agency/7968670.html	2025-02-09T11:51:57-08:00
