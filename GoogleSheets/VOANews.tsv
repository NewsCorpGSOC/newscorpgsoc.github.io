Listeners protest as Turkey silences radio station	In Turkey, listeners of Acik Radyo are protesting after regulators revoked the Istanbul-based station’s license. For nearly 30 years, Acik sought to bridge the country's divides. Analysts say the action against it is part of a wider government media crackdown. Dorian Jones reports from Istanbul.	https://www.voanews.com/a/listeners-protest-as-turkey-silences-radio-station/7853163.html	2024-11-05T16:42:13-08:00	
VOA talks with US presidential 3rd party candidates	Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have spent the past few months battling for the White House, and experts say that votes for third party candidates could be a deciding factor for who will become the next president of the United States. With the latest polls showing Harris and Trump in a dead heat in battleground states around the country, ballots cast for third-party candidates Jill Stein of the Green Party, independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver could be enough to tip the scales. VOA Persian spoke with all three of them. Their responses have been edited for length and clarity. Green Party candidate Jill Stein VOA: During one of his final campaign rallies in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, former President Donald Trump praised you, saying he loved the Green Party and that you might be one of his favorite politicians. What do you make of this? Jill Stein: I make of that about as much as I make of Donald Trump's assessment of climate change, which is that he sort of believes the opposite of reality. I am in this race to provide an alternative to the two parties that are bought and paid for, that are serving Wall Street and the war contractors and definitely not the American people. So I don't have a lot of high regard for Donald Trump's political strategies or his values. VOA: How much support do you expect to receive in battleground states like Michigan? There were some polls that suggested you have support of over 40% of the Arab American population there. Stein: Exactly what the numbers will turn out to be, it depends how many people are turning out to vote. It depends how strong the vote of the, not only the Muslim population, but also many African Americans and Hispanics and young people who feel like they do not have a future under Kamala Harris, and they do not have a future under Donald Trump. At this point, it's too soon to say. We ourselves do not strictly work based on polls. We're really in this based on principle and for the long haul. We would be delighted if we make the 5% cut in the national poll in the national results, but it's very hard to say at this point. VOA: What would be your position regarding the government of Iran? Stein: I think we need to open the door to negotiations with Iran. Iran has elected a new president who is said to be moderate and interested in improving relations with the West, and we need to explore that. I think the most critical thing in the Middle East right now is resolving this expanding war and the intention of Bibi [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu to create a wider war and drag the U.S. into it. I think that is the greatest threat to peace in the Middle East right now and has the potential to grow into a conflict that's even bigger than the Middle East. Independent candidate Cornel West VOA: How many states allowed you to have your name on the ballot and why did others not? Cornel West: We've got 16 states where we have direct ballot access. We have 24 states where we have write-in access, and that did require petitions and signatures. So that required a lot of work on behalf of magnificent volunteers. But it was very difficult. There's been a tremendous struggle, but we come up swinging. VOA: How different will your policy be compared to what we hear from Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump? West: Martin Luther King [Jr.] said, militarism, racism, poverty and materialism are the four forces that are sucking the democratic energy out of the American social experiment. I take very seriously his critique of militarism. I see that as a criticism of American foreign policies in which we are so eager to create these lethal armed forces rather than engage in wise diplomatic processes. And so there would be no genocide. I would have had an embargo on any kind of military or financial support of Israel as it was very clear that they were laying bare this kind of massive massacre on innocent people, especially innocent children and women and men. The same would be true in terms of being able to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Same would be true in terms of trying to be more diplomatic with China. I see Kamala Harris as a militarist, Black woman. That is to say she's willing to not just provoke, but to push [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. And I think Putin himself is still very much a gangster and a war criminal in his own way, but he has a right — Russia has a right to security. And the same is true with China. There's too much provocation, and I think that moves us toward World War III in the same way that Trump moves us towards Civil War II at home. And that was one reason why I wanted to provide some kind of alternative to Trump and [U.S. President Joe] Biden. And then when Biden had his LBJ moment [referring to Biden's poor debate performance] something that we talked about many, many months ago, we just predicted that Harris now is following through on the same militarism in Gaza. And of course, genocide, the crime of genocide, is a litmus test of morality of any nation, any country, and if you deny it, if you enable it, it's a sign that you don't have a moral fiber in your military policy. VOA: Many people in the occupied West Bank are disturbed by Tehran's support for militants in Gaza. How do you see this considering the moral aspects of your vision, your doctrine and your policy? West: Malcolm X used to say, I'm for truth, no matter who's for it, and justice, no matter who supports it. People can actually support just movements for motivations that themselves are highly suspicious. When the French supported the American revolutionaries, when Lafayette came to the United States, it was partly because the French were over against the British in Europe, they didn't have a whole lot of solidarity with these colonists responding against the British Empire. ... The Soviet Union supported the freedom struggles in Africa. It wasn't always because they just love Africans so much. It was anti-United States. They had a Cold War going on, and their policies were strategic and tactical in that way. The same would be true for Iran vis-a-vis Palestinians. So I think we have to be very truthful about the ways in which the motives might not always be attractive, but when you're a people like Palestinians this moment, whose backs are against the wall, they need help from anybody, and it's very important that people highlight their plight so that their babies are not crushed. But that doesn't mean that those who are supporting them always have the right motives, and therefore we can still be critical of what those motives are. Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver VOA: In your platform, you mentioned that Libertarians seek the United States at peace with the world. How different will your foreign policy be? Chase Oliver: It would be a drastic difference than what the status quo has been, certainly since I've been an adult. Since I've been an adult, let's just call it the post-9/11 War on Terror kind of foreign policy mindset that we've had, which I think is rooted in ideas that are very black and white. You're either with us or you're with the terrorists. The best way to solve a problem is through a preemptive war or through increasing our military presence in the region, to flex our muscle. And what I think that has done is actually created further instability, particularly in the Middle East, which I don't think has been a success despite the trillions of dollars we've spent in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I don't think you can say either of those nations are particularly bastions of democracy, or that the region itself is now more stable than it was. And so for me, I would say let's remove our military footprint and start flexing our diplomatic muscle. Let's start meeting with world leaders directly, one on one. Let's start forming coalitions around peaceful ideas and free trade and voluntary exchange to tear down barriers between our nations so that we can have cultural exchanges with one another. I think these are the ideas that we really need to be pushing, and not a militarized foreign policy that's ruined the idea that the United States must be the world's enforcer. VOA: So you don't see America as the leader of the free world with its responsibilities? Oliver: I absolutely see America as a leader in terms of the markets of the world, the economic engine of the world, the diplomatic arm of the world. But it doesn't need to be coming, using the military might of the world. Teddy Roosevelt said, 'Speak softly and carry a big stick.' We have a very powerful military that can defend ourselves, and ultimately, if there were a need and if Congress declared a war, fight a war anywhere in the world with absolute certainty that we could dominate our opponent. But you don't flex your muscle like that around the world. That's not a position of strength. When you use that military might to push your agenda, that's actually a position of weakness, because good ideas should not require force, and you should be able to diplomatically work throughout the world. And I recognize the world is not perfect. The world does not lack violence. The world is not lacking for bad people, particularly governments around the world who represent good people. And Iran is no different. The government of Iran is abhorrent. They're abusive to their people. They curtail their rights. But the people of Iran are good, innocent people who don't deserve to have things like airstrikes and missiles raining down upon them because of the evils of their government. And I hope that ultimately, we can liberalize the world more towards more liberalized things like free speech, freedom of movement and freedom of religion. But that's not going to come just from us beating people down. VOA: How difficult is it to run as a third-party candidate? Oliver: Running as an alternative party candidate has a lot of challenges because the two mainstream parties have a lot of built-in incumbency power, both in the number of elected officials they have as well as things like taxpayer-funded primaries. So they basically take taxes out of my wallet to fund primaries that help promote the candidates that are Republicans and Democrats. And as a Libertarian, we're kind of left in the lurch there. So there's a lot of challenges, especially around things like ballot access. There's a lot of solutions. And actually a big part of my platform is a thing called the voter bill of rights that will open up this process, not just for Libertarians like myself, but all sorts of other alternative parties that really need to have their voices heard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-talks-with-us-presidential-3rd-party-candidates-/7852852.html	2024-11-05T16:09:08-08:00	
US Army soldier injured while working on Gaza pier has died	washington — A U.S. Army soldier who was injured in May while working on the American-built pier to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza has died. Sargeant Quandarius Stanley, 23, was a motor transport operator and was critically injured when high winds and heavy seas damaged the pier, causing four Army vessels to become beached. Two other service members also were injured but later returned to duty. U.S. military officials have not provided details on how exactly Stanley was injured but have noted it was not in combat. He died last Thursday and had been assigned to the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia. 'Sergeant Quandarius Stanley was an instrumental and well respected first-line leader in the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary (TBX), especially during the mission to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. We will continue to provide support to his family during this difficult time,' said Colonel John 'Eddie' Gray, brigade commander. 'Our entire unit mourns alongside his family.' Captain Shkeila Milford-Glover, spokesperson for the 3rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command, said Stanley had recently retired and was receiving treatment in a long-term care medical center. The massive pier project was hampered by unexpected bad weather and security issues, as well as persistent safety issues involving Israeli forces that prompted aid agencies to halt distribution of the supplies out of fear of being injured and killed. The Defense Department formally pulled the pier from the Gaza shore on June 28 and declared an end in mid-July to the mission to bring aid into the territory besieged by the war between Israel and Hamas. The military moved nearly 20 million pounds of aid onto the Gaza shore in what officials said was the 'largest volume of humanitarian assistance' ever delivered into the Middle East. But aid agencies had difficulty moving the food brought ashore to areas farther into Gaza where it was needed most because humanitarian convoys came under attack.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-army-soldier-injured-while-working-on-gaza-pier-has-died-/7852796.html	2024-11-05T15:06:56-08:00	
Police fire tear gas at protests of deadly canopy collapse in Serbia	NOVI SAD, Serbia — Protesters threw flares and red paint Tuesday on the City Hall building in the Serbian city of Novi Sad in rage over last week's collapse of a concrete canopy at the railway station that killed 14 people. Police responded by firing tear gas canisters. The protesters surrounded the building in central Novi Sad, breaking windows and throwing stones and other objects despite calls by organizers to remain calm. Special police troops were deployed inside the building. Some of the angry protesters wearing masks, believed to be soccer hooligans who are close to the populist government, tried to get inside the building and hand over their demands that those responsible for the canopy collapse face justice. Serbia's autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic said the police are 'showing restraint,' but also issued a warning saying 'horrific, violent protests are underway.' 'People of Serbia, please do not think violence is allowed,' he said on X, formerly Twitter. 'All those taking part in the incidents will be punished.' Protest organizers said they wanted to enter the Hall and submit their demands. Miran Pogacar, an opposition activist, said 'one glass window can be mended but we cannot bring back 14 lives. People are angry. Serbia won’t stand for this.' Bojan Pajtic, an opposition politician, said he believed the violent incidents were stoked deliberately by provocateurs, a tactic used before in Serbia to derail peaceful anti-government protests and paint the opposition protesters as enemies of the nation. Thousands first marched through the city streets demanding that top officials step down because of the fatal outer roof collapse last Friday, including President Vucic and Prime Minister Milos Vucevic. The protesters first gathered outside the railway station where they held a moment of silence for the victims as organizers read their names. The crowd responded by chanting: 'arrest the gang' and 'thieves.' The protest started peacefully but some demonstrators later hurled plastic bottles and bricks at the headquarters of Vucic’s ruling Serbian Progressive Party and smeared red paint on posters of the Serbian president and the prime minister — a message that they have blood on their hands. The protesters removed most of the Serbian national red, blue and white national flags that were apparently hung on the headquarters to prevent it from an attack. That triggered an angry reaction from the president. 'Our Serbian tricolor has been destroyed, hidden and removed by all those who do not love Serbia,' Vucic wrote on X. 'Tonight, in Novi Sad, this is being done by those who tell us that they love Serbia more than us, the decent citizens of this country.' Critics of Serbia’s populist government have attributed the disaster to rampant corruption in the Balkan country, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during renovation work on the station building which was part of a wider railway deal with Chinese state companies. The accident happened without warning. Surveillance camera footage showed the massive canopy on the outer wall of the station building crashing down on the people sitting below on benches or going in and out. Officials have promised full accountability and, faced with pressure, Serbia’s construction minister submitted his resignation Tuesday. Prosecutors have said that more than 40 people already have been questioned as part of a probe into what happened. Many in Serbia, however, doubt that justice will be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police. Opposition parties behind Tuesday’s protest said they are also demanding the resignation of Vucevic and that documentation be made public listing all the companies and individuals involved. The victims included a 6-year-old girl. Those injured in the roof collapse remained in serious condition Tuesday. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not included. The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-fire-tear-gas-at-protests-of-deadly-canopy-collapse-in-serbia/7852830.html	2024-11-05T14:35:07-08:00	
Migrant caravan of 3,000 heads north in Mexico	A caravan of approximately 3,000 migrants set off on Tuesday from southern Mexico, headed toward the United States on the day when U.S. voters were deciding between U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Immigration has been a key issue in the U.S. election campaign. Before heading northward, the migrants gathered in Tapachula, the capital of the southern Chiapas state, carrying banners with messages such as 'NO MORE MIGRANT BLOOD' and images of the Virgin of Guadalupe, an important religious and cultural symbol in Mexico, according to Reuters witnesses. 'We want U.S. authorities to see us, to see that we are people who want to work, not to harm anyone,' said Honduran migrant Roy Murillo, who joined the caravan with his two children and his pregnant wife. In recent years, several caravans with people hoping to enter the United States have attempted to reach the U.S.-Mexican border, traveling in mass groups for safety. Most have dispersed along the way. 'I'm afraid to travel alone with my family. Here, the cartels either kidnap you or kill you. ... That's why we're coming in the caravan,' Murillo said. Murillo recounted his unsuccessful attempts to secure an asylum appointment through a mobile app developed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. Tapachula, a mandatory crossing point for tens of thousands of migrants, has become one of Mexico's most violent cities in recent months, with migrants frequently targeted by organized crime, according to official data. 'I feel suffocated here. That's why we decided to leave,' said 28-year-old Venezuelan migrant Thais, who spoke on condition that her surname not be used due to safety concerns. She joined the caravan with her husband and 3-year-old daughter. 'I wish Mr. Trump and Ms. Kamala would see that we are human beings, that we want to live and support our families,' she added. Voters cast ballots on Tuesday in the race between Vice President Harris, a Democrat seeking to become the first female U.S. president, and Trump, a Republican immigration hard-liner aiming to regain the presidency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrant-caravan-of-3-000-heads-north-in-mexico/7852819.html	2024-11-05T14:19:54-08:00	
Swedish court sentences far-right politician for insulting Muslims	MALMO, Sweden — A Swedish court sentenced a far-right politician Tuesday to four months in jail for two counts of 'incitement against an ethnic group' after making hateful comments at political rallies two years ago. The Danish-Swedish 42-year-old man, who was not named but has been identified by Swedish media as Rasmus Paludan, founder and head of the Danish nationalist anti-immigration party Stram Kurs, had been previously convicted and sentenced by a Danish court on a similar charge, the Malmo District Court said. In 2022, Paludan made his offensive remarks directed at Muslims, Arabs and Africans during protests that he led in the southern city of Malmo, the court said. He also burned a copy of the Quran, Islam's holy book, on at least one occasion. In response, a violent wave of riots swept the country. Some observers also say Paludan's actions may have momentarily risked Sweden's chances of joining NATO after increasing political tensions with Turkey. Sweden joined the alliance in March this year. The court in a statement Tuesday said Paludan's remarks against Muslims 'cannot be excused as criticism of Islam or as political campaign work.' Chief Councilor Nicklas Soderberg, the court's chairman, said: 'It is permitted to publicly make critical statements about, for example, Islam and also Muslims, but the disrespect of a group of people must not clearly cross the line for a factual and valid discussion.' He added that during the Malmo rallies in April and September 2022, 'there was no question of any such discussion,' and that Paludan's public statements 'only amounted to insulting Muslims.' The court took particular interest in whether the politician knew the protests were filmed and published on Facebook. Paludan had said that he wasn't aware of it, but the district court disagreed and said his 'actions at the gatherings would be downright illogical if he didn't know about the publication on Facebook.' Paludan, a lawyer by profession, told Swedish media outlets that he wasn't surprised by the verdict. 'It was expected. We will appeal,' the Swedish newspaper Expressen cited him as saying.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-court-sentences-far-right-politician-for-insulting-muslims/7852800.html	2024-11-05T14:03:12-08:00	
US Department of Agriculture bans school lunch fees for low-income families	The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027. School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge 'processing fees' for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. The Agriculture Department's new policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four. 'USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,' said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. 'While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.' The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report. The USDA has mandated since 2017 that school districts inform families of their options, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome. 'It's just massively inconvenient,' said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch accounts, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead. 'A dollar here and there, I expected,' she said. 'But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.' Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches, which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37, or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account. While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures 'may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.' Just three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe and LINQ Connect — dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, 'families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,' the agency said, 'including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-department-of-agriculture-bans-school-lunch-fees-for-low-income-families/7852801.html	2024-11-05T14:01:54-08:00	
Report: Russia deceives OPEC on oil sales to fund Ukraine war	LONDON — Russia is 'flagrantly violating' its agreements with the OPEC oil cartel by concealing the true amount of oil it is producing and selling, according to a new report that says the profits are funding Moscow’s war on Ukraine. The investigation by the Ukrainian Center for Defense Reforms asserts that Russia is breaching an OPEC agreement to cut oil production. The think tank is chaired by Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former chief adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister. Oil cut 'In 2016, amid declining oil prices and to stabilize the market, OPEC reached an agreement with ten additional oil-producing countries, including Russia. The participants in this expanded format, known as OPEC+, agreed to reduce oil production, leading to a natural rise in global commodity prices,' the report says. However, the authors say that Russia has 'flagrantly violated its obligations under the OPEC+ agreement' by concealing the true extent of its production and sales, thereby exceeding its production quota 'by no less than 2.57 million barrels per day (28%) on average during the first four months of 2024.' $60 billion That has enriched the Kremlin, said report co-author Danylyuk. 'It’s about $60 billion per year. And it's also important because this is the money which is not seen by anyone,' Danylyuk told VOA. 'And obviously, this is extra funds Russia can use to support the war efforts in Ukraine. This is actually the money they can use to buy microelectronics, to buy explosives, to buy shells, to pay countries like North Korea and Iran.' The report claims Russia is concealing the true volume of oil sold to its two biggest customers, India and China. 'To disguise these deliveries, Russian authorities list zero value for certain contracts in the customs declarations,' says the report. 'Over the first four months of 2024, Russia exported at least 789,000 barrels of oil per day more to China than officially reported. During the same period, exports to India exceeded official statistics by at least 280,000 barrels per day.' Shadow fleet In addition, Moscow is using a so-called shadow fleet of tankers to mask the true scale of its oil sales. The vessels 'frequently change flags or ownership structures, deliberately deactivate the Automatic Identification System, falsify location under the influence of electronic warfare, and use other deceptive shipping practices.' By comparing discrepancies in shipping data, the Center for Defense Reforms estimates that Russia is exporting an unaccounted crude oil volume of around 1.5 million barrels per day above its OPEC quota through the Baltic Sea and Black Sea. Smuggling 'Paradoxically, because Russia started using those sophisticated methods of smuggling its oil, they are able not just to fool the West and to hide the oil supplies from sanctions, but also to hide them from their partners in the OPEC+ club,' Danylyuk said. 'The real scale of the operations is actually much higher than most observers believe — $60 billion literally stolen from other OPEC+ countries,' he added. 'I don't think that OPEC originally was founded to have members like that, right? So it's not fair. It's not how cartels usually work.' Russia response Russia has not directly addressed accusations that it conceals oil sales from OPEC. The Kremlin had not responded to VOA requests for comment at the time of publication. Speaking at September’s Russian Energy Week forum in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin insisted his country was a reliable partner. 'Russia fulfills its obligations to supply energy resources to the world market and plays a stabilizing role in it by participating in such authoritative formats as OPEC+,' Putin said in a September 26 address to the conference. OPEC also did not respond to VOA requests for comment. In a press release issued Sunday, OPEC said that Russia — along with Iraq and Kazakhstan — had 'strongly reaffirmed' their commitment to cut oil output. Danylyuk said the interests of the West and OPEC were now aligned, 'because the West doesn't want Russia to make money and OPEC doesn't want Russia to steal money from them.' 'Obviously, the only way to reduce Russia's ability to make that money is to just reject them from OPEC,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-russia-deceives-opec-on-oil-sales-to-fund-ukraine-war/7852345.html	2024-11-05T13:35:59-08:00

Iran FM: Tehran determined to respond to Israel's attack at 'appropriate time'	Islamabad — Iran's chief diplomat said Tuesday that Tehran opposes military escalation in the region but 'will certainly respond' to the deadly Oct. 26 strike by Israel against his country. During an official visit to neighboring Pakistan, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi discussed the Israeli attack on Iranian military bases and other installations, resulting in the deaths of at least five people, mostly security personnel. 'Unlike the Israeli regime, the Islamic Republic of Iran does not seek escalation. However, we reserve our inherent right to legitimate defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter,' he told a joint news conference in Islamabad with his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar. 'We would certainly respond to the Israeli aggression in a proper time and in a proper manner in a very measured and well-calculated manner,' Araghchi said without elaborating further. Israeli warplanes conducted the October 26 strikes, saying they were in retaliation for Tehran's missile barrage on October 1. Iran described its military action as a response to the killing of militant leaders backed by Tehran and a commander from the Revolutionary Guards. On Sunday, Iranian state media quoted President Masoud Pezeshkian as saying that a potential cease-fire between its regional allies and Israel 'could affect the intensity and type of' Iran's response to the Israeli attack. Dar stated Tuesday that during discussions with his Iranian counterpart, both sides condemned the 'unrestrained Israeli aggression' in the Middle East and emphasized the urgent need for a 'cease-fire' and 'de-escalation.' Gas pipeline Araghchi said that during his meetings in Islamabad, he also stressed the need to boost political, economic, commercial, and energy cooperation between Iran and Pakistan. He described terrorism as a mutual threat for both countries and urged enhanced cooperation. The two foreign ministers did not discuss the status of a long-stalled multi-billion-dollar pipeline, though, intended to export Iranian natural gas to energy-starved Pakistan. The United States is opposed to the project as a violation of its sanctions on Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Under a 2009 gas sales and purchase agreement for the cross-border pipeline, the Iranian side must supply Pakistan with up to 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Iran's South Pars Field. However, the project has been on hold since then. Iranian officials have long announced that the 900-kilometer pipeline is completed on their side of the border. Pakistani officials say they have not started constructing their portion of the pipeline for fear of being slapped with U.S. sanctions. Tehran has been pressing Islamabad to uphold its end of the project or pay a reported financial penalty of up to $18 billion for delaying it. Pakistan has recently hired the services of two U.S.-based law firms to represent the country at the International Court of Arbitration in anticipation of a potential situation in which Iran may compel Islamabad to fulfill its obligations or face financial penalties. The move followed Tehran's reported final notice to Islamabad in August before seeking arbitration from the Paris-based body.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-fm-tehran-determined-to-respond-to-israel-s-attack-at-appropriate-time/7852689.html	2024-11-05T12:56:42-08:00	
WHO: 2 UK mpox cases first local transmissions in Europe	London — Two new cases of the mpox variant clade 1b detected in the U.K. are the first locally transmitted cases in Europe and the first outside Africa, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. The U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed late Monday that the two new cases were household contacts of Britain's first case identified last week, bringing the country's total confirmed cases to three. The WHO warned that European states should be prepared for 'rapid action' to contain the latest mpox variant, which spreads through close physical contact including sexual relations and sharing closed spaces. The two cases are also the first to be locally transmitted outside Africa since August 2024, when the WHO declared the outbreak of the new variant an international public health emergency — its highest level of alarm. Those affected are under specialist care and the risk to the U.K. population 'remains low,' UKHSA said. The original case was detected after the person traveled to several African countries on holiday and returned to the U.K. on Oct. 21. The patient developed flu-like symptoms more than 24 hours later and, on Oct. 24, started to develop a rash that worsened in the following days. Mpox, a viral disease related to smallpox, has two types, clade 1 and clade 2. Symptoms include fever, a skin rash or pus-filled blisters, swollen lymph nodes and body aches. The WHO first declared an international public health emergency in 2022 over the spread of clade 2. That outbreak mostly affected gay and bisexual men in Europe and the United States. Vaccination and awareness drives in many countries helped stem the number of worldwide cases and the WHO lifted the emergency in May 2023 after reporting 140 deaths out of around 87,400 cases. In 2024, a two-pronged epidemic of clade 1 and clade 1b, a new strain that affects children, has spread widely in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The new strain has also been recorded in neighboring Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, with imported cases in Sweden, India, Thailand, Germany and the U.K.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-2-uk-mpox-cases-first-local-transmissions-in-europe/7852677.html	2024-11-05T12:05:25-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu dismisses his defense minister	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday the trust between the two men had evaporated over the course of Israel’s war on Gaza. 'Over the past few months that trust has eroded,' Netanyahu said in a statement. 'In light of this, I decided today to end the term of the defense minister.' 'In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defense,' Netanyahu said. 'Significant gaps were discovered between me and Gallant in the management of the campaign' in Gaza, said Netanyahu. Despite 'many attempts to bridge these gaps,' the prime minister said, 'they kept getting wider.' Netanyahu has appointed Foreign Minister Israel Katz to replace Gallant. Some information provided by the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israels-netanyahu-dismisses-his-defense-minister/7852644.html	2024-11-05T11:35:51-08:00	
More than 100 patients to be medically evacuated from Gaza	geneva — In a rare and welcome move, the World Health Organization says more than 100 patients, including children, who are suffering from severe trauma injuries and chronic diseases will be medically evacuated from Gaza Wednesday to countries where they can receive medical treatment for their condition. 'These are ad hoc measures. What we have been requesting for repeatedly is a sustained medevac [medical evacuation] outside Gaza, an organized, sustained medevac,' Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, said in a call Tuesday with journalists in Geneva. Speaking in Gaza, Peeperkorn said that as many as 113 patients who are 'on the Ministry of Health priority list' for medical evacuation will be gathered at the European Gaza hospital tonight 'and from six in the morning — that is the plan — they will be brought to Kerem Shalom and then across Kerem Shalom to Ramallah airport.' 'The majority of the patients will go to the UAE,' he said 'and then I think something like 13 patients will go to Romania. So, that is the plan for tomorrow.' While affirming the importance of the operation, Peeperkorn noted the number of people being evacuated from war-torn Gaza paled in comparison to the needs. 'We estimate that approximately 12,000 to 14,000 critical patients need to be medevaced, half of them probably trauma-related — what we call serious trauma cases — amputations, spinal cord injuries, burns, etc., with the other half being chronic cases,' including cancer, cardiovascular, blood and liver diseases, he said. Before the Rafah crossing in South Gaza near the Egyptian border was closed on May 6, nearly 5,000 patients were medevaced outside the Palestinian enclave. Since then, only 282 patients have been evacuated. The last WHO-led operation occurred on September 11 when 97 sick and severely injured patients and 155 companions were transported out of Gaza via Kerem Shalom for medical treatment. 'We cannot continue the way we do now. We need medical corridors,' Peeperkorn said. 'The first medical corridors we have repeatedly requested to be restored is the traditional referral pathway from Gaza to East Jerusalem and the West Bank to the hospitals that are there already. 'And a second medical corridor to Egypt should be opened again, and maybe to Jordan, and from there when other countries are willing to receive patients, they can go to other areas,' he said. While plans for transporting patients outside the Gaza Strip are moving ahead, a second round of polio vaccinations aimed at reaching more than a half million children under age 10 is winding down. The World Health Organization says a second dose of novel oral polio vaccine has been administered to more than 450,000 children, and more than 364,000 children have received vitamin A in central and southern Gaza. Unfortunately, a similar campaign 'was compromised' in northern Gaza because of the dire conditions prevailing in the region. Peeperkorn said the technical committee, which is the Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF, UNRWA, and NGO partners, decided to postpone the vaccination campaign from October 23 until November 2 'due to the lack of access, the lack of assured humanitarian pauses, the intense bombardment and the mass evacuation orders.' 'The committee decided to go ahead after the delay and to do our level best to cover as many kids as possible,' he said, noting that between November 2 and 4, the campaign managed to vaccinate 88% of the targeted 119,000 children under 10, and it provided nearly 84,000 children with vitamin A. 'This is an exceptional achievement,' he said, while acknowledging it will take weeks if not months 'for us to know how successful this campaign has been.' Peeperkorn participated in a mission that reached Kamal Adwan hospital Sunday, managing to deliver medical and surgical supplies, as well as other urgent necessities of fuel, food and water. The team also transferred 25 patients and 37 companions to Gaza City’s Shifa Hospital. The WHO official presented an alarming picture of conditions in northern Gaza and the dangers encountered by medical staff and patients alike. 'There was intense bombardment in close proximity to the hospital even during the mission,' he said. 'Shortly after the WHO mission to Kamal Adwan Hospital departed, the facility’s third floor reportedly was hit, injuring six children who are patients there. One child reportedly sustained a critical injury. Water tanks were damaged.' He said, 'The needs are enormous. The Emergency Department is full of patients, more than 40 casualties. The inpatient department also was full of hospitalized patients and their caregivers.' Northern Gaza has three hospitals. Peeperkorn said the Indonesian Hospital is not functional and the other two, Kamal Adwan and al-Awda hospitals, are 'only minimally functional. … There are no functional primary health care centers or medical points in North Gaza.' While an estimated 150,000 people 'were forcibly evacuated from the region,' he noted that an estimated population of 75,000 people remain. Given the health situation in northern Gaza, he said, 'It is critically vital that these hospitals remain functional.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-100-patients-to-be-medically-evacuated-from-gaza-/7852604.html	2024-11-05T10:57:24-08:00	
Lack of justice makes media more vulnerable to attacks, analysts say	In countries experiencing war or internal conflict, attacks on journalists are happening with impunity. Watchdog groups say most killings of journalists in recent years have gone unresolved. With Liam Scott, Cristina Caicedo Smit has the story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lack-of-justice-makes-media-more-vulnerable-to-attacks-analysts-say/7852263.html	2024-11-05T08:59:39-08:00	
A week after Spain's floods, families hopeful missing loved ones are alive	SEDAVI, Spain — Francisco Murgui went out to try to salvage his motorbike when the water started to rise. He never came back. One week after catastrophic flooding devastated eastern Spain, Maria Murgui still holds out hope that her father is alive and among the unknown number of the missing. 'He was like many people in town who went out to get their car or motorbike to safety,' the 27-year-old told The Associated Press. 'The flash flood caught him outside, and he had to cling to a tree in order to escape drowning. He called us to tell us that he was fine, that we shouldn’t worry.' But when Maria set out into the streets of Sedavi to try to rescue him from the water washing away everything in its path, he was nowhere to be found. 'He held up until 1 in the morning,' she said. 'By 2, I went outside with a neighbor and a rope to try to locate him. But we couldn’t find him. And since then, we haven’t heard anything about him.' At least 218 have been confirmed dead after a deluge caused by heavy rains late on October 29 and the next morning swamped entire communities, mostly in Spain's Valencia region, catching most off guard. Regional authorities have been heavily criticized for having issued alerts to mobile phones some two hours after the disaster had started. Authorities have yet to any give an estimate of the missing seven days on. Spanish state broadcaster RTVE, however, shows a steady stream of appeals by people who are searching for family members who are not accounted for. Maria Murgui herself has posted a missing person’s message on social media with a photo of her father, a 57-year-old retiree. 'This is like riding a roller coaster. Sometimes I feel very bad and sometimes I feel better. I try to stay positive,' she said. 'This truly is madness. We don’t know what else to do. Neither does anybody else in town.' Relief package While many search for their loved ones, the gargantuan recovery efforts in Sedavi and dozens of other communities slowly moved forward. To aid those in need, the central government approved a 10.6-billion-euro relief package for 78 communities on Tuesday. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez compared it to the measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic. The package includes direct payments of 20,000 euros to 60,000 euros to owners of damaged homes, among other financial aid for businesses and municipal governments. 'We have a lot of work left to do, and we know it,' Sanchez said. Sanchez said that he will ask the European Union to help pay for the relief, saying, 'it is time for the European Union to help.' Many people are still without basic goods amid scenes of devastation. Street after street in town after town is still covered with thick brown mud and mounds of ruined belongings, clumps of rotting vegetation, and wrecked vehicles. A stench arises from the muck. In many places, people still face shortages of basic goods, and lines form at impromptu emergency kitchens and stands handing out food. Water is running again but authorities say it is not fit for drinking. The ground floors of thousands of homes have been ruined. It is feared that inside some of the vehicles that the water washed away or trapped in underground garages there could be bodies waiting to be recovered. Thousands of soldiers are working with firefighters and police reinforcements in the immense emergency response. Officers and troops are searching in destroyed homes, the countless cars strewn across highways, streets, or lodged in the mud in canals and gorges. Authorities are worried about other health problems caused by the aftermath of the deadliest natural disaster in Spain's recent history. They have urged people to get tetanus shots and to treat any wounds to prevent infections and to clean the mud from their skin. Many people wear face masks. Thousands of volunteers are helping out, filling the void left by authorities. But the frustration over the crisis management boiled over on Sunday when a crowd in hard-hit Paiporta hurled mud and other objects at Spain’s royals, Sanchez and regional officials when they made their first visit to the epicenter of the flood damage. Sanchez’s national government is set to announce a new package of relief on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-week-after-spain-floods-families-hopeful-missing-loved-ones-are-alive/7852219.html	2024-11-05T08:22:41-08:00

Iran claims Iranian-German prisoner died before he could be executed	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — An Iranian official claimed Tuesday that Iranian-German prisoner Jamshid Sharmahd died before Tehran could execute him — directly contradicting the country's earlier announcement he had been put to death. The comment by Asghar Jahangir came after Germany shut down all three Iranian consulates in the country over Sharmahd's death, leaving only the embassy in Berlin open. Germany later disputed Jahangir's remark. Meanwhile, even Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has offered his own criticism of Germany's response to Sharmahd's death as tensions remain high between Tehran and the West over its rapidly advancing nuclear program and the ongoing Mideast wars. The judiciary's Mizan news agency quoted Jahangir as saying: 'Jamshid Sharmahd was sentenced to death, his sentence was ready to be carried out, but he passed away before implementation of the sentence.' He did not elaborate. Jahangir's remarks were made to the state-affiliated Quds newspaper after a weekly news conference, when journalists typically buttonhole the spokesperson into answering questions he didn't take from the podium. Germany's Foreign Ministry, reacting to the official's comment, said, 'His death was confirmed to us by the Iranian side. 'Jamshid Sharmahd was abducted by Iran and held for years without a fair trial, in inhumane conditions and without the necessary medical care,' the ministry said. 'Iran is responsible for his death.' Germany added it was 'lobbying the Iranian government to hand over his body to his family.' The State Department in the United States, where Sharmahd once lived, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jason Poblete, a lawyer representing Sharmahd's family, told The Associated Press that the conflicting comments from Iran were 'deeply concerning.' 'This inconsistency raises serious questions about the circumstances of the death and the transparency of the Iranian system,' Poblete said. 'The family has been urging the German and U.S. authorities to investigate this matter to ascertain the truth, ensure accountability thoroughly and reunite Jimmy with his family in California.' Iran had said it executed Sharmahd on October 28. He was 69. Iran accused Sharmahd, who lived in Glendora, California, of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people — including five women and a child — and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. Iran also accused Sharmahd of 'disclosing classified information' on missile sites of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during a television program in 2017. His family disputed the allegations and worked for years to see him freed. Germany, the U.S. and international rights groups dismissed Sharmahd's trial as a sham. Amnesty International said the proceedings against Sharmahd were a 'grossly unfair trial' because he was denied access to an independent lawyer and 'the right to defend himself.' However, Amnesty also noted that Sharmahd ran a website for the Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing that included claims of 'responsibility for explosions inside Iran,' although he repeatedly denied being involved in the attacks. Sharmahd was apparently kidnapped while on a layover in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2020. His family received their last message from him on July 28, 2020. It's unclear how the abduction happened, but tracking data showed that Sharmahd's cellphone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman. On July 30, tracking data showed the phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped. Two days later, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a 'complex operation.' The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded. In the time since his execution, Germany shut the consulates. It's a diplomatic tool Germany seldom uses and signals a major downgrade in relations with Tehran. However, Iran has responded by criticizing Germany and the West, including Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a promise of getting sanctions on the Islamic Republic lifted. 'When someone who has slaughtered dozens is executed, they say you do not observe human rights,' Pezeshkian said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-claims-iranian-german-prisoner-died-before-he-could-be-executed/7852164.html	2024-11-05T07:41:59-08:00	
Brazilian police official chosen as next head of Interpol	London — Brazilian police official Valdecy Urquiza will be the next chief of Interpol, the global police organization announced Tuesday. Urquiza was elected secretary-general by a vote of Interpol's general assembly at its meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, and will take up the post when the gathering ends on Thursday. Currently Interpol's vice president for the Americas, Urquiza is the first chief of the Lyon, France-based organization not to come from Europe or the United States. The Interpol secretary-general essentially runs the organization on a daily basis. Juergen Stock of Germany, who has held the post since 2014, is not allowed under its rules to seek a third term. Urquiza pledged to promote diversity within the organization, saying 'a strong Interpol is one that includes everyone.' 'When we respect and elevate diverse perspectives, we get a clearer, more comprehensive approach to global security,' he said. Interpol, which has 196 member countries and celebrated its centennial last year, works to help national police forces communicate with each other and track suspects and criminals in fields such as counterterrorism, financial crime, child pornography, cybercrime and organized crime. The world's biggest police organization has been grappling with challenges including a growing caseload of cybercrime and child sex abuse, and increasing divisions among its member countries. Interpol had a total budget of about $188 million last year, compared to more than $200 million at the European Union's police agency, Europol, and some $11 billion at the FBI in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazilian-police-official-chosen-as-next-head-of-interpol/7852038.html	2024-11-05T06:15:13-08:00

Ukraine reports downing 48 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it shot down two Russian guided missiles as well as 48 of the 79 drones that Russian forces used in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Ivan Fedorov, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, said Tuesday a Russian attack killed at least six people and wounded 16 others. Fedorov said on Telegram that Russia hit an infrastructure facility. Officials in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region also reported a Russian attack that injured two people and damaged three apartment buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed six Ukrainian aerial drones over the Kursk region. The governor of Bryansk, Alexander Bogomaz, said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties. A spokesperson for the South Korean Defense Ministry said at a briefing Tuesday that there are more than 10,000 North Korea soldiers currently in Russia, including a portion deployed to frontline areas such as in Kursk. The statement, which spokesperson Jeon Ha-Gyu said was based on intelligence authorities, came a day after a similar assessment from the U.S. Defense Department. Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters that there could be as many as 11,000 to 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia, with most of them in Kursk. Ryder said the Pentagon could not corroborate reports that the North Koreans were engaged in combat. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-reports-downing-48-russian-drones-/7851881.html	2024-11-05T03:35:44-08:00	
Toxic smog wreathes India's capital as winter nears	NEW DELHI — A toxic smog shrouded the Indian capital on Tuesday, driving air quality in some areas into the 'severe' range ahead of winter, when cold air traps pollutants and brings a spike in respiratory illnesses. The mix of smoke, emissions, and dust is an annual problem for authorities in New Delhi, with vehicles, construction dust, and smoke from farm fires in the adjoining northern states of Punjab and Haryana among the major contributors. 'The outlook for the subsequent six days: the air quality is likely to be in the 'very poor' to 'severe' category,' said the earth sciences ministry. The city's overall score on an air quality index kept by India's top pollution authorities was 'very poor' at 384, the ministry added, and was likely to stay there until Thursday. An index range of 401 to 500 falls into the 'severe' category, implying it affects healthy people, but is more serious for those already fighting disease. Ministry data showed farm fires have increasingly swelled the pollution over the last three days, for a share of more than 23% on Monday, from about 15% on Saturday. About a third of the city's 39 monitoring stations showed a 'severe' score of more than 400 on Tuesday, said the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), well short of an air quality score of zero to 50 that it rates as 'good.' Swiss group IQAir also rated Delhi the world's second most polluted city on Tuesday, after Lahore in neighboring Pakistan, where authorities also took emergency measures in the wake of Sunday's unprecedented pollution levels. The government in the eastern province of Punjab, home to Lahore, has blamed deteriorating air quality on pollution wafting in from India, an issue it has vowed to take up with its neighbor through the foreign ministry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/toxic-smog-wreathes-india-s-capital-as-winter-nears/7851854.html	2024-11-05T02:40:01-08:00	
Two Chinese nationals shot and injured in southern Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Authorities in Pakistan said Tuesday that a local security guard at a factory in the southern port city of Karachi shot and injured two Chinese nationals, the third attack this year in the country targeting workers from China. Zia ul Haq Langar, the home minister of the Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, confirmed the shooting incident, saying it took place in an industrial area. He said an investigation was underway. Police officials reported that a 'heated argument' and subsequent 'scuffle' with the Chinese workers prompted the guard to open fire on them. The foreigners were taken to a local hospital, where one of them was said to be in 'critical condition.' The shooting comes amid Islamabad’s rare tensions with close ally Beijing that stem from growing security threats to Chinese workers and engineers working on infrastructure development projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI. At a seminar in Pakistan's capital last week, the Chinese ambassador criticized the repeated attacks on Chinese citizens in the country, labeling them as 'unacceptable' and a barrier to their investments in the South Asian nation. It is extremely rare for Beijing to publicly admonish Islamabad over the security threats to its workers. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry, in an unprecedented response, described the Chinese envoy's remarks as 'perplexing' and inconsistent with 'the diplomatic traditions' that exist between the two nations. Last month, a suicide car bomber in Karachi killed two Chinese engineers and wounded another, along with several local security personnel. The Baloch Liberation Army, a separatist militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack. In March this year, a suicide car bombing in northwestern Pakistan killed five Chinese workers and their local driver traveling to a major hydropower project in the area. The attacks have increased the number of Chinese workers killed in the country to 21 since the launch of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) nearly a decade ago, which is a major infrastructure project stemming from President Xi Jinping’s global BRI plans. Beijing has repeatedly urged Islamabad to improve security for its nationals working in Pakistan. CPEC has resulted in roads and highways, primarily coal-fired power plants in Pakistan, and the strategic deepwater Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea in the southwestern province of Balochistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-chinese-nationals-shot-and-injured-in-southern-pakistan-/7851845.html	2024-11-05T02:25:10-08:00	
Chad president threatens to withdraw from regional force after Boko Haram attack kills over 40 Chad troops	Yaoundé, Cameroon — Chad says it will withdraw its troops from the United Nations-supported Multinational Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, which combats Boko Haram in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. Officials from Chad say its military is not getting enough assistance to fight the terrorist group since an attack last week killed more than 40 of Chad’s soldiers. Chad's President Mahamat Idiss Deby says his country will pull out of the Multinational Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, which has some 11,000 troops, because of the absence of what he calls coordinated efforts among member states troops in jointly fighting Boko Haram terrorism. A release read on Chad's state TV on Monday says Deby is surprised at the slow pace at which the task force, a regional group that includes rescue workers, reacts to Boko Haram attacks. The task force was created in April 2012 by Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Benin and Nigeria to jointly fight Boko Haram and bring back peace in areas affected by terrorism in Lake Chad Basin shared by the five countries. The African Union, or AU, authorized the force to operate in February 2015. The force says it receives regular technical support from the United Nations to protect civilians affected by terrorism in the Lake Chad Basin. Deby did not say when Chad will withdraw troops. The Central African state’s president, however, says Chad's military will protect civilians from all forms of terrorism, including Boko Haram. Remadji Hoinathy is a lecturer at the Department of Anthropology at the University of N'Djamena in Chad and a researcher on strategic development in central Africa and the Lake Chad Basin Commission. He said Deby is disgruntled because Chad is not receiving the assistance it needs to track and eliminate several hundred Boko Haram fighters who attacked and killed more than 40 Chad government troops in the Lake Chad Basin last week. He said Deby, who is in the Lake Chad area to supervise a security operation to fight the assailants after the deadly attack, is dissatisfied that his troops are not getting immediate assistance from Cameroon, Benin, Niger and Nigeria. Remadji spoke Monday on Chad state TV. Chad's government sait it informed the task force after last week’s attack on its troops in Ngouboua, a western village in Lake Chad, on the island of Bakaram, near the border with Nigeria. Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria and Benin are yet to react to Deby's threats to pull his troops from the task force. The statement about Chad troops leaving was issued after media reports that the central African state’s military recently deployed to fight Boko Haram mistakenly killed at least a dozen fishermen in Lake Chad thinking that they were militants. Chad's government said reports that its fighter jets bombed the fishermen were unfounded. Belngar Larme Laguerre is the president of Chad’s National Commission on Human Rights. He spoke via a messaging app from N’Djamena. He said Boko Haram hides among civilians or uses civilians as human shields when attacked, but that Chad troops are well-trained to find terrorists hiding among civilians. He said he has not received complaints from civilians that the Chad soldiers deployed to fight Boko Haram last week disrespected human rights. Local media reported that the attack on fishermen took place in Tilma, an island on the border with Nigeria. VOA could not independently verify if there was an attack on civilians. Some 40,000 people have been killed and 3 million have fled their homes since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants degenerated into an armed conflict and spread to Cameroon, Niger and Chad, according to the United Nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-president-threatens-to-withdraw-from-regional-force-after-boko-haram-attack-kills-over-40-chad-troops-/7851832.html	2024-11-05T01:54:46-08:00	
Nigerian president orders release of underage protesters following outrage	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigerian President Bola Tinubu ordered the immediate release Monday of some 29 minors detained during anti-government protests in August after their court trial sparked outrage and widespread condemnation. The protesters faced treason charges punishable by death according to Nigerian law. But human rights groups saaid recent suppression of protesters is an attempt by authorities to stifle dissent. Nigeria's information minister, Mohammed Idris, told reporters that Tinubu ordered the immediate release of all minors arraigned in connection with the anti-government protests in early August. He said Tinubu also called for a probe of the security operatives involved in their arrest and ordered the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs to help rehabilitate the minors. The children were among 76 protesters who had been detained since early August. They appeared before the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday, most of them looking frail and sick. Their arraignment sparked widespread condemnation of the government by human rights groups including Amnesty International. Amnesty said putting underage protesters on trial shows the government's disregard for the rule of law, and it called for the minors to be released unconditionally and immediately. Among the charges they face are treason and attempting to destabilize the government. Under Nigerian law, treason is punishable by a possible death sentence. 'Any form of trial that has a child as a defendant is illegal, unconstitutional and null and void,' said Marshal Abubakar, a lawyer for the protesters. 'We have informed the court through our notice of criminal objection challenging the court's jurisdiction to try those children.' Abubaker said the proceedings were a violation of the children's fundamental human rights. Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission also criticized the trial, accusing authorities of manipulating state institutions to punish citizens. In early August, many Nigerians took to the streets to denounce government policies they said had increased the cost of living. The so-called 'Ten Days of Rage' protests aimed to pressure the government to abandon unpopular economic policies. However, security forces cracked down and quelled the demonstrations. Nigerian police accused the protesters of attempting to foment violence. Before the minors were ordered to be released, Nigerian police spokesperson Olumuyiwa Adejobi said the protesters were criminally liable even if they were underage. 'Once you're more than 7 [years old], you can be charged to court,' said Muyiwa Adejobi of the national police. 'The only thing is that you need to follow certain procedures to do that. The youngest should be 13. So, we have charged them to court on behalf of the federal government of Nigeria, because these are those who actually leveraged on the protests, they hijacked the protests, and they're so violent.' Last year, Tinubu introduced several reforms, including the removal of fuel subsidies, which he says will boost Nigeria’s economy. But citizens facing higher living costs have been pushing back against the policies and have blamed the government for their hardship. Abubakar said the government wants to curb demonstrations of any kind. 'Over the months this government has shown that they are interested in curtailing the civic space and denying Nigerians of their fundamental human rights to dissent and to demand for a better life for themselves,' Abubakar said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-president-orders-release-of-underage-protesters-following-outrage-/7851818.html	2024-11-05T01:36:53-08:00	
India aims to curb judges' arbitrary sentences for criminals, sources say	NEW DELHI — India plans to overhaul its criminal sentencing norms to counter accusations of arbitrary punishment, sources said, following public outrage over the 2022 rape conviction of a man within 30 minutes of trial, by a judge who handed him the death penalty. A higher court in the eastern state of Bihar later overturned the conviction and ordered a retrial, saying the man had been denied the opportunity to defend himself and the judge had acted in 'utmost haste.' It also called for more training for the judge. In response, the government plans to develop a grading system to ensure punishment matches the crime, and help standardize sentencing, so pulling the judicial system closer in line with the likes of Britain, Canada and New Zealand. The law and justice ministry will unveil its plan to the Supreme Court around December, after the court asked the government in May to consider adopting a comprehensive sentencing policy following the Bihar case, one source said. The government sources sought anonymity as they were not authorized to talk to the media. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The source said while the plan had not been finalized, one suggestion was for a minimum punishment that will make it easier for judges, especially those in lower courts, to dole out sentences proportionate to the crime. The policy would cover all criminal cases but the Bihar case, dating from 2021, was tried under the Protection Of Children From Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), which prescribes punishment ranging from three years in jail to death. The source said lower court judges often award the harshest punishment in such cases, given the outrage around the crimes. In 2018, another lower court judge in central India ordered death for a man accused of raping and murdering a baby girl 23 days after his arrest, amid street protests against the crime. The pace of the trial and questions about the legal defense given to the accused fueled concern among some rights advocates. India's judicial system is straining under a backlog of tens of millions of cases, including nearly 300,000 sexual offenses against children, many of them in fast-track courts set up to exclusively try incidents of sexual assault. In September, Reuters reported that the government had slashed its goal of swiftly setting up thousands of such fast-track courts to try sex crimes. The change came after states such as West Bengal, where the recent brutal rape and homicide of a doctor shook the nation, fell far short of their targets regarding such courts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-aims-to-curb-judges-arbitrary-sentences-for-criminals-sources-say/7851812.html	2024-11-05T01:16:00-08:00	
India's top court overturns northern state's ban on Islamic schools	NEW DELHI — India's Supreme Court set aside on Tuesday an order that banned Islamic schools in the country's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, providing a breather to thousands of students and teachers. In March, the Allahabad High Court had scrapped a 2004 law governing the schools, called madrasas, saying it violated the constitutional tenet of secularism, and directing that all their students be moved to conventional schools. By setting aside the March order, the Supreme Court allowed the 25,000 Muslim schools to operate in the northern state, however, providing relief to 2.7 million students and 10,000 teachers. 'The act is consistent with the positive obligation of the state to ensure that the children get adequate education,' Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said in court. There was no immediate comment from the state government in response. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which also governs Uttar Pradesh, has been converting hundreds of madrasas into conventional schools in the northeastern state of Assam as well. Muslims and rights groups have accused some BJP members and affiliates of promoting anti-Islamic hate speech and vigilantism, and of demolishing properties owned by Muslims. Modi and the BJP deny religious discrimination exists in India, saying they work for the development of all communities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-top-court-overturns-northern-state-s-ban-on-islamic-schools/7851809.html	2024-11-05T01:02:06-08:00	
World's first wooden satellite, developed in Japan, heads to space	KYOTO, JAPAN — The world's first wooden satellite, built by Japanese researchers, was launched into space on Tuesday, in an early test of using timber in lunar and Mars exploration. LignoSat, developed by Kyoto University and homebuilder Sumitomo Forestry, will be flown to the International Space Station on a SpaceX mission, and later released into orbit about 400 km (250 miles) above the Earth. Named after the Latin word for 'wood,' the palm-sized LignoSat is tasked to demonstrate the cosmic potential of the renewable material as humans explore living in space. 'With timber, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever,' said Takao Doi, an astronaut who has flown on the Space Shuttle and studies human space activities at Kyoto University. With a 50-year plan of planting trees and building timber houses on the moon and Mars, Doi's team decided to develop a NASA-certified wooden satellite to prove wood is a space-grade material. 'Early 1900s airplanes were made of wood,' said Kyoto University forest science professor Koji Murata. 'A wooden satellite should be feasible, too.' Wood is more durable in space than on Earth because there's no water or oxygen that would rot or inflame it, Murata added. A wooden satellite also minimizes the environmental impact at the end of its life, the researchers say. Decommissioned satellites must re-enter the atmosphere to avoid becoming space debris. Conventional metal satellites create aluminum oxide particles during re-entry, but wooden ones would just burn up with less pollution, Doi said. 'Metal satellites might be banned in the future,' Doi said. 'If we can prove our first wooden satellite works, we want to pitch it to Elon Musk's SpaceX.' The researchers found that honoki, a kind of magnolia tree native in Japan and traditionally used for sword sheaths, is most suited for spacecraft, after a 10-month experiment aboard the International Space Station. LignoSat is made of honoki, using a traditional Japanese crafts technique without screws or glue. Once deployed, LignoSat will stay in the orbit for six months, with the electronic components onboard measuring how wood endures the extreme environment of space, where temperatures fluctuate from -100 to 100 degrees Celsius every 45 minutes as it orbits from darkness to sunlight. LignoSat will also gauge wood's ability to reduce the impact of space radiation on semiconductors, making it useful for applications such as data center construction, said Kenji Kariya, a manager at Sumitomo Forestry Tsukuba Research Institute. 'It may seem outdated, but wood is actually cutting-edge technology as civilisation heads to the moon and Mars,' he said. 'Expansion to space could invigorate the timber industry.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-first-wooden-satellite-developed-in-japan-heads-to-space/7851802.html	2024-11-05T00:34:16-08:00	
Tropical Storm Rafael forms in the Caribbean and could hit Cuba as a hurricane	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Tropical Storm Rafael formed Monday in the Caribbean and will bring heavy rain to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands before strengthening into a hurricane and likely hitting Cuba, forecasters said. Later in the week it also is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Florida and portions of the U.S. Southeast, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Jamaica, and a hurricane watch was in effect for the Cayman Islands and for parts of Cuba including the provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, La Habana, Mayabeque, Matanzas, and the Isle of Youth. A tropical storm watch was issued for Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, and Las Tunas in Cuba. A tropical storm watch also was issued for the lower and middle Florida Keys from Key West to west of the Channel 5 Bridge, and for the Dry Tortugas. The storm was located about 245 kilometers south of Kingston, Jamaica. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 kph while moving north-northwest at 15 kph, the center said. The storm was expected to move near Jamaica late Monday, be near or over the Cayman Islands late Tuesday as a hurricane and approach Cuba on Wednesday. Most forecasts show the storm peaking as a Category 1 hurricane, 'but conditions over the next few days will favor strengthening so we'll need to monitor how quickly it organizes, and a stronger hurricane can't be ruled out,' wrote Michael Lowry, hurricane specialist and storm surge expert, in an analysis Monday. On Monday morning, the government of the Cayman Islands offered people sandbags and announced schools would close on Tuesday. 'Residents are urged to take immediate precautions to protect themselves and their properties,' the government said in a statement. Schools in Jamaica also were scheduled to close on Tuesday, with government offices closing on Monday afternoon. Cuban authorities said Monday night that some 37,000 people remained under evacuation orders in far eastern Cuba, in the province of Guantanamo, due to bad weather. The latest development comes on the heels of Tropical Storm Oscar, which dumped heavy rains in Cuba in October, leaving eight people dead and a widespread blackout across the island due to a collapse of the national energy system. Meanwhile, the Jamaica Observer newspaper reported a large landslide in a rural area north of the Kingston capital on Sunday that officials blamed on persistent rains ahead of the potential storm. No injuries were reported, but a couple of communities were left isolated. Heavy rainfall will affect the western Caribbean with totals of 7 to 15 centimeters and up to 23 cm expected locally in Jamaica and parts of Cuba. Flooding and mudslides are possible. Rafael is the 17th named storm of the season. On the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Patty dissipated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-rafael-forms-in-the-caribbean-and-could-hit-cuba-as-a-hurricane/7851785.html	2024-11-04T23:08:49-08:00	
China warns military members against online dating, gambling	BEIJING — In an unusual warning, China's navy told young officers and personnel that they could get ensnared by online dating scams and virtual gambling if they let down their guard, exposing themselves to security risks and undermining the military. Addressing those born from 1990 who are 'becoming the core of the army,' the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy said in a social media post that young soldiers should avoid revealing their military identity online as they could be 'extremely easy' targets of criminals. The political and confidential nature of the military profession dictates that the military personnel identity must not be exposed online, it said. 'Distinguish carefully and keep some distance when making friends online,' a line in the post advised, and 'never lose sight of your principles and make random friends with netizens.' The navy also cautioned against virtual gambling, which is illegal in China, likening gambling addiction to being 'possessed by a demon' and warning against schemes that could lead to a 'fall into an endless abyss' of debt. China's military projects an image of power, from launching drills around democratically governed Taiwan to deploying patrols in the South China Sea. But President Xi Jinping, also the military's commander-in-chief, has often warned that the armed forces face 'deep-seated' problems from within, including corruption and a lack of discipline. Young soldiers are not the only demographic singled out. Xi has also stressed political loyalty from senior military personnel. At a military conference in June, Xi emphasized upholding the Chinese Communist Party's 'absolute leadership' over the PLA and that the armed forces must always 'uphold their core values, maintain purity, and strictly adhere to discipline.' Xi attributed the root cause of problems to the lack of ideals and beliefs, calling on the armed forces particularly senior cadres, to 'introspect, engage in soul-searching reflections, and make earnest rectifications,' according to official news agency Xinhua.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-warns-military-members-against-online-dating-gambling/7851769.html	2024-11-04T22:19:40-08:00	
Boeing workers accept contract, end more than 7-week strike	SEATTLE — Unionized machinists at Boeing voted Monday to accept a contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks, clearing the way for the aerospace giant to resume production of its bestselling airliner and generate much-needed cash. Leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers district in Seattle said 59% of members who cast ballots agreed to approve the company's fourth formal offer and the third put to a vote. The deal includes pay raises of 38% over four years, and ratification and productivity bonuses. However, Boeing refused to meet strikers' demand to restore a company pension plan that was frozen nearly a decade ago. The contract's ratification on the eve of Election Day clears the way for a major U.S. manufacturer and government contractor to restart Pacific Northwest assembly lines that the factory workers' walkout have idled for 53 days. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees Monday night that he was pleased to have reached an agreement. 'While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,' Ortberg said. 'We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.' According to the union, the 33,000 workers it represents can return to work as soon as Wednesday or as late as Nov. 12. Boeing's CEO has said it might take 'a couple of weeks' to resume production in part because some could need retraining. The contract decision is 'most certainly not a victory,' said Eep Bolaño, a Boeing calibration specialist based in Seattle who voted in favor of ratification. Bolaño said she and her fellow workers made a wise but infuriating choice to accept the offer. 'We were threatened by a company that was crippled, dying, bleeding on the ground, and us as one of the biggest unions in the country couldn't even extract two-thirds of our demands from them. This is humiliating,' Bolaño said. Leaders of IAM District 751 had endorsed the latest proposal, saying they thought they had gotten all they could though negotiations and the strike. 'It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,' the union district said before Monday's vote. 'We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn't be right as we have achieved so much success.' The average annual pay of Boeing machinists is currently $75,608 and eventually will rise to $119,309 under the new contract, according to the company. A continuing strike would have plunged Boeing into further financial peril and uncertainty. CEO Kelly Ortberg, an outsider who started at Boeing only in August, has announced plans to lay off about 10% of the workforce, about 17,000 people, due to the strike and a series of other factors that diminished the company's reputation and fortunes this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-workers-accept-contract-end-more-than-7-week-strike-/7851763.html	2024-11-04T21:48:52-08:00	
US presidential election in the hands of voters as Harris, Trump battle for White House	Millions of U.S. voters are set to cast their ballots Tuesday as they decide whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump will be the country’s next leader. Polls heading into Election Day indicated a tight race, particularly in a group of battleground states that will be key to deciding the winner. Both candidates made stops Monday in Pennsylvania, one of those closely watched states, holding a series of rallies including nearby each another in the Pittsburgh area as they projected confidence in their own campaigns. 'Tomorrow is Election Day, and the momentum is on our side,' Harris told her supporters gathered at a historic steel facility that nodded to Pittsburgh’s history as the heart of the country’s steel industry. 'Our campaign has tapped into the ambitions, the aspirations and the dreams of the American people. And we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America.' 'We must finish strong,' Harris added. 'Make no mistake, we will win.' Trump, addressing his supporters at a sports arena, said another Trump administration would 'launch the most extraordinary economic boom the world has ever seen.' 'If you vote for Kamala, you will have four more years of misery, failure and disaster,' Trump said. 'Our country may never recover. Vote for me and I will deliver rising wages, soaring income, and a colossal surge of jobs, wealth and opportunity for America of every race, religion, color and creed. Every one of them.' Ahead of Tuesday’s Election Day, more than 81 million Americans cast early votes, either in person at polling stations or by mail. The total is more than half the 158 million who voted in the 2020 election, when President Joe Biden defeated Trump. It was a Democratic victory that to this day Trump says he was cheated out of by fraudulent voting rules and vote counts. Dozens of court decisions, often rendered by Trump-appointed judges, went against him as he attempted to challenge the 2020 results. But Sunday, he told a Pennsylvania rally he 'shouldn’t have left' the White House in 2021 when Biden assumed office. Trump has said he will only accept Tuesday’s outcome if he concludes that the election is conducted fairly, which Democratic critics have said they assume means only if he wins. Both Trump and Harris have assembled vast teams of lawyers to contest voting and vote-counting issues as they materialize Tuesday during the day, into the evening and the following days, until a clear winner emerges. A Trump victory would make him only the second president to serve two non-consecutive terms, after Grover Cleveland in the 1880s. He would also be the first felon to serve as president as he awaits sentencing later in November after being convicted of 34 charges linked to his hush money payment to a porn film star ahead of his successful 2016 run for the presidency. Trump has often punctuated his campaign with angry broadsides at his Democratic opponents, calling them the 'enemy within' the country and a threat to the country’s future. He has belittled Harris as a person of limited intellect and said she would be the pawn of other world leaders in dealing with international relationships. Harris for weeks has claimed she is the underdog in the campaign but lately expressed more optimism and now says she expects to become the country’s 47th president. If elected, she would be the first woman to be the American leader, its first of South Asian descent and its second Black president after Barack Obama. She has described Trump as an 'unserious man,' saying he would be a threat to American democracy and unhinged by any normal presidential constraints after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that presidents cannot be prosecuted for any wrongdoing linked to their official actions. Pollsters say the country’s voters are deeply divided between the two candidates. It is an assessment reflected in how major media outlets look at the possible outcome just ahead of the official Election Day. Last-minute polling shows the Harris-Trump race all but tied in the battleground states, within the margin of statistical error. ABC News polling shows Trump winning five of the seven battleground states, but The Washington Post says its aggregation of polls has Harris ahead in four. The New York Times says Trump is ahead in four, Harris two, and the race tied in Pennsylvania. The importance of battleground states cannot be overstated. U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular vote but through the Electoral College, which turns the election into 50 state-by-state contests, with 48 of the states awarding all their electoral votes to the winner in those states. Nebraska and Maine allocate theirs by both statewide and congressional district vote counts. The number of electoral votes in each state is based on population, so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall national outcome, with the winner needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes to claim the presidency. Pennsylvania alone has 19 electoral votes. Polls show either Harris or Trump with substantial or comfortable leads in 43 of the states, enough for each to get to 200 electoral votes or more. Barring an upset in one of those states, the winner will be decided in the seven remaining battleground states, where both Harris and Trump have staged frequent rallies, all but ignoring the rest of the country for campaign stops.

Key county in swing state of Georgia counting ballots ahead of Election Day	Lawrenceville, Georgia — One of the most ethnically diverse counties in the Southeastern United States will be among those issuing early voting results Tuesday night, a reveal that could indicate which of the presidential candidates is in the lead in the crucial count of 538 electoral votes. The victor must receive at least 270 of those electoral votes, and Georgia, seen as one of the seven states where the outcome is uncertain, has 16 of those precious votes. Only Pennsylvania has more — 19 — among the battleground states. North Carolina also has 16. The other wild cards are Arizona (11), Michigan (15), Nevada (6) and Wisconsin (10). It is possible for the declared victor in the electoral count to lose the national popular vote total. That last happened in 2016, when Republican Donald Trump won 304 electoral votes but lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 2%. It could be days before the United States knows who its next president will be, but at the Gwinnett County Voter Registration and Elections headquarters in the swing state of Georgia, workers are already scanning several hundred thousand ballots submitted in advance by mail-in and early voters. The tabulations of those ballots will be released the moment the polls close at 7 p.m. on Tuesday. Up to 70% of the vote total from those already-processed ballots will be known within that first hour, said Zach Manifold, the county's elections supervisor. 'And then, kind of a long night begins,' Manifold told VOA on Monday. 'Our first precinct usually arrives maybe about 8:30, just depending on how much line there is at seven o'clock. But 8:30 is the first precinct. We have 156 precincts that all have to come back. I don't know why, but it always seems like that last one comes in sometime between 11:30 and midnight. 'After you get past midnight, you'll probably have just about all the precincts in and have a pretty good feel for the final — at least the unofficial results — for Gwinnett,' Manifold said. To demonstrate transparency, the media, which is expected to include dozens of TV news crews and other journalists from around the world, will be allowed in the large room where the ballots are opened. The reporters will be kept behind a cordon but not prevented from observing the entire process. Activities in the tabulation room, in another part of the same building, will be livestreamed online. Gwinnett County, with a population of about 1 million, is the second-largest county in Georgia. It is remarkable for its exceptional diversity, with no single ethnic group making up more than about one-third of its residents. In 2023, non-Hispanic whites made up about one-third of the country's population, as did African Americans, according to census data. 'We have a very large Hispanic population, Asian population, Black population,' said Manifold. 'It is a very much a mixture of what is America. And, so, I think a lot of the reason that people are wanting to see what Gwinnett's like [on election night] is, I think, Gwinnett is a lot like modern America.' Democrat Joe Biden's strong margin in this suburban county four years ago helped him narrowly win Georgia and thus the presidency, unseating Trump. Gwinnett County voted Republican every year between 1980 and 2012, but in line with a trend of suburban political realignment, went narrowly for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump, a political novice that year, won Georgia overall in 2016, which was key to his unexpected presidential victory. Regardless of the outcome this week, Manifold knows he will be drinking a lot of coffee from Tuesday morning to stay alert. 'It's about a 24-hour day a lot of the time in these presidential elections,' he said. 'I'll start at our warehouse at 4 a.m., and we'll see what time we get out of here at the main office.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/key-county-in-swing-state-of-georgia-counting-ballots-ahead-of-election-day/7851747.html	2024-11-04T20:35:47-08:00	
Somali Americans gear up for US elections	MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Somali Americans in Minnesota last month took part in a town hall involving Democratic and Republican party representatives encouraging them to participate in the 2024 election, arguing the stakes are high for them and their grandchildren. During a VOA town hall event in Minneapolis, Somali Americans listened to remarks by panelists from both political parties, who answered questions about the economy, immigration, and foreign policy, explaining what their candidate would do to win the votes of Somali Americans. Economic policy While many Somali Americans are traditionally Democratic-leaning, there are rising numbers who support former President Donald Trump, crediting him for stronger economic conditions during his presidency, despite concerns over his immigration policies. Faisal Deri, chair of the African Republicans of Minnesota, urged Somali Americans to vote for Trump, stating that Somali Americans, including truck drivers, experienced positive economic conditions during his presidency. 'Truck drivers’ business was thriving, with a high volume of work and plenty of income flowing in. That brought significant money into the community, and they were able to send substantial support to their relatives in Somalia. But, under [President Joe] Biden’s term, business was down, and many have been forced to park their trucks,' Deri said. Nimo Ahmed, a Democrat and an activist, is the chair of the Somali American Coalition Action Fund. She said there's no way the community will vote for Trump, claiming his policies primarily benefit millionaires. '[Vice President Kamala] Harris will support small businesses, which are essential for many Somali families in Minnesota who run small stores. Trump had focused on supporting millionaires and would continue to do so, but we are middle-class people, and only the Democratic Party truly supports the middle class,' Ahmed said. Habon Abdulle, director of Ayada Leads, an organization that empowers African diaspora women, stressed that it is crucial for everyone to vote. 'Vote for whoever you choose, but please vote, because your vote reflects your values and who you’re negotiating with. Please make your voice heard,' Abdulle said. On the economy, the other questions posed to the panelists included: Why is the U.S. spending billions of dollars on foreign wars while homelessness persists in America? What actions can Harris take to address high interest rates, given the community’s desire for affordable homeownership? In response, Deri asserted that the ongoing wars abroad have contributed to rising interest rates. He noted that when Trump was in office, interest rates were low, allowing many Somalis to purchase homes. However, that is no longer the case, as affordability has decreased. 'If Trump returns to the White House, his first action would be to end the wars and cut foreign aid to Ukraine, rearranging those funds for use within the United States,' Deri said. Nimo Ahmed defended Harris on economic policies, asserting that her policies aim to support lower and middle-class Americans. Immigration policy Trump’s plans for 'mass deportations' as well as tightening immigration policy are also concerns for Somali Americans, as well as a travel ban that affected many foreign visitors during his last term in office. Community members said they worry reinstating travel bans could halt family reunifications, and mass deportations could impact many Somali residents in the United States. Ahmed, the Democrat party supporter, said Trump’s policies would not be good for Somali American communities. 'Trump doesn’t respect immigrants and has referred to them as ‘poisoning the blood.’ We must support Harris to prevent deportations so Somalis without legal status can live with dignity here. When Trump talks about ‘poisoning the blood,’ he’s including some Somalis in that group, so we need to protect them,' Ahmed said. In contrast, Deri, the Republican panelist, argued that Trump’s immigration policies focus on preventing criminals from entering the United States, a benefit to all American communities, including Somalis. 'The deportation policy targets criminals who bring drugs into the country, which especially harms minorities like us. The focus isn’t on Somalis, and each country’s rules must be respected,' Deri said. Foreign policy Ahead of the election, opinion surveys have indicated that many American Muslims oppose the Biden administration's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. During the VOA town hall, some participants questioned why they should support Harris when there seems to have been no significant action in ending the conflict in Gaza. 'I don’t support Biden and Harris for failing to establish a cease-fire in Gaza. It’s disheartening, but Trump doesn’t have anything for Gazans; their lives would only be worse if he were to be elected. I prefer Harris’s party because they can be held accountable, while Trump’s administration lacks that accountability,' Democrat Nimo Ahmed said. The war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, following a terror attack in southern Israel by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. Deri, the pro-Republican activist argued that the Biden-Harris administration's policies have been tested, and they missed their opportunity to deliver aid to Gaza. 'If we vote for Harris, we are rewarding someone who has failed. Trump is a strong leader, and he could potentially resolve the Gaza situation quickly,' Deri said. Amin Harun, a lawyer in Minneapolis, said the division of opinion among American Muslims is a significant issue. 'Some are voting, some are rejecting, and others are supporting different candidates. Unifying the voices of Muslims is essential for expressing their collective thoughts,' Harun said. Abdulle, the director of the Ayada Leads organization, underscored the importance of voting. 'Even if you don’t vote for the president, you need to participate in local elections, vote for local seats so that your votes make an impact,' Abdulle said. Ifrah Farah, a town hall attendee, said there should not be a reason to equate the policies of Biden with those of Harris, who she said has her own political agenda. Farah urged participants to vote, stating, 'Elections are crucial. If you're a citizen of this country, you should vote because it will benefit you and your children in the future.' As the community gears up for these crucial elections, there are dozens of Somali American candidates vying for seats to represent a rapidly growing immigrant community that has exceeded 300,000. This story originated in VOA’s Somali Service. The townhall was recorded on October 19, 2024, and was conducted in Somali. The discussion has been translated into English for this story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-americans-gear-up-for-us-elections-/7851727.html	2024-11-04T20:15:03-08:00	
Canadian police arrest 3 men, following violence at Hindu temple	Canadian officials pressed charges against three people Monday, following the violence that erupted Sunday at a Hindu temple near Toronto where Sikh activists staged a Pro-Khalistan demonstration, according to a Reuters report. Local police say a 43-year-old man was charged with causing a disturbance and assaulting a peace officer and a 23-year-old man was charged with assault with a weapon. Meanwhile, a 31-year-old man was charged with mischief. In addition, police say they have been made aware of the video of an off-duty police officer who was seen participating in the protest. Police say they are investigating that case and the officer has been suspended. The prime ministers of India and Canada have denounced the violence that erupted Sunday at several locations in suburban Toronto, including the Hindu temple. 'I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada,' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the 'acts of violence' were unacceptable. Video of the disturbance at the temple appeared to show an altercation between Hindus and Sikhs that included footage of people hitting each other with flagpoles outside the Hindu Sabha Mandir in the city of Brampton, according to Reuters. It was not clear, however, how the violence was initiated. 'The Hindu community in Canada is feeling that they are not being provided a safe place for the worship,' Arunesh Giri, president of the Canadian Hindu Foundation told Agence France-Presse. A spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry called on Canada to 'ensure that all places of worship are protected' from attacks like the ones on Sunday. 'We also expect that those indulging in violence will be prosecuted,' the ministry said. Sikh activists told Reuters that pro-Khalistan activists at the Hindu temple demonstration were protesting the presence of Indian diplomats. The activists said another rally was held at a Sikh temple. Khalistan is the Sikh homeland that some activists want created out of India’s Punjab state. Canada is home to the largest Sikh community outside of India. Footage of the disruptions posted on social media shows some people carrying the yellow flags of the pro-Khalistan movement. The violence comes amid frayed diplomatic ties between India and Canada. Canada recently expelled six Indian diplomats over the 2023 killing in Canada of a Sikh separatist leader. India’s tit-for-tat response to the expulsion of its diplomats from Canada was to expel six Canadian diplomats from India. Canada has accused India of targeting Sikh activists in Canada. India has said that allegation is 'absurd and baseless.' Some information provided by Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7851724.html	2024-11-04T19:27:47-08:00	
China attempts to boost birth rate amid mounting challenges	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Jasmine Chen has been married for two years, but the idea of having children is not part of her plans. The 28-year-old bank teller who lives in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou said raising children in China is just too expensive. 'Even though anyone can raise children, regardless of their economic situation, I would want to make sure that I could give my children the best possible life if I decide to get pregnant, but that’s not what I think I could achieve,' she told VOA in a written response. Chen is among a growing number of young Chinese women who have decided not to have children despite a growing number of government policy measures, including subsidies and other incentives, aimed at boosting births. Last year, new births in China fell by 5.7%. That’s a record low of 6.39 births per 1,000. In contrast, the mortality rate was 7.87 per 1,000 people. The decline has led to the closure of more than 14,000 kindergartens across China according to China’s Ministry of Education. Statistics also show more than an 11% drop in preschool enrollments, and kindergarten enrollments experienced a 10.30% decrease. ‘Fertility friendly’ policies To boost the country’s declining birth rate, China’s State Council, the country’s chief administrative authority, rolled out a policy with 13 directives aimed at enhancing 'childbirth support services, expand childcare systems, strengthen support in education, housing, and employment, and foster a birth-friendly social atmosphere.' The new measures also include providing maternity insurance to rural migrant workers and people with flexible employment, as long as they have basic health insurance. The policy document also urges local authorities to implement parental leave. Other measures include offering subsidies and medical resources for children and the call on local governments to budget for childcare centers and preferential taxes or fees for these services. Local authorities are also encouraged 'to raise the limits of' housing loans to help families with multiple children buy homes. Despite the Chinese government’s efforts, analysts say these new measures may only have a limited impact on boosting China’s birth rate. 'China is currently facing a serious debt crisis, many local governments, especially those in northeastern or western provinces, won’t have enough financial resources to implement the policy directives that the state council has laid out,' Yi Fuxian, a demographer and expert on Chinese population trends at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told VOA by phone. Fertility rates in Asia China is not the only economy in the region that is struggling with low fertility rates. According to economists, a rate of 2.1 children per woman is needed to sustain a population over time. South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan have been struggling for years to raise their number of births. Yi said since Japan and Taiwan have already implemented similar measures with little success, it will be hard for the Chinese government to achieve its birth goals by rolling out these policy directives. 'Japan put so many resources into these policies, but its birth rate didn’t increase as a result, and the Chinese government may not have enough financial resources to replicate Japan’s policies,' he told VOA. One child policy Unlike most countries though, China had a stringent one-child policy for decades. That policy formally ended in 2016 when couples were allowed to have two children. However, the change in policy has done little to turn the trend around. In addition to financial challenges, Yi said China’s persistently low birth rate is also the result of less willingness to have children and the growing prevalence of infertility among Chinese women, in part due to trying to have a child later in life, according to researchers. 'The one-child policy has changed the concept of childbearing for several generations in China, resulting in the lack of willingness to have children among the younger generation in China,' Yi told VOA. Some young Chinese women told VOA that they worry once they have children, they would have to make a lot of compromises in their lives, including giving up the freedom to decide how to live their lives. 'Having a child and being responsible for it would make me lose the ability to leave for a trip whenever I want to and lose the very free lifestyle that I currently have,' Chen in Guangzhou said. Others said they are terrified of the responsibility that comes with having children. 'I’m relatively healthy. My financial situation is manageable, and my parents even agree to help me out if I ever decide to have children. But I simply don’t want to take on the responsibility that I can’t get rid of once I have children,' Catherine Wang, a 33-year-old woman living in Beijing, told VOA in a written response. Putting off marriage In addition to the unwillingness among some Chinese women to have children, more Chinese people are getting married much later in their lives. According to China’s official 2020 data, Chinese men’s average age for a first marriage was 29.38 while Chinese women’s average age for a first marriage was 27.95. Yi estimates that both numbers are probably now beyond 30 years old. 'Many people won’t be able to have children if they are delaying their marriage age and the Chinese government has done nothing to address this issue,' Yi told VOA. Data released by China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs on November 1 showed a drop in marriage registrations for the first nine months of 2024. It’s a year-on-year decrease of 943,000. Working overtime Long working hours and low wages for certain people, such as factory workers, will make it hard for them to raise children, said some labor rights groups. 'In China's manufacturing factories, workers frequently endure long shifts, typically from 8 AM to 8 PM, with only two days off per month, [and] the combination of low minimum wages and extended overtime working hours has resulted in numerous workers clocking over 300 hours per month,' wrote the editors of the China Labour Bulletin, or CLB, on the organization’s website. A CLB spokesperson told VOA in a written response that unless Chinese workers have support from extended families, it will be difficult for them to raise children. According to Chen, overtime work has been routine for her, and she does not think she can have enough time to childcare if she ever has children. 'Some people may seek help from nannies or older family members, but I think one thing that can’t be absent from children’s upbringing is quality time with their parents, and since my work is too busy, I don’t think I can fulfill that,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-attempts-to-boost-birth-rate-amid-mounting-challenges-/7851712.html	2024-11-04T18:33:08-08:00

Lebanon death toll in Hezbollah-Israel war surpasses 3,000	The death toll in Lebanon surpassed 3,000 Monday in the 13-month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, with the vast majority killed since hostilities dramatically escalated in mid-September and Israel invaded south Lebanon on October 1. The Lebanese health ministry said more than 13,000 people have also been wounded. More than a million people have been displaced in the tiny country. Israel says the dead include hundreds of Hezbollah members. It also succeeded in assassinating the group’s top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several senior commanders. In Israel, 72 people have been killed by Hezbollah rocket and drone attacks, including 30 soldiers, according to the prime minister's office. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, called for 'immediate international pressure' to end the war with Israel, protect civilians and medical teams from attack, as well as the country’s cultural heritage, the National News Agency reported Monday. Israel has conducted repeated airstrikes over the ancient cities of Tyre and Baalbek, risking damage to their ancient ruins. Mikati also discussed the situation with the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the U.N Security Council — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — as well as the European Union. In neighboring Syria, the state news agency reported an Israeli airstrike on a southern suburb of Damascus, saying it caused material damage but no casualties. The Israeli military said its air force struck Hezbollah targets belonging to the group's intelligence headquarters in Syria. In Gaza, Israeli airstrikes killed at least a dozen Palestinians on Monday in the northern town of Beit Lahiya, which has come under renewed intensive Israeli assault in the last month. Israel says Hamas militants are regrouping in northern Gaza, and they have issued evacuation orders for the remaining residents and have stepped up assaults on Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. The area’s hospitals have also come under fire and only three are still partially functioning. 'Indonesian hospital is not functional anymore; Kamal Adwan and al Awda are minimally functional,' Rik Peeperkorn, World Health Organization representative in the West Bank and Gaza, told reporters in a video call from Gaza on Monday. He said if a planned WHO mission later this week is not allowed, al Awda would also 'very quickly' go out of service. The United Nations has repeatedly said it faces obstacles from Israel in delivering aid, especially in northern Gaza. Peeperkorn said there were very few missions to the north in October across U.N. agencies — they 'got canceled, got impeded, got delayed.' Currently, private imports are 'virtually banned' and Israeli authorities are allowing the use of only three crossing points into Gaza — Kerem Shalom, Gate 96 (near central Gaza) and Erez West. 'Furthermore, humanitarian colleagues can only access these border areas by highly dangerous routes,' said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. 'The use of most roads leading to these entry points has either been banned by the Israeli authorities or rendered unsafe due to the ongoing hostilities.' He said the routes available are often in poor condition and prone to looting by armed men. The United Nations is also in the final phase of a massive polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, where the disease has been detected in wastewater. Peeperkorn said the goal is to vaccinate nearly 600,000 children under age 10 across the territory. Teams have reached more than 95% coverage in south and central Gaza, and in the first two days of vaccinations in northern Gaza they reached nearly 95,000 children, or about 79% of their target. Israel cancels UNRWA Israel’s foreign ministry said Monday that the country formally notified the United Nations that it will not cooperate with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, once new Israeli legislation goes into effect early next year. The move follows the Israeli parliament’s approval of legislation severing ties with the agency and banning it from operating in Israel. 'Despite the overwhelming evidence we submitted to the U.N. that substantiate Hamas' infiltration of UNRWA, the U.N. did nothing to rectify the situation,' Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said in a statement. Israel has long been critical of UNRWA and has accused some of its staff of taking part in the October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. Israel has provided little evidence to support its claims, and UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said last week that the agency has received no response to its repeated requests for Israel to provide such information. Where it has received evidence, it has acted. UNRWA is the main distributor of aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where virtually the entire population needs humanitarian assistance. Israel’s letter to the U.N. says the country 'will continue to work with international partners, including other United Nations agencies, to ensure the facilitation of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not undermine Israel's security.' 'If the law is fully implemented and the Israeli government makes it impossible for UNRWA to operate, this will have no effect on Israel's responsibility to provide for the population,' U.N. spokesperson Dujarric said. He noted that UNRWA is continuing to operate in Gaza. A group of about 50 countries led by Turkey has sent a letter to the president of the U.N. General Assembly calling for a halt in arms and munitions transfers to Israel where there are reasonable grounds to suspect they will be used against the Palestinians. 'We urge all necessary steps to be taken without delay to this end,' the letter says. Israel’s envoy dismissed the move as 'another ridiculous move by the Axis of Evil to act against Israel in the international arena.' The letter is signed by, among others, Turkey, the Palestinian Authority, Brazil, China, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Russia, and both the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. More than a year ago, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,300 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terror groups by the United States and other Western countries. VOA U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

Analysts: North Korea's ties with Russia elevate danger to itself	washington — Pyongyang may have bet all its chips on its relationship with Moscow by committing the lives of its soldiers to fight for Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine, according to analysts. North Korean soldiers are gearing up for an anticipated battle in the Russian border region of Kursk. According to the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine on Saturday, more than 7,000 North Korean soldiers in the front line near the border were armed with various weapons by Russia. They included 60 mm mortars, AK-12 rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Some North Korean soldiers in the region have already come under fire, according to a message that Andriy Kovalenko, the head of the Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation, posted on Telegram on Monday. The U.S. estimates that 8,000 soldiers are in the Kursk Oblast to fight in front-line operations against Ukraine forces in the coming days. 'There is no more significant and long-term a commitment one country can make to another than sending troops at wartime,' Victor Cha, president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department and Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told VOA. 'I never believed this was short term, at least from the North Korean perspective,' said Cha, who formerly served as the deputy head of the U.S. delegation to the Six Party Talks with North Korea. Cha added that Kim could face many risks by deploying troops thousands of miles away from home and exposing them to fight alongside Russian soldiers. 'What if North Korean soldiers desert or are captured? What is the future of DPRK-Europe relations? What if South Korean weapons [supplied via the U.S to Ukraine thus far] kills North Korean soldiers? What if Ukraine makes a point of targeting North Korean soldiers for propaganda purposes?' he asked. Long-term commitment Cha, in an article CSIS published October 23, said that by sending troops, North Korea may have crossed the point of no return in its ties with Russia. South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun said during a news conference in Washington, held last week after a security meeting, that Seoul is looking to send a team to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops. When Kim visited Russia last year and began sending munitions the same year, some analysts saw him as largely engaged in a short-term transactional relationship with Moscow. But after North Korea deployed troops to Russia — a move in line with a mutual defense treaty the two signed this summer — and joined Moscow’s war efforts against Ukraine and, by default, against NATO and U.S. interests, Kim is viewed as engaged in an 'all-in' relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin that comes with major risks. Evans Revere, a former State Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea, said, 'Kim Jong Un’s willingness to take these risks suggests he is ‘all in’ on the relationship with Moscow and prepared to make important sacrifices to show support for his Russian patron, in the hope that doing so will yield the benefits he seeks.' Revere added, 'This tells us a lot about what Kim is prepared to do to receive key military and space technologies. It remains to be seen whether Moscow is prepared to provide all the technologies and support Kim wants. If it does not, it will leave the North Korean ruler in a very difficult position.' South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell held talks Monday in Seoul and condemned North Korea’s troop deployment and possible military technology transfers Russia could make in return. North Korea launched a Hwasong-19 intercontinental ballistic missile Thursday in demonstration of what it described as the 'world’s most powerful strategic deterrent.' In addition to technologies Kim might want to further advance Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs, North Korea will receive about $200 million from Moscow for its troop deployment, according to an estimate from South Korea’s National Intelligence Service. 'North Korea is not necessarily wanting to back away from the relationship at the moment because it’s given a lifeline as well as a hedge partner against China,' said Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. Kim is 'willing to commit almost anything that Putin is willing to ask him to do at this point,' Ramani said. Transactional relationship Whether long term or short term, Dan DePetris, a fellow at Defense Priorities, said, 'Ties are still very much transactional in the sense that Kim expects Russian President Vladimir Putin to compensate him in some way, shape or form.' However, DePetris said, 'it’s unlikely North Korea will be comfortable putting all its chips in Russia’s basket,' as 'betting on Russia over the long term would mean handcuffing North Korea to a single power, limiting the flexibility North Korean officials seek to maintain and giving Russia the ability to blackmail North Korea in the future.' North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said Friday, when she met in Moscow with her Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that Pyongyang would fully back Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine until victory. Choe also said Kim had already 'instructed' North Korean officials to provide support for the Russian army 'without regard to anyone' when Russia launched what she described as 'the special military operation' against Ukraine in 2022. In return, Lavrov reaffirmed Moscow’s 'full support for North Korea’s measures aimed at countering the aggressive policies of the U.S. and its partners' and its commitment to implement the mutual defense treaty. 'We’ve long thought of North Korea as a rogue state, but the tight cooperation between Putin and Kim Jong Un now makes Russia look like a rogue state, too,' said Stephen Sestanovich, senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations who served as U.S. ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union from 1997 to 2001.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-north-korea-s-ties-with-russia-elevate-danger-to-itself-/7851643.html	2024-11-04T17:10:27-08:00	
UAE opens its annual oil and gas summit as industry weathers Mideast wars and awaits US election	abu dhabi, united arab emirates — The United Arab Emirates opened its annual oil-and-gas summit on Monday as it plans to increase the country's energy output as global prices stay volatile and world politics remain uncertain ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The massive Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference comes after the UAE just last year hosted the United Nations COP28 climate talks. Those talks ended with a call by nearly 200 countries to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels — the first time the conference made that crucial pledge. But the UAE as a whole still plans to increase its production capacity of oil to 5 million barrels a day in the coming years as it pursues cleaner energies at home. Meanwhile, UAE officials have made a point to dodge any questions about the U.S. election while maintaining their close ties to Russia despite Moscow's war on Ukraine. 'Allow me to say that we in the United Arab Emirates will always choose partnership over polarization, dialogue over division and peace over provocation,' said Sultan al-Jaber, who heads the state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or ADNOC, and who also led the COP28 talks in Dubai. Crude oil prices have been depressed this year. Benchmark Brent crude traded around $74 a barrel on Monday as prices have dropped after concerns over the ongoing Mideast wars growing into a regional conflict faded in recent days. Slowing economic growth in China and ample supply in the market are additionally dragging down prices. In his speech opening the summit, al-Jaber pointed to artificial intelligence as a future technology that could be deployed by the energy industry — and one with a voracious appetite for electricity. 'No single source of energy is going to be enough to meet this demand,' he said. He called for a variety of energy sources to meet that challenge, including fossil fuels. 'Oil will continue to be used for fuel and as a building block for many essential products,' al-Jaber added. Scientists have called for drastically slashing the world's emissions by nearly half in the coming years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times. The 2015 Paris Agreement mentions that limit without specifically calling for a stop on using fossil fuels — something that OPEC Secretary-General Haitham al-Ghais seized on in remarks. 'The Paris Agreement, ladies and gentlemen, is about the reduction of emissions,' he said. 'It's not about phasing out or phasing down or keeping the oil under the ground.' Suhail al-Mazrouei, the Emirates' minister of energy and infrastructure, separately stressed that 'investments in oil and gas need to be taken care of' to support demand in the market. 'We are committed to invest in making more resources in the future to ensure the world will have adequate oil and gas resources,' he said. Hardeep Singh Puri, India's minister of petroleum and natural gas, separately made a point to criticize what he described as his 'ideologically motivated colleagues' who sought an end to fossil fuel production. 'As we accelerate other green energy transition, we will still need affordable traditional energy at least for two decades, if not longer,' he said. Politics was also close at hand at the summit on Monday. Whispers among the crowd attending the opening pondered who would be better for their businesses, Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. Al-Mazrouei dodged the first question by a presenter over whether his country preferred Trump or Harris. 'Of course, we will be discussing energy politics here and I [would] rather not ... talk about the election in the United States,' al-Mazrouei said. 'As a political contest, we wish both candidates the best.' Later, ADNOC executive Musabbeh al-Kaabi said he worried that 'escalating tensions and trade wars may have an impact on the energy transition going forward.' However, he declined to comment directly on the election. The UAE maintains close ties to Russia despite Western sanctions over Moscow's war. An announcer told the crowd where to find Russian translation for the event, while one of the main partners of the summit was Lukoil, Russia's largest non-state oil firm. Meanwhile, the Mideast wars remain a top concern. 'I think the conflict in the Middle East is probably the top risk,' U.K.-based BP CEO Murray Auchincloss said. 'We're worried about the safety and security of our people and the security of energy flows.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uae-opens-its-annual-oil-and-gas-summit-as-industry-weathers-mideast-wars-and-awaits-us-election-/7851659.html	2024-11-04T17:02:04-08:00	
Philippine military drills to seize an island in the South China Sea	MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine military opened two weeks of combat drills Monday that will include seizing an island in the disputed South China Sea and likely be frowned upon by China. More than 3,000 Filipino army, navy and air force personnel will take part in the maneuvers, which Philippine military officials said were not directed against any country. China has rapidly expanded its military and has become increasingly assertive in pursuing territorial claims in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety. The tensions have led to more frequent confrontations, primarily with the Philippines and Vietnam, though the longtime territorial disputes also involve Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Taiwan. Last month, Indonesia said its patrol ships drove away a Chinese coast guard ship that disrupted a survey being undertaken by a state-owned energy company in a part of the South China Sea disputed by both countries. 'Our mission today is very clear, to prepare ourselves comprehensively to respond to any external threats that might challenge our sovereignty,' Armed Forces of the Philippines chief General Romeo Brawner Jr. said in the opening ceremony of the exercises. The maneuvers will include live-fire drills using artillery and assault rifles and beach landing drills. In the South China Sea, Filipino forces would simulate taking control of an island, Philippine army Colonel Michael Logico told reporters without elaborating. Asked how China may react, Logico said he expected Chinese forces to undertake surveillance from a distance but added they would not likely make any hostile move. 'They have a front seat to the exercise. They'll watch and we don't mind,' Logico said. China has opposed such combat drills in the South China Sea, particularly if American and allied forces were involved. The outgoing Biden administration has moved to strengthen an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan. America's moves dovetail with Philippine efforts to shore up its territorial defense amid a long-seething dispute mainly with China in the South China Sea. Next year, U.S. and Philippines forces plan to stage their largest annual combat drills called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder, that are also expected to include maneuvers in contested South China Sea areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-military-drills-to-seize-an-island-in-the-south-china-sea/7851656.html	2024-11-04T16:54:28-08:00	
US aiming for hack-proof election	Washington — Countries aiming to undermine Tuesday’s U.S. elections are being forced to rely on faked videos and other disinformation because they are unable to penetrate systems that could alter the actual tally of the vote, according to the latest assessment by the U.S. agency responsible for election security. Officials at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, said late Monday that with less than 24 hours before polls open on Election Day, there is no evidence to suggest foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China have the wherewithal to infiltrate and manipulate the country’s election infrastructure. 'I can say with great confidence that I do not believe that a technical hack of our elections in the way that it would materially impact the presidential election is possible,' said CISA Director Jen Easterly. 'Given the multiple layers of safeguards, the cybersecurity protections, the physical access controls, the pre-election testing of equipment for accuracy, the postelection audits, it would not be possible for a bad actor to tamper with or manipulate our voting systems in such a way that it would have a material impact on the outcome of the presidential election, certainly not without being detected,' Easterly told reporters. Some of the confidence stems from the decentralized way U.S. elections are run — with each state using its own, individual system to record and tally ballots. But it also follows years of preparation by CISA, working with state and local election officials across the United States. Those efforts have included more than 700 cybersecurity assessments, and hundreds of election exercises and training sessions since the start of 2023. Additionally, none of the state voting systems are connected to the internet, and an estimated 97% of U.S. voters will be casting ballots in jurisdictions that produce paper records as a backup. 'Our election infrastructure has never been more secure,' Easterly said. 'The election community has never been better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free and fair elections.' As of late Monday, CISA estimated that more than 77 million Americans had already cast ballots during the early voting period, with tens of millions more expected to vote in person on Election Day. Yet while most votes have been cast without issue, organizations representing state election officials cautioned there are likely to be some disruptions. 'As with any Election Day, it is important to note operational issues may arise,' according to the National Association of State Election Directors and the National Association of Secretaries of State. 'Voting locations could open late, there could be lines during busy periods, or an area could lose power,' they said in a statement. 'These are inevitable challenges that will arise on Election Day.' There have also been other efforts to try to derail the election. CISA said it has observed 'small scale incidents,' including efforts to take down official election websites with distributed denial of service attacks, as well as several attempts to blow up or set fire to ballot drop boxes. 'We expect that these types of incidents and other forms of disruptions will continue on Election Day [and] in the days that follow,' Easterly told reporters. But she added that despite those disruptions, there has been 'no significant impacts to election infrastructure.' Instead, the bigger concern is what U.S. officials have described as 'a firehose of disinformation,' much of it blamed on Russia, Iran and China. A declassified U.S. assessment issued just two weeks before the election warned those three countries 'remain intent on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans’ confidence in the U.S. democratic system consistent with what they perceive to be in their interests.' Russia, Iran and China have repeatedly rejected the allegations. But U.S. officials and cybersecurity analysts argue there is ample proof. U.S. intelligence agencies have already attributed responsibility for some social media videos to Russian influence actors — including one claiming to show Haitian immigrants voting multiple times, and another purporting to show ballots in Pennsylvania being ripped up. And the FBI has likewise denounced additional videos pretending to be from the bureau as fakes. Separately, tech giant Microsoft last week identified a Chinese cyber campaign targeting Republican lawmakers and candidates seen as critical to Beijing. And U.S. intelligence has previously pointed to Iranian efforts to hack the campaign of former President Donald Trump. Gauging the effectiveness of these efforts, especially the recent videos attributed to Russia, is difficult to determine. 'The successfulness, I would say, is quite small,' said Brian Liston, a senior threat intelligence analyst with Recorded Future’s Insikt Group. 'We have not really seen these videos, or this content break out beyond social media or on Telegram,' Liston told VOA. There are concerns, however, that some of these narratives could gain traction on more mainstream social media platforms, like X and Meta. 'Since Elon Musk took over Twitter and gutted content moderation and really changed the purpose of X, we've seen it become just a hotbed of mis and disinformation,' said Audrey McCabe, an information accountability analyst at Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog and advocacy organization. McCabe told reporters Monday that the changes to X have rippled across the social media space. '[It] has allowed other platforms to lower their standards for content moderation and what they're doing to protect users,' she said. 'And so, we're seeing an increase of this stuff everywhere, including on Meta, and other platforms as well.' And with voters going to the polls Tuesday, there are concerns that the threat environment could worsen. The latest U.S. intelligence assessment, for example, warned that both Russia and Iran are likely to use their influence operations to incite violence, especially in the hours and days after the voting ends. 'They are deliberately finding narratives to try to stoke partisan discord and inflame domestic tension and pit Americans against one another, and we cannot let them succeed,' a senior CISA official said, who briefed reporters last Friday on the condition of anonymity. 'We've seen how these disinformation campaigns have led to very real threats of violence targeting these public servants, and that should be unacceptable,' the official added, citing repeated threats against election officials across the country. CISA’s Easterly said Monday that state and local election officials have been in close contact with law enforcement agencies, and that precautions have been put in place. She and other CISA officials also emphasized that so far, there have been no credible or specific threats to polling locations. 'We've not seen specific reporting about violence at polling places,' Easterly said in response to a question from VOA. 'I certainly don't want voters to feel at all intimidated about going to voting locations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aiming-for-hack-proof-election/7851626.html	2024-11-04T16:11:42-08:00	
China files complaint at WTO over EU tariffs on Chinese EVs	GENEVA — China has moved forward with a complaint at the World Trade Organization that alleges the European Union has improperly set anti-subsidy tariffs on new Chinese-made electric vehicles. The Chinese diplomatic mission to the WTO said Monday it 'strongly opposes' the measures and insisted its move was designed to protect the EV industry and support a global transition toward greener technologies. The European bloc announced last month it was imposing import duties of up to 35% on electric vehicles from China, alleging the Chinese exports were unfairly undercutting EU industry prices. The duties are set to remain in force for five years, unless an amicable deal can be struck. Electric vehicles have become a major flashpoint in a broader trade dispute over the influence of Chinese government subsidies on European markets and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the bloc. China alleged that the EU move amounted to 'an abuse of trade remedies' that violates WTO rules, and amounted to 'protectionist' measures, according to the mission's statement. Valdis Dombrovskis, the executive vice president of the EU's Commission, last week called the steps 'proportionate and targeted' and were aimed to underpin fair market practices and support the bloc's industrial base.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-files-complaint-at-wto-over-eu-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-/7851619.html	2024-11-04T16:00:47-08:00	
Remains of nearly 30 Civil War veterans found in funeral home's storage are laid to rest	PAWTUCKET, R.I. — For several decades, the cremated remains of more than two dozen American Civil War veterans languished in storage facilities at a funeral home and cemetery in Seattle. The simple copper and cardboard urns gathering dust on shelves only had the name of each of the 28 soldiers — but nothing linking them to the Civil War. Still, that was enough for an organization dedicated to locating, identifying and interring the remains of unclaimed veterans to conclude over several years that they were all Union soldiers deserving of a burial service with military honors. 'It's amazing that they were still there and we found them,' said Tom Keating, the Washington state coordinator for the Missing in America Project, which turned to a team of volunteers to confirm their war service through genealogical research. 'It's something long overdue. These people have been waiting a long time for a burial.' Most of the veterans were buried in August at Washington's Tahoma National Cemetery. In a traditional service offered to Civil War veterans, the historical 4th U.S. Infantry Regiment dressed in Union uniforms fired musket volleys and the crowd sang 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic.' Names were called out for each veteran and their unit before their remains were brought forward and stories were shared about their exploits. Then, they were buried. Among them was a veteran held at a Confederate prison known as Andersonville. Several were wounded in combat and others fought in critical battles including Gettysburg, Stones River and the Atlanta campaign. One man survived being shot thanks to his pocket watch -- which he kept until his death — and another deserted the Confederate Army and joined the Union forces. 'It was something, just the finality of it all,' Keating said, adding they were unable to find any living descendants of the veterans. While some remains are hidden away in funeral homes, others were found where they fell in battle or by Civil War re-enactors combing old graveyards. Communities often turn reburials into major events, allowing residents to celebrate veterans and remember a long-forgotten war. In 2016, a volunteer motorcycle group escorted the remains of one veteran cross country from Oregon to the final resting place in Maine. In South Carolina, the remains of 21 Confederate soldiers recovered from forgotten graves beneath the stands of a military college's football stadium were reburied in 2005. Sometimes reburials spark controversy. The discovery of the remains of two soldiers from the Manassas National Battlefield in Virginia prompted an unsuccessful attempt in 2018 by several families to have DNA tests done on them. The Army rejected that request and reburied them as unknown soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery. Along with those buried at Tahoma, Keating said, several others will be buried at Washington State Veterans Cemetery and a Navy veteran will be buried at sea. The remains of several more Civil War veterans were sent to Maine, Rhode Island and other places where family connections were found. Among them was Byron Johnson. Born in Pawtucket in 1844, he enlisted at 18 and served as a hospital steward with the Union Army. He moved out West after the war and died in Seattle in 1913. After his remains were delivered to Pawtucket City Hall, he was buried with military honors at his family's plot in Oak Grove Cemetery. Pawtucket Mayor Donald R. Grebien said Johnson's burial service was the right thing to do. 'When you have somebody who served in a war but especially this war, we want to honor them,' he said. 'It became more intriguing when you think this individual was left out there and not buried in his own community.' Grebien said the burials recall important lessons about the 1861-1865 war to preserve the Union, fought between the North's Union Army and the Confederate States of America at a cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. 'It was important to remind people not only in Pawtucket but the state of Rhode Island and nationwide that we have people who sacrificed their lives for us and for a lot of the freedoms we have,' he said. Bruce Frail and his son Ben — both long active in the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War — were on hand for service. Ben Frail was also a re-enactor at Johnson's service, portraying a Union Army captain. 'It's the best thing we can do for a veteran,' said Bruce Frail, a former commander-in-chief with the Sons of Union Veterans and state coordinator for Missing in America Project. 'The feeling that you get when you honor somebody in that way, it's indescribable,' he said. The task of piecing together Johnson's life story was left to Amelia Boivin, the constituent liaison in the Pawtucket mayor's office. A history buff, she recalled getting the call requesting the city take possession of his remains and bury them with his family. She got to work and Johnson's story became the talk of City Hall. She determined Johnson grew up in Pawtucket, had two sisters and a brother and worked as a druggist after the war. He left to make his fortune out West, first in San Francisco and eventually in Seattle, where he worked nearly up until his death. It doesn't appear Johnson ever married or had children, and no living relatives were found. 'I felt like it was resolution of sorts,' Boivin said. 'It felt like we were doing right for someone who otherwise would have been lost to history.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7851351.html	2024-11-04T15:47:17-08:00	
Russia to launch two Iranian satellites Tuesday, Tehran's Moscow envoy says	Russia will launch two Iranian satellites into orbit using a Soyuz launcher on Tuesday, Iran's ambassador to Moscow said Monday, as the two U.S.-sanctioned countries deepen their scientific relationship. 'In continuation of the development of Iran-Russia scientific and technological cooperation, two Iranian satellites, Kowsar and Hodhod, will be launched to a 500 km orbit of Earth,' Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali said in a post on X. The development of Kowsar, a high-resolution imaging satellite, and Hodhod, a small communications satellite, is the first substantial effort by Iran's private space sector, a report by Iran's semiofficial news agency Tasnim said last month. Russia launched an Iranian research-sensing satellite, Pars 1, into space in February using a Soyuz rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-to-launch-two-iranian-satellites-tuesday-tehran-s-moscow-envoy-says-/7851354.html	2024-11-04T15:45:06-08:00	
Iran executes Jewish citizen convicted of murder	tehran, iran — Iran on Monday executed a Jewish citizen convicted of murdering another man in 2022 following a personal dispute, reports said. It was a rare case of an execution of member of a religious minority in the predominately Muslim nation. Mizanonline.ir, a website affiliated with Iran's judiciary, said 23-year-old Arvin Ghahremani was put to death after the country's Supreme Court affirmed the capital punishment handed down in the case earlier last year. The report quoted Hamid Reza Karimi, the prosecutor of the western city of Kermanshah, as saying the court and the convicted man's lawyers and relatives had failed to convince the victim's family to abstain from qisas — an act under Islamic penal code that calls for similar punishment, or an 'eye for an eye' — and effectively pardon his killer. The victim's name was not provided. According to the report, Ghahramani attacked the victim outside a gym in Kermanshah in 2022 and stabbed the man several times following a dispute over money he had loaned the victim. Jewish citizens are a small minority in the country of 85 million. In 1999, Iran arrested 13 Jewish citizens, accusing them of spying for Israel and sentenced several to up to four years in prison. Many Jews fled the country after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and current estimates suggest some 20,000 Jews remain in Iran. Shiite Muslims make up most of Iran's population and the establishment is led by hard-line clerics who preach a strict version of Islam.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-executes-a-jewish-citizen-convicted-of-murder-/7851349.html	2024-11-04T15:44:44-08:00	
Russia, Indonesia begin unprecedented naval drills	Indonesia and Russia began their first-ever joint naval exercises Monday in the Java Sea. These bilateral drills work to support an Indonesian foreign policy agenda that prioritizes nonalignment in the face of conflict between world powers. The drills have been divided into two phases and will take place over the course of five days near Indonesia's Surabaya city, east of the capital, Jakarta. In the beginning 'harbor phase,' Indonesia and Russia have focused on increasing naval interoperability through ship tours and simulation games, according to a press release from the Indonesian navy. Russia sent three corvette-class warships, a medium tanker ship, a military helicopter unit and a tugboat to the archipelago. Indonesia participated in military drills in 2021 with Russia as a member of the ASEAN bloc, but this marks the first time that the two countries have engaged independently. The bilateral drills come as Indonesia’s newly elected President Prabowo Subianto doubles down on Indonesia’s commitment to nonalignment in foreign affairs, seeking to pursue relationships with all countries, regardless of ideological differences. Prabowo, the country’s former defense minister, visited Russia in July, where he expressed wishes to deepen the bilateral relationship and increase defense collaboration, extending an invitation to Indonesia’s defense exposition this month. 'We consider Russia as a great friend, and I would like to continue to maintain and enhance this relationship,' Prabowo told Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russian ambassador to Indonesia, Sergey Tolchenov, said Monday that the drills were not aimed at any country and could 'ensure security and stability in the region,' Reuters reported. Outside of Russia, Indonesia has looked to further defense collaboration with other countries, including the United States and China. In August, just before participating in the U.S.-led, multinational Super Garuda Shield exercises, Indonesia and China agreed to resume joint military exercises after a nine-year suspension.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-indonesia-begin-unprecedented-naval-drills/7851339.html	2024-11-04T15:18:29-08:00	
Pennsylvania judge: Musk's $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes can proceed	PHILADELPHIA — The $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes that Elon Musk 's political action committee is hosting in swing states can continue through Tuesday's presidential election, a Pennsylvania judge ruled Monday. Common Pleas Court Judge Angelo Foglietta — ruling after Musk's lawyers said the winners are not chosen by chance — did not immediately give a reason for the ruling. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner had called the sweepstakes a scam that violates state election law and asked that it be shut down. The winners of the sweepstakes did not win by chance but are instead paid spokespeople for the group, Musk's lawyers said in court Monday. Musk lawyer Chris Gober said the final two recipients before Tuesday's presidential election will be in Arizona on Monday and Michigan on Tuesday. 'The $1 million recipients are not chosen by chance,' Gober said Monday. 'We know exactly who will be announced as the $1 million recipient today and tomorrow.' Chris Young, the director of America PAC, testified that the recipients are vetted ahead of time, to 'feel out their personality, (and) make sure they were someone whose values aligned' with the group. The disclosures prompted a lawyer for District Attorney Larry Krasner to call the effort a 'scam' that is 'designed to actually influence a national election.' Musk's lawyers, in closing arguments, called it 'core political speech' given that participants sign a petition endorsing the U.S. Constitution. They said Krasner's legal bid to shut down the sweepstakes under Pennsylvania law was moot because there would be no more Pennsylvania winners before the program ends Tuesday. Krasner believes the giveaways violates state election law and contradict what Musk promised when he announced them during an appearance with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 's campaign in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 19: 'We're going to be awarding a million dollars randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election,' Musk vowed. Young also acknowledged that the PAC made the recipients sign nondisclosure agreements. 'They couldn't really reveal the truth about how they got the money, right?' asked Krasner lawyer John Summers. 'Sounds right,' Young said. In an Oct. 20 social media post shown in court, Musk said anyone signing the petition had 'a daily chance of winning $1M!' Summers grilled him on Musk's use of both the words 'chance' and 'randomly,' prompting Young, who also serves as the PAC's treasurer, to concede the latter was not 'the word I would have selected.' Young said the winners knew they would be called on stage but not specifically that they would win the money. Musk did not attend the hearing. He has committed more than $70 million to the super PAC to help Trump and other Republicans win in November. 'This was all a political marketing masquerading as a lottery,' Krasner testified Monday morning. 'That's what it is. A grift.' Lawyers for Musk and the PAC said they do not plan to extend the lottery beyond Tuesday. Krasner said the first three winners, starting on Oct. 19, came from Pennsylvania in the days leading up to the state's Oct. 21 voter registration deadline. Other winners came from the battleground states of Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan. It's not clear if anyone has yet received the money. The PAC pledged they would get it by Nov. 30, according to an exhibit shown in court. More than 1 million people from the seven states have registered for the sweepstakes by signing a petition saying they support the right to free speech and to bear arms, the first two amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Krasner questioned how the PAC might use their data, which it will have on hand well past the election. 'They were scammed for their information,' Krasner said. 'It has almost unlimited use.' Krasner's lawyer, John Summers, said Musk is 'the heartbeat of America PAC,' and the person announcing the winners and presenting the checks. 'He was the one who presented the checks, albeit large cardboard checks. We don't really know if there are any real checks,' Summers said. Common Pleas Court Judge Angelo Foglietta was presiding over the case at Philadelphia City Hall after Musk and the PAC lost an effort to move it to federal court. Krasner has said he could still consider criminal charges, as he's tasked with protecting both lotteries and the integrity of elections. In the lawsuit, he said the defendants are 'indisputably violating' Pennsylvania's lottery laws. Pennsylvania remains a key battleground state with 19 electoral votes and both Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris have repeatedly visited the state, including stops planned Monday in the final hours of the campaign. Krasner — who noted that he has long driven a Tesla — said he could also seek civil damages for the Pennsylvania registrants. Musk is the CEO and largest shareholder of Tesla. He also owns the social media platform X, where America PAC has published posts on the sweepstakes, and the rocket ship maker SpaceX.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pennsylvania-judge-musk-s-1-million-a-day-voter-sweepstakes-can-proceed/7851311.html	2024-11-04T14:51:21-08:00	
US arrests Turkish businessman accused of helping Venezuela skirt sanctions	miami — A Turkish businessman was arrested Monday in Miami and charged with helping Venezuela's state-run oil company circumvent U.S. sanctions. Taskin Torlak, 37, was arrested while attempting to return to Turkey, the Justice Department said in a statement. According to court documents, Torlak operated several companies involved in the shipment of sanctioned oil. Starting in 2020, he allegedly started working with unnamed co-conspirators and companies from Ukraine, China, Indonesia and elsewhere to transport Venezuela's crude oil at a time when most Western buyers stayed clear of the South American country for fear of undermining U.S. sanctions aimed at removing President Nicolas Maduro. Torlak and his associates allegedly hid the identities of transaction beneficiaries to enable U.S. banks to unknowingly process payments related to the illegal oil transports. 'We could use one of the clean names to avoid money getting stuck somewhere,' he allegedly wrote in communications with one of the co-conspirators. To evade detection, the chartered oil tankers frequently turned off their automated tracking systems, a mandatory safety device, when transporting the illegal Venezuelan crude. They also frequently changed the vessels' registry to fly so-called flags of convenience. It wasn't immediately possible to locate an attorney for Torlak. The U.S. started ratcheting up sanctions on Venezuela following Maduro's first re-election in 2018, in which several key opponents were barred from running. Since then, the self-declared socialist leader has deepened his grip on power, this year claiming he won a third six-year term in the face of evidence presented by his opponents that the vote was stolen. The U.S. responded with another round of sanctions against officials accused of obstructing the vote and carrying out human rights abuses. 'The Justice Department will continue to hold accountable those involved in criminal efforts to circumvent sanctions imposed on the Maduro regime,' Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-arrests-turkish-businessman-accused-of-helping-venezuela-skirt-sanctions-/7851307.html	2024-11-04T14:49:36-08:00	
At UN, US confronts Russia over North Korean troops for Ukraine	New York — Russia refused to confirm its plans for North Korean troops it reportedly plans to deploy in its fight against Ukraine, during a confrontation with the United States Monday at the U.N. Security Council. 'I heard the statement [of the Russian envoy], as did others in this room, but the one question still remains that that statement does not address, and that is whether there are DPRK troops on the ground in Russia,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood told council members, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name. 'And my question still stands, and I hope that the Russian Federation will answer that simple question,' he said. Wood was referring to intelligence indicating that an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia for training and deployment to fight alongside the Kremlin’s troops in Ukraine, with some of the North Koreans believed to be heading to Ukraine in the coming days. 'We're not in a court here, and the question of the United States, in the spirit of an interrogation, is not something I intend to answer,' said Russian Deputy Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva. U.S. officials estimate that more than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022. Russia, they say, is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. Ambassador Wood said the Russians have trained the North Koreans in artillery and drone operations, and basic infantry operations. 'The nature of the training Russia is providing to these forces, to include trench clearing, indicates Russia intends to use these forces in front line operations,' he said. South Korea’s envoy said Pyongyang is acting in a 'more desperate and dangerous' way recently, including the blowing up of rail and road links between the two neighbors. 'And now the desperate DPRK is demanding more sacrifices from its own people by dispatching troops to Russia,' said Ambassador JoonKook Hwang. William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA Monday that it is unclear how experienced and professional the North Korean troops are. 'And we don't know how they will react when faced in combat positions. They have not been basically in a war for a long time,' he said. 'So, whether the North Koreans have the ability and the equipment to maintain, to keep in the battlefield, is an open question.' Western nations have questioned what the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will get in return from Moscow for its troops. There are concerns it could include advanced military technology, possibly for its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs, in addition to economic or other support. 'North Korea could benefit politically or diplomatically,' Naoko Aoki, a political scientist at RAND Corporation told VOA. 'And this is a little bit more vague than the other more tangible support, but it is nevertheless important, because Russia, as it has been doing, can shield North Korea in the U.N. Security Council so that North Korea is not faced with further sanctions for its nuclear and missile development, for example, and also basically help [it] over the long run.' She said that would support the Kim regime’s goal of remaining in power and increasing its influence on the Korean Peninsula. On March 28, Moscow took one such step to shield Pyongyang, using its Security Council veto to shut down the panel that monitors implementation of the council’s sanctions on North Korea — sanctions that Russia previously voted for. Ballistic missile launch The Security Council met Monday to discuss Pyongyang’s October 30 missile launch of a solid fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 'The latest ICBM is estimated to have landed in the waters near Japan, around only 200 kilometers from the island of Hokkaido,' Japan’s ambassador, Yamazaki Kazuyuki told the council. 'This ICBM launch is more threatening than ever, as it reached a height of over 7,000 kilometers and a flight time of about 86 minutes — the highest and longest length trajectory of any missile that North Korea has launched to date.' He said its estimated range capability of 15,000 kilometers covers three quarters of the planet, making it the gravest threat yet from North Korea. North Korea’s ambassador dismissed the council’s meeting as 'unlawful' and interference in its domestic affairs. 'Like all strategic weapons tests we have conducted so far, the test launching of our ICBM Hwasong-19 this time, is a part of the exercise of the just and legitimate right to self-defense to reliably safeguard security of our state as well peace of the region involved,' said Ambassador Kim Song. Russia sides with North Korea 'The aim of convening a meeting is the same every time, to make yet another step towards demonizing the DPRK,' said Ambassador Evstigneeva. She blamed the United States for ratcheting up tension on the peninsula because of its recent military exercises with South Korea. South Korea’s ambassador questioned the timing of the latest launch and strongly condemned it. 'Its intention could be to distract the world's attention from its troops in Russia, demonstrate themselves as larger than life, or gain diplomatic leverage amid the U.S. presidential election,' said Ambassador Hwang. 'Regardless of the intention, it was clearly an attempt to advance its missile technology, which makes the launch another flagrant violation of multiple Security Council resolutions,' he said. VOA’s Kim Lewis contributed reporting for this story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-us-confronts-russia-over-north-korean-troops-for-ukraine/7851266.html	2024-11-04T13:39:44-08:00	
Pakistan's parliament extends army chief's term amid opposition outcry	Islamabad — Pakistan’s ruling coalition lawmakers approved a series of bills Monday that extend the terms of the heads of the armed forces, including the military, from three years to five years, despite noisy opposition protests. The legislative action ensures that Army Chief General Asim Munir, who has been in office for two years, will continue to lead the country’s powerful military at least until November 2027. The parliamentary proceedings, telecast live, witnessed disruptive protests from lawmakers of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by the imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan, with some of them tearing up copies of the bills and throwing them at the house speaker. PTI members argued that the government hastily approved key constitutional amendments without allowing for proper debate, calling the move detrimental to an already fragile democracy in Pakistan. They reiterated their complaints about the ongoing government crackdown on party workers and demanded Khan's release, asserting that he is being jailed on false charges. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government dismissed PTI’s claims as politically motivated. 'Pakistan’s parliament has pushed through a bill extending the army chief’s tenure from 3 to 5 years, and with little debate,' Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at Washington’s Wilson Center, said on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. 'The most powerful post in Pakistan is poised to become even more powerful. When a legislature is reduced to a rubber stamp, democracy is never a winner,' Kugelman wrote. Sharif took power after general elections in February, which Khan and his party allege were rigged by the military leadership to keep them out of power. Election officials and the army reject the allegations. Khan, cricket star-turned-prime minister, was removed from office through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in 2022. The 72-year-old deposed leader was jailed in August 2023 over controversial allegations of corruption and inciting violence against the military, among dozens of other charges. Khan rejects all the lawsuits as fabrications by the military, accusing Munir’s predecessor, former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, of orchestrating the downfall of his government. The former prime minister has led a defiant campaign against the military while his party continues to protest in parliament and on the streets, demanding the return of their 'stolen mandate.' Last month, more than 60 Democratic lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to secure the release of Khan and all other political prisoners in Pakistan. The American lawmakers expressed concern about what they denounced as the 'ongoing widespread human rights violations' in the South Asian nation. Without naming Sharif’s coalition government, the letter stated that 'Pakistan's current system amounts to 'military rule with civilian facade.’' Islamabad hit back at the letter, saying it is based on 'an incorrect understanding of the political situation in Pakistan.' Pakistan’s military and its intelligence agencies are frequently accused of influencing the rise or fall of elected governments through election rigging and pro-army political parties. Army generals have staged three coups against elected governments and ruled the South Asian nation for over three decades since it gained independence in 1947. Pakistani politicians, including Khan and several of his predecessors, have publicly stated that military generals influence policy-making even when they are not in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-parliament-extends-army-chief-term-amid-opposition-outcry/7851242.html	2024-11-04T13:26:51-08:00	
What does Harris mean by an opportunity economy?	As U.S. voters remain largely dissatisfied with the economy under President Joe Biden, Kamala Harris has sought to define her own economic policy under the label of an opportunity economy. But what does that term mean, and how different is it than what Biden has offered? Among many contentious topics influencing the 2024 election, the economy remains the number one issue for a majority of voters. With Americans reporting feeling worse off financially despite positive economic trends, Vice President Harris has sought to distinguish her own economic platform from that of the administration in which she currently serves. President Biden’s economic platform has been characterized by support for unions and American industries, efforts to cancel student debt and attempts to pass major disaster recovery and infrastructure packages. Harris has aimed to build on these policies while doing more to address concerns over rising prices due to inflation, and her economic program has focused largely on ways to lower costs for Americans. These proposals include a ban on price-gouging, a price cap on prescription drugs and subsidizing the construction of new homes in hopes that increasing supply will help stem rising housing costs. Harris has also sought to make the case to voters that tariffs proposed by her rival, former President Donald Trump, will exacerbate price increases as companies pass higher import costs on to consumers. However, the vice president has also proposed tariffs in strategic industries such as energy and is likely to retain tariffs on Chinese goods maintained under the Biden administration. The Harris campaign’s frequent references to an 'opportunity economy' combine the Democratic Party’s traditional support for social safety nets and consumer protection regulations with an entrepreneurial message usually associated with Republicans. Besides expanding the child tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, the vice president has echoed Trump’s proposal for eliminating taxes on tips earned by service workers. Harris has also announced plans to provide more loans for new small businesses and to ensure that historically disadvantaged groups can benefit economically from the growing legal cannabis industry. Harris’ California background and connections to Silicon Valley also suggest that she may be more friendly to the tech industry and the emerging cryptocurrency market. It remains to be seen whether a Harris administration would replace Lina Khan of the Federal Trade Commission and Gary Gensler of the Securities and Exchange Commission – two Biden appointees known for their tough regulatory approach. The vice president’s economic plan has received a mixed reception. Many economists believe Trump’s proposed tax cuts and deregulation may help spur economic growth, but a majority polled by The Wall Street Journal have predicted that Harris’ less aggressive trade policy will be better for curbing inflation and the deficit. When it comes to the general public, however, Harris is still perceived as less capable of handling the economy than Trump, although the margin of Trump’s advantage has shrunk as the election draws near.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-does-harris-mean-by-an-opportunity-economy-/7851119.html	2024-11-04T11:51:04-08:00	
Shards of IS Part 1: Forgotten children of Islamic State locked away in Syria	At 21 years old, Noah Soulay is a grown man. He is tall, slim and speaks English with an American accent. He says he lived in New York for some time as a child. He is now incarcerated in Syria. When he was 12, Soulay's stepfather brought him and his mother here from Trinidad and Tobago to join Islamic State. At the height of its power, the militant group held land that was roughly the size of the United Kingdom in Syria and Iraq. IS's land-claim and the terror they inflicted on the world have faded into a bizarre chapter of history. But tens of thousands of its former members from dozens of countries remain imprisoned in northeastern Syria. Also locked away are about 30,000 of their children, many who have never known a day of freedom. 'Sometimes I feel like there's no hope, you know?' says Soulay. 'We are living for no reason. My life has no meaning.' Soulay has been imprisoned since he was captured at 16 years old, holding an AK-47 with men who appeared to be seasoned foreign militants. Initially, Kurdish regional authorities put him in an adult jail, but he was soon transferred to al-Houri Rehabilitation Center, which holds boys from IS families who have not been accused of crimes. Al-Houri is surrounded by thick concrete walls, topped with barbed wire and armed guards. It also has a school that teaches science, music, English and Arabic. It is nicer than the adult prisons in the region that we have seen, where men live packed in small, dirty rooms without fresh air, clean bathrooms, enough food or medical care. But it is a prison. 'If we put them in with adult prisoners they will be radicalized,' says a camp manager, who declines to give his name because he is afraid of being targeted by whoever killed another al-Houri manager two years ago. 'It's a big problem for us.' However, al-Houri is often filled well beyond capacity, and many boys are delivered to prison when they turn 18, regardless of the risk and the injustice. If they are Syrian, they may get a trial and may be released. Foreigners, however, are kept in jail indefinitely. The camp manager now, and others who held the job before, acknowledge that keeping children who have never been accused of crimes locked up is wrong. But they say the countries where the boys came from should retrieve their children. They don't know what else to do with them. The boys say they are deeply depressed and lonely. They never chose to be involved with IS. 'I don't know what's happening with me,' says Soulay. 'I just wake up every morning hoping that one day, someone's going to come and tell me: it's time to go home.' Childhoods erased The younger boys at al-Houri and rehabilitation centers like it were toddlers when they were brought to IS. Some have no memories of life before the militant group. When IS collapsed in 2019 at least 70,000 people fled the final brutal battle in Baghuz, Syria, including tens of thousands of children. I remember watching children stumble out of the military trucks that carried them from a war zone that hardened militants later told us was 'hell on earth.' The children were dirty, thin and bleary eyed. One boy answered a journalist's questions in a daze, saying his father was 'present.' When asked if that meant his father was present in this field, or present on the earth, he stared blankly. The children and their mothers were gathered onto trucks and brought to camps while the men were lined up and carted off to prison. In the years since, some of the foreign women and children were taken back by their home countries, and many Syrian families went home. But most of them still live in al-Hold and al-Roj camps, where the tents are cold, wet and muddy in the winter and sweltering hot in the summer. Sometimes there are schools for the children provided by aid workers, but periodically those schools are burnt down by women who object to the non-IS curriculum. 'We won't go to any infidel school,' Mohammed, 11, from Tajikistan, told us at al-Hol Camp, back in 2020. He later admitted he'd like to go to a school that teaches things like math and English. He just didn't want to be tricked into being a non-believer. Guards call the camp a 'ticking time bomb' because many residents are still IS ideologues. They believe that people they deem to be 'infidels' should be killed. In the past five years there have been at least 130 murders. I then took out a camera and Mohammed ducked behind Halan Akoiy, our translator. Mohammed later explained that at 11 years old, he was close to the age of being taken to prison. He didn't want the prison bosses to see his picture and come to get him. 'Why are they taking our boys to jail?' shouted Asma, a mother shopping in the nearby market stall. She was from Uzbekistan and overheard the conversation. 'What did they do?' Local officials are frank when asked why they snatch up boys as young as 12 and take them away from their families. According to the officials, without outside help, there is no other option. Otherwise, they say, the boys will become the next generation of militants. We asked Mohammed if children here want to grow up to be IS fighters. 'Some kids don't want to,' he answered. 'But 99% of us want this.' Who to blame? There is no plan to stop removing boys from their mothers, and guards say the detention system is expanding. Girls are left in the camps, also facing a lifetime of danger and degradation. Amnesty International says the separation of children from their mothers is unlawful and that conditions in the camps and prisons are inhumane and sometimes deadly. The vast majority of the men and women in the system have not been formally accused of a crime or tried in a court. Amnesty International blames the local Kurdish authorities—the Autonomous Authorities of the North and East Syria Region, which is made up of the civilian leadership, the Syrian Democratic Forces and other affiliated military groups. They also blame the United States, which backs the SDF. 'The U.S. government has played a central role in the creation and maintenance of this system,' says a report the organization published in April this year. Kurdish authorities are offended by the accusation that they are human rights abusers. They have spoken out countless times against the ill treatment of the IS detainees, saying they desperately need international help to solve what they say is an international problem. Dozens of countries took credit in the defeat of IS in Syria, but they have been left virtually alone to clean up the mess. There are detainees from more than 70 countries, and while some prisoners have been repatriated, most remain in Syria. 'We are suffering here in the camp,' says Khorsheed Haval, the al-Hol Camp Director, using a nickname for security reasons. 'Our funding has decreased to only 30% of what is needed. Our healthcare is bad and people are dying, but there is no place to treat them.' These officials say IS attacks never stopped after the group was defeated in battle, and they are once again a growing threat. Amnesty International says the danger is not limited to Syria. 'While the threat of IS remains real worldwide,' reads the April report. 'The violations ongoing in north-east Syria only entrench further grievances and mean a generation of children have known only systematic injustice. The autonomous authorities, members of the U.S.-led coalition, and the U.N. must act to remedy these violations and end the cycles of abuse and violence.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7850595.html	2024-11-04T11:37:26-08:00

Shards of IS Part 1: Forgotten children of Islamic State locked away in Syria	Long gone is Islamic State’s grip on parts of Iraq and Syria. Yet many of its former members remain in Syria, incarcerated in prisons and camps in conditions that Amnesty International says are inhumane and sometimes deadly. Also locked away are tens of thousands of children who have never known a day of freedom.

Serbian minister to resign over concrete canopy collapse that killed 14 people	belgrade, serbia — Serbia's construction minister said Monday he was stepping down days after a concrete canopy collapsed at a railway station, killing 14 people and severely injuring three. Minister Goran Vesic announced his resignation at a hastily called press conference as anger mounted in the Balkan country over the fatal collapse that happened just before noon on Friday in the northern city of Novi Sad. Vesic's resignation needs to be confirmed in Serbia's parliament. 'I would like to inform you that I will formally submit my resignation tomorrow morning,' said Vesic. 'Once the parliament accepts it, I will no longer perform this duty.' Surveillance camera footage showed the massive canopy on the outer wall of the station building crashing down on the people sitting below on benches or going in and out. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Critics of Serbia's populist government attributed the disaster to rampant corruption, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during the reconstruction. The renovation was part of a wider deal with Chinese construction companies. Opposition parties have demanded the resignation of top officials, including President Aleksandar Vucic and Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, accusing them of being responsible for the deadly accident. Opposition groups plan to hold a rally on Tuesday in Novi Sad and more protests later if their demands are not met. Vesic said that he does not accept any guilt for the deaths of the victims. 'I cannot accept guilt for the death of 14 people because neither I, nor the people who work with me, bear even a shred of responsibility for the tragedy that happened,'' he said. 'I urge the authorities to determine as soon as possible who was responsible for this tragedy.' The dead included a 6-year-old girl. The three injured, who are between 18 and 24 years old, all had to have limbs amputated. They were still in serious condition on Monday without improvement, doctors said. Populist officials have accused opposition parties of using the tragedy for political gains while pledging accountability. Vucic on Monday promised those responsible will be punished. 'I am certain that the state authorities will determine criminal responsibility for the tragedy that happened in our country,' said Vucic. Serbian prosecutors said they have already questioned more than 40 people — including Vesic — since opening the probe on Saturday. But critics believe that justice is unlikely to be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not renovated. The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964. The renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-minister-to-resign-over-concrete-canopy-collapse-that-killed-14-people-/7851070.html	2024-11-04T11:16:08-08:00	
Trump lawsuits, complaints target media in closing days of campaign	Washington — In the last week of the U.S. presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump sued CBS News and filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against The Washington Post newspaper. The cases are the latest high-profile conflicts between the former president and news outlets that he often accuses of bias. Trump sued CBS over an interview of Vice President Kamala Harris on the network’s '60 Minutes' program that aired in early October. Trump had also agreed to give an interview to '60 Minutes' before backing out. Filed in Texas on Thursday, the lawsuit alleges that the network aired two different responses from Harris about the Israel-Hamas war. In a statement, CBS said '60 Minutes' gave an excerpt of the interview to the CBS show 'Face the Nation' that used a longer section of her answer than what aired on '60 Minutes.' But Trump’s lawsuit — which calls for a jury trial and $10 billion in damages — alleges that CBS violated a Texas law that prohibits deceptive acts in the conduct of business. A CBS spokesperson told VOA the interview was not doctored. The lawsuit 'is completely without merit and we will vigorously defend against it,' the spokesperson said in an email. Trump on Thursday also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that The Washington Post illegally contributed to the Harris campaign. The complaint alleges a social media ad campaign highlighting the newspaper’s critical coverage of the former president constituted 'illegal corporate in-kind contributions and unreported last-minute independent expenditures.' Trump’s legal representatives allege the ad campaign meant the Post was 'acting like any other partisan player in the election process.' A Post spokesperson told VOA that promoted posts on social media reflect high-performing content from the newspaper 'We believe allegations suggesting this routine media practice is improper are without merit,' the spokesperson said in an email. Gabe Rottman, policy director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, dismissed the case against the Post. 'Advertising by news organizations is a legitimate, routine press function and receives strong First Amendment protections in the courts,' he told VOA in a text message. Trump’s campaign and office did not reply to VOA’s multiple requests for comment on the recent legal actions or the former president’s press freedom record for this story. Power to revoke broadcasting licenses Trump has had a contentious relationship with some news outlets since running for president in 2015. Often referring to journalists as 'the enemy of the people,' he has complained on social media and in speeches about ideological bias and unfair treatment of conservative voices, while also championing media that reflect his views. He has pledged to jail journalists who do not name confidential sources on stories he believed to have national security implication, and suggested changing First Amendment protections to allow punishing people who burn the American flag or criticize Supreme Court judges. Trump had previously threatened to revoke CBS’s broadcast license if elected. On his social media platform, Truth Social, he said '60 Minutes' had 'created the Greatest Fraud in Broadcast History' and that CBS should lose its license because it is 'corrupt.' Following his September debate against Harris on ABC News, Trump called for that network’s broadcasting license to be revoked over what he described as 'unfair' fact-checking. And as president in 2017, Trump threatened to revoke NBC’s broadcasting license after the outlet reported a dispute between the then-president and his military advisers about the size of the nuclear arsenal. In an October statement, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, which issues licenses, said the FCC 'does not and will not revoke licenses for broadcast stations simply because a political candidate disagrees with or dislikes content or coverage.' Many of Trump’s supporters applaud his attacks on the media, reflecting in part the steep erosion of trust in the press that public opinion polls have tracked among many Americans for years. But media analysts say Trump’s attacks echo how leaders in countries like Hungary have undermined journalistic norms. Clayton Weimers, the head of the U.S. office of Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, said the lawsuit against CBS 'looks like a publicity stunt.' But, he said, 'It reinforces the very real threats that Trump has issued to use the U.S. government to punish media outlets he doesn’t like should he regain the White House.' Leading up to and during his time as president, Trump published more than 2,000 posts on social media that the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker classified as anti-media. After Trump left the White House, his anti-media rhetoric has continued. Between September 1 and October 24, Trump verbally insulted, attacked or threatened the media at least 108 times in public, RSF found in a study. RSF has not conducted a similar study about Vice President Harris because she does not make those kinds of anti-media statements, Weimers said. 'By just accepting that as a piece of this political moment, I do think there’s a risk that the American public has grown numb to how serious it is, what an aberration it is, and how dangerous it could be going forward,' Weimers said in a phone interview. Trump’s public attacks against the media frequently play well with his supporters. At many of his rallies, the candidate often pauses after criticizing the media to give his supporters a chance to jeer at the reporters who are present. Last month, Trump’s presidential campaign sent VOA a statement that Republican National Committee spokesperson Taylor Rogers originally provided to the conservative news site The Daily Caller. In it, Rogers described Trump as a 'champion for free speech' and said that 'everyone was safer under President Trump, including journalists' because of 'commonsense law.' Newspaper endorsements Record-low distrust in media in the U.S. is what billionaire and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos pointed to in an op-ed last week to explain why the newspaper would not make an endorsement in this year’s presidential election. Days before the Post’s announcement, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times said his newspaper would not endorse a candidate so as not to worsen political divisions. For some media analysts, the decisions by the Post and the Los Angeles Times have only crystallized concerns about what a second Trump presidency would mean for press freedom in the United States. Marty Baron, the Post’s former executive editor, said he thinks it would have been fine if the Post made this decision a year or two ago. But announcing the decision so close to the election was a 'betrayal of core principles of the Post,' Baron told VOA in a phone interview. 'This is an invitation to further intimidation and bullying, and I think that that’s what we would likely see if Trump were to be back in the White House,' Baron added. Margaret Sullivan, a media columnist with The Guardian who previously worked as a media columnist at the Post, said the decision does not reflect the newspaper’s ideals. 'This seemed to be a move from above that wasn’t about the content of the endorsement,' she told VOA in a phone interview. Baron and Sullivan told VOA they’re concerned that the non-endorsement is a harbinger of what’s to come for press freedom if Trump is re-elected. 'I’m very concerned about intimidation of the press,' Sullivan said. 'And frankly, I’m very concerned about the press preemptively acting like they’ve been intimidated when they have the ability to stand firm.' Both of Trump’s legal challenges against the Post and CBS are expected to take weeks or months before they reach a resolution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lawsuits-complaints-target-media-in-closing-days-of-campaign/7851069.html	2024-11-04T11:15:45-08:00	
Thousands rally again in Georgia to protest Oct. 26 parliamentary election they say was rigged	Tbilisi, Georgia — Thousands of opposition supporters rallied outside Georgia's parliament for the second straight Monday to denounce the Oct. 26 election as illegitimate after the ruling party was declared the winner amid allegations of vote-rigging helped by Russia. The protesters, who waved Georgian and European Union flags, demanded a new parliamentary election under international supervision and an investigation of the alleged ballot irregularities. Opposition leaders vowed to boycott sessions of parliament and hold regular protests until their demands are met. The protest took place under the watch of riot police, reflecting the simmering political tensions in the South Caucasus country of 3.7 million that lies between Russia and Turkey. The Central Election Commission said the ruling Georgian Dream party won about 54% of the vote. Its leaders have rejected the opposition claims of vote fraud. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, says Georgia has fallen victim to pressure from Moscow against joining the EU. Zourabichvili, who holds mostly ceremonial position, has urged the United States and EU support the demonstrations. Officials in Washington and Brussels have urged a full investigation of the election, while the Kremlin has rejected the accusations of interference. Georgian Dream, which has been in power since 2012, was established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia. The opposition has accused it of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. It has recently adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. European election observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. Observers said instances of intimidation and other violations were particularly prevalent in rural areas. The EU suspended Georgia's membership application process indefinitely because of its passage in June of a Russian-style 'foreign influence law.' Many Georgians viewed the parliamentary election as a pivotal referendum on the country's effort to join the EU. Georgian Dream promised to continue pushing toward EU accession but it also wants to 'reset' ties with Russia, the country's former imperial master. In 2008, Georgia fought and lost a brief war with Moscow, which then recognized the independence of two breakaway Georgian regions and bolstered its military presence there. Georgia's prosecutors last week launched an investigation of the alleged vote-rigging. The opposition immediately objected that the Prosecutor's Office would not conduct an independent investigation because its head was appointed by the Georgian Dream-controlled parliament.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-rally-again-in-georgia-to-protest-oct-26-parliamentary-election-they-say-was-rigged/7851020.html	2024-11-04T10:44:51-08:00	
New president says Botswana's smooth transfer of power sets example	gabarone, botswana — Botswana’s newly elected leader, Duma Boko, says Africa can draw vital lessons from his country’s smooth transfer of power. Boko spoke after the Botswana Democratic Party, which had ruled the country since independence in 1966, suffered a crushing defeat in last week’s elections. Addressing the media after an official handover of office Monday, Boko praised outgoing President Mokgweetsi Masisi for ensuring a seamless transfer of power. Boko’s party, the Umbrella for Democratic Change, will form the next government. 'Botswana today, sends a message to the whole world and says democracy is alive here, democracy is in action,' Boko said. 'This is democracy in motion; this is democracy exemplified, sent as an abiding lesson to the whole world to say to the African continent — it must happen, it can happen and when it does, it is one of the most beautiful experiences a country can go through.' Masisi’s former ruling Botswana Democratic Party was soundly beaten, winning only four out of 61 National Assembly seats. Analysts blamed mounting economic grievances, particularly among young people, for the party’s downfall. The former president said he had a duty to ensure that the first change of government since 1966 was seamless. 'I knew I had a responsibility to make sure we set a standard, because we have never had a change of government as in a different party taking over in this country,' Masisi said. 'So the onerousness of the responsibility on me was massive and I had to lead.' Masisi, who served only one out of a possible two five-year terms, said he will not run for political office again. Piers Pigou of the Institute of Security Studies in Pretoria said the smooth transition in Botswana was expected. 'The fact that we have had an expedited and smooth transfer of power should really surprise no one given Botswana’s pedigree,' Pigou said. 'Of course, there are many lessons for the region where such reflections of such pluralism are largely absent. One hopes there will be lessons learned.' Pigou said Botswana has always been a shining example of democracy in the region, backed by independent public institutions. 'Notwithstanding the fact that Botswana has been ruled by one party for almost six decades until this recent election, it is nevertheless held out as an example of democratic practice, strong independent institutions for the most part in the southern Africa region,' he said. 'There have been concerns of late of compromising those institutions, corruption and so forth under the Masisi administration. But I think by and large what this election has showed is that the institutions have held firm.' Masisi said his hands are clean and is prepared to defend himself if called to answer for any supposed improprieties while in office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-president-says-botswana-s-smooth-transfer-of-power-sets-example-/7850964.html	2024-11-04T10:18:59-08:00	
Pakistan: Border forces kill several militants trying to infiltrate from Afghanistan	Islamabad — Pakistan reported Monday that its border security forces killed at least five insurgents who were attempting to cross over from Afghanistan. The predawn encounter occurred after Pakistani troops detected the 'movement of a group of khwarij' in the volatile South Waziristan border district and 'effectively engaged' them to foil their infiltration attempt, according to a military statement. The term 'khwarij' in official Pakistani documents refers to the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed organization waging deadly attacks within the country from its alleged sanctuaries in Afghanistan. Separately, the military said an intelligence-driven operation in the nearby North Waziristan border district killed a key TTP commander. The statement reiterated Islamabad’s call for the Taliban government in Kabul 'to fulfill its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by khwarij' to stage acts of terrorism against Pakistan. It urged Taliban authorities to ensure 'effective' management of the Afghan side of the nearly 2,600-kilometer border between the two countries. Pakistani authorities say the TTP has found sanctuaries in Afghanistan and intensified cross-border attacks since the Islamist Taliban seized power in the neighboring country three years ago, killing hundreds of civilians and security forces. The United Nations has labeled the TTP as 'the largest terrorist group' on Afghan soil. Taliban authorities in Kabul reject the charges, saying they are not allowing any foreign group, including TTP, to use Afghan soil to threaten neighboring countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-border-forces-kill-several-militants-trying-to-infiltrate-from-afghanistan/7850914.html	2024-11-04T09:35:38-08:00	
India's Modi condemns 'deliberate' Canada Hindu temple attack	New Delhi — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday condemned a 'deliberate attack' on a Hindu temple in Canada blamed by some on Sikh activists, as already frosty bilateral ties plunged to a fresh low. 'I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada,' Modi said in a statement on X. 'Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats.' Canada is home to the largest Sikh community outside of India, and includes activists for 'Khalistan', a fringe separatist movement seeking an independent state for the religious minority carved out of Indian territory. Relations between India and Canada nosedived after Ottawa accused the Indian government of orchestrating the 2023 killing in Vancouver of 45-year-old naturalized Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Khalistan activist. While India's foreign ministry has repeatedly denied accusations by Canada, and New Delhi has accused Ottawa for decades of harboring fringe religious extremists, these were Modi's first comments on the furious diplomatic row. 'Such acts of violence will never weaken India's resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,' Modi added. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier said that the violence at the Hindu temple on Sunday in Brampton, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Toronto, was 'unacceptable'. Video circulating on social media appears to show individuals carrying yellow Khalistan flags clashing with a rival group, including people holding Indian flags. There were also isolated fist fights, videos show. India's foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal had earlier said the attack on the temple was carried 'perpetrated by extremists and separatists', and asked Canada to 'ensure that all places of worship are protected' from such attacks. 'We also expect that those indulging in violence will be prosecuted,' he added. 'We remain deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada.' Beyond Nijjar's killing, Canada has accused India of directing a broad campaign targeting Sikh activists on Canadian soil, which Ottawa says has included intimidation, threats and violence. Trudeau charged the government of Prime Minister Modi with violating Canadian sovereignty. India has rejected the allegations. On Saturday, New Delhi denied that interior minister Amit Shah had plotted to target Sikh activists on Canadian soil, and said it had officially rebuked Ottawa over the 'absurd and baseless' allegation. New Delhi and Ottawa earlier this month each expelled the other's ambassador and other senior diplomats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-modi-condemns-deliberate-canada-hindu-temple-attack/7850762.html	2024-11-04T08:04:35-08:00

EU, South Korea urge withdrawal of North Korean troops from Russia's war with Ukraine	Seoul, South Korea — South Korea and the European Union on Monday jointly condemned North Korea's supply of weaponry to Moscow and demanded that it withdraw troops it has sent as Russia wages war against Ukraine. The EU and South Korea were holding their first 'Strategic Dialogue' meeting in Seoul, shortly after Washington and Seoul sounded the alarm about North Korea sending soldiers to help Russia. In a joint statement, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul condemned the North's 'unlawful arms transfers to the Russian Federation for its use in attacking Ukraine.' They demanded an end to the 'unlawful military cooperation' and a withdrawal of the North Korean forces. Borrell also met South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun. 'Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an existential threat,' Borrell said in a post on X that included a photo of him shaking hands with Kim. 'The Republic of Korea is best positioned to understand it. We are united in our support to Ukraine. I encouraged them to step it up.' The two countries also signed a security and defense partnership covering 15 areas including cyber security and disarmament. Cho said last week, when asked whether Seoul could send weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea aiding Russia, that all possible scenarios were under consideration, South Korea has provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including mine clearance equipment, but rebuffed requests for weapons. Seoul expects the North to be compensated by Moscow with military and civilian technology, as it races to launch a spy satellite and upgrade its missile capabilities. North Korea last week flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19. Washington expects the North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, part of which has been seized by neighboring Ukraine, to enter the fight against Ukrainian forces soon, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week. At talks in Moscow on Friday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country would back Russia until it achieved victory in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-south-korea-urge-withdrawal-of-north-korean-troops-from-russia-s-war-with-ukraine/7850671.html	2024-11-04T06:50:08-08:00	
At least 36 dead in northern India after overcrowded bus skids into deep gorge	Lucknow, India — A poorly maintained and overcrowded bus veered off the road and plunged into a deep gorge in northern India on Monday, killing at least 36 people and injuring several others, officials said. The accident occurred in Almora district in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand. The bus was carrying around 60 people, and more than 20 have been injured, said Deepak Rawat, a senior state government official. Authorities said earlier they believed there were 42 passengers, which was how many people the bus could accommodate. Teams of rescue and relief workers were deployed to the site and officials feared the death toll may rise further, especially as seven passengers in hospital were in critical condition. Television footage showed parts of the bus mangled and destroyed as it lay overturned on a rocky slope, close to a stream. Rescuers were seen working to pull out passengers and carrying bodies on stretchers. The state's chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami earlier said rescue teams were working to quickly evacuate the injured passengers to nearby hospitals and that authorities have been instructed to airlift those seriously hurt. The state government has opened an investigation into the accident, said Vineet Pal, another official in the state. He added that preliminary information suggested that the dilapidated bus skidded before tumbling down a 60 meter-deep gorge. A number of passengers managed to escape or were thrown out by the impact, and then alerted authorities about the accident. Two transport officials have been suspended for approving a bus that was in poor condition, Pal said. India has some of the highest road death rates in the world, with hundreds of thousands of people killed and injured annually. Most crashes are blamed on reckless driving, poorly maintained roads and aging vehicles. In July, at least 18 people died after a double-decker passenger bus collided with a milk truck in Uttar Pradesh state. In May, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims skidded and rolled into a deep gorge on a mountainous highway in Indian-controlled Kashmir, killing at least 21 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/northern-india-uttarakhand-overcrowded-bus-accident/7850623.html	2024-11-04T06:36:53-08:00	
Trial opens in France in beheading of teacher over prophet cartoons	Paris — The trial of eight people in Paris on terrorism charges started on Monday over the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, who was killed by an Islamic extremist after showing caricatures of Islam's prophet to his middle school students for a lesson on freedom of expression. Paty's shocking death left an imprint on France, and several schools are now named after him. Paty was killed outside his school near Paris on Oct. 16, 2020, by an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, who was shot to death by police. Those on trial include friends of assailant Abdoullakh Anzorov who allegedly helped purchase weapons for the attack, as well as people who are accused of spreading false information online about the teacher and his class. The proceedings started Monday in the presence of members of Paty's family, including his two sisters. The trial was held under high security, with many police officers patrolling and making checks outside and inside the courtroom. Five of the accused, who are currently imprisoned, were seated in a wide glass box. Three others, placed under judicial supervision, sat on the defendants' benches outside the box. France's secularism at stake The attack occurred against a backdrop of protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty's death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists. The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty's killing reinforced the French state's commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life. 'We expect that the justice system will be up to the crime that has been committed,' Francis Szpiner, the lawyer representing Paty's 9-year-old son, told reporters. 'It's an unheard-of event in the history of the republic. It's the first time a teacher has been assassinated because he is a teacher.' Thibault de Montbrial, a lawyer for Paty's sister, Mickaelle Paty, said the trial 'will enable everybody in French society to become aware of the direct link, extremely clear, that exists between fundamentalist Islam ... and the violence that can lead to such a terrifying act.' A student's father among the accused Much attention at the trial will focus on Brahim Chnina, the Muslim father of a teenager who was 13 at the time and claimed that she had been excluded from Paty's class when he showed the caricatures on Oct. 5, 2020. Chnina, 52, sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that 'this sick man' needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina's daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question. Paty was giving a lesson mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom. An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher's head on social media. Police later shot Anzorov as he advanced towards them armed. Chnina will be tried for alleged association with a terrorist enterprise for targeting the 47-year-old teacher through false information. His daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty's school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth, who pointed out Paty to Anzorov in exchange for money, was given a 6-month term with an electronic bracelet. A figure promoting radical Islam involved Abdelhakim Sefrioui, 65, is another key figure in the trial opening Monday for the adult suspects. He presented himself as a spokesperson for Imams of France, although he had been dismissed from that role. He filmed a video in front of the school with the father of the student. He referred to the teacher as a 'thug' multiple times and sought to pressure the school administration via social media. Sefrioui founded the pro-Hamas Cheikh Yassine Collective in 2004, which was dissolved a few days after Paty's killing. Sefrioui had long criticized and threatened Muslims who advocate friendship with Jews, including the rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris. Sefrioui and Chnina face 30 years in prison if convicted. Chnina denied any incitement to 'kill' in his messages and video, claiming he did not intend to incite hatred and violence, according to judicial documents. Sefrioui's lawyer, Ouadie Elhamamouchi, said he will seek to prove his client is 'innocent' and that the video filmed by Sefrioui in front of the school was not seen by the attacker. 'In this case, he is the only one who never had any link with the terrorist,' Elhamamouchi said. Others face charges of complicity Anzorov, who had wanted to go to Syria to fight with Islamic extremists there, discovered Paty's name on jihadist social media channels, according to investigators. Anzorov lived 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Paty's school and did not know the teacher. Two of Anzorov's friends face life imprisonment if convicted on charges of complicity in murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise. Naim Boudaoud, 22, and Azim Epsirkhanov, 23, are accused of helping Anzorov buy a knife and a pellet gun. Boudaoud also drove Anzorov to Paty's school. They turned themselves in at the police station, and deny being aware of the attacker's intentions. The other four individuals are charged with criminal terrorist conspiracy for communicating with the killer on pro-jihad Snapchat groups. They all deny being aware of the intent to kill Paty. On Oct. 13, 2023, another teacher in France was killed by a radical Islamist from Russia, originally from Ingushetia, a region bordering Chechnya.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-opens-in-france-in-beheading-of-teacher-over-prophet-cartoons/7850565.html	2024-11-04T05:59:39-08:00	
Spain deploys 7,500 troops to flood zone where anger rises at slow help	PAIPORTA, Spain — Spain is deploying 7,500 troops to its eastern region hit by devastating floods, the government said on Monday in the face of rising discontent over the response to the catastrophe that has killed at least 217 people. The army sent about 5,000 soldiers over the weekend to help distribute food and water, clean up streets and protect shops and properties from looters. A further 2,500 would join them, Defense Minister Margarita Robles told state-owned radio RNE. A warship carrying 104 marine infantry soldiers as well as trucks with food and water was approaching Valencia port even as a strong hailstorm pummeled Barcelona some 300 km to the north. Rescue teams on Monday were searching for bodies in underground garages including a 5,000-car park at Bonaire shopping mall near Valencia airport as well as river mouths where currents may have deposited bodies. Fatalities from Spain's worst flash floods in modern history edged higher to 217 on Sunday - almost all of them in the Valencia region and more than 60 in the suburb of Paiporta. Local residents' anger was focused on late alerts from authorities about the dangers of flooding and a perceived delayed response by emergency services. On Sunday, some residents in Paiporta slung mud at Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and King Felipe and his wife Queen Letizia, chanting: 'murderers, murderers!' Transport Minister Oscar Puente said on Sunday the death toll had stabilized because all victims on the surface had been identified. The torrential rains on Tuesday and Wednesday caused rivers to swell, engulfing streets and the ground floors of buildings, and sweeping away cars and pieces of masonry in tides of mud. It was the worst flood-related disaster in Europe in five decades Even though rainfalls have continued during the rest of the week, there has been no more major flooding in the area. The weather agency issued a warning on Monday morning for Barcelona as hailstorm and heavy rains hit Spain's second largest city. Some of Sunday's protesters wore clothing with the symbols of far-right organizations that often stage protests against the leftist government. Robles said extremist groups were taking advantage of the situation for political gains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-deploys-7-500-troops-to-flood-zone-where-anger-rises-at-slow-help/7850383.html	2024-11-04T02:37:52-08:00	
French prosecutors drop harassment probe into ex-soccer chief Le Graet	Paris — French prosecutors on Monday said they had dropped an investigation into sexual and moral harassment allegations against former French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet. The preliminary inquiry, opened in January 2023, was closed on Oct. 17 due to insufficient evidence, the Paris public prosecution office said in e-mailed comments. Le Graet, 82, who had led the federation since 2011, resigned in February but denied any wrongdoing. His departure followed a government audit that concluded he no longer had 'the necessary legitimacy' to lead French soccer. French papers L'Equipe and Le Monde first reported that the investigation into Le Graet had been dropped. 'I lived through a nightmare, but being cleared in this affair brings some comfort,' Le Graet told L'Equipe in an interview published on Monday, adding that he felt anger but also relief.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-prosecutors-drop-harassment-probe-into-ex-soccer-chief-le-graet-/7850372.html	2024-11-04T02:22:41-08:00	
Malaysia complains to Vietnam over South China Sea reef expansion, sources say	Malaysia has sent a complaint letter to Vietnam over its alleged expansion of a South China Sea reef that both countries claim as their own, two officials told Reuters, in a rare bilateral escalation not involving China. The move brings to light another of the multiple disputes in the strategic waterway, most of which China claims sovereignty over, with Beijing involved in frequent altercations with the Philippines and sporadic rows with Vietnam. The most contested features are around the Spratly archipelago, where China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and the Philippines all have various claims and degrees of occupation. Malaysia's letter was sent to Vietnam's foreign ministry in early October but has so far received no reply, the two officials said, declining to be identified more precisely because the matter was sensitive. The complaint was over Vietnam's alleged artificial expansion of the Barque Canada Reef, an islet in the Spratlys where Vietnam has built numerous infrastructure, according to satellite images analyzed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, which were released last month. In late October, Radio Free Asia reported that Vietnam was also building an airstrip on the reef. Vietnam's foreign ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Malaysia's foreign ministry did not comment. The letter preceded those publications and only criticized the enlargement of the islet, not the building of infrastructure, one of the officials said. The tiny Spratly islands have seen significant construction in recent years as countries seek to bolster their territorial claims and prove they can sustain human habitation on dozens of islets and features. China's activities have attracted the most attention, with seven islands built on submerged reefs, some equipped with runways, docks, control towers and missile batteries. Though complaints between Malaysia and Vietnam over territory are rare, Malaysia has taken issue regularly over what it says is encroachment by Vietnamese fishermen into its Exclusive Economic Zone, leading to the arrest of some crew.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-complains-to-vietnam-over-south-china-sea-reef-expansion-sources-say/7850369.html	2024-11-04T02:14:22-08:00	
India's factory growth accelerates in October, purchasing managers’ data shows	BENGALURU, India — India's manufacturing growth gained momentum in October after decelerating for three months as demand improved significantly, helping in job creation and leading to a better business outlook, according to a business survey released on Monday. The HSBC final India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, rose to 57.5 in October from an eight-month low of 56.5 in September and was above a preliminary estimate of 57.4. 'India's headline manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers’ index) picked up substantially in October as the economy's operating conditions continue to broadly improve,' noted Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC. 'Rapidly expanding new orders and international sales reflect strong demand growth for India's manufacturing sector.' The output and new orders sub-indexes rose to three-month highs with a notable increase in demand. International demand improved from a year-and-a-half low in September. A desire for Indian goods led to orders from Asia, Europe, Latin America and the U.S. Buoyant demand also boosted the outlook for the year ahead. 'Business confidence is also very high due to expectations of continued strong consumer demand, new product releases, and sales pending approval,' Bhandari said. To meet growing demand, firms took on many more workers than in September. Hiring increased for an eighth consecutive month. That would probably bring some relief to the government, which has failed to create enough well-paying jobs for those entering the workforce. Economists cautioned job creation will remain muted over the next 12 months, a Reuters poll published a week ago showed. Inflationary pressures increased with both input and output prices rising faster. Input cost inflation was the highest in three months, elevated by higher material costs, wage bills and transportation fees. Firms passed on the extra costs to their clients at a much quicker pace than in September. India's inflation rose to a nine-month high of 5.49% in September, largely driven by higher food prices and close to the upper end of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) 2-6% target. Despite that, a separate Reuters poll last week showed a slim majority of economists expected the RBI to cut interest rates in December, to 6.25% from 6.50% currently.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-factory-growth-accelerates-in-october-purchasing-managers-data-shows/7850363.html	2024-11-04T02:03:29-08:00	
German foreign minister pledges Ukraine support in Kyiv visit	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock pledged her country’s support for Ukraine during a visit Monday to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian leaders. Baerbock said Ukraine needs support amid Russian airstrikes as its heads into another winter season, and with the added threat of North Korean military support for Russia. 'We are countering this brutality with our humanity and support, so that Ukrainians can not only survive the winter, but so that their country can survive. Because they are also defending the freedom of all of us in Europe,' Baerbock said. Ukraine’s military said Monday the country’s air defenses shot down 50 of the 80 drones that Russian forces used in overnight attacks targeting areas across the country. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Kharkiv reported Monday that Russian aerial attacks injured at least 13 people. In Kyiv, officials said falling debris from downed drones sparked several fires in the Ukrainian capital. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it shot down one Ukrainian drone over the Belgorod region that sits along the Russia-Ukraine border.

Public funding for nature conservation stalls at COP16, eyes on private investment	CALI, Colombia — Wealthy nations appeared to hit a limit with how much they are willing to pay to conserve nature around the world, instead shifting their focus at the two-week U.N. biodiversity summit toward discussions of private money filling the funding gap. At the COP16 negotiations in Cali, Colombia, countries failed to figure out how they would mobilize $200 billion annually in conservation funding by 2030, including $30 billion that would come directly from rich nations. That money, pledged two years ago as part of the landmark Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework agreement, is meant to finance activities that boost nature, such as sustainable farming or patrolling wildlife reserves. But there was no consensus as talks dragged on beyond the summit's scheduled end on Friday, during which dozens of delegations departed. By Saturday morning's roll call, there was no longer a quorum among the nearly 200 nations for an agreement to pass, forcing organizers to abruptly suspend the meeting. 'I am both saddened and enraged by the non-outcome of COP16,' said Shilps Gautam, chief executive of project finance firm Opna. 'The wild thing about the nature financing discussions is that the numbers discussed are already a pittance.' Human activities such as farming, mining, and urban development are increasingly pushing nature into crisis, with 1 million or so plant and animal species thought to be at risk of extinction. Climate change, a result of fossil fuel burning, is also adding to nature's woes by raising temperatures and disrupting weather cycles. Countries will meet again in Azerbaijan next week for the U.N.'s COP29 climate summit, which again will be focused on the steep need for funding from wealthy nations to their poorer counterparts to help shoulder climate costs. Little money from rich nations Even before the talks broke down, developed nations had signaled an unwillingness to offer large amounts of cash. European governments including Germany and the Netherlands have slashed their foreign aid budgets over the last year, while France and the U.K. are also cutting back. Government development money specifically targeted at nature conservation abroad fell to $3.8 billion in 2022 compared with $4.6 billion in 2015, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. At COP16, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres demanded that countries make significant new contributions to the Global Biodiversity Framework Fund. The response was muted. Nations at COP16 pledged $163 million in contributions to the fund, bringing total contributions to roughly $400 million - far from a major contribution to the $30 billion target from nations by 2030. The United States, which is not a party to U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity, has not contributed. 'The public money is already leveraged as much as we can,' Florika Fink-Hooijer, the European Union's director general of environment, told reporters at the summit. 'We now have to look at other sources of funding.' Private cash When it came to going after private capital, delegates at the COP16 summit agreed to a plan to charge pharmaceutical and other companies for their use of genetic information in the research and development of new commercial products. Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca and Land Sanofi did not respond to request for comment on the deal. Experts estimate the plan could generate about $1 billion annually. That still doesn't cover the billions needed to halt the collapse of ecosystems, like the Amazon rainforest or coral reefs. The world will need to devise ways for enticing private investment in nature-friendly projects, said Marcos Neto, director of global policy at the U.N. Development Program. Some tools include green bonds or debt-for-nature swaps, whereby countries refinance their debt at lower interest rates in order to spend the savings on conservation. The World Economic Forum estimates that debt-for-nature swaps could generate $100 billion in nature funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/public-funding-for-nature-conservation-stalls-at-cop16-eyes-on-private-investment/7850354.html	2024-11-04T01:37:37-08:00	
Turkey replaces pro-Kurdish mayors with state officials in southeast	ISTANBUL, Turkey — Turkey stripped three elected pro-Kurdish mayors of their posts in southeastern cities on Monday, for convictions and charges on terrorism-related offenses, the interior ministry said, appointing state officials in their places instead. Local governors replaced the mayors in the provincial centers of Mardin and Batman, while the mayor of Halfeti in Sanliurfa province was also unseated, it said. All belonged to the pro-Kurdish DEM Party, which has 57 seats in the national parliament. Dozens of pro-Kurdish mayors from its predecessor parties have been removed from their posts on similar charges in the past. Last week, a mayor from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) was arrested after prosecutors accused him of belonging to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), banned as a terrorist group in Turkey. The changes followed a proposal by President Tayyip's Erdogan main ally last month aimed at ending the state's 40-year conflict with the PKK.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-replaces-pro-kurdish-mayors-with-state-officials-in-southeast/7850347.html	2024-11-04T01:27:15-08:00	
Central bank independence challenged in many countries, Thai bank governor says	BANGKOK — The independence of central banks is being challenged and they have come under more pressure lately than at any time in the past decade, the Bank of Thailand chief said, according to a speech transcript released on Monday. 'Central bank independence in many countries, including Thailand, is being challenged despite having done a reasonable job over past decades,' Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput said in remarks made at the Bank of International Settlements annual conference in Switzerland, an undated transcript of which the Bank of Thailand released on Monday. 'If we allow central bank independence to be eroded, we will not be able to deliver on our core mandates,' the governor said. The conference took place on June 28, according to the Bank of International Settlements website, which on Oct. 30 published a paper with transcripts of remarks made at the event by several central bank governors, including Sethaput. The Bank of Thailand later on Monday removed the transcript from its site. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments were delivered at a time when the Bank of Thailand had clashed with Thailand's government over monetary policy, with the central bank until last month coming under near-daily pressure to cut interest rates to help spur growth. The Bank of Thailand unexpectedly cut its benchmark rate to 2.25% in October, but has since stressed that it was not embarking on an easing cycle and said the move was a 'recalibration' and not a caving to political pressure. Former Bank of Thailand governors last week expressed their concern that a candidate for the role of central bank board chairman had 'close political ties,' widely seen as referring to the government's nominee, a critic of the current governor. The Thai government has maintained it respects the Bank of Thailand's independence, but wants it to do more to help it revive the economy, growth of which has been tepid. The Bank of Thailand on Monday said the decision on a candidate had been delayed until next week, the second time it has been postponed. The finance minister said the role had limited authority and the delay would not impact the central bank's work. In the remarks at the conference in Switzerland in June, Sethaput also said unconventional policies such as expanding balance sheets and pervasive crisis measures had expanded central banks' footprints in private markets and raised expectations on what a central bank can achieve. 'It results in not just moving the goalpost but also adding more goalposts. As expectations increase, it becomes harder to ring-fence our reputation, credibility and the case for central bank independence,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-bank-independence-challenged-in-many-countries-thai-bank-governor-says/7850337.html	2024-11-04T00:50:41-08:00	
French families sue TikTok over alleged failure to remove harmful content	PARIS — Seven French families have filed a lawsuit against social media giant TikTok, accusing the platform of exposing their adolescent children to harmful content that led to two of them taking their own lives at 15, their lawyer said on Monday. The lawsuit alleges TikTok's algorithm exposed the seven teenagers to videos promoting suicide, self-harm and eating disorders, lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion told broadcaster franceinfo. The families are taking joint legal action in the Créteil judicial court. Boutron-Marmion said it was the first such grouped case in Europe. 'The parents want TikTok's legal liability to be recognized in court,' she said, adding: 'This is a commercial company offering a product to consumers who are, in addition, minors. They must, therefore, answer for the product's shortcomings.' TikTok, like other social media platforms, has long faced scrutiny over the policing of content on its app. As with Meta's Facebook and Instagram, it faces hundreds of lawsuits in the U.S. accusing them of enticing and addicting millions of children to their platforms, damaging their mental health. TikTok could not immediately be reached for comment on the allegations. The company has previously said it took issues that were linked to children's mental health seriously. CEO Shou Zi Chew this year told U.S. lawmakers the company has invested in measures to protect young people who use the app.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-families-sue-tiktok-over-alleged-failure-to-remove-harmful-content/7850334.html	2024-11-04T00:32:28-08:00	
Music titan Quincy Jones dies at 91	Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic 'Thriller' album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91. Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family. 'Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones' passing,' the family said in a statement. 'And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.' Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him. Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for 'Roots' and 'In the Heat of the Night,' organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of 'We Are the World,' the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa. Lionel Richie, who co-wrote 'We Are the World' and was among the featured singers, would call Jones 'the master orchestrator.' In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, top honors likely go to his productions with Jackson: 'Off the Wall,' 'Thriller' and 'Bad' were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones' versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the 'King of Pop.' On such classic tracks as 'Billie Jean' and 'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,' Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For 'Thriller,' some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing 'Beat It' and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track. 'Thriller' sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles' 'Greatest Hits 1971-1975' among others as the best-selling album of all time. 'If an album doesn't do well, everyone says 'it was the producers fault'; so if it does well, it should be your 'fault,' too,' Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. 'The tracks don't just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.' The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography 'Q', including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for 'Roots.' He also received France's Legion d'Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, 'Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones' and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.	https://www.voanews.com/a/music-titan-quincy-jones-dies-at-91/7850332.html	2024-11-04T00:26:11-08:00	
Two of Iran's Revolutionary Guards die in gyroplane crash	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Two of Iran's Revolutionary Guards died in a gyroplane crash in the southeastern region on Monday, the semi-official Fars news agency cited the force's public relations department as saying. The accident happened near Sirkan, a city in the province of Sistan-Baluchustan bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan, which has long been the site of frequent clashes between Iranian security forces and Sunni militants as well as drug traffickers. 'Second Brigadier General Hamid Mazandarani, the commander of the Nineva Brigade of Golestan province, and his pilot, were martyred in this accident,' the agency said. However, it did not say why the commander of the brigade, based in the northern province, was visiting the southeast at the time. Ten Iranian border guards were killed in the province last month, in clashes with suspected Sunni Muslim militants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-of-iran-s-revolutionary-guards-die-in-gyroplane-crash/7850324.html	2024-11-03T23:50:01-08:00	
EU'S Borrell visits South Korea amid alarm over North Korean troops in Russia	SEOUL, South Korea — The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell holds talks on Monday with his South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul, amid growing concerns in Seoul over the dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia for its war with Ukraine. Borrell arrived in South Korea after a trip to Japan and visited the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas, the diplomat said in a post on social media platform X on Sunday. 'My visit today of the Demilitarized Zone - DMZ - between the Republic of Korea and the DPRK is yet another reminder of the need to invest more in peace,' Borrell said in the post, referring to the initials of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Borrell is visiting South Korea to take security and defense cooperation between the the EU and Seoul to 'the next level,' he said in another post, without elaborating. The first such Strategic Dialogue meeting between the EU and South Korea comes as Washington and Seoul have been sounding the alarm about the dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia for its war with Ukraine. Borrell met with South Korea's defense minister Kim Yong-hyun in Seoul on Monday and expressed concern over the development, the Yonhap news agency reported. Cho said last week that all possible scenarios were under consideration, when asked about whether Seoul could send weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea's aiding Russia. South Korea has provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including mine clearance equipment, but so far has resisted Kyiv's requests for weapons. Seoul also sees it as likely that the North will be compensated by Moscow with military and civilian technology, as it races to launch a spy satellite and upgrade its missile capabilities. North Korea last week flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19. Washington expects North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region to enter the fight against Ukraine in the coming days, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country intended to back Russia until it achieved victory in the Ukraine war at talks in Moscow on Friday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-s-borrell-visits-south-korea-amid-alarm-over-north-korean-troops-in-russia-/7850314.html	2024-11-03T23:22:13-08:00	
Myanmar junta chief to make first China visit since seizing power	Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing will travel to China this week to attend regional summits, state media said on Monday, in the embattled top general's first visit to the influential neighboring nation since he seized power in a 2021 coup. Since the coup, Myanmar has been in chaos, including areas along its border with China, as an armed resistance movement combined with established ethnic minority militias to wrest control of large territories from the military government. Min Aung Hlaing will attend summits of the Greater Mekong Subregion and the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Co-operation Strategy and join a meeting with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam on Nov. 6 and 7 in Kunming, MRTV said. 'He will have meetings and discussions with authorities from China and will work on enhancing the bilateral relationship, economic and development in several sectors,' it said, referring to the junta chief. The Myanmar military's deterioration, in the face of rapid gains by anti-junta fighters since a surprise offensive last October, has alarmed China, which has sealed parts of the border and halted key imports to rebel-controlled areas, Reuters has reported. China has strategic economic interests in Myanmar, including major oil and gas pipelines crossing the country and a planned deep-sea port in the Bay of Bengal. Beijing also imports rare earths from its smaller neighbor for use in the automotive and wind energy sectors. 'Whether he is going there to receive more Chinese support or more Chinese pressure, it's only bad for the people,' said David Mathieson, an independent analyst who tracks Myanmar. 'China has made clear they are supporting the SAC and their elections transition plan,' he said, referring to the junta's State Administration Council, headed by Min Aung Hlaing. The junta began a nationwide census last month to pave the way for an election next year, despite not having control over wide swathes of the country, and with dozens of political parties disbanded. Beijing promised technical support and aid to the junta for the census and the proposed election, Myanmar state media said in August after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Min Aung Hlaing. The meeting, in Myanmar's capital Naypyidaw, was seen by some critics as Beijing's endorsement of the junta and activists in the war-torn country have voiced frustration at China's stance, calling it a barrier to their struggle for democracy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-junta-chief-to-make-first-china-visit-since-seizing-power/7850312.html	2024-11-03T23:15:15-08:00	
Boeing machinists are holding a contract vote that could end their 7-week strike	Unionized factory workers at Boeing are voting Monday whether to accept a contract offer or to continue their strike, which has lasted more than seven weeks and shut down production of most Boeing passenger planes. A vote to ratify the contract would clear the way for the aerospace giant to resume airplane production and bring in much-needed cash. If members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers vote for a third time to reject Boeing's offer, it would plunge the company into further financial peril and uncertainty. In its latest proposed contract, Boeing is offering pay raises of 38% over four years, as well as ratification and productivity bonuses. IAM District 751, which represents Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest, endorsed the proposal, which is slightly more generous than one the machinists voted down nearly two weeks ago. 'It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,' the union district said in scheduling Monday's vote. 'We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn’t be right as we have achieved so much success.' Union officials said they think they have gotten all they can though negotiations and a strike, and that if the current proposal is rejected, future offers from Boeing might be worse. They expect to announce the result of the vote Monday night. Boeing has adamantly rejected requests to restore traditional pensions that the company froze nearly a decade ago. Pensions were a key issue for workers who voted down previous offers in September and October. If machinists ratify the latest offer, they would return to work by Nov. 12, according to the union. The strike began Sept. 13 with an overwhelming 94.6% rejection of Boeing's offer to raise pay by 25% over four years — far less than the union’s original demand for 40% wage increases over three years. Machinists voted down another offer — 35% raises over four years, but still no revival of pensions — on Oct. 23, the same day Boeing reported a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion. However, the offer received 36% support, up from 5% for the mid-September proposal, making Boeing leaders believe they were close to a deal. Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer. In addition to a slightly larger pay increases, the proposed contract includes a $12,000 contract ratification bonus, up from $7,000 in the previous offer, and larger company contributions to employees’ 401(k) retirement accounts. Boeing also promises to build its next airline plane in the Seattle area. Union officials fear the company may withdraw the pledge if workers reject the new offer. The strike drew the attention of the Biden administration. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su intervened in the talks several times, including last week. The labor standoff — the first strike by Boeing machinists since an eight-week walkout in 2008 — is the latest setback in a volatile year for the company. Boeing came under several federal investigations after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company. The door plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the plane's crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. The CEO whose effort to fix the company failed announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who approved the 737 Max. As the strike dragged on, new CEO Kelly Ortberg announced about 17,000 layoffs and a stock sale to prevent the company’s credit rating from being cut to junk status. S&P and Fitch Ratings said last week that the $24.3 billion in stock and other securities will cover upcoming debt payments and reduce the risk of a credit downgrade. The strike has created a cash crunch by depriving Boeing of money it gets when delivering new planes to airlines. The walkout at Seattle-area factories stopped production of the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling plane, and the 777 or 'triple-seven' jet and the cargo-carrying version of its 767 plane. Ortberg has conceded that trust in Boeing has declined, the company has too much debt, and 'serious lapses in our performance' have disappointed many airline customers. But, he says, the company’s strengths include a backlog of airplane orders valued at a half-trillion dollars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-machinists-are-holding-a-contract-vote-that-could-end-their-7-week-strike-/7850309.html	2024-11-03T23:02:34-08:00	
Bolivia's Evo Morales says he'll press on with a hunger strike	LAUCA N, Bolivia — Bolivia's transformative and divisive former President Evo Morales said Sunday that he would press on with a hunger strike until the government of his protégé-turned-rival agreed to a political dialogue. His act of dissent aims to defuse street protests that have paralyzed the nation in recent weeks over what Morales' supporters condemn as his political persecution. Morales, a larger-than-life figure still towering over Bolivian politics five years after his fraught ouster, spoke on his third day without food from the misty tropics of Chapare, Bolivia’s rural coca-growing region that serves as his stronghold. 'My fight is to improve the situation in the country and to start a dialogue without conditions on two fronts, one economic and one political,' Morales told The Associated Press from the office of the coca growers’ federation that he long has led. The ex-president said he began his hunger strike Friday in hopes of 'international organizations or friendly governments' facilitating talks with his political nemesis, President Luis Arce. Tensions have surged over the past three weeks since pro-Morales supporters set up crippling roadblocks aimed at rebuking Arce — Morales' former economy minister with whom he’s now vying to lead Bolivia’s governing socialist party into next year’s elections. Protesters have choked off major highways in defiance of an attempt by Arce's government to revive a 2016 statutory rape case against Morales, an ethnic Aymara who was the first member of an Indigenous community to become the president of Latin America’s only Indigenous-majority nation. Morales has denied any wrongdoing. 'My crime is being Indigenous,' he said on Sunday. The AP reached Morales after an arduous 11-hour journey by car, motorcycle and foot over hills and through the highlands, circumventing road blockades, crisscrossing routes littered with debris and toppled trees and squeaking through over a dozen security checkpoints, in some cases manned by profiteers. Roadblocks are a common protest tactic in Bolivia, where the mountainous terrain means a few strategically positioned checkpoints can can isolate major cities and bring the whole nation to a halt. That's exactly what happened earlier this month, marooning hundreds of thousands of residents in the highlands, raising fears of food and gasoline shortages and hiking up the prices of basic goods in major cities, including La Paz, the capital. 'I see people rising up even more,' said Eusebio Urbano, a farmer protesting in support of Morales at one of the road blockades Sunday. 'I don’t know what this government thinks. ... They don’t try to solve anything. We have to keep pushing until it leaves.' Under public pressure to quell the unrest, Arce's government sent some 3,000 police officers armed with tear gas and backed by helicopters to break up the blockades by force. Eduardo Del Castillo, a senior Cabinet minister, said security forces had arrested dozens of protesters in clearing the main road linking Cochabamba, Bolivia’s third-biggest city, with La Paz. Authorities transferred over 50 of the demonstrators to pre-trial detention in the capital on charges related to violating public order, he said. 'What happened was very inhumane,' Morales said of the crackdown, adding that his refusal to eat was also aimed at pressuring authorities to release the 66 detainees. 'These are humble people who were presented as terrorists.' It was the latest turn in Bolivia’s long-running political crisis, which escalated last week when gunmen ambushed Morales’ convoy in what the former president claimed was a government-led assassination attempt. Officials in Arce’s government denied this, alleging that police opened fire because Morales’ van had barreled through a security checkpoint. 'They’ve been using any tactic they can, politically, legally, morally and now, physically, to end my life,' Morales said. From there, protests in defense of Morales only intensified. On Friday, Arce’s government accused his demonstrators of occupying military barracks in Chapare, a flashpoint for conflict since the U.S.-backed war on drugs in the 1990s. Authorities said that Morales' more radical loyalists seized weapons and held some 200 soldiers hostage Friday. Morales and his supporters rejected reports of a violent hostage situation, with the leader's Kausachun Coca radio station airing footage that showed protesting union members and soldiers negotiating calmly while munching on coca leaves. 'Please, it’s no a take-over of military barracks,' Morales said. 'They are holding vigils until their economic and political demands are met.' Del Castillo, the minister, said Sunday that the government is, in principle, open to negotiating a resolution to the political crisis with Morales. But he said authorities didn’t trust Morales' motives. 'Morales doesn’t care about the country, he cares about himself,' Del Castillo said. 'He's looking for new confrontations.' The crisis stems from a bitter rift at the highest rungs of Bolivia’s long-dominant Movement Toward Socialism party, which deepened last month when authorities announced their intention to arrest Morales on charges that he fathered a daughter with a 15-year-old girl in 2016 when he was 56 years old and president. Morales and his supporters have decried the case as a political witch hunt aimed at blocking his candidacy in the 2025 election. Arce insists that the current constitution — which permits just two consecutive terms — forbids Morales, who held power from 2006-2019, from running next year, anyway. It was Morales' quest for a fourth term that led to his ouster, which he and his supporters view as a coup. 'It is a betrayal of the people, of the party activists, of the revolution,' Morales said of Arce's efforts to undercut him. In neighboring Argentina, the government of far-right President Javier Milei on Saturday announced it had lodged a complaint accusing Morales of child abuse committed during the former president’s monthslong political exile in Argentina, from 2019 to 2020. At that time, Morales' contested re-election sparked mass protests that prompted him to resign under pressure from the military and flee to Mexico before seeking asylum in Argentina. Now, years later, the charismatic populist — who continues to evince intense support from the Indigenous population — has seized upon growing public discontent with his chosen successor. 'It’s not that I, Evo, want to be president. The people have asked me to return,' Morales said. 'During my administration there was stability. When there is economic and political stability, there is happiness.' Many in the country have soured on Arce over the collapse of Bolivia’s once-prosperous economy built on cheap dollars and fuel. They look back fondly on the tenure of Morales, credited with lifting millions out of poverty and drastically narrowing Bolivia's wealth divide during the nation's natural gas boom. 'Now with more experience, we are ready to save Bolivia,' Morales said. Aware that the economic model that led to Bolivia's remarkable growth had quite literally run out of gas, Morales said he would reverse the nation's economic downturn by having Bolivia join BRICS, a group of emerging economies seeking to counter Western dominance of the world order, and collaborating more closely with China. The former president, now 65, isn't sure how long his hunger strike will last. But he said he's prepared for the deprivation. 'I do a lot of sports,' Morales said. 'Today I woke up at 4 a.m. and did 1,015 sit-ups.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-s-evo-morales-says-he-ll-press-on-with-a-hunger-strike-/7850308.html	2024-11-03T23:00:30-08:00	
Israel notifies UN it will not cooperate with UNRWA after new legislation	Israel’s foreign ministry said Monday the country formally notified the United Nations that it will not cooperate with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, once new Israeli legislation goes into effect early next year. The move follows the Israeli parliament’s approval of legislation severing ties with the agency and banning it from operating in Israel. 'Despite the overwhelming evidence we submitted to the UN that substantiate Hamas' infiltration of UNRWA, the UN did nothing to rectify the situation,' Israel’s Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon said in a statement. Israel has long been critical of UNRWA and has accused some of its staff of taking part in the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel has provided little evidence to support its claims, and UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said last week that the agency has received no response to its repeated requests for Israel to provide such information. 'UNRWA is therefore in the invidious position of being unable to address allegations for which it has no evidence, while these allegations continue to be used to undermine the Agency,' Lazzarini said. UNRWA has been the main distributor of aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip where Israel’s response to the Hamas attack has devastated many areas and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people. Lazzarini said last week that dismantling the agency 'will have a catastrophic impact on the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.' Israel’s letter to the U.N. says the country 'will continue to work with international partners, including other United Nations agencies, to ensure the facilitation of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not undermine Israel's security.' Humanitarian agencies have repeatedly complained of delays in getting aid into Gaza, as well as unsafe conditions to distribute aid within Gaza to due to the fighting. Syria raid Israel said Sunday it launched a ground raid into Syria, seizing a Syrian it claimed was involved in Iranian networks supporting militants in the region. The Israeli raid into Syria was its first during the current 13-month Mideast conflict. Syria did not immediately confirm the operation. The Israeli army did not say where the raid occurred or when, but identified the man seized as Ali Soleiman al-Assi and said he had been living in the southern Syrian region of Saida. Israel said he had been under military surveillance for many months and was involved in Iranian initiatives targeting areas of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights near the border with Syria. Body camera footage of the raid released by the army showed soldiers seizing a man in a white tank top inside a building. The man was brought to Israel for interrogation, the military said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border with Lebanon on Sunday, saying that Hezbollah militants in Lebanon must be pushed back beyond the Litani River, with or without a cease-fire deal in place, and that the Iran-backed group must be prevented from rearming. The river is about 30 kilometers north of the Israeli border. 'With or without an agreement, the key to returning our (evacuated) residents in the north safely to their homes is to keep back Hezbollah beyond the Litani, to strike its every attempt [to] rearm, and to respond forcefully against all action against us,' Netanyahu said. More than a year ago, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7 attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,300 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terror groups by the United States and other Western countries. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-notifies-un-it-will-not-cooperate-with-unrwa-after-new-legislation/7850306.html	2024-11-03T22:47:46-08:00	
Oklahoma storms injure at least 11 and leave thousands without power	OKLAHOMA CITY — Severe storms and tornadoes battered Oklahoma early Sunday, tossing cars and ripping roofs off buildings in the middle of the night and leaving tens of thousands of homes and businesses without power. Among numerous injuries, 11 people required hospitalization, authorities said. Much of the damage was reported in and around the state capital of Oklahoma City, near the state's center, but also scattered elsewhere around the state. The early morning storms set off tornado warnings that extended south to the Arkansas state line. Heavy rains caused flash flooding in some areas and one lightning-sparked house fire was reported. More than 99,000 Oklahoma homes and businesses lost power during the overnight storms. By late Sunday afternoon, that number was reduced to around 24,000. No fatalities had been reported. Richard Thompson, forecast chief for the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, said he believes six or more tornadoes hit the state overnight. Meanwhile, forecasters warned state residents to brace for more heavy rain and possible severe weather through Monday. 'We're not done with it yet,' he said. A tornado watch for much of the central and southeast part of Oklahoma was in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday. Other areas were under thunderstorm or flood watches. In the town of Choctaw, east of Oklahoma City, firefighters and police officers went door to door Sunday morning to ask about injuries. 'It leveled a complete neighborhood in Choctaw,' the town’s mayor, Chad Allcox, told The Associated Press. He added that debris hindered search and rescue efforts. 'Power lines are down everywhere ... a lot of the roads are blocked, hard to get through. Very large trees blocking roadways.' Oklahoma City Fire Department spokesman Scott Douglas told the AP that heavy rain and the lingering threat of tornadoes in the early morning darkness complicated early search and rescue efforts. He described a first sweep of hard-hit areas around 1:30 a.m. Emergency workers had to free two people from an overturned mobile home, including a woman injured when an air conditioner landed on her leg, Douglas said. The scale of the damage came into focus as daylight broke. Local television footage showed downed power lines, walls peeled off homes, overturned vehicles and neighborhood streets littered with debris. Douglas said 11 people were transported to hospitals with injuries that were not life-threatening. 'There were some other minor injuries, some walking wounded, that were going to get treatment on their own,' Douglas said. Allcox said early weather warnings and tornado sirens likely saved lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oklahoma-storms-injure-at-least-11-and-leave-thousands-without-power-/7850299.html	2024-11-03T22:16:31-08:00	
Pakistan shuts primary schools for a week in Lahore due to dangerous air quality	LAHORE, Pakistan — Dangerously poor air quality on Monday forced Pakistani authorities in the cultural capital of Lahore to close primary schools for a week, government officials said, after the air-quality index hit a record high over the weekend. The measures in Lahore were part of a larger effort to protect children from respiratory-related and other diseases in the city of 14 million people. The government said everyone in Lahore was required to wear a face mask. Fifty percent of employees must also work from home as part of a 'green lockdown' in the city, the government said, adding that barbecuing food without filters was banned and motorized rickshaws restricted. Wedding halls must close at 10 p.m. and artificial rain is likely to be used to combat the pollution. The air-quality index in Lahore exceeded 1,000 over the weekend, a record high in Pakistan. Toxic gray smog has sickened tens of thousands of people, mainly children and elderly people, since last month when the air quality started worsening in Lahore, the capital of eastern Punjab province bordering India. The government has also banned construction work in certain areas and fined owners of smoke-emitting vehicles. Schools will remain closed for a week because of the pollution, according to a government notification. The concentration of PM 2.5, or tiny particulate matter, in the air approached 450, considered hazardous, the Punjab Environment Protection Department said. Lahore was once known as a city of gardens, which were ubiquitous during the Mughal era from the 16th to 19th centuries. But rapid urbanization and surging population growth have left little room for greenery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-shuts-primary-schools-for-a-week-in-lahore-due-to-dangerous-air-quality-/7850298.html	2024-11-03T22:09:47-08:00	
US tech firms warn Vietnam's planned law to hamper data centers, social media	HANOI, Vietnam — U.S. tech companies have warned Vietnam's government that a draft law to tighten rules on data protection and limit data transfers abroad would hamper social media platforms and data center operators from growing their businesses in the country. The Southeast Asian nation with a population of 100 million is one of the world's largest markets for Facebook and other online platforms, and is aiming to exponentially increase its data center industry with foreign investment in coming years. The draft law 'will make it challenging for tech companies, social media platforms and data center operators to reach the customers that rely on them daily,' said Jason Oxman, who chairs the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), a trade association representing big tech companies including Meta, Google and data centers operator Equinix. The draft law, being discussed in parliament, is also designed to ease authorities' access to information and was urged by the ministry of public security, Vietnamese and foreign officials said. The ministry of public security and the information ministry did not respond to attempts to contact them via email and phone. Vietnam's parliament is discussing the law in its current month-long session and is scheduled to pass it on Nov. 30 'if eligible,' according to its program, which is subject to changes. Existing Vietnamese regulations already limit cross-border transfers of data under some circumstances, but they are rarely enforced. It is unclear how the new law, if adopted, would impact foreign investment in the country. Reuters reported in August that Google was considering setting up a large data center in southern Vietnam before the draft law was presented in parliament. Research firm BMI had said Vietnam could become a major regional player in the data center industry as limits on foreign ownership are set to end next year. Among the provisions of the draft law is prior authorization for the transfer overseas of 'core data' and 'important data,' which are currently vaguely defined. 'That will hinder foreign business operations,' Oxman told Reuters. Tech companies and other firms favor cross-border data flows to cut costs and improve services, but multiple jurisdictions, including the European Union and China, have limited those transfers, saying that allows them to better protect privacy and sensitive information. Under the draft law, companies will have to share data with Vietnam's ruling Communist Party and state organizations in multiple, vaguely defined cases including for 'fulfilling a specific task in the public interest.' The U.S. tech industry has raised concerns with Vietnamese authorities over 'the undue expansion of government access to data,' Oxman said. The new law 'would cause significant compliance challenges for most private sector companies,' said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, noting talks were underway to persuade authorities to 'reconsider the rushed legislative process' for the law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-tech-firms-warn-vietnam-s-planned-law-to-hamper-data-centers-social-media/7850290.html	2024-11-03T21:36:26-08:00	
Indonesia's Laki-laki volcano on Flores Island erupts, killing 9 people	JAKARTA, Indonesia — At least nine people died after Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki in eastern Indonesia erupted on Sunday, spewing explosive plumes of lava and forcing authorities to evacuate several nearby villages, officials said on Monday. Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki, located on Flores Island in East Nusa Tenggara province, erupted on Sunday night, belching a fiery-red column of lava, volcanic ash and incandescent rocks, Hadi Wijaya, a spokesperson for The Center of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation , said on Monday. 'After the eruption, there was power outage and then it was raining and big lightning which caused panic among residents,' he told Reuters, adding that the authority had raised the status of the volcano to level IV or the highest. The agency has recommended a seven-kilometer radius must be cleared. Fiery lava and rocks hit the nearest settlements around 4 kilometers from the crater, burning and damaging residents' houses, Hadi said. As of Monday morning at least nine people had died, said Heronimus Lamawuran, a local official at East Flores area, adding the eruption had affected seven villages. 'We have started evacuating residents since this morning to other villages located around 20 kilometers from the crater,' he said. The nearest villages were covered by thick volcanic ash on Monday morning, Heronimus added. The authorities are still gathering data on the number of evacuees and damaged buildings. Indonesia sits on the 'Pacific Ring of Fire,' an area of high seismic activity atop multiple tectonic plates. This eruption follows a series of eruptions of different volcanoes in Indonesia. In May, a volcano on the remote island of Halmahera, Mount Ibu, caused evacuation of people from seven villages. North Sulawesi's Ruang volcano also erupted in May and prompted authorities to evacuate more than 12,000 people. Flash floods and cold lava flow from Mount Marapi in West Sumatra province, covered several nearby districts following torrential rain on May 11, killing more than 60 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-laki-laki-volcano-on-flores-island-erupts-killing-9-people/7850275.html	2024-11-03T20:17:19-08:00	
Puerto Rico prepares for Election Day as a third-party candidate makes history	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The two parties that have dominated Puerto Rican politics for decades are losing their grip as they face the stiffest competition yet from a younger generation fed up with the island's corruption, chronic power outages and mismanagement of public funds. For the first time in the island's governor's race, a third-party candidate has a powerful second lead in the polls ahead of the U.S. territory's election Tuesday — and some experts say there's a possibility he could win. 'This election is already historic,' said political analyst and university professor Jorge Schmidt Nieto. 'It already marks a before and an after.' Juan Dalmau is running for Puerto Rico's Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement, established in 2019. A Gaither international poll this month shows Dalmau closing in on Jenniffer González, a member of the New Progressive Party and Puerto Rico's representative in Congress. She beat Gov. Pedro Pierluisi in their party's primary in June. Gaither's poll shows Dalmau with 29% of support versus González's 31% as he nearly caught up with her since a different poll in July showed him with only 24% compared with González's 43%. Coming in third was Jesús Manuel Ortiz, of the Popular Democratic Party, followed by Javier Jiménez of Project Dignity, a conservative party created in 2019. Under pressure Puerto Rican politics revolve around the island's status, and up until 2016, the New Progressive Party, which supports statehood, and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the status quo, would split at least 90% of all votes during general elections, Schmidt said. But that year, U.S. Congress created a federal control board to oversee Puerto Rico's finances after the government announced it was unable to pay a more than $70 billion public debt load. In 2017, Puerto Rico filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history. The debt was accrued through decades of corruption, mismanagement and excessive borrowing, with Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority still struggling to restructure its more than $9 billion debt, the largest of any government agency. Puerto Ricans have largely rejected and resented the board, created a year before Hurricane Maria slammed into the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid. In 2020, Pierluisi won but received only 33% of votes. His opponent from the Popular Democratic Party received 32%. It marked the first time either party failed to reach 40% of votes. The power outages that have persisted since the elections, coupled with the slow pace of hurricane reconstruction, have frustrated and angered voters. Under Pierluisi, the government signed contracts with two companies, Luma Energy and Genera PR, which together oversee the generation, transmission and distribution of power. Outages have persisted, with the companies blaming a grid that was already crumbling before the hurricane hit due to a lack of maintenance and investment. 'Disastrous things have occurred during this four-year term, especially with the electric energy,' Schmidt said. 'It has affected everyone, regardless of social class.' Voters, he said, are viewing Tuesday's elections 'as a moment of revenge.' Dalmau said he would oust both companies in an 'organized fashion' within six months if he becomes governor. Ortiz said he would cancel Luma's contract, while González has called for the creation of an 'energy czar' that would review potential Luma contractual breaches while another operator is found. However, no contract can be canceled without prior approval of the federal control board and Puerto Rico's Energy Bureau. The candidates also are under pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crimes, boost Puerto Rico's economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a crumbling health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland. Dalmau, who suspended his campaign for two weeks in mid-October after his wife had emergency brain surgery, also has said he would eliminate tax breaks for wealthy U.S. citizens from the mainland. Apathy dominates Despite their promises to turn Puerto Rico around, candidates face persistent voter apathy. In 2008, 1.9 million out of 2.5 million registered voters participated in that year's election, compared with 1.3 million out of 2.3 million in 2020. This year, nearly 99,000 new voters registered and more than 87,000 reactivated their status, according to Puerto Rico's State Elections Commission. 'A much higher number was expected,' Schmidt said. He noted that those middle age and older favor González and her pro-statehood party, while those younger than 45 'overwhelmingly' favor Dalmau, which means that if a majority of young voters participate on Tuesday and fewer older ones do so, he might have a chance of winning. The Bad Bunny factor The months leading up to the Nov. 5 elections have been contentious. Reggaetón superstar Bad Bunny paid for dozens of billboard ads criticizing Puerto Rico's two main parties. In response, the governor's New Progressive Party financed a billboard ad suggesting an obscenity in reference to Bad Bunny. On Friday, the singer published a page-long letter in a local newspaper deriding González's pro-statehood party. While the artist has not endorsed any local officials, the sole person he recently began following on Instagram was Dalmau. On Sunday, he briefly appeared at Dalmau's closing campaign. A hush fell over a crowd of tens of thousands of people as Bad Bunny spoke before singing, saying he doesn't endorse a specific candidate or party. 'My party is the people. ... My party is Puerto Rico,' he said as he later praised the alliance between Puerto Rico's Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement. Meanwhile, a so-called 'cemetery of corruption' was set up Thursday in the capital, San Juan, featuring large black-and-white pictures of nearly a dozen politicians from the island's two main parties who have been charged or sentenced by federal authorities in recent years. It was created by Eva Prados with the Citizen Victory Movement, who is running for Puerto Rico's House. By Friday, police reported that the pictures were destroyed or stolen. As the race heats up, the number of formal complaints about alleged electoral crimes also has increased. These include people who say they received confirmations for early voting when they made no such request. A persistent question Voters on Tuesday also will be asked for a seventh time what Puerto Rico's political status should be. The nonbinding referendum will feature three choices: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated. Regardless of the outcome, a change in status requires approval from the U.S. Congress. The push for a change in status doesn't depend on whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump win in the U.S. mainland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/puerto-rico-prepares-for-election-day-as-a-third-party-candidate-makes-history/7850265.html	2024-11-03T19:22:24-08:00	
China urges France to get EU to arrive at palatable EV trade solution	BEIJING — China has urged France to take on 'an active role' to push the European Commission toward a solution acceptable to both the European and Chinese electric vehicle industries, Beijing's commerce ministry said on Monday, citing its minister. Wang Wentao, in a meeting with French junior trade minister Sophie Primas in Shanghai on Sunday, reiterated the European Union's investigation into China's EVs is a major concern and has 'seriously hindered' China-EU auto industry cooperation. The EU launched an anti-subsidy investigation into imports of Chinese-made battery EVs last year and in October voted for tariffs on those vehicles. China in the past year has launched its own investigations into European pork and dairy, and imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on imports of brandy from the EU early this month. Primas is on a three-day visit to challenge China over its import duties on brandy, which Paris calls political and unjustified, Reuters reported last week. Wang told Primas China's trade remedy investigations on EU brandy, pork and dairy products were in accordance with the domestic industry's applications and complied with the World Trade Organization rules, 'unlike the EU' which was 'rash' in launching its EV probe. 'China will continue to conduct investigations in strict accordance with the law, safeguard the legitimate rights of enterprises of EU member states, including France, and make rulings based on facts and evidence,' the ministry statement cited Wang as saying. But he said China is willing to work with the European Commission towards a 'proper solution' as well, without elaborating. China opened an anti-subsidy probe into imported EU dairy products in August and an investigation focusing on pork intended for human consumption in June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-france-to-get-eu-to-arrive-at-palatable-ev-trade-solution/7850250.html	2024-11-03T18:41:55-08:00	
African Union soldiers killed in al-Shabab mortar attack	Two African Union soldiers were killed and a third one injured by an al-Shabab mortar attack Sunday on their base inside the perimeters of Mogadishu’s international airport. A statement by the head of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) and Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission Mohamed El-Amine Souef condemned the attack on the facility known as the Halane Base Camp. It’s believed that a 107mm rocket was used for the attack. At least four mortar rounds were reportedly fired during the attack. 'The heinous attack will not deter us and the Somali security forces from pursuing lasting peace and in Somalia,' Souef said in the statement posted on X, formerly Twitter. 'We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to combat terrorism and build a peaceful and prosperous Somalia.' The statement did not specify the nationality of the soldiers killed, but an AU official told VOA’s Horn of Africa that the soldiers who were killed and the one soldier injured are Ugandans. 'ATMIS extends its deepest sympathies and condolences to the families, friends, and relatives of those who lost their lives and wishes a quick recovery to those injured during the attack,' Souef said. The AU senior leadership team later visited the site of the blasts. The al-Shabab militant group claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement posted on one of its websites, the group claimed the mortars killed 'white and black officers.' Despite being driven out of Mogadishu in 2011, the group, from time to time, manages to carry out mortar attacks that hit Mogadishu’s airport, which is a base for the AU as well as some foreign embassies. Al-Shabab mortars have also targeted residential areas in Mogadishu and have claimed the lives of civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-union-soldiers-killed-in-al-shabab-mortar-attack/7850242.html	2024-11-03T18:15:23-08:00	
Pumpkins at center of fall celebration at Maryland farm	Although Halloween has passed, pumpkins are still an indispensable part of the fall season in the United States. Americans are expected to spend nearly $800 million on the decorative gourds this year. For many, heading to a pumpkin patch and picking a pumpkin is an annual tradition.

Federal judge lets Iowa challenge voter rolls; may affect naturalized citizens	DES MOINES, Iowa — A federal judge ruled Sunday that Iowa can continue challenging the validity of hundreds of ballots from potential noncitizens even though critics said the effort threatens the voting rights of people who’ve recently become U.S. citizens. U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sided with the state in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in the Iowa capital of Des Moines on behalf of the League of Latin American Citizens of Iowa and four recently naturalized citizens. The four were on the state’s list of questionable registrations to be challenged by local elections officials. The state’s Republican attorney general and secretary of state argued that investigating and potentially removing 2,000 names would prevent illegal voting by noncitizens. GOP officials across the U.S. have made possible voting by noncitizen immigrants a key election-year talking point even though it is rare. Their focus has come with former President Donald Trump falsely suggesting that his opponents already are committing fraud to prevent his return to the White House. In his ruling Sunday, Locher pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision four days prior that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its voter registration rolls even though it was impacting some U.S. citizens. He also cited the Supreme Court's recent refusal to review a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on state electoral laws surrounding provisional ballots. Those Supreme Court decisions advise lower courts to 'act with great caution before awarding last-minute injunctive relief,' he wrote. Locher also said the state's effort does not remove anyone from the voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional ballots. In a statement Sunday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, celebrated the ruling. 'Today’s ruling is a victory for election integrity,' Reynolds said. 'In Iowa, while we encourage all citizens to vote, we will enforce the law and ensure those votes aren’t cancelled out by the illegal vote of a non-citizen.' A spokesperson for the ACLU said the organization did not immediately have a comment. After Locher had a hearing in the ACLU’s lawsuit Friday, Secretary of State Paul Pate and state Attorney General Brenna Bird issued a statement saying that Iowa had about 250 noncitizens registered to vote, but the Biden administration wouldn’t provide data about them. Pate told reporters last month that his office was forced to rely upon a list of potential noncitizens from the Iowa Department of Transportation. It named people who registered to vote or voted after identifying themselves as noncitizens living in the U.S. legally when they previously sought driver’s licenses. 'Today’s court victory is a guarantee for all Iowans that their votes will count and not be canceled out by illegal votes,' Bird said in the statement issued after Sunday's decision. But ACLU attorneys said Iowa officials were conceding that most of the people on the list are eligible to vote and shouldn’t have been included. They said the state was violating naturalized citizens’ voting rights by wrongfully challenging their registrations and investigating them if they cast ballots. Pate issued his directive Oct. 22, only two weeks before the Nov. 5 election, and ACLU attorneys argued that federal law prohibits such a move so close to Election Day. 'It’s very clear that the secretary of state understands that this list consists primarily or entirely of U.S. citizens who have exactly the same fundamental core right to vote as the rest of us citizen Iowa voters,' Rita Bettis Austen, the legal director of the ACLU of Iowa, said during a Zoom briefing for reporters after the hearing. The people on the state’s list of potential noncitizens may have become naturalized citizens after their statements to the Department of Transportation. Pate’s office told county elections officials to challenge their ballots and have them cast provisional ballots instead. That would leave the decision of whether they will be counted to local officials upon further review, with voters having seven days to provide proof of their U.S. citizenship. In his ruling, Locher wrote that Pate backed away from some of his original hardline positions at an earlier court hearing. Pate's attorney said the Secretary of State is no longer aiming to require local election officials to challenge the votes of each person on his list or force voters on the list to file provisional ballots even when they have proven citizenship at a polling place. Federal law and states already make it illegal for noncitizens to vote, and the first question on Iowa’s voter registration form asks whether a person is a U.S. citizen. The form also requires potential voters to sign a statement saying they are citizens, warning them that if they lie, they can be convicted of a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. Locher’s ruling also came after a federal judge had halted a similar program in Alabama challenged by civil rights groups and the U.S. Department of Justice. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the more than 3,200 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens. In Iowa’s case, noncitizens who are registered are potentially only a tiny fraction of the state’s 2.2 million registered voters. But Locher wrote that it appears to be undisputed that some portion of the names on Pate’s list are registered voters who are not U.S. citizens. Even if that portion is small, an injunction effectively would force local election officials to let ineligible voters cast ballots, he added. Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in a sprawling legal fight over this year’s election for months. Republicans have filed dozens of lawsuits challenging various aspects of vote-casting after being chastised repeatedly by judges in 2020 for bringing complaints about how the election was run only after votes were tallied. Democrats have their own team of dozens of staffers fighting GOP cases.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-judge-lets-iowa-challenge-voter-rolls-may-affect-naturalized-citizens-/7850224.html	2024-11-03T17:08:16-08:00	
Japan grounds its V-22 Osprey fleet again after flight incident	Washington — Japan has grounded its fleet of V-22 Osprey aircraft again after an incident last Sunday where one of the hybrid helicopter-aircraft tilted unexpectedly and hit the ground while trying to take off. The V-22 was taking part in the joint U.S. military exercise Keen Sword and carrying 16 passengers, including three U.S. service members. During takeoff it 'became unstable as it swayed from side to side, and the left wing, the lower part of the aircraft came into contact with the ground and part of the aircraft was damaged, so the flight was aborted,' Japan's Ground Self Defense Forces said in a statement. It was the first major incident involving Japan's V-22 fleet since a U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command Osprey crash last November off the coast of Japan killed eight service members and led to a monthslong grounding of the entire fleet for both Japan and the U.S. The aircraft resumed flight operations earlier this year, but the Osprey’s use remains controversial particularly in Okinawa, where residents have questioned its safety record. The Osprey in last Sunday's incident was able to land and no one was injured, however Japan will keep its fleet of more than a dozen V-22s grounded while it investigates the incident, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters last week. 'We believe there is no safety problem with Ospreys, although ensuring flight safety is a prerequisite for aircraft operations,' Nakatani said. The Pentagon's V-22 joint program office is supporting Japan's investigation into the incident, spokesperson Neil Lobeda said Saturday. The V-22 was operating on the Japanese island of Yonaguni during the joint exercise Keen Sword. Yonaguni is only 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Taiwan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-grounds-its-v-22-osprey-fleet-again-after-flight-incident/7850209.html	2024-11-03T16:25:16-08:00	
Israel sends troops into Syria, detaining alleged Iranian agent	Israel said Sunday it launched a ground raid into Syria, seizing a Syrian it claimed was involved in Iranian networks supporting militants in the region. The Israeli raid into Syria was its first during the current 13-month Middle East conflict. Syria did not immediately confirm the operation. The Israeli army did not say where the raid occurred or when, but identified the man seized as Ali Soleiman al-Assi and said he had been living in the southern Syrian region of Saida. Israel said he had been under military surveillance for many months and was involved in Iranian initiatives targeting areas of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights near the border with Syria. Body camera footage of the raid released by the army showed soldiers seizing a man in a white tank top inside a building. The man was brought to Israel for interrogation, the military said. Elsewhere on the war front, an airstrike on a clinic in northern Gaza, where children were being vaccinated for polio, wounded six people, including four children, Palestinian officials said. The Israeli military denied responsibility. The alleged Israeli drone strike occurred Saturday. The area has been encircled by Israeli forces and largely isolated for the past year. Israel had been carrying out another offensive there in recent weeks that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. It was not possible to resolve the conflicting accounts. Israeli forces have repeatedly raided hospitals in Gaza, saying Hamas uses them to hide militant fighters, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. Hamas fighters are also operating in the north, battling Israeli forces. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that a quadcopter struck the Sheikh Radwan clinic in Gaza City early Saturday afternoon, just a few minutes after a United Nations delegation left the facility. The World Health Organization and the U.N. children's agency, known as UNICEF, which are jointly carrying out the polio vaccination campaign, expressed concern over the reported strike. 'The reports of this attack are even more disturbing as the Sheikh Radwan Clinic is one of the health points where parents can get their children vaccinated,' said Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for UNICEF. She said the attack occurred while the humanitarian pause was still in effect, despite assurances given that the pause would be respected from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. local time. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said that 'contrary to the claims, an initial review determined that the (Israeli military) did not strike in the area at the specified time.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border with Lebanon on Sunday, saying that Hezbollah militants in Lebanon must be pushed back beyond the Litani River, with or without a cease-fire deal in place, and that the Iran-backed group must be prevented from rearming. The river is about 30 kilometers north of the Israeli border. 'With or without an agreement, the key to returning our (evacuated) residents in the north safely to their homes is to keep back Hezbollah beyond the Litani, to strike its every attempt [to] rearm, and to respond forcefully against all action against us,' Netanyahu said. Israel continued to launch strikes in eastern Lebanon and in Gaza, while Israel said more than 100 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory Sunday. Several were intercepted, and some fell in unpopulated areas. More than a year ago, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7 attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated a terror group by the United States and other Western countries. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-sends-troops-into-syria-detaining-alleged-iranian-agent/7850206.html	2024-11-03T16:11:28-08:00	
Second Taiwanese fighter killed in Ukraine	Taipei, Taiwan — A second Taiwanese volunteer fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers against Russia has been killed, Taiwan's foreign ministry said Sunday. The man was a member of the Ukrainian Foreign Legion, the ministry said in a statement, expressing condolences to his family, who did not want him publicly identified. The ministry said it was informed of the man's death Saturday and that Taiwan's representative office in Poland had verified the information with the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. No further details were released about how he died. At the start of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy openly invited foreigners to come to his country to join a 'foreign legion' that would fight alongside Ukrainians against the invading Russians. Taiwanese media reported that the soldier returned to Ukraine in July after recovering from a leg injury. There are currently 'five to six' Taiwanese fighters in Ukraine, Taiwanese lawmaker Puma Shen, a member of the parliamentary defense committee, told AFP. The first Taiwanese volunteer died on the battlefield in Ukraine in November 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/second-taiwanese-fighter-killed-in-ukraine/7849941.html	2024-11-03T15:51:28-08:00	
China: Astronauts from Tiangong space station return to Earth	Beijing — A Chinese crew of three astronauts returned to Earth on Monday after a stay of more than six months aboard the Tiangong space station, the Xinhua news agency reported. Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu were 'in good health' after landing in their return capsule at the Dongfeng site in Inner Mongolia, the agency said. The three men arrived at the Tiangong station in late April and were joined there on October 30 by three new astronauts, two men and a woman, with whom they undertook a five-day handover before beginning their return journey. The Tiangong space station, crewed by teams of three astronauts who rotate every three to six months, is the jewel of China's space program. Its central module was launched in 2021 and is expected to be used for around ten years. Beijing says it is on track to send a manned mission to the moon by 2030, where it plans to build a base.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-astronauts-from-tiangong-space-station-return-to-earth/7849937.html	2024-11-03T15:34:10-08:00	
Taiwan reports rise in Chinese military activity as US election nears	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan's defense ministry said Sunday it had spotted 35 Chinese military aircraft, including fighters and bombers, flying to the island's south on the way to exercises in the Pacific, a second day in a row it has reported such activities. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory despite the strong objections of the government in Taipei, regularly sends its military in the skies and waters near the island seeking to enforce its sovereignty claims. China's defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the missions, reported just days before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election. The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, and its arms sales to Taipei, including a $2 billion missile system announced last month, which infuriated Beijing. Taiwan's defense ministry said that from 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) Sunday it had detected 37 Chinese military aircraft, including J-16 fighters, nuclear-capable H-6 bombers and drones. Of those, 35 aircraft flew to Taiwan's southwest, south and southeast into the Western Pacific to carry out long-range training, the ministry said, adding it had sent its own forces to keep watch. On Saturday, the ministry said China had carried out another 'joint combat readiness patrol' with warships and aircraft near Taiwan. China last month held large war games around Taiwan it said were a warning to 'separatist acts,' drawing condemnation from the Taiwanese and U.S. governments. Beijing strongly dislikes Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, who took office in May, saying he is a 'separatist.' He says only Taiwan's people can decide their future and has repeatedly offered talks with Beijing but been rebuffed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-reports-rise-in-chinese-military-activity-as-us-election-nears/7849933.html	2024-11-03T15:19:51-08:00	
5 migrants die trying to reach Spain's Canary Islands	Madrid — Five bodies were found floating in the sea Sunday after the inflatable boat they were travelling in punctured around 90 km (56 miles) off the Spanish island of Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands, Spanish Sea Rescue services told Reuters. A spokesperson said a rescue aircraft sighted two inflatable boats heading toward the archipelago, and that one of them had one of its floats deflated. The aircraft launched two life rafts and was able to rescue 17 people from one vessel and 80 from another, but five bodies were also found. State agency EFE said the rescue services had rescued more than 1,500 people over the weekend. It also reported Sunday that at least 48 migrants died trying to reach the Canary Islands in a boat that departed Mauritania three weeks ago. Ten more migrants from the same craft were rescued near the island of El Hierro on Saturday, it said. Calm seas and gentle winds associated with late summer in the Atlantic Ocean off West Africa have prompted a surge of migrants trying to escape extreme poverty and political instability in Africa's Sahel region. The Atlantic route to the Canary Islands has seen the fastest growth in irregular migration in recent years, though numbers remain below those on the Central Mediterranean route toward Italy. Some 32,878 migrants took the route in boats from West Africa to the Canary Islands between January and Oct. 15, according to government figures, a rise of 39.7% from the same period last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-die-trying-to-reach-spain-canary-islands/7849913.html	2024-11-03T13:44:03-08:00

Iran president says potential cease-fire 'could affect' response to Israel	Tehran — Iran's president said Sunday a potential cease-fire between its allies and Israel 'could affect the intensity' of Tehran's response to Israel's recent strikes on Iranian military sites. 'If they [the Israelis] reconsider their behavior, accept a cease-fire and stop massacring the oppressed and innocent people of the region, it could affect the intensity and type of our response,' Masoud Pezeshkian said, quoted by state news agency IRNA. He added that Iran 'will not leave unanswered any aggression against its sovereignty and security,' according to the news agency. Israeli warplanes carried out the October 26 strikes in what Israel said was retaliation for Tehran's October 1 missile barrage. Iran had in turn described that attack as a reprisal for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. Since the strikes last month, Israel has warned Iran against retaliating, while Tehran vowed to respond. On Saturday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all matters of the state, said the Islamic republic would retaliate. 'The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response to what they are doing against Iran, the Iranian nation, and the resistance front,' Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran. He was referring to the alliance of Tehran-backed armed groups that include Yemen's Houthi rebels, Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. After the strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they 'hit Iran's defense capabilities and missile production.' Iran's armed forces said the attack killed four military personnel and caused 'limited damage' to a few radar systems. Iranian media said a civilian was also killed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7849830.html	2024-11-03T10:33:27-08:00	
UN expert: Iran transformed Yemen's Houthi rebels into potent military force	UNITED NATIONS — Yemen’s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants and others, U.N. experts said in a new report. The Iranian-backed Houthis have exploited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and worked to enhance their status in Iran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance' to gain popularity in the region and beyond, the experts monitoring sanctions against the Houthis said in the 537-page report to the U.N. Security Council. To support Iranian-backed Hamas militants, whose surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparked the war in Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting global shipping in a key geopolitical area. Despite Houthi claims that they would target ships linked to Israel, the panel said its investigations revealed the rebels have been targeting vessels indiscriminately. Its analysis of data from the International Maritime Organization, the U.S. and the United Kingdom revealed that at least 134 attacks were carried out from Houthi-controlled areas against merchant and commercial vessels and U.S. and U.K. warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden between Nov. 15, 2023, and July 31, 2024. 'The group’s shift to actions at sea increased their influence in the region,' the U.N. experts said. 'Such a scale of attacks, using weapon systems on civilian vessels, had never occurred since the Second World War.' In their attacks, the experts said, the Houthis used a new and previously undisclosed ballistic missile, the Hatem-2. The five-member U.N. panel includes experts on arms, finance, regional affairs, international humanitarian law and armed groups. The experts hail from India, Egypt, Switzerland, Belgium and Cabo Verde. Confidential sources told the panel that the Houthis are coordinating operations with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and strengthening ties to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group in Somalia. The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen’s internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks to end the war vanished after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. The U.N. experts said the Yemen conflict, which started as an internal fight and expanded into a regional confrontation, 'has now escalated into a major international crisis.' According to the experts, the number of Houthi fighters is estimated at 350,000 now, compared with 220,000 in 2022 and 30,000 in 2015. 'The panel observes the transformation of the Houthis from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization, extending their operational capabilities well beyond the territories under their control,' the report said. The experts said the transformation has been possible due to the transfer of military materiel and training provided by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s elite Quds Force, Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists and technicians. Military experts, Yemeni officials and even officials close to the Houthis indicated that the rebel group couldn’t produce complex weapons systems such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surveillance and attack drones, portable air defense systems, and thermal sights, which they have used without foreign support, the U.N. experts said. 'The scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military material and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,' the experts said. The panel said it observed similarities between multiple military items used by the Houthis and those produced and operated by Iran or its allies in the Axis of Resistance, which includes Hezbollah and Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria. It said joint operations centers have been set up in Iraq and Lebanon with Houthi representatives 'aimed at coordinating joint military actions of the Axis of Resistance.' Inside Yemen, the panel said the Houthis have been intensifying military operations against the government. 'The internal military situation is fragile, and any internal or external trigger could lead to the resumption of military confrontations,' it said. The Houthis also have been recruiting large numbers of Yemeni youths and children as well as exploiting Ethiopian migrants, forcing them to join the fight against the government and engage in trafficking narcotics, it said. 'Exploiting high illiteracy rates, particularly in tribal areas, they have reportedly mobilized boys as young as 10 or 11, often despite parental opposition,' they said. 'Recruitment sermons and weekly classes on jihad are reportedly delivered in schools.' Child recruitment reportedly increased after the war in Gaza started and the U.S. and U.K. airstrikes in Yemen, the experts said. Yemen’s government said it received 3,298 reports of child recruitment in the first half of 2024, with youngsters reportedly used as human shields, spies and in combat — and for planting landmines and explosives, reconnaissance and as cooks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-expert-iran-transformed-yemen-s-houthi-rebels-into-potent-military-force/7849814.html	2024-11-03T10:15:22-08:00	
Return of abducted lawyer for Pakistan’s jailed former leader sparks controversy	Islamabad — A leading lawyer for Pakistan’s imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan has resurfaced under mysterious circumstances nearly a month after his alleged 'enforced disappearance.' Police officials and Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party Sunday confirmed the overnight recovery of Intazar Ahmad Panjutha — who had gone missing on October 8 while returning home to Islamabad — amid allegations that government security agencies were involved. Punjutha’s recovery occurred a day after Pakistan's attorney general assured a federal high court Friday that the lawyer 'would be recovered within 24 hours' but did not provide further details. However, police reported late Saturday that they intercepted a suspicious vehicle in the city of Hassan Abdul, northwest of the Pakistani capital, and recovered the lawyer, asserting that armed individuals who were with Panjutha opened fire at police from within the vehicle and fled. A video later surfaced showing a visibly shaken and weak Panjutha sitting in a vehicle with his hands and feet tied. In a separate video, the lawyer can be seen breaking down in tears while telling police officers that his captors were demanding ransom and subjected him to severe custodial torture. Khan’s party rejected the police claims and Panjutha’s video remarks, saying he was forced to make the statement and alleging again that the lawyer 'was abducted by security forces.' Salman Akram Raja, the secretary general of PTI, identified Panjutha as one of Khan's key lawyers in his ongoing legal battles. 'His condition, that spoke of the horror he had endured, was filmed and spread to cause fear. This is shameful,' Raja said in a video statement he released Sunday. A police department spokesperson dismissed allegations of staging a fake encounter, asserting that officers rescued Panjutha from kidnappers demanding ransom. Absa Komal, a prime-time news anchor at Pakistan's Dawn TV channel, commented on Panjutha’s video appearance and sympathized with him. 'He is unrecognizable — a changed man. The attorney general told the high court that he would be produced in 24 hours, and this is how he has been presented. Shame on the decision-makers,' Komal wrote on her social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Khan’s party members and supporters have been the subject of a government crackdown since he was removed from power through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in 2022 and jailed a year later over controversial allegations of corruption and inciting violence against the Pakistani military, among dozens of other charges. The 72-year-old deposed leader rejects the lawsuits as fabricated by the military after allegedly orchestrating his ouster from power, charges government and army officials reject. Domestic and international human rights groups have lately intensified their criticism of Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies, accusing them of engaging in a campaign of suppressing PTI and dissent at large. Khan, cricket star-turned-prime minister, has led a campaign of defiance against the military since his ouster from power. Army generals have staged three coups and ruled Pakistan for over three decades since it gained independence in 1947. Pakistan’s military and its intelligence agencies are frequently accused of influencing the rise or fall of elected governments through election rigging and pro-army political parties, charges army officials deny. Last month, more than 60 Democratic lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to secure the release of Khan and all other political prisoners in Pakistan. The American lawmakers expressed their concern about what they denounced as the 'ongoing widespread human rights violations' in the South Asian nation. Without naming Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government, the letter stated that 'Pakistan's current system amounts to 'military rule with civilian facade.’' Islamabad hit back at the letter, saying it is based on 'an incorrect understanding of the political situation in Pakistan.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/return-of-abducted-lawyer-for-pakistan-s-jailed-former-leader-sparks-controversy-/7849779.html	2024-11-03T09:20:02-08:00	
Abdi Nageeye of the Netherlands and Sheila Chepkirui of Kenya win New York City Marathon	New York — Abdi Nageeye of the Netherlands won the men's race at the New York City Marathon on Sunday and Sheila Chepkirui of Kenya took the women's event. Both runners pulled away from their closest competitors in the final few hundred meters to come away with their first victories in the race. Nageeye was step-for-step with 2022 champion Evans Chebet before using a burst heading into Central Park to come away with the win in 2 hours, 7 minutes, 39 seconds. Chebet finished 6 seconds behind. Chepkirui was running New York for the first time and pulled away from defending champion Hellen Obiri in the women's race. Chepkirui started to run marathons in 2022. She finished the race in 2:24.35. Obiri finished nearly 15 seconds behind. Obiri was looking to be the first repeat champion since Mary Keitany of Kenya won three in a row from 2014-16. Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenya finished third, giving the African nation the top three spots. Tamirat Tola, the men's defending champion and Paris Olympic gold medalist, finished fourth, right behind Albert Korir. The top Americans finished sixth in both races. Conner Mantz led the men and Sara Vaughn the women. Vaughn was in the lead group heading into Mile 20 when they entered the Bronx before she dropped off the lead pack. Vaughn was geared up to run Chicago before COVID-19 kept her from competing in that race. She was a late addition to this marathon. The day got started with an upset in the men's wheelchair race as three-time defending champion Marcel Hug was beaten by Daniel Romanchuk, who won in 2018 and 2019. Susannah Scaroni won the women’s wheelchair race. It was her second victory in New York, also taking the 2022 race and giving Americans winners in both events — the first time that has happened. The 26.2-mile course took runners through all five boroughs of New York, starting in Staten Island and ending in Central Park. This is the 48th year the race has been in all five boroughs. Before that, the route was completely in Central Park when it began in 1970. The first race had only 55 finishers while more than 50,000 are expected to compete this year. The weather was perfect to run in with temperatures in the lower 40s when the race started. Last year, it was 61 degrees when the race started.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abdi-nageeye-of-the-netherlands-and-sheila-chepkirui-of-kenya-win-new-york-city-marathon/7849762.html	2024-11-03T08:52:38-08:00	
Russia sends nearly 100 drones into Ukraine, as Zelenskyy urges tougher sanctions against Moscow	Kyiv, Ukraine — Moscow sent 96 drones and a guided air missile into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine's Air Force, 66 drones were destroyed during the overnight barrage, along with the missile. A further 27 drones were 'lost' over various areas, it said, likely having been electronically jammed, while one drone flew into Belarusian airspace. No casualties were reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russia had launched around 900 guided aerial bombs, 500 drones and 30 missiles against Ukraine over the past week. Zelenskyy appealed Sunday on X to Ukraine's allies to provide 'long-range capabilities for our security', saying that these 'attacks would have been impossible if we had sufficient support from the world.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil, including for preemptive Ukrainian strikes on camps where North Korean troops are being trained. The Ukrainian President also urged partners to enact 'truly effective sanctions to prevent Russia from importing critical components for drone and missile production'. This appeal followed an address on Saturday, in which he said over 2,000 drones and missiles 'still using Western components' were launched against Ukraine in October, and underlined the need for more stringent export controls to prevent sanctions evasion. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in three regions of Russia: 16 in the Rostov region, two in the Belgorod region and one in the Volgograd region. A man died Sunday in a Ukrainian drone attack in the Belgorod region, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-sends-nearly-100-drones-into-ukraine-as-zelenskyy-urges-tougher-sanctions-against-moscow/7849741.html	2024-11-03T08:28:26-08:00	
Wikipedia embroiled in legal battle in India	A monthslong legal battle between online encyclopedia Wikipedia’s parent company and India’s largest newswire service took a turn this week that has raised concerns about free access to credible online information in the country. In July, Asian News International (ANI), which calls itself South Asia’s leading multimedia news agency, filed a lawsuit in the Delhi High Court against the U.S.-based Wikimedia Foundation over a Wikipedia page that labeled ANI a mouthpiece of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The foundation runs Wikipedia. The content on Wikipedia is managed by volunteers, and it allows all users free editing access to its pages. During a hearing in the $237,000 [approx.] defamation lawsuit on October 28, Wikimedia relented to the High Court’s demand that Wikipedia reveal identifying information of the online users involved in editing the ANI page. In August, the court had threatened to halt the operation of the widely used website in India if it did not comply. Indian tech journalist and digital rights activist Nikhil Pahwa said that if the precedent set by the ANI lawsuit against Wikimedia holds, it will make editors across Wikipedia vulnerable to defamation cases from any political actor who has an issue with their Wikipedia page. 'This means that anyone who edits a Wikipedia page is potentially susceptible to identification because all one has to do is file a case. In the case of politicians especially, the edits will be fraught with risk. This will mean that Wikipedia editors will hesitate when editing pages pertaining to powerful people, and this has a chilling effect on speech,' Pahwa told VOA. ANI, which also accused Wikipedia of spreading information from 'fake news websites,' had demanded in the lawsuit that the website’s page on the newswire service be taken down. Wikimedia initially argued that the pages on ANI were entirely written by volunteers who simply made use of an online platform provided by Wikipedia. But on October 16, the court ordered Wikimedia to take down a page concerning ANI, saying that its existence was 'interfering' with the court proceedings. In an unprecedented move, Wikipedia removed the page from its platform on October 21. On October 25, the Delhi High Court expressed surprise at the open-access editing function of Wikipedia, calling it a 'dangerous tool.' Justice Subramonium Prasad, during a hearing on the case, asked: 'Anybody can edit a page on Wikipedia? What kind of page is this if it is open to anybody [to edit]?' A history of censorship Wikipedia has faced bans or censorship intermittently in more than a dozen countries. The site has also faced lawsuits filed by individuals as well as organizations across borders. China banned the Chinese language version of Wikipedia in 2015. Four years later, it blocked all language editions of the free, community-edited encyclopedia in the country. Pakistan blocked the website for three days last year for hosting allegedly blasphemous content. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later ordered the restoration of the site, noting that the consequences of the blanket ban outweighed its benefits. In 2023, a court in Russia imposed a fine worth $20,350 on Wikimedia for not deleting what it claimed was 'banned content' regarding the Russian military. The fine was for the failure to take down a page that contained 'classified military information' about Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, among other content on its location and equipment. Global popularity Wikipedia insists that despite being a community-driven platform, it has a robust fact-checking system. Wikipedia also maintains the anonymity of its volunteers who edit and verify information from different sources. Wikipedia, available in many languages and with more than 350 editions, is consistently one of the most visited websites in the world and is used by millions of people for a variety of purposes. New Delhi-based lawyer Ujjaini Chatterji said that Wikipedia is a very useful first step for any research. 'It is especially helpful because they have a lot of other links within the footnotes which direct us to other credible articles, journals, academic literature, media coverage, databases and more, in order to build on our research further,' she said. 'This free source encyclopedia is particularly a useful starting point to understanding concepts in a simplified manner. Like many others in India, I have used Wikipedia, both as a student and a professional,' she added. Indian residents visit Wikipedia more than 750 million times per month, making it the online encyclopedia’s fifth-largest user base in the world. The site operates in 23 Indian languages besides English. The outcome of the lawsuit, which is already resolved at this point, may affect hundreds of thousands of Indians in the future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wikipedia-embroiled-in-legal-battle-in-india/7849693.html	2024-11-03T07:27:21-08:00	
Protesters demand arrests over train station roof collapse that killed 14 people in Serbia	BELGRADE — Angry protesters on Sunday left red handprints at the entrances of government buildings in the Serbian capital to demand the arrest of officials, two days after a concrete canopy collapsed at a railway station, killing 14 people and injuring three. Police formed a cordon outside the seat of the Ministry of Construction and Infrastructure in central Belgrade as several thousand people called for ranking government ministers, including Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, to immediately step down. 'Arrest, arrest!' chanted the crowd. They shouted at police officers outside the building that they are 'guarding murderers' and that 'your hands are bloody,' while holding banners reading 'corruption kills' and 'we are all under the canopy!' 'Everywhere you can, leave bloody hands so they know their hands are bloody. In every city in Serbia, everywhere you can,' opposition political activist Nikola Ristic said. The concrete canopy that ran along the front of the railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad collapsed suddenly on Friday, landing on people who were sitting on benches or passing through the building's entrance. Surveillance camera footage showed the canopy crashing down in seconds. The dead included a 6-year-old girl. The three injured, who are between 18 and 24 years old, all had to have limbs amputated. They were still in serious condition on Sunday, doctors said. Funerals for the victims, attended by thousands, have been held in northern Serbia. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years, and critics of Serbia's populist government attributed the disaster to rampant corruption, lack of transparency and sloppy renovations. The renovation was part of a wider deal with Chinese construction companies. 'Citizens no longer have anything to lose, they are increasingly becoming aware of this,' said liberal politician Biljana Stojkovic. 'This is grief combined with anger, despair that is turning into rage.' Serbia's populist government has promised a thorough investigation, with prosecutors saying they already have questioned more than two dozen people. But critics believe that justice is unlikely to be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation why this wasn't done. The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by President Aleksandar Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-demand-arrests-over-train-station-roof-collapse-that-killed-14-people-in-serbia-/7849674.html	2024-11-03T06:48:35-08:00	
14 people killed when lightning hits church in remote refugee camp in Uganda	KAMPALA — Fourteen people were killed in a lightning strike in a refugee camp in northern Uganda, police said Sunday. The incident happened Saturday in the remote district of Lamwo. Police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke said 34 other people were injured. The victims have not yet been identified, he said. The residents of the Palabek settlement camp, which primarily houses refugees from South Sudan, had been attending a prayer service in the makeshift metallic structure when the lighting struck. Deadly lightning is commonly reported in this East African country during the wet seasons. Rusoke said there was no report of fire breaking out following the strike.	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-killed-when-lightning-hits-a-church-in-a-remote-refugee-camp-in-uganda-/7849454.html	2024-11-03T05:52:04-08:00	
A crowd of Spain's flood survivors toss mud and shout insults at King Felipe VI	VALENCIA, Spain — A crowd of angry survivors of Spain's floods tossed mud and shouted insults at Spain's King Felipe VI and government officials when they made their first visit to one of the hardest hit towns on Sunday. Government officials accompanied the monarch who tried to talk to locals while others shouted at him in Paiporta, an outskirt of Valencia city that has been devastated. Police had to step in with officers on horseback to keep back the crowd of several dozens. 'Get out! Get out!' and 'Killers!' rang out among other insults. After being forced to seek protection from the mud, the king remained calm and made several efforts to speak to individual residents. One person appeared to have wept on his shoulder. He shook the hand of a man. It was an unprecedented incident for a Royal House that takes great care to craft an image of a monarch who is liked by the nation. Queen Letizia and regional Valencia President Carlo Mazón were also in the contingent. Over 200 people have died from Tuesday's floods and thousands have had their homes destroyed by the wall of water and mud. At least 60 of the dead were in Paiporta, an epicenter of suffering.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-pm-king-heckled-on-visit-to-flood-hit-area-/7849424.html	2024-11-03T05:21:56-08:00	
Amid war and deep hunger, Gaza fisherman struggle to feed families	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — After over a year of war in Gaza, Palestinian fishermen gather along the coastline, desperately casting their nets in hopes of catching enough for their families amid widespread hunger. Since Israel began a military onslaught in Gaza after Hamas' October 2023 attack, Israeli restrictions in the waters off the enclave have made life almost impossible for fishermen, who no longer sail out to sea and instead must stay by the shore. In Khan Younis, Ibrahim Ghurab, 71, and Waseem Al Masry, 24, fish for sardines from the shoreline in front of a encampment of tents and makeshift shelters for those displaced by the war. 'Life is difficult,' Ghurab said. 'One tries to secure food. There is no aid, we don't receive anything anymore. In the beginning there was some [humanitarian] aid, very little, but now there is no more.' Fishermen like Ghurab and Al Masry struggle daily to bring in even a modest catch to feed their families. There is rarely any fish left over from a daily haul to be sold to others. Fishing was an important part of daily life in Gaza before the war, helping people eke out a living by selling their daily hauls in the market and feed the population. But scant aid is reaching Gaza amid Israeli restrictions and frequent fighting, and many people have no income. The price of simple goods are largely out of reach for most. 'We have to come here and risk our lives,' Al Masry said, describing shootings by the Israeli military from the sea that he accused of targeting fisherman on the beach in Khan Younis. Ghurab similarly said that Israeli military boats had fired upon fisherman at Khan Younis. The Israeli military did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the claims the military had shot at fishermen. Israel's retaliatory war against Hamas for the Islamist militant group's deadly, cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023 has devastated densely populated Gaza and displaced most of the 2.3 million population.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-war-and-deep-hunger-gaza-fisherman-struggle-to-feed-families-/7849422.html	2024-11-03T05:09:56-08:00	
A grenade explosion in busy market in Indian-controlled Kashmir wounds 9	SRINAGAR, India — An assailant threw a grenade at a marketplace bustling with shoppers in the main city of Indian-controlled Kashmir on Sunday, wounding at least nine people, police said. The attack comes a day after a suspected militant was killed in a daylong gunbattle in Srinagar, a rare occurrence in the city where security is tight. Police said an unidentified attacker hurled a grenade from a flyover bridge, apparently targeting a stationed paramilitary vehicle, in the main business center of Srinagar, where Sunday's flea market is visited by thousands of people. The grenade exploded in the midst of shoppers and vendors, wounding at least nine, police said. All were taken to a hospital and reinforcements of police and paramilitary soldiers launched a search for the attacker. In the past, Indian authorities have blamed rebels fighting against Indian rule in the disputed region for similar grenade attacks. Rebels have in turn accused government agents of carrying out the attacks to defame their movement. 'There can be no justification for targeting innocent civilians,' Kashmir’s Chief Minister Omar Abdullah wrote on the social media platform X. 'The security apparatus must do everything possible to end this spurt of attacks at the earliest so that people can go about their lives without any fear.' India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-grenade-explosion-in-a-busy-market-in-indian-controlled-kashmir-wounds-9-/7849413.html	2024-11-03T04:56:14-08:00	
Germany's Scholz summons top ministers over rival plans to fix economy	Berlin — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will hold meetings with his top two ministers to try to find common ground after they put forward contradictory plans to fix the nation's ailing economy, a government source told Reuters on Sunday. A document leaked by Christian Lindner's finance ministry raised eyebrows in Berlin last week, with its push for tax cuts and fiscal discipline widely interpreted as a challenge to the multibillion-euro investment plan put forward by Economy Minister Robert Habeck just days earlier. The stand-off is the latest escalation in a row over economic and industrial policy between the FDP, the Greens and Scholz's Social Democrats that has fueled speculation of the coalition's potential collapse, less than a year before elections are due. But a government source told Reuters that Scholz and the ministers would hold several meetings in the coming days, saying that 'now that everyone has submitted their paper, we have to see how they fit with each other.' A worsening business outlook in Europe's largest economy has widened divisions in Scholz's ideologically disparate coalition over policy measures to drive growth, protect industrial jobs, and reinforce Germany’s position as a global industrial hub. While Habeck wants the creation of a fund to stimulate investment and to get around Germany's strict fiscal spending rules, Lindner advocates tax cuts to spur the economy and an immediate halt on all new regulation. SPD leader Lars Klingbeil signaled openness to discussing Lindner's proposals in a local newspaper interview, but said that some of them were untenable for his party, which released its own economic plan earlier in October. 'Giving more to the rich, letting employees work longer and sending them into retirement later - it will come as no surprise to anyone that we think this is the wrong approach,' Klingbeil told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-scholz-summons-top-ministers-over-rival-plans-to-fix-economy-/7849402.html	2024-11-03T04:32:26-08:00	
Mpox cases in Congo may be stabilizing, but more vaccines needed to stamp out virus	Goma, Congo — Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be 'stabilizing' — a possible sign that the main epidemic for which the World Health Organization made a global emergency declaration in August might be on the decline. In recent weeks, Congo has reported about 200 to 300 lab-confirmed mpox cases every week, according to WHO. That’s down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. The decline is also apparent in Kamituga, the mining city in the eastern part of Congo where the new, more infectious variant of mpox first emerged. But the U.N. health agency acknowledged Friday that only 40% to 50% of suspected infections in Congo were being tested — and that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda. While doctors are encouraged by the drop in infections in some parts of Congo, it's still not clear what kinds of physical contact is driving the outbreak. Health experts are also frustrated by the low number of vaccine doses the central African nation has received — 265,000 — and say that delivering the vaccine to where it's needed in the sprawling country is proving difficult. WHO estimates 50,000 people have been immunized in Congo, which has a population of 110 million. Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent, broader vaccination effort for the entire continent to halt mpox's spread and avoid further worrisome genetic mutations, like the one detected earlier this year in Congo after months of low-level circulation. 'If we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases substantially,' said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in Congo for the charity Alima. So far this year, there have been roughly 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in Congo. 'We’ve seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained,' he said. The 2017 epidemic ended up leading to the 2022 global outbreak of mpox that affected more than 100 countries. Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga — where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners — is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, surveillance and education. Georgette Hamuli, an 18-year-old sex worker, hadn’t been aware of mpox until immunization teams arrived last week in the poor neighborhood where she works in Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo. 'They told us we're highly exposed to the risk of infection,' she said. 'We insist on condoms with our clients, but some refuse ... if they don’t want to use a condom, they double the amount they pay.' Hamuli said she and other friends who are sex workers each received 2,000 Congolese francs ($0.70) from a charity to get vaccinated against mpox — but it wasn’t the money that swayed her. 'The vaccine is also necessary,' she said. 'I think we’re now protected.' The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, WHO and partners have allocated 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year. Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda had their origins in Congo, and a number of cases in travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain. Fewer than half of the people who are most at risk in Congo have been vaccinated, according to Heather Kerr, Congo director for the International Rescue Committee. 'We only have a tiny amount of vaccines, and nothing for the kids,' she said. The vaccines for Congo are largely coming from donor countries like the U.S and through UNICEF, which mainly uses taxpayer money to buy the shots. 'We’re getting a charitable approach where we only see very small donations of vaccines to Africa,' said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. 'What we need is a public health approach where we immunize populations at scale.' Drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, which makes the most widely used mpox vaccine, said it would sell shots destined for Africa at the lowest price possible. The advocacy group Public Citizen estimated UNICEF paid $65 per dose of the Jynneos mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, far higher than nearly all other vaccines used in public health programs. Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an infectious diseases expert at South Africa’s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said mpox outbreaks typically peak and disappear quickly because of how the virus spreads. This time, however, he said there are two complicating factors: the virus’ transmission via sex and the continued spillover from infected animals. 'We’re in new territory with mpox this time,' he added. 'But we’re never going to solve this until we vaccinate most of our people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mpox-cases-in-congo-may-be-stabilizing-but-more-vaccines-needed-to-stamp-out-virus-/7849399.html	2024-11-03T04:21:25-08:00	
Lahore air pollution hits historic high, forcing school closures	KARACHI — Unprecedented air pollution levels in Pakistan's second-largest city of Lahore prompted authorities to take emergency measures on Sunday, including issuing work-from-home mandates and closing primary schools. The city held the top spot on a real-time list of the world's most polluted cities on Sunday after recording its highest ever pollution reading of 1900 near the Pakistan-India border on Saturday, based on data released by the provincial government and Swiss group IQAir. The government has shut primary schools for a week, advising parents to ensure children wear masks, said Senior Minister of Punjab Marriyum Aurangzeb during a press conference, as a thick blanket of smog enveloped the city. Citizens have been urged to stay indoors, keep doors and windows shut, and avoid unnecessary travel, she said, adding that hospitals had been given smog counters. To reduce vehicle pollution, 50% of office employees would work from home, said Aurangzeb. The government has also imposed a ban on three-wheelers known as rickshaws and halted construction in certain areas to reduce the pollution levels. Factories and construction sites failing to comply with these regulations could be shut down, she said. Aurangzeb described the situation as 'unexpected' and attributed the deterioration in air quality to winds carrying pollution from neighboring India. 'This cannot be solved without talks with India,' she said, adding the provincial government would initiate talks with its bigger neighbor through Pakistan's foreign ministry. The smog crisis in Lahore, similar to the situation in India's capital Delhi, tends to worsen during cooler months due to temperature inversion trapping pollution closer to the ground.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lahore-air-pollution-hits-historic-high-forcing-school-closures-/7849395.html	2024-11-03T04:12:12-08:00	
Turkey seeks deeper Africa ties at summit	Nairobi — Turkey on Sunday said it was committed to deepening relations with Africa, which it and called on to back diplomatic support for Palestinians, as it held its latest African summit in Djibouti. Turkey has invested heavily across Africa in recent years, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan carrying out 50 visits to 31 countries during his two decades in power. Fourteen African countries attended the latest ministerial meeting in the tiny Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti this weekend. They included Angola, Chad, Comoros, Republic of Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Libya, Mauritania, Nigeria, South Sudan, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who presided over the summit, said trade with the continent surpassed $35 billion last year and Turkey's direct investments now totaled $7 billion. 'Turkey is employing a comprehensive and holistic approach in terms of enhancing our trade and economic partnership with the continent,' Fidan said in a speech. Turkey has become the fourth largest arms supplier to sub-Saharan Africa and helped train armed forces in many countries. In recent months, it has attempted to mediate a feud between Ethiopia and Somalia, and struck a mining deal with Niger. Fidan reiterated support for the African Union to become a permanent member of the G20, and for reform of the United Nations Security Council. 'We should continue our efforts to make the UN more relevant and capable of confronting the complex challenges of the century. Security Council reform is critical in this sense,' he said. Fidan also called for greater African involvement in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. 'We believe that Africa can play an instrumental role in supporting the Palestinian cause and in stopping Israel,' he said. 'We appreciate the African countries that stand with Palestine,' he added, highlighting South Africa's recent move to file evidence of 'genocide' committed by Israel to the International Criminal Court. The next Turkiye-Africa Summit is due to be held in 2026.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-seeks-deeper-africa-ties-at-summit/7849389.html	2024-11-03T03:59:20-08:00	
Ethiopia bans imports of gas-powered private vehicles, but the switch to electric is a bumpy ride	ADDIS ABABA — As the price of fuel soared in Ethiopia earlier this year, Awgachew Seleshi decided to buy an electric car. That aligned with the government's new efforts to phase out gas-powered vehicles. But months later, he's questioning whether it was the right decision. He faces a range of issues, from the erratic supply of electricity in Addis Ababa, the capital, to the scarcity of spare parts. 'Charging my car has been a challenge,' the civil servant said. 'Spare parts that are imported from China are expensive, few mechanics are able to fix such cars and the resale value of such cars is poor.' Seleshi's troubles point to wider challenges for Ethiopia. In January, the East African country became the first in the world to ban the importation of non-electric private vehicles. The decision eased pressure on authorities who spend scarce foreign currency to subsidize the cost of fuel, but it also reflected growing enthusiasm for electric vehicles as the world demands more green technologies to reduce climate-changing emissions. Earlier this month, Ethiopia's government raised the price of fuel by up to 8% as part of a plan to gradually end all fuel subsidies in Africa's second-most populous country. Authorities have claimed some success in enforcing the ban on non-electric vehicles entering Ethiopia, and more than 100,000 electric cars are now being imported into the country each month. The official target is to increase the monthly import figure to 500,000 by 2030. By that time, a big new dam Ethiopia has built on the Nile River is expected to be producing power at full capacity. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, in a televised address earlier this year, said the Grand Renaissance Dam will start generating more than 5,000 megawatts of electric power within a year. Authorities say such capacity would support the transition to electric vehicles. For now, many in Addis Ababa, a city of more than 5 million people, are doubtful the country can achieve its ambitious goals for electric vehicles without further needed infrastructure and services. The few garage owners who can fix broken electric cars say they are overwhelmed, while customers say they are being overcharged amid an apparent lack of competition. 'There are two or three garages that can fix new energy vehicles in Ethiopia and many consumers lack awareness on how to take care of such vehicles,' said Yonas Tadelle, a mechanic in Addis Ababa. 'As mechanics, we also lack the tools, the spare parts and the know-how to fix such cars.' Many EVs are now parked in garages and parking lots awaiting parts expected to come from China. Ethiopia's minister in charge of transport, Bareo Hassen Bareo, has said he believes the country can be a model nation with a green economy legacy, with the prioritization of electric vehicles a key component. The government will invest in public charging stations, he told The Associated Press, and there are plans to create a plant manufacturing EV batteries locally to reduce reliance on imports. Private efforts have included a collaboration, which has since fizzled, between Olympian Haile Gebreselassie and South Korean carmaker Hyundai to make electric vehicles in Ethiopia. That effort is believed to have collapsed over the sourcing of materials. Samson Berhane, an economist based in Addis Ababa, said the sudden flood of electric vehicles into the local market despite poor infrastructure is making it difficult for customers to adapt comfortably. Some EVs sell for about $20,000. 'Very few people are willing to take the risk of buying electric cars due to the lack of infrastructure, shortage of mechanics specialized in EV maintenance and the flooding of the market with Chinese brands that have questionable details and long-term visibility,' Berhane said. But he said he believes that Ethiopia is more than able to provide electricity to the expected 500,000 EV’s there within the next decade while fulfilling its industrial ambitions. Some Ethiopians are already giving up on electric vehicles, and the secondhand trade in gasoline-powered vehicles continues. There are at least 1.2 million vehicles across Ethiopia, and only a small fraction are electric ones. Businessman Yared Alemayehu bought a Chinese-made electric vehicle that he had hoped to use for a taxi service. He knew the car had a mechanical defect, but he believed it could be fixed. A mechanic disagreed. In the end, he sold the car at a loss and bought a Toyota Corolla — a car made in 2007 that he felt was more reliable — for the equivalent of $20,000, a sum that included the hefty taxes imposed on gasoline vehicles. Taxes can be higher than the cost of importing the vehicle. 'In addition to having to charge my old electric car, it frequently broke, and the garage was overcharging, and the lineup at the garage was overwhelming us,' he said. Taxi driver Dereje Hailu, who had high hopes for his Chinese-made E-Star electric vehicle when he purchased it earlier this year, said his expectations had been dashed. 'With such a car, I fear I might be stuck if I go far from Addis Ababa where there are no charging stations,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-bans-imports-of-gas-powered-private-vehicles-but-the-switch-to-electric-is-a-bumpy-ride-/7849387.html	2024-11-03T03:48:26-08:00	
Will people leave Florida after devastating hurricanes? History suggests not	orlando, florida — The news rippled through Treasure Island, Florida, almost like a third storm: The mayor planned to move off the barrier island a month after Hurricane Helene flooded tens of thousands of homes along the Gulf Coast and two weeks after Hurricane Milton also ravaged the state. Mayor Tyler Payne's home had been flooded and damaged beyond repair, he explained in a message to Treasure Island residents, and he and his husband can't afford to rebuild. He also was stepping down as mayor. 'While it pains my heart to make this decision in the midst of our recovery from Hurricanes Helene and Milton, this is the best decision for me and my family,' Payne, who had held the office for more than three years and was a fourth-generation Treasure Island resident, said Monday. Up and down Florida's storm-battered Gulf Coast, residents are making the same calculations about whether they should stay or go. Can they afford to rebuild? What will insurance cover? People considering moving to Florida are contemplating whether it's worth the risk to come to a hurricane-prone state. These existential questions about Florida's appeal are raised regularly after the state experiences a busy hurricane season, such as in 2004, when four hurricanes crossed the Sunshine State. If moves into the state offer any answer, then hurricanes have served little as deterrents. Florida's population has grown by one-third to 23 million residents in the two decades since Charley, Frances, Jeanne and Ivan ravaged the state. Last year, Florida added more than 365,000 residents, second only to Texas among states. On the other hand, there are signs that Florida's white-hot real estate market has cooled. Sales of single-family homes were down 12% in September compared with the same time in the previous year. But interest rates, rising home prices and skyrocketing insurance costs likely played bigger roles than the recent hurricanes. 'Florida recovers much faster than you think,' said Brad O'Connor, chief economist for Florida Realtors. What happens after a storm? Studies of hurricanes along the Gulf Coast have shown that any outbound migration tends to be short-lived, and if people do leave, it's usually a short-distance move, such as from a barrier island to the mainland. Older people with more financial resources are more likely to return to devastated communities. When it comes to the housing market, there may be an initial shock to the supply as homeowners wait for reimbursement from insurance companies to fix up their homes or sell them. But in the three years after a hurricane, home prices in areas of Florida that were hit by one are 5% higher on average than elsewhere in the state because of smaller supply, according to a study of the impact of hurricanes on Florida's housing market from 2000 to 2016. New homeowners tend to be richer than previous ones because wealthier buyers can absorb price increases. Other factors that determine how quickly communities bounce back include whether homes were insured, the speed of insurance reimbursements, and whether there are enough construction workers. Because of stricter building codes implemented in the years after Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida in 1992, newer homes withstand hurricanes better than older ones, O'Connor said. 'If a property is damaged and uninsured, and the homeowner says, 'I don't want to deal with this,' there are always people willing to scoop up that property because it's valuable land,' he said. 'People build new homes under the new codes and there's less of an impact from hurricanes.' Short term and long term Recent storms offer examples what happens to communities, both short term and longer term. In Lee County, home to Fort Myers, Hurricane Ian made landfall two years ago in what had been one of the fastest growing parts of the United States. Population growth slowed afterward to 1.5% from 4.4% before the storm. The number of households dropped from about 340,000 to about 326,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2019, three-quarters of all United Van Lines truck moves were into Lee County and a quarter were outbound, but that dropped to two-thirds inbound and a third outbound in 2023 to 2024, the company told The Associated Press. The share of people in their late 20s, 30s and early 40s increased, as did the share of men with no spouse or partner, reflecting an influx of construction and recovery workers. The share of the white population dropped while it increased for the Hispanic community. The percentage of utility and transportation workers in the county jumped, according to the Census Bureau. Bay County in the Florida Panhandle, where Michael made landfall as the first Category 5 hurricane on the continental U.S. in a quarter century in 2018, offers a portrait of longer term trends. Four years later, Bay County had recovered its pre-hurricane population, which dropped almost 6% in the year after the storm. Since Michael, the county has grown more diverse, wealthier and older, with the median age rising from 39.6 to 41.4 and more people identifying as multiracial or Hispanic. The share of households earning $200,000 or more went from 4.3% before the hurricane to 8.3% in 2022 in a sign that some of the least affluent residents couldn't afford to rebuild or return. Treasure Island's mayor In his message to constituents, Payne said he would still stay connected to the Treasure Island community because his parents plan to rebuild on the barrier island, one of a string of beach towns along the Gulf of Mexico west of St. Petersburg known for motels, restaurants and bars lining the street. Payne, an attorney who also is an executive in his family's eyeglass-lens manufacturing business, said in his message that his decision to move was 'difficult.' 'I completely empathize with the difficult decisions that are facing so many of our residents,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/will-people-leave-florida-after-devastating-hurricanes-history-suggests-not-/7848619.html	2024-11-03T01:42:57-08:00	
Opponents use parental rights, anti-trans messages to fight abortion ballot measures	CHICAGO — Billboards with the words 'STOP Child Gender Surgery.' Pamphlets warning about endangering minors. 'PROTECT PARENT RIGHTS' plastered on church bulletins. As voters in nine states determine whether to enshrine abortion rights in their state constitutions, opponents are using parental rights and anti-transgender messages to try to undermine support for the ballot proposals. The measures do not mention gender-affirming surgeries, and legal experts say changing existing parental notification and consent laws regarding abortions and gender-affirming care for minors would require court action. But anti-abortion groups hoping to end a losing streak at the ballot box have turned to the type of language many Republican candidates nationwide are using in their own campaigns as they seek to rally conservative Christian voters. 'It's really outlandish to suggest that this amendment relates to things like gender reassignment surgery for minors,' said Matt Harris, an associate professor of political science at Park University in Parkville, Missouri, a state where abortion rights are on the ballot. Since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated constitutional protections for abortion, voters in seven states, including conservative Kentucky, Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated attempts to curtail them. 'If you can't win by telling the truth, you need a better argument, even if that means capitalizing on the demonization of trans children,' said Dr. Alex Dworak, a family medicine physician in Omaha, Nebraska, where anti-abortion groups are using the strategy. Tying abortion-rights ballot initiatives to parental rights and gender-affirming is a strategy borrowed from playbooks used in Michigan and Ohio, where voters nonetheless enshrined abortion rights in the state constitutions. Both states still require minors to get parental consent for abortions, and the new amendments have not yet impacted parental involvement or gender-affirming care laws in either state, said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University. 'It's just recycling the same strategies,' Cohen said. In addition to Missouri and Nebraska, states where voters are considering constitutional amendments this fall are Montana, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada and South Dakota. Missouri's abortion ballot measure has especially become a target. The amendment would bar the government from infringing on a 'person's fundamental right to reproductive freedom.' Gov. Mike Parson and U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, both Republicans, have claimed the proposal would allow minors to get abortions and gender-affirming surgeries without parental involvement. The amendment protects reproductive health services, 'including but not limited to' a list of items such as prenatal care, childbirth, birth control and abortion. It does not mention gender-affirming care, but Missouri state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican and lawyer with the conservative Thomas More Society, said it's possible that could be considered reproductive health services. Several legal experts told The Associated Press that would require a court ruling that is improbable. 'It would be a real stretch for any court to say that anything connected with gender-affirming care counts as reproductive health care,' said Saint Louis University law and gender studies professor Marcia McCormick. She noted that examples listed as reproductive health care in the Missouri amendment are all directly related to pregnancy. As for parental consent for minors' abortions, she pointed to an existing state law that is written similarly to one the U.S. Supreme Court found constitutional, even before Roe v. Wade was overturned. Most states have parental involvement laws, whether requiring parental consent or notification. Even many Democratic-leaning states with explicit protections for transgender rights require parental involvement before an abortion or gender-affirming care for minors, said Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law. A state high court would have to overturn such laws, which is highly unlikely from conservative majorities in many of the states with abortion on the ballot, experts said. In New York, a proposed amendment to the state constitution would expand antidiscrimination protections to include ethnicity, national origin, age, disability and 'sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive health care and autonomy.' The constitution already bans discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion. The measure does not mention abortion. But because it is broader, it could be easier for opponents to attack it. But legal experts noted that it would also not change existing state laws related to parental involvement in minors getting abortions or gender-affirming care. The New York City Bar Association released a fact sheet explaining that the measure would not impact parental rights, 'which are governed by other developed areas of state and federal law.' Yet the Coalition to Protect Kids-NY calls it the 'Parent Replacement Act.' Rick Weiland, co-founder of Dakotans for Health, the group behind South Dakota's proposed amendment said it uses the Roe v. Wade framework 'almost word for word.' 'All you have to do is look back at what was allowed under Roe, and there were always requirements for parental involvement,' Weiland said. Caroline Woods, spokesperson for the anti-abortion group Life Defense Fund, said the measure 'means loving parents will be completely cut out of the equation.' Weiland said those claims are part of a 'constant stream of misinformation' from opponents. If this campaign strategy failed in Michigan and Ohio, why are anti-abortion groups leaning on it for the November elections? Ziegler, the University of California, Davis, law professor, said abortion-rights opponents know they may be 'playing on more favorable terrain' in more conservative states like Missouri or in states like Florida that have higher thresholds for passing ballot measures. 'Anti-abortion groups are still looking for a winning recipe,' Ziegler said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opponents-use-parental-rights-and-anti-trans-messages-to-fight-abortion-ballot-measures/7848620.html	2024-11-03T01:41:38-08:00	
America's holiday calendar is increasingly diverse	NEW YORK — John Albert's daughter didn't go to school on Friday. And he couldn't be happier about it. For the first time, the high school senior and all of New York City's public school students have the day off to mark the holiday of Diwali, celebrated in India and among the global Indian diaspora as the victory of light over darkness and marked by communities of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs. To get the holiday added to the school calendar, where it joins other days off for Rosh Hashanah, Lunar New Year, Eid al-Fitr as well as federal holidays like Veterans Day, Christmas and Memorial Day, took years of pushing from those in New York's South Asian and Indo-Caribbean communities like Albert. But it was worth it. 'It was this feeling of wanting to weave our culture into New York,' he said. From religious and cultural holidays to region-specific commemorations to days meant to honor the towering figures and moments of U.S. history, the holiday calendars across the 50 states and the country at large are increasingly diverse ones, a reflection of and a window into the many communities that make up the American whole. Recognizing holidays creates community Including a smaller culture's or community's special days as something to recognize in the larger general culture is an act of unity, said Lauren Strauss, professor of modern Jewish history at American University. 'By doing that in an American context and by including a Muslim feast for the end of Ramadan and by including Diwali and including Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, my goodness. You're just saying it out loud, aren't you? You're saying that these cultures, these people, they aren't visitors, that they are a permanent part of this community, that it is multicultural and multiethnic,' she said. 'Whether or not you think it's good or bad, certainly it paints a different picture of what it means to be American and what the American calendar is.' A look at what days are marked as holidays in places around the country can be a crash course into what matters in those places. Louisiana, home to New Orleans, takes a day for Mardi Gras. In Hawaii, the state marks a day for King Kamehameha, who united the Hawaiian islands, as well as a day for becoming a U.S. state. California and some other states mark Cesar Chavez Day, named for the civil rights and labor movement activist. In Texas and in the southwest, there are celebrations scheduled for Friday marking Day of the Dead, the Mexican cultural remembrance of loved ones who have passed. The federal government, in addition to the 11 days that are days off for federal workers, has a host of days that it marks as national observances, like Harriet Tubman Day in March and Patriot Day on September 11. It keeps greeting card companies on their toes. 'Celebrating holidays and occasions, big or small, with the people we care about is a vital thread that runs through our shared human experience,' Kelly Ricker, chief product officer at American Greetings, said in a statement. The company is 'studying and talking to consumers, continuously' to keep up with the kinds of cards people are looking for. When Chris Sargiotto started his greeting card company Apartment 2 Cards about 15 years ago, the holiday offerings were limited to Christmas and Hanukkah. In recent years, he's added Kwanzaa and Ramadan, and is looking to bring Diwali cards onto the roster for next year. The additional holidays were added because of requests from his customers, the stores around that country that stock Apartment 2 cards, a reflection of increasing demand. 'It was stores asking for it because of their customers are asking for it,' he said. 'Whenever we introduce one of these specific cards, it seems to take off. So I think there definitely is the need for these.' There can be challenges as well But a holiday is not always uncontested. Take mid-October, when the federal government recognizes Columbus Day. It was added to the federal calendar in the 20th century after efforts from Italian Americans, who pushed for it as a way to stake their community's place in America. In the decades after though, Indigenous communities pushed back, citing the impact of colonization on their people and the continuing challenges. That has led to the spread of Indigenous People's Day marked on the same day, which while not a federally recognized is recognized in states around the country. And sometimes there's some learning that needs to happen as well. In Montville, New Jersey, the police department this month put a post on Facebook explaining to the community that with Diwali approaching, they would be more likely to see swastikas, a variation of which are ancient sacred symbols in some religions and not deployed in the way Hitler and the Nazis did. With both Jewish and Hindu communities in the town, it was done in an attempt to forestall misunderstanding, said Chief Andrew Caggiano, and has been met with an overwhelmingly positive response. 'It's a great opportunity,' he said, 'to raise awareness about other cultures that are that are in our community and that are part of our community at this point.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/america-s-holiday-calendar-is-increasingly-diverse/7848603.html	2024-11-03T01:41:06-08:00	
Ukrainian front-line school system goes underground to protect against bombs, radiation	ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — To be a parent in the Ukrainian front-line city of Zaporizhzhia means weighing your child's life against the Russian weapons within striking distance. Most rain death in an instant: the drones, the ballistic missiles, the glide bombs, the artillery shells. But Russian soldiers control another weapon they have never deployed, with the potential to be just as deadly: The nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The NPP, as it's known, once produced more electricity than any other nuclear power plant in Europe. It fell to Russian forces in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, and Russia has held its six reactors ever since. The plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides blame on the other. These twin dangers — bombs and radiation — shadow families in Zaporizhzhia. Most of the youngest residents of the city have never seen the inside of a classroom. Schools that had suspended in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic more than four years ago continued online classes after the war started in February 2022. So with missiles and bombs still striking daily, Zaporizhzhia is going on a building binge for its future, creating an underground school system. Construction has begun on a dozen subterranean schools designed to be radiation- and bomb-proof and capable of educating 12,000 students. Then, officials say, they will start on the hospital system. The daily bombs are a more tangible fear than radiation, said Kateryna Ryzhko, a mother whose children are the third generation in her family to attend School No. 88. The main building, dating to the Soviet era of the children's grandmother, is immaculate but the classrooms are empty. The underground version is nearly complete, and Ryzhko said she wouldn't hesitate to send her kids to class there. Nearly four years of online learning have taken their toll on kids and parents alike. 'Even classmates don't recognize each other,' she said. 'It's the only safe way to have an education and not be on screens.' Nuclear shadow Within days of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zaporizhzhia's 300,000 residents found themselves on the front lines. Unlike larger Ukrainian cities, like Kyiv or Kharkiv, there is no subway system that could do double-duty as a bomb shelter and few schools had basements where students could more safely attend classes. Many residents left — though some have returned. But the single-family homes and Soviet-style apartment blocks of Zaporizhzhia, the capital of the region that shares its name, filled nearly as quickly with Ukrainians fleeing areas seized by Russian forces, like the cities of Mariupol, Melitopol and Berdyansk. By the start of the school year in September 2022, which was supposed to mark the post-pandemic return to classrooms, schools were empty. Windows were boarded up to protect against bomb shockwaves, the lawns left unkempt. Fifty kilometers away, the nuclear reactor went into cold shutdown after intense negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Russian government. The IAEA has rotated a handful of staff on site ever since. There are risks even in cold shutdown, when the reactor is operating but not generating power. The main danger is that its external electrical supply, which comes from Ukrainian-controlled territory under constant Russian bombardment, will be cut off for a longer period than generators can handle. The nuclear plant needs electricity to keep crucial backups functioning, including water pumps that prevent meltdowns, radiation monitors and other essential safety systems. During a recent Associated Press trip to the Ukrainian-controlled zone closest to the nuclear plant, two airborne bombs struck electrical infrastructure in a matter of minutes as night fell. Russia has repeatedly struck at Ukraine's grid, attacks that have intensified this year. Highlighting the constant danger, electricity to the NPP was cut yet again for three days as emergency workers struggled to put out the fire. It was at least the seventh time this year that the plant was down to either a single electrical line or generator power, according to the global Nuclear Energy Agency. 'Nuclear power plants are not meant to be disconnected from the grid. It's not designed for that. It's also not designed to be operating in cold shutdown for that long,' said Darya Dolzikova, a researcher on nuclear policy at the Royal United Services Institute in London. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses Russia of targeting nuclear plants deliberately. The 1986 meltdown in Ukraine's Chornobyl, on the northern border nearly 900 kilometers from Zaporizhzhia, increased the country's rates of thyroid disease among Ukrainian children far from the accident site and radiation contaminated the immediate surroundings before drifting over much of the Northern Hemisphere. To this day, the area around the plant, known in Russian as Chernobyl, is an 'exclusion zone' off-limits except to the technical staff needed to keep the decommissioned site safe. Russian forces seized control of Chornobyl in the first days of the invasion, only to be driven back by Ukrainian forces. The Zaporizhzhia plant has a safer, more modern design than Chornobyl and there's not the same danger of a large-scale meltdown, experts say. But that doesn't reduce the risk to zero, and Russia will remain a threatening neighbor even after the war ends. An investment that might seem extreme elsewhere is more understandable in Ukraine, said Sam Lair, a researcher at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. 'They are there under a conventional air and missile attack from the Russians, and they have experience with the fact that those attacks aren't being targeted only at military targets,' Lair said. 'If I were in their position, I would be building them too.' In addition, the Zaporizhzhia region received a European Union donation of 5.5 million iodine pills, which help block the thyroid's absorption of some radiation. Since the start of the war, Russia has repeatedly alluded to its nuclear weapons stockpile without leveling direct threats. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would consider any attack by a country supported by a nuclear-armed nation to be a joint attack and stressed that Russia could respond with nuclear weapons to any attack that posed a 'critical threat to our sovereignty.' Ukrainian officials fear that the Russian attacks on Chornobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants may be just a start. During his speech in late September to the U.N. General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that Russia was preparing strikes on more nuclear plants, which generate a large portion of Ukraine's electricity. 'If, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, radiation won't respect state borders,' Zelenskyy said. Underground for the future The cost to build a subterranean school system is enormous — the budget for the underground version of Gymnasium No. 71 alone stands at more than 112 million hryvnias ($2.7 million). International donors are covering most of it, and the national and local governments have made it a priority on par with funding the army. 'Everybody understands that fortification and aid for the army, it's priority No. 1,' said Ivan Fedorov, head of the Zaporizhzhia region. 'But if we lose the new generation of our Ukrainians, for whom (do) we fight?' Daria Oncheva, a 15-year-old student at Gymnasium 71, looks forward to the underground classes, and not just because she'll finally be in the same place as her schoolmates. 'It's safer than sitting at home remotely,' she said. School No. 88, across town, is further along, with rooms carved out and fully lined with concrete thick enough to block an initial onslaught of radiation. The contractor leading the project is also digging trenches for Ukraine's military. When done, it will also be the primary bomb shelter for the neighborhood, whose single-family homes tend to have small orchards and trellised gardens — but no basements. An optimistic timeline has the school ready for children by December. It has three layers of rebar totaling 400 tons of metal, plus 3,100 cubic meters of reinforced concrete. The building will be topped by nearly a meter of earth, concealed by a soccer field and playground. The school will have an air filtration system, two distinct electrical lines and the ability to operate autonomously for three days, including with extra food and water supplies. Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who studies how people can survive nuclear fallout, said being underground improves survival by a factor of 10. But Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said ultimately people can do more — 'which is eliminating these weapons instead of … building, really not even a Band-Aid, for the actual problem.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-front-line-school-system-goes-underground-to-protect-against-bombs-radiation/7847291.html	2024-11-03T01:40:29-08:00	
Inspired by Harris, Black sorority and fraternity members help downballot races	HARTFORD, Conn. — U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes isn't a member of the historically Black sororities and fraternities known as the 'Divine Nine.' But throughout her hotly contested reelection campaign this year, Hayes, the first Black woman to represent Connecticut in Congress, has sometimes felt like she's a fellow soror, the term used by Black Greek organizations for sorority sisters. On their own, members have shown up to call voters, organize fundraisers, knock on doors, cheer Hayes on at campaign events and even offer pro bono legal help. 'I had people from Massachusetts come in to volunteer,' said Hayes, a Democrat who is seeking a fourth term. 'I've had people who had previously been considering going to a battleground state like Pennsylvania and are saying, 'No, we're going to stay right here and help out in this race in Connecticut.'' Downballot candidates like Hayes — particularly Black women — have benefited from a surge in support this year from volunteers who happen to be members of Black Greek organizations, many energized by Kamala Harris' presidential run. The vice president is a longtime member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., which was founded at her alma matter, Howard University, in 1908. Harris pledged AKA as a senior at Howard in 1986. Collectively known as the National Pan-Hellenic Council, the nine historically Black sororities and fraternities are nonpartisan and barred from endorsing candidates because of their not-for-profit status. The organizations focus on voter registration drives, civic engagement and nonelectoral initiatives and are careful not to show favor to a particular candidate. But many of the groups' members, as individuals, have been 'extremely active' in federal and state races around the country this year, said Jaime R. Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. 'I think that's a part of the Kamala Harris effect,' Harrison said during a recent visit to Connecticut. There were women affiliated with all the D9 sororities on a recent get-out-the-vote bus tour through New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland to support Black women on the ballot. Along with other volunteers, they knocked on hundreds of doors, made thousands of calls and sent out hundreds of postcards, urging people to vote. The trip was organized by the Higher Heights for America PAC, a nearly 13-year-old organization that works to elect progressive Black women. Members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. showed off their crimson and cream colors while stumping in Maryland for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks, a fellow Delta who is in a closely watched race against former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. Volunteers who are D9 sorority members also campaigned for Democratic U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha who is running for the U.S. Senate. If both candidates were elected, it would mark the first time two Black women have served in the Senate simultaneously. Latosha Johnson, a social worker from Hartford, recently participated in a get-out-the-vote phone banking session for Hayes along with other Black women who, like her, are members of Alpha Kappa Alpha. She said there's a realization among many Black and brown voters that the stakes in the election are particularly high. And if Harris wins, she'll need allies in Congress, Johnson said. 'If we don't get her a Congress that's going to be able to move things,' Johnson said, 'that becomes hard.' Hayes is in a rematch against former Republican George Logan, a former state senator who identifies as Afro-Latino but has not seen an outpouring of support from D9 members, according to his campaign. Both Harris and former President Donald Trump are courting Black voters in the final days of the presidential race. Harris' campaign has expressed concern about a lack of voting enthusiasm among Black men. While Trump's favorability among Black Americans has risen somewhat since he left office in 2021, two-thirds still identify as Democrats. About 2 in 10 identify as independents. About 1 in 10 identify as Republicans, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Voter registration and nonpartisan get-out-the-vote efforts by the sororities and fraternities, coupled with the mobilization of individual members, could potentially have an impact on some of these races, said Darren Davis, a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame. 'In local elections, in statewide elections, where the Black vote is more powerful and concentrated as opposed to in national elections, D9 organizations have this tremendous untapped ability to reach and to mobilize disaffected voters,' Davis said. The D9 fraternal groups were founded on U.S. college campuses in the early 1900s when Black students faced racial prejudice and exclusion that prevented them from joining existing white sororities and fraternities. In a tradition that continues today, the organizations focused on mutual upliftment, educational and personal achievement, civic engagement and a lifelong commitment to community service. Many of the fraternities and sororities served as training grounds for future civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. member Brandon McGee is a former Democratic state representative who now leads Connecticut's Social Equity Council on cannabis. As the father of two daughters, he is excited about helping Harris and Hayes win. 'I want my babies to see me working for a female who looks like their mother. And even beyond looking like their mother, a female,' he said. 'And I want my babies to know, 'You can do the same thing.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/inspired-by-harris-black-sorority-and-fraternity-members-help-downballot-races/7847208.html	2024-11-03T01:39:58-08:00	
Ballot box fires underscore concerns that conspiracy theories make them targets	atlanta, georgia — Two ballot drop boxes in the Pacific Northwest were damaged in a suspected arson attack just over a week before Election Day, destroying hundreds of ballots at one location in the city of Vancouver in the state of Washington. At the other, in neighboring Portland, Oregon, it appears a fire suppression system contained the blaze and limited the number of ballots damaged to three. Authorities are reviewing surveillance footage as they try to identify who is responsible. Here's what happened, how rules and security measures about drop boxes vary across the country, and how election conspiracy theories have undermined confidence in their use. What do we know? Police said incendiary devices started the fires in the drop boxes in Portland and Vancouver. Authorities said evidence showed the fires were connected and that they also are related to an October 8 incident when an incendiary device was placed at a different drop box in Vancouver. Multnomah County Elections Director Tim Scott said his office was planning to contact the three voters whose ballots were damaged in Portland to help them get replacements ballots. In Vancouver, hundreds of ballots were lost at a ballot box at the Fisher's Landing Transit Center when the drop box's fire suppression system did not work as intended. Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey said the box was last emptied at 11 a.m. Saturday. Voters who dropped their ballots there afterward are being urged to contact the office to get a new one. The office will be increasing how frequently it collects ballots and changing collection times to the evening to keep ballot boxes from remaining full overnight when vandalism is more likely to occur. Kimsey described the suspected arson as 'a direct attack on democracy.' When and where can drop boxes be used? Drop boxes have been used for years in states such as Colorado, Oregon, Utah and Washington, where ballots are mailed to all registered voters. They grew in popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, as election officials sought options for voters who wanted to avoid crowded polling places or were worried about mail delays. In all, 27 states and the District of Columbia allow ballot drop boxes, according to data collected by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Six others don't have a specific law but allow local communities to use them. Placement can vary widely. In some communities, they're located inside public buildings, available only during office hours. Elsewhere, they are outside and accessible at any hour, typically with video surveillance or someone watching. Sporadic problems have occurred over the years. In 2020, a few drop boxes were hit by vehicles, and one in Massachusetts was damaged by arson. In that case, most of the ballots were legible enough for voters to be identified and sent replacements. A drop box also was set on fire in Los Angeles County in 2020. How should they be secured? The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency advises state and local election officials to place drop boxes in convenient, high-traffic areas that are familiar to voters, such as libraries and community centers. If drop boxes are not staffed, they should be secured and locked at all times, located in well-lit areas and monitored by video surveillance cameras, the guidance says. Many are bolted to the ground, surveilled with cameras or confined to public buildings during business hours, where they can be monitored. How have conspiracy theories contributed to concerns around drop boxes? Ballot drop boxes have been in the spotlight for the last four years, targeted by right-wing conspiracy theories that falsely claimed they were responsible for massive voter fraud in 2020. A debunked film called '2,000 Mules' amplified the claims, exposing millions to a groundless theory that a ballot harvesting operation was depositing fraudulent ballots in drop boxes in the dark of night. An Associated Press survey of state election officials across the U.S. found there were no widespread problems associated with drop boxes in 2020. Paranoia about drop boxes continued into the 2022 midterms, when armed vigilantes began showing up to monitor them in Arizona and were restricted by a federal judge. This year, the conservative group True the Vote launched a website hosting citizen livestreams of drop boxes in various states. In Montana, where an important U.S. Senate race is on the ballot, Republicans recently seized on an unsubstantiated ballot box tampering claim to raise money off doubts about the electoral process. How have states responded since the 2020 election? Republican lawmakers in several states sought to tighten rules around mail voting after the 2020 election, and much of their focus was on the use of ballot drop boxes. Six states have since banned them: Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina and South Dakota, according to research by the Voting Rights Lab, which advocates for expanded voting access. Other states have restricted their use. This includes Ohio and Iowa, which now permits only one drop box per county, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. In Georgia's Fulton County, which includes Atlanta and has over 1 million residents, 10 ballot drop boxes are available for this year's presidential election. That's down from 38 four years ago under an emergency rule prompted by the pandemic. It's the result of an election overhaul by Georgia Republicans in response to former President Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election. Overall, 12 states prohibit drop boxes or do not list drop boxes as an approved method of returning a ballot, according to data collected by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five other states do not have a state law and do not use drop boxes. Drop boxes had been used for years in Wisconsin, one of this year's presidential battlegrounds, but support for them has split along ideological lines since 2020. In Wausau, the conservative mayor carted away the city's lone drop box, an action that's under investigation by the state Department of Justice. The drop box has since been returned and is in use.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ballot-box-fires-underscore-concerns-that-conspiracy-theories-make-them-targets/7845749.html	2024-11-03T01:39:26-08:00	
Liberty University sued by former IT staffer fired after disclosing she's a transgender woman	The bitter nationwide debate over transgender rights is playing out on a very personal level in a federal court lawsuit filed in Virginia by a former Liberty University employee. She was fired by the evangelical Christian school after disclosing her identity as a transgender woman. The lawsuit on behalf of Ellenor Zinski was filed in July by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and the Richmond law firm of Butler Curwood. It alleges that she was fired last year from her job on Liberty's Information Technology help desk solely because of her gender identity, in violation of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964. Earlier this month, the conservative legal organization Liberty Counsel filed a brief on behalf of the university asking the federal district court to dismiss the lawsuit. The brief contends that the Civil Rights Act explicitly permits religious educational institutions to make employment decisions consistent with their religious doctrine — in this case a doctrinal statement asserting that 'denial of birth sex by self-identification with a different gender' is sinful. Liberty University, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, has evolved over its five-decade history into one of the largest Christian universities in the world, with more than 100,000 students enrolled in its residential and online programs. One of its co-founders was the late Jerry Falwell Sr., the prominent televangelist and conservative activist; his son, Jerry Falwell Jr., served as president for 13 years before resigning in 2020 amid a series of personal scandals. The brief filed by Liberty Counsel alleges that Zinski attempted to 'set up' the university, applying for the IT job four months after beginning to take female hormones yet agreeing — when offered the job in February 2023 — to adhere to the school's statement rejecting transgender transition. Only after a 90-day probation ended did Zinski notify the university of the gender transition process and then request that the school 'depart from its doctrine and mission,' Liberty Counsel said in an effort to get the lawsuit dismissed. 'All of this was done to set Liberty up and attempt to make an example out of the university for standing its ground,' contended Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel's founder and chairman. Wyatt Rolla, the ACLU of Virginia's senior transgender rights attorney, rejected the claim of a set-up. 'It's strange to disparage Ellenor over what turned out to be real concern with employment discrimination,' they said. 'Her intention was to be a highly successful employee for Liberty who continued to meet all of her obligations.' The trans woman suing Liberty had grown up admiring the university Zinski, 30, says she was raised as a conservative Christian, attended a Christian high school, and took the job at Liberty hoping the university — which she had admired — would accept her even after learning of her transition. She had received a positive performance review after completing her probation. 'I was really hoping they would work with me ... that I could be myself,' she told The Associated Press. 'I was hoping I could advocate for queer people. We need Jesus just as much as anyone else does.' In her July 2023 letter to the university disclosing her transition, Zinski stressed that her Christian faith 'has been a guiding force throughout this process.' 'The public discourse surrounding the transgender community has imbued my journey with a certain degree of trepidation,' she wrote. 'However, I am hopeful that with your support and understanding, we can navigate this process with sensitivity and respect for all parties involved.' Zinski received no immediate response to her letter, leading to what she described as intense anxiety. After four weeks, she inquired about the status of her case and was promptly summoned to a meeting with Liberty human resources officials to be informed she was being fired. A lengthy email explaining the rational for the firing was read aloud to her at the meeting. 'Active and unrepentant patterns of sin, including sinful behaviors regarding sexual expression and/or gender expression, would be incompatible with our Christian workplace,' the email said. What lies ahead for Ellenor Zinski — and her lawsuit? Within a few months of her firing, Zinski was able to obtain a similar IT help-desk job at the University of Lynchburg, a small, private university. It is affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), a mainline Protestant denomination, and describes spiritual life on campus as 'inclusive and open.' 'A lot of people at work have my back,' Zinski said. She has also found support as an active member of Lynchburg's Trinity Episcopal Church. It was at Trinity, she says, that she was first assured that 'God made me this way.' The next formal step in the case will be the filing of a brief by the ACLU of Virginia opposing Liberty Counsel's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Daniel Schmid, a Liberty Counsel lawyer working on this case, said there would likely be a hearing — and perhaps a decision — on the motion to dismiss before the end of this year. Yet the case could linger far beyond that, he said, if there are appeals eventually leading to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a phone interview with the AP, Schmid alluded to the so-called 'ministerial exception' — which gives religious institutions protection against anti-discrimination lawsuits related to jobs with ministerial functions. Even with IT staff and janitors, Schmid said, 'Liberty considers them to be ministers of the Gospel. The First Amendment protects their right to make that call.' The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $300,000 on behalf of Zinski, as well as a declaration that the university's handling of the case violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Zinski told the AP she has no desire to return to work at Liberty, at least under its current leadership. 'My biggest fear if I ever went back is knowing there are people who do not want me there at all,' she said. 'I would not feel comfortable enough to work there.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/liberty-university-sued-by-former-it-staffer-fired-after-disclosing-she-s-a-transgender-woman/7845738.html	2024-11-03T01:38:37-08:00	
Latino evangelical voters torn between their faith and harsh rhetoric around immigration	The Rev. Arturo Laguna leads a largely immigrant church of about 100 followers in Phoenix. His job as a pastor, he says, gets complicated come election season. Laguna's church, Casa de Adoracion, is in Arizona — one of seven closely watched swing states that could possibly decide the next president. It is also a microcosm of the larger Latino evangelical Christian community in the U.S. The soft-spoken Laguna says, for the members of his congregation, voting is 'not an intellectual issue.' 'It's a matter of faith and spirituality,' he said. 'We're in a complicated moment because, on the one hand, we are against abortion, and on the other, we are concerned about the sharp rhetoric around immigration and lack of reform. It's a difficult choice.' This is not a new dilemma for Latino evangelicals, who are growing in numbers even as mainline white Protestant denominations have steadily declined. Latino evangelicals are an influential voting bloc. Both parties have tried to appeal to them over the past two election cycles — neither with remarkable success — according to faith and community leaders. A 2022 Pew Research Center survey showed 15% of Latinos in the U.S identify as evangelical Protestants. Among all American evangelicals, they are the fastest-growing group. About half of Latino evangelicals identified as Republicans or as independents who lean right, while 44% identified as Democrats or as independents leaning left. While U.S. Latinos generally favor Democratic candidates, a majority of Latino evangelicals backed Donald Trump in 2020. According to AP Votecast, about six in 10 Latino evangelical voters supported Trump in 2020, while four in 10 supported Biden. A Pew survey released last month showed that about two-thirds of Latino Protestants planned to back Trump this year, while about two-thirds of Hispanic Catholics and religiously unaffiliated Hispanics said they were supporting Vice President Kamala Harris. Agustin Quiles, president and founder of Mission Talk, a Florida-based Latino Christian social justice organization, says conflicting priorities leave some Latino evangelicals feeling politically homeless. Some are torn between their conservative views on social issues such as abortion and their desire to see immigration and criminal justice reform, he said. While many are offended by Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, Quiles added, Democrats still haven't figured out how to have conversations with the community about issues such as abortion. 'So there is a lot of silence among Latino evangelicals right now,' he said. 'That does not mean they are not going to vote. There is just a lot of discontent.' To understand Latino evangelicals, it is important to understand their origins, said Elizabeth Conde-Frazier, a scholar of the Association of Hispanic Theological Association. The word 'evangelico' pertains to Protestants or those who are not Catholic, which includes a wide swath of churches, cultures and traditions, she said. 'When immigrants come here and have to reestablish themselves, the Protestant, Pentecostal and mainline churches become spaces where people create a new sense of community and family,' Conde-Frazier said. 'People are trying to understand what life is supposed to be in this country.' With white Protestantism in decline and different mainline denominations vying for the loyalty of these communities, second-generation Latino Christians became more a part of the dominant culture and often embraced the fervor of the white evangelical church, she said. 'Latino churches, in order to gain a sense of power and acceptance, began to align with (white conservative) evangelical churches in the U.S., moving away from their 'evangelico' roots,' Conde-Frazier said. Now, she added, some Latino evangelicals find themselves increasingly at odds with their white counterparts because they are pro-immigration. Quiles says in white evangelical churches where Latinos, including undocumented immigrants, are growing in numbers, there is palpable dissonance between what is said in the pulpit and how those in the pews perceive it. 'Just because a pastor pushes anti-immigrant agenda, that does not mean members are receiving it,' he said. 'They selectively take what they want from the teaching.' The Rev. Juan Garcia, who leads a 100-strong Hispanic ministry at the First Baptist Church in Newport News, Virginia, said the word 'evangelico' represents the Gospel to him. He says the 'evangelical' label feels tainted because of its affiliation with one political party. 'Jesus is not Democrat or Republican,' he said. 'Some see their Christian values being represented by the Republican party and others see some of their values represented by the Democrats. But neither party is Christian in essence.' Garcia feels that sense of political homelessness, too. 'I have a candidate I may vote for, but no political party I'd like to belong to,' he said. 'The most important value we as Christians must live by is love — love our neighbors, the poor, those fleeing persecution.' Garcia said he has his 'opinions and inclinations' but doesn't view the candidate he favors as flawless. He warns his flock: 'If one is the anti-Christ, the other is not Christ.' The Rev. Jacqueline Tavarez, pastor of the Pentecostal Church of God in Raleigh, North Carolina, says her diverse congregation cares more about the values a political party represents rather than the face or the voice of the party. 'Our community doesn't care about the politics,' she said. 'They care about laws that affect our communities in terms of jobs, opportunities, education. And they view abortion and transgender laws as an attack on family values. When they see the ballot, they don't see Trump or (Harris). They see what the party supports and how the community is going to fare under a candidate.' The Rev. Lori Tapia, the Arizona-based national pastor and president of the Obra Hispana, Disciples of Christ, said politics is not typically integrated into the life of the Latino evangelical church. Unlike white evangelical congregations, political engagement happens more organically, she said. 'Here, the compassion piece is always stronger and there is a desire to see leaders who will prioritize compassionate politics,' Tapia said. 'There is also frustration at how slow progress is on critical issues. Anyone can pitch a story or a political campaign. But where is it being manifested in the lives of people who are struggling?' Bishop Angel Marcial, who leads the Church of God that oversees more than 15,000 churches, says some of the main issues for his congregants are healthcare education, public safety and housing. 'Voting gives you respect in this country and it brings opportunities for marginalized communities,' he said. 'As pastors, we don't tell people whom to vote for, but we do tell them about the platforms that best align with the values of the church and needs of our communities.' John P. Tuman, professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, observes that in Las Vegas, Latino evangelicals who join larger evangelical churches that have English and Spanish services tend to skew conservative. However, in communities that form their own congregations and conduct services in Spanish and Otomi, an Indigenous language in Mexico, are likely to have more diverse political views. 'They tend to be historically in favor of immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship, along with other elements of a social justice message that resonates more with Democratic candidates,' he said. Nevada is also a key swing state. Pastor Willie Pagan, who leads the 700-strong Iglesia de Dios in North Las Vegas that falls under the Church of God, said the economy is a top issue for his congregants. 'Yes, people are worried about immigration, but those who are here already, they want the economy to be stable,' he said. 'They see homelessness and crime growing in Las Vegas. Our church was in a rough neighborhood that has gotten rougher recently.' Pagan says some in his congregation believe they were better off financially and safer during the Trump administration, and wish to vote Republican to uphold their conservative religious values. But there are also those who fear they or their loved ones could get deported, he said. 'The struggle is real.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/latino-evangelical-voters-torn-between-their-faith-and-harsh-rhetoric-around-immigration/7845716.html	2024-11-03T01:37:51-08:00	
Indian Americans show shifting political loyalties ahead of presidential election	Washington — At a recent Diwali gathering in Denver, software architect Salil Gaonkar asked his Indian American friends to raise their hands: Would they vote for Trump or Harris in the presidential race? The response — from about 45 tech professionals and business owners who had overwhelmingly backed Joe Biden in 2020 — stunned him. Former President Donald Trump edged out Vice President Kamala Harris, albeit by a narrow margin. 'I was shocked,' Gaonkar, a progressive Democrat who is supporting Harris, said. 'Most of them voted for Biden, but now there was a significant shift and that surprised me really.' One dinner poll does not a trend make, but Gaonkar’s experience appears to reflect a broader national pattern. Indian Americans, long a reliable Democratic voting bloc, are showing signs of shifting allegiance. A Carnegie Endowment survey released this week showed the number of Indian Americans identifying as Democrats dropped to 47% from 56% in 2020. Harris, despite her Indian heritage, commanded just 60% support from a community that gave Biden nearly 70% of its votes four years ago. Trump, meanwhile, improved his support to 31% from 22%. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7%. And while other polls show stronger South Asian support for Harris, the shift in loyalties is significant, said Milan Vaishnav, director of Carnegie Endowment’s South Asia program and one of the co-authors of the study. 'We are seeing some signs of a greater shift or movement or acceptance of at least this Republican Party, led by Trump, and that to us, was a big surprise,' Vaishnav said in an interview with VOA last Friday. The rightward drift isn’t unique to Indian Americans. In recent years, Republicans have made surprising gains among Hispanic, Black, Arab and Muslim voters – all once deemed reliable Democratic voting blocs. Polls show a razor-thin race between Harris and Trump, and whether these shifts will propel the former president back to the White House remains uncertain. But the findings shatter a core assumption of American politics: that minority and immigrant communities are safely Democratic, Vaishnav said, during an online presentation Thursday. 'There has been this idea of demography is destiny and that the Democratic Party, which has been the natural home to ethnic and racial minorities and many if not most immigrant communities … will have a perpetual electoral advantage as the size of these groups increases,' he said. 'Clearly, there are many signs that that’s not true. Our survey is one of them.' More than 5 million strong, Indian Americans defy easy categorization. They’re predominantly Hindus, with smaller numbers of Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and others among them. While many first-generation Indians lean conservative, plenty don’t. Ahead of the Tuesday’s election, their concerns mirror those of other Americans: Inflation, abortion, jobs, and immigration. U.S.-India relations barely register. 'They vote like Americans because they are,' said Sumitra Badrinathan, a professor at the American University and one of three co-authors of the report, during the presentation. Demolishing long-held assumptions about the community, the Carnegie survey revealed that Harris' Indian heritage hasn’t helped her top Biden's 2020 numbers. More surprisingly, it showed that Indian American men under 40 — not their first-generation, supposedly 'traditional' elders — are driving the rightward shift. 'The Democrats don't have a problem with the uncles,' Vaishnav said. 'They have a problem with males under 40.' According to Pew Research, about two-thirds of Indian Americans are immigrants. Many are politically split by era. 'People who came in 1990 or later are clinging to Trump, but people [in] my dad’s generation are solidly Democratic,' said Angana Shah, a Michigan-based social justice lobbyist and lawyer. The divide between first- and second-generation Indians surfaces in other ways. For many recent arrivals, illegal immigration has emerged as a top concern. Gaonkar said his formerly Biden-supporting friends cite illegal border crossings as the main reason for switching to Trump. 'Indians hate the illegal immigration that skyrocketed under Biden,' Gaonkar said. 'We know what hoops we have had to go through to get into the country legally and stay here and to see some others come in like that is not right.' The sentiment cuts deep among first-generation immigrants. Take Dharmendra Jaiswal, a Maryland tech executive whose path to citizenship stretched nearly 20 years. He voted for Biden in 2020, his first presidential election, but now backs Trump. 'People are pissed off,' he said. 'Illegal immigrants are getting [education and health care] from our taxpayer money.' Indians make up the third-largest group of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. But Jaiswal said, 'illegal immigrant is illegal immigrant.' Suhag Shukla, co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation, said the backlash against illegal immigration makes sense. Immigration backlogs force many Indian immigrants to wait 10 to 20 years for green cards and citizenship. 'People should not be in limbo for 20 years, but unfortunately that is the state of the immigration program that we are dealing with today and many are speaking out just like many other Americans about the need to have stronger borders,' Shukla said in an interview with VOA this week. Criticized for being soft on unauthorized immigration, Harris has defended her record, highlighting a drop in illegal border crossings due to recent policy changes implemented by the Biden administration. For his part, Trump has vowed to carry out the 'largest deportation operation in American history.' Harris’ campaign, launched in July, electrified many progressive Indian Americans, drawing thousands of eager volunteers. But the enthusiasm masked a deeper reality: Her Indian heritage proved a weak draw for many voters. The Carnegie survey found that fewer than 1 in 10 Indian American supporters were motivated by her South Asian heritage. Towson University professor Pallavi Guha, an Indian American, said many members of her community are 'looking beyond identity politics.' 'People who are supporting Vice President Harris are supporting Vice President Harris because of the policies,' Guha, who lives in Howard County, Virginia, said in an interview with VOA on Thursday. A survey of South Asian voters by the Indian American Impact Fund, a political group, found Harris leading Trump, 68% to 20%, in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. With more than 400,000 eligible South Asian voters in these states, the community is 'poised to make the margin of difference in what will likely be a razor-thin election,' the group said in a statement last month. But the enthusiasm isn’t uniform. Rupal Shah, an Atlanta-based second-generation Indian American non-profit worker volunteering for IAI, sees a generational divide. 'I’m second generation and I believe that my generation of folks are very, very pro-Kamala, ready to vote for her, excited about her,' Shah said. 'And then when you talk to my parents or parents in general, you get a sense of excitement and a sense of nervousness.' 'Their fiscal concerns always kind of rise to the top, but there's also a lot of excitement about Kamala and who she represents and how she represents our community,' Shah said. VOA reached out to both the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment but did not receive a response from either group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-americans-show-shifting-political-loyalties-ahead-of-presidential-election/7849306.html	2024-11-03T01:37:25-08:00	
Palestinians say Israel struck Gaza clinic during polio campaign; army denies it	CAIRO — Palestinian officials say an Israeli drone strike on a clinic in northern Gaza where children were being vaccinated for polio wounded six people, including four children. The Israeli military denied responsibility. The alleged strike occurred Saturday in northern Gaza, which has been encircled by Israeli forces and largely isolated for the past year. Israel has been carrying out another offensive there in recent weeks that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. It was not possible to resolve the conflicting accounts. Israeli forces have repeatedly raided hospitals in Gaza over the course of the war, saying Hamas uses them for militant purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that a quadcopter struck the Sheikh Radwan clinic in Gaza City early Saturday afternoon, just a few minutes after a United Nations delegation left the facility. The World Health Organization and the U.N. children's agency, known as UNICEF, which are jointly carrying out the polio vaccination campaign, expressed concern over the reported strike. 'The reports of this attack are even more disturbing as the Sheikh Radwan Clinic is one of the health points where parents can get their children vaccinated,' said Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for UNICEF. 'Today's attack occurred while the humanitarian pause was still in effect, despite assurances given that the pause would be respected from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.' Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said that 'contrary to the claims, an initial review determined that the (Israeli military) did not strike in the area at the specified time.' A scaled-down campaign to administer a second dose of the polio vaccine began Saturday in parts of northern Gaza. It had been postponed from October 23 due to lack of access, Israeli bombings and mass evacuation orders, and the lack of assurances for humanitarian pauses, a U.N. statement said. The administration of the first dose was carried out in September across the Gaza Strip, including areas of northern Gaza that are now completely sealed off. Health officials said the campaign's first round, and the administration of the second dose across central and southern Gaza, were successful. At least 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate from areas of north Gaza toward Gaza City in the past few weeks, but around 15,000 children under the age of 10 remain in northern towns, including Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, which are inaccessible, according to the U.N. The final phase of the polio vaccination campaign had aimed to reach an estimated 119,000 children in the north with a second dose of oral polio vaccine, the agencies said, but 'achieving this target is now unlikely due to access constraints.' They say 90% of children in every community must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease. The campaign was launched after the first polio case was reported in Gaza in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralyzed in the leg. The World Health Organization said the presence of a paralysis case indicates there could be hundreds more who have been infected but aren't showing symptoms. The Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,400 Palestinians, with more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinians-say-israel-struck-gaza-clinic-during-polio-campaign-army-denies-it/7849358.html	2024-11-03T01:34:24-08:00	
Moldovan runoff election starts amid fraud and intimidation claims	CHISINAU, Moldova — Moldovans are casting votes in a decisive presidential runoff Sunday that pits pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu against a Russia-friendly opponent, as ongoing claims of voter fraud and intimidation threaten democracy in the European Union candidate country. In the first round held October 20, Sandu obtained 42% of the ballot but failed to win an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general, who outperformed polls in the first round with almost 26% of the vote. Polling stations opened Sunday at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and will close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT). A poll released by research company iData indicates a tight race that leans toward a narrow Sandu victory, an outcome that might rely on Moldova's large diaspora. The presidential role carries significant powers in areas such as foreign policy and national security and has a four-year term. Moldova's diaspora played a key role in a nationwide referendum also held on October 20, when a narrow majority of 50.35% voted to secure Moldova's path toward EU membership. But the results of the ballots including Sunday's vote have been overshadowed by allegations of a major vote-buying scheme and voter intimidation. Instead of winning the overwhelming support that Sandu had hoped, the results in both races exposed Moldova's judiciary as unable to adequately protect the democratic process. On Friday, Moldova's Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that people throughout the country were receiving 'anonymous death threats via phone calls' in what he called 'an extreme attack' to scare voters in the former Soviet republic, which has a population of about 2.5 million people. 'These acts of intimidation have only one purpose: to create panic and fear,' Recean said in a statement posted on social media. 'I assure you that state institutions will ensure order and protect citizens.' Outside a polling station on Sunday in Romania's capital, Bucharest, 20-year-old medical student Silviana Zestrea said the runoff would be a 'definitive step' toward Moldova's future. 'People need to understand that we have to choose a true candidate that will fulfill our expectations,' she said. 'Because I think even if we are a diaspora now, none of us actually wanted to leave.' In the wake of the two October votes, Moldovan law enforcement said that a vote-buying scheme was orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled oligarch who lives in Russia and was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering. Shor denies any wrongdoing. Prosecutors say $39 million was paid to more than 130,000 recipients through an internationally sanctioned Russian bank to voters between September and October. Anticorruption authorities have conducted hundreds of searches and seized over $2.7 million (2.5 million euros) in cash as they attempt to crack down. In one case in Gagauzia, an autonomous part of Moldova where only 5% voted in favor of the EU, a physician was detained after allegedly coercing 25 residents of a home for older adults to vote for a candidate they did not choose. Police said they obtained 'conclusive evidence,' including financial transfers from the same Russian bank. On Saturday at a church in Comrat, the capital of Gagauzia, Father Vasilii told the Associated Press that he's urged people to go and vote because it's a 'civic obligation' and that they do not name any candidates. 'We use the goods the country offers us — light, gas,' he said. 'Whether we like what the government does or not, we must go and vote. ... The church always prays for peace.' On Thursday, prosecutors also raided a political party headquarters and said 12 people were suspected of paying voters to select a candidate in the presidential race. A criminal case was also opened in which 40 state agency employees were suspected of taking electoral bribes. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told the AP that whatever the outcome of the second round, it 'will not deflate' geopolitical tensions. 'On the contrary, I expect geopolitical polarization to be amplified by the campaign for the 2025 legislative elections,' he said. Moldovan law enforcement needs more resources and better-trained staff working at a faster pace to tackle voter fraud, he added, to 'create an environment in which anyone tempted to either buy or sell votes knows there will be clear and fast consequences.' Savlina Adasan, a 21-year-old economics student in Bucharest, says she voted for Sandu and cited concerns about corruption and voters uninformed about the two candidates. 'We want a European future for our country,' she said, adding that it offers 'many opportunities, development for our country … and I feel like if the other candidate wins, then it means that we are going ten steps back as a country.' A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, and a parliamentary election will be held in 2025. Moldova watchers warn that next year's vote could be Moscow's main target. In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was granted candidate status in June of that year, and in summer 2024, Brussels agreed to start membership negotiations. The sharp Westward shift irked Moscow and significantly soured relations with Chisinau. Since then, Moldovan authorities have repeatedly accused Russia of waging a vast 'hybrid war,' from sprawling disinformation campaigns to protests by pro-Russia parties to vote-buying schemes that undermine countrywide elections. Russia has denied it is meddling.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovans-to-choose-president-in-decisive-runoff-overshadowed-by-fraud-and-intimidation-claims/7849351.html	2024-11-03T01:15:54-08:00	
Nevada lithium mine will crush rare plant habitat US said is critical to its survival, lawsuit says	RENO, Nevada — Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources. The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.'s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas. It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden's administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels. The new lawsuit says the Interior Department's approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S. wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm's buckwheat was 'in danger of extinction now' when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022. 'One cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,' said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno. 'The use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,' said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff. Rita Henderson, spokesperson for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment. Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and 'vigorously defend' approval of the project, 'which was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.' 'We are confident that the BLM will prevail,' Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year. The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than 1.6 kilometers away described as 'a site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.' But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 15-centimeter-tall wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig. The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 3.6 square kilometers the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants — home to various pollinators important to their survival — would be lost for decades, some permanently. When proposing protection of the 368 hectares of critical habitat, the service said 'this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm's buckwheat.' The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status. 'We find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm's buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,' the agency concluded. The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion. The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says. The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project 'will result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nevada-lithium-mine-will-crush-rare-plant-habitat-us-said-is-critical-to-its-survival-lawsuit-says-/7849321.html	2024-11-02T22:55:29-07:00	
UN talks on saving nature stumble on funding hurdle	Cali, Colombia — The world's biggest nature conservation conference closed in Colombia on Saturday with no agreement on a roadmap to ramp up funding for species protection. With other successes under its belt, the 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) to the U.N.'s Convention on Biological Diversity was suspended by its president, Susana Muhamad, as negotiations ran almost 12 hours longer than planned and delegates started leaving to catch flights. The exodus left the summit without a quorum for decision-making, but CBD spokesman David Ainsworth told AFP it will resume at a later date to consider outstanding issues. 'We will continue working because this crisis is too big and we cannot stop,' Muhamad told AFP after declaring the Cali COP closed. The conference, the biggest meeting of its kind yet with about 23,000 registered delegates, was tasked with assessing, and ramping up, progress toward reaching 23 targets set in Canada two years ago to halt humankind's rapacious destruction of nature's bounty by 2030. They include placing 30% of land and sea areas under protection and 30% of degraded ecosystems under restoration by 2030, reducing pollution, and phasing out agricultural and other subsidies harmful to nature. For this purpose, it was agreed in 2022 that $200 billion per year be made available to protect biodiversity by 2030, including the transfer of $30 billion per year from rich to poor nations. The total for 2022 was about $15 billion, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. On top of that, nations have pledged about $400 million to a Global Biodiversity Framework Fund created last year to meet the U.N. targets. In Cali, negotiators were split largely between poor and rich country blocs as they haggled over increased funding and other commitments. The biggest ask from the summit — to lay out a detailed funding plan — turned out to be a bridge too far. Muhamad, Colombia's environment minister, had offered a draft text proposing the creation of a dedicated biodiversity fund, which was rejected by the European Union, Switzerland and Japan. Developing nations had insisted on the creation of a new fund, saying they are not adequately represented in existing mechanisms including the GBFF, which they say are also too onerous. The lack of agreement is 'a negative signal that will have repercussions on the other environmental negotiations at the end of the year because it reveals a deep disagreement on the technical possibility of making transfers between the Global North and South,' said Sebastien Treyer, of the French think tank Iddri. The meeting did manage to coalesce around the creation of a fund to share the profits of digitally sequenced genetic data taken from plants and animals with the communities they come from. Such data, much of it from species found in poor countries, is notably used in medicines and cosmetics that can make their developers billions, very little of which ever trickles back down. The Cali agreement determines that genetic data users whose income exceeds a certain threshold should contribute 1% of profits or 0.1% of revenue to the new fund, potentially worth billions of dollars per year. Delegates also approved the creation of a permanent body to represent the interests of Indigenous people under the U.N.'s Convention on Biological Diversity. Representatives of Indigenous peoples, many in traditional dress and headgear, broke out in cheers and chants as the agreement was gaveled through. But the talks on biodiversity funding stumbled even as new research presented to coincide with COP16 showed that more than a quarter of assessed plants and animals are now at risk of extinction. Only 17.6% of land and inland waters, and 8.4% of the ocean and coastal areas, are estimated to be protected and conserved. Observers welcomed the summit's advances on Indigenous representation and gene profit sharing but lamented the funding deadlock. 'Governments in Cali put forward plans to protect nature but were unable to mobilize the money to actually do it,' said An Lambrechts, the head of Greenpeace's COP16 delegation. 'Biodiversity finance remains stalled after a deafening absence of credible finance pledges from wealthy governments and unprecedented corporate lobbying.' The meeting was held amid a massive security deployment following threats from a Colombian guerrilla group with its base of operations near Cali. No incidents were reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-talks-on-saving-nature-stumble-on-funding-hurdle/7849302.html	2024-11-02T19:24:54-07:00	
Families separated by US-Mexico border reunite for a few precious minutes	CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico — Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with loved ones they had not seen for years because they live in different countries. Tears flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to reunite for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to the U.S. Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with their loved ones. This year, the annual 'Hugs Not Walls' event organized by an immigrant rights advocacy group happened three days before the U.S. presidential election, whose monthslong campaigns have focused heavily on immigration and border security. It also took place under decreased security, according to the Network in Defense of the Rights of Migrants. 'We did not have barbed wire, we did not have so many soldiers deployed in our community,' said Fernando Garcia, the organization's director, highlighting the border security changes that the border has seen since the reunions began last decade. 'The barbed wire had to be opened so that the families could have this event.' Garcia said he expects migration into the U.S. to continue regardless of who wins Tuesday's election. Family reunions, he said, will continue, too. 'Deportation policy, border policy, immigration policy, is separating families in an extraordinary way and is deeply impacting these families,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/families-separated-by-us-mexico-border-reunite-for-a-few-precious-minutes/7849296.html	2024-11-02T19:05:41-07:00	
VOA immigration weekly recap, Oct. 27–Nov. 2	Editor's note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com. By immigrants, for immigrants: 'Documented' covers immigration through a personal lens In New York City, a media outlet run by immigrants for immigrants uses messaging apps to engage with communities on elections, crime and local issues. Liam Scott and Cristina Caicedo Smit have the story, narrated by Caicedo Smit. Tina Trinh contributed. Naturalized citizens to play a bigger role in 2024 election Naturalized immigrants will make up 10% of Americans eligible to vote in 2024. What impact might they have on the election? US border arrests remained lower in October amid Biden asylum restrictions U.S. border authorities apprehended about 54,000 migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in October, according to preliminary figures obtained by Reuters. They show a marginal rise from September but continue the broader downward trend since June when new restrictions were imposed under President Joe Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has called for even tougher border restrictions in the face of criticism by Republican candidate Donald Trump over illegal immigration. Reuters reports. Migrant families separated under Trump still feel fallout, fear his return With the United States on the verge of an election that could put former President Donald Trump back in office, Billy wants people to know that what happened to him and several thousand other children still reverberates. Some families have not been reunited, and many of those together in the U.S. have temporary status and fear a victorious Trump carrying out promised mass deportations. The Associated Press reports. Immigration around the world VOA60 World - At least 10 dead after Israeli airstrike on a street in Gaza’s Nuseirat Refugee Camp An Israeli strike on a street in central Gaza’s Nuseirat Refugee Camp killed at least 10 people, including children, and injured 20 others, according to Palestinian health officials and Associated Press journalists.

Canada-India tensions could escalate cyberthreats, hinder immigration Canada's deepening dispute with India over its alleged campaign of violence against Sikhs in Canada could intensify Indian-based cyber espionage and hold back immigration, but analysts and experts see no immediate impact on trade. Concern about a widening rift between the two countries comes after a senior Canadian official told a parliamentary national security committee Tuesday that Indian Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah, a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the mastermind behind the alleged plots. Reported by Reuters. Sudan displacement crisis worsens as fighting, hunger, sexual violence escalates The International Organization for Migration warned Tuesday that Sudan’s displacement crisis is worsening as increasing numbers of people flee fighting, hunger and sexual violence, thereby threatening 'regional instability.' 'The scale of this displacement and the corresponding humanitarian needs grows every day,' Amy Pope, IOM director general, told journalists in Geneva on a video link from Port Sudan. Lisa Schlein reports for VOA from Geneva. Uganda struggles to feed 1.7 million refugees as international support dwindles Uganda is home to more than 1.7 million refugees, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Despite being renowned for welcoming those fleeing neighboring violence, Ugandan officials and humanitarians say dwindling international support coupled with high numbers of refugees have put much pressure on host communities. Reported by The Associated Press. Russian army deserters hope French asylum decision will encourage others to flee Thousands of Russians, including soldiers, have sought asylum in the West since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 — though only a small fraction of their applications have been approved. This month, however, France allowed several Russian army deserters to enter the country to seek refugee status. Henry Ridgwell reports.

Russia, Ukraine accuse each other of obstructing prisoner swaps	MOSCOW — Kyiv called on Moscow on Sunday to provide a list of Ukrainian prisoners of war ready for a swap after Russia accused Ukraine of sabotaging the exchange process. In requesting the list of Ukrainians from his Russian counterpart, Ukrainian human rights commissioner Dmytro Lubinets wrote on his Telegram messaging channel: 'We are always ready to exchange prisoners of war!' Kyiv and Moscow have frequently exchanged prisoners since Russia's full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbor in 2022. The last swap took place in mid-October with each side bringing home 95 prisoners. On Saturday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Ukraine was essentially sabotaging the process and has refused to take back its own citizens. Zakharova said Russia's defense ministry had offered to hand over 935 Ukrainian prisoners of war, but that Ukraine had taken only 279. Lubinets, in turn, said that Ukraine was always ready to accept its citizens and accused Russia of slowing the exchange process. Russian Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova said on Saturday that Ukraine has politicized the issue. 'We consider it necessary to return to a constructive dialog and speed up the exchange of prisoners,' Moskalkova wrote on Telegram.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-accuse-each-other-of-obstructing-prisoner-swaps-/7849284.html	2024-11-02T17:47:28-07:00	
B-52 bombers arrive in Middle East, US military says	Washington — American B-52 bombers have arrived in the Middle East, the U.S. military said Saturday, a day after Washington announced their deployment in a warning to Iran. 'B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers from Minot Air Force Base's 5th Bomb Wing arrived in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility,' the military command for the Middle East and surrounding countries said in a post on social media. The United States announced Friday evening that it was sending the bombers, fighter and tanker aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the Middle East. 'Should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people,' Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said in a statement on the deployment. Israel launched strikes against Iran on October 26, hitting military infrastructure while steering clear of critical nuclear and oil sites, and the country's supreme leader has vowed that Tehran will retaliate for Israeli attacks. Iran has carried out two major attacks against Israel in 2024, one in April after a strike on its consulate in Damascus that was blamed on Israel, and another in October that Tehran said was in response to the assassination of leaders of armed groups it backs in the Middle East.	https://www.voanews.com/a/b-52-bombers-arrive-in-middle-east-us-military-says/7849285.html	2024-11-02T17:44:29-07:00	
North Korean 'white paper' says South Korea's president raised risk of nuclear war	seoul — North Korean state media released a white paper Sunday accusing South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol of exposing his country to the danger of nuclear war through his policies toward the North. The document, compiled by North Korea's Institute of Enemy State Studies and released by state news agency KCNA, criticized Yoon's 'reckless remarks' about war, abandoning elements of an inter-Korean agreement, engaging in nuclear war planning with the United States, and seeking closer ties with Japan and NATO. 'It's ever-worsening military moves resulted only in the paradoxical consequences of pushing [North Korea] to stockpile its nuclear weapons at an exponential rate and further develop its nuclear attack capability,' the paper said. Yoon, a conservative, has taken a hard line on North Korea, which has forged ahead with developing its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions. His administration blames North Korea for raising tensions with weapons tests and providing military aid and troops to aid Russia's war in Ukraine. Pyongyang has been taking steps to sever inter-Korean ties, redefining the South as a separate, hostile enemy state since Kim Jong Un declared it a 'primary foe' early this year and said unification was no longer possible. North Korea blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas last month, and satellite imagery shows it has since built large trenches across the former crossings. The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. The two Koreas also have clashed over balloons of trash floated since May from North Korea. Pyongyang has said the launches are a response to balloons sent by anti-regime activists in the South. Sunday's white paper also listed Yoon's domestic political woes, including scandals involving his wife, which have driven his approval ratings to record lows.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-white-paper-says-south-korea-s-president-raised-risk-of-nuclear-war-/7849275.html	2024-11-02T17:22:00-07:00	
Supporters of Bolivia's ex-leader Morales detain 200 soldiers: government	La Paz, Bolivia — Supporters of former Bolivian president Evo Morales are holding at least 200 soldiers hostage, the Foreign Ministry said Saturday, as their standoff with the state continues to escalate. Three military units in Chapare province were 'assaulted by irregular groups' Friday, with the assailants 'taking more than 200 military personnel hostage' from three barracks, the ministry said. 'They seized weapons and ammunition,' it added. Backers of Morales, the country's first Indigenous leader, began blocking roads three weeks ago to prevent his arrest on what he calls trumped-up charges aimed at thwarting his political comeback. The government had sent troops to the area in Cochabamba department to help police in clearing the roadblocks. Early reports Friday had mentioned only 20 soldiers being detained. A video broadcast Friday showed 16 soldiers surrounded by protesters holding pointed sticks. 'They have cut off our water, electricity and are keeping us hostage,' a uniformed man is heard saying. Morales, after first threatening a hunger strike unless the government agreed to negotiations, later urged his supporters to consider suspending the roadblocks to 'avoid bloodshed.' Morales, 65, was in office from 2006 to 2019, when he resigned under a cloud after elections marked by fraud. Despite being barred from running again, Morales wants to challenge President Luis Arce, his former ally, for the nomination of the left-wing MAS party in elections next August. Days after he led a march of thousands of mainly Indigenous Bolivians on the capital La Paz to protest Arce's policies, prosecutors announced Morales was under investigation for statutory rape, human trafficking and human smuggling over his alleged relationship with a 15-year-old girl in 2015. Morales has called the accusations 'a lie.' On Wednesday, Arce demanded an 'immediate' end to the roadblocks, saying the government would 'exercise its constitutional powers to safeguard the interests of the Bolivian people.' It was in Chapare that Morales claimed last week he was the victim of an assassination attempt that he blamed on state agents. A video he shared on social media showed his pickup truck riddled with bullet holes. The government said police fired on the vehicle after Morales's convoy first opened fire at a checkpoint. Morales' supporters initially demanded an end to what they called his 'judicial persecution.' But the protest movement has snowballed into a wider antigovernment revolt marked by calls for Arce to resign. They blame Arce, who has been in power since November 2020, for a sharp rise in food and fuel prices and shortages that pre-date the protests. At least 90 people, mostly officers, have been injured in clashes surrounding the protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supporters-of-bolivia-s-ex-leader-morales-detain-200-soldiers-government/7849278.html	2024-11-02T17:18:55-07:00	
Protesters demonstrate in Tel Aviv to demand end of war, return of hostages	Tel Aviv, Israel — Hundreds of protesters in Tel Aviv, Israel, voiced their frustration with the government Saturday for failing to secure a truce to bring the remaining hostages in Gaza home. Flag-waving demonstrators in the country's commercial hub held placards with slogans including 'Deal now,' 'Stop the war' and 'We won't abandon them,' and beat drums and chanted 'Why are they still in Gaza?' 'There have been countless opportunities to end this crisis, and each one was torpedoed by the government,' said demonstrator Zahiro Shahar Mor, a 52-year-old bank employee from Tel Aviv. 'The cycle of violence is escalating week after week and we see no end,' said Mor, whose uncle Avraham Munder was killed in captivity in Gaza, and who is campaigning for the release of others' loved ones. Critics have questioned why a truce has still not materialized now that Israel has achieved many of its war aims, including last month's killing of Hamas's leader Yahya Sinwar. Israeli and U.S. officials as well as some analysts have said Sinwar was an obstacle to reaching a truce in the war between Israel and Hamas. Ifat Kalderon, a prominent antigovernment protester afraid for her cousin still held in Gaza, blamed Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister. 'Each hostage deal they start to talk about, he sabotages. He always blamed Sinwar, but now there is no Sinwar. But every time he finds another reason,' the 50-year-old stylist told AFP. 'It's a bloody war, we need to stop it. Enough. So many soldiers are dying. And ordinary citizens,' she said, referring to civilians from both sides of the conflict paying with their lives. Some at the rally — organized by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group — brought up the plight of Israel's soldiers, who are exhausted more than a year into the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Others hoped for international intervention, including from the United States, which holds a presidential election Tuesday. 'I hope whoever wins will be adult enough to take the kids in the Middle East by the ear and force them to the negotiating table,' said protester Mor. He said he was 'disappointed, frustrated and angry' at the lack of a hostage deal but was 'keeping the hope for the people who are still alive' in Gaza. Sinwar's killing had spurred hope that fresh life could be breathed into months of fruitless negotiations for a truce with hostage and prisoner releases. The talks have been mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stop-the-war-say-israelis-demanding-return-of-gaza-hostages-/7849068.html	2024-11-02T16:49:29-07:00	
Time to 'fall back' an hour as daylight saving time ends	The good news: You will get a glorious extra hour of sleep. The bad: It'll be dark by late afternoon for the next few months in the United States. Daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. local time Sunday, which means you should set your clock back an hour before you go to bed. Standard time will last until March 9, when we will again 'spring forward' with the return of daylight saving time. 'Fall back' should be easier. But it still may take a while to adjust your sleep habits, not to mention the downsides of leaving work in the dark or trying to exercise while there's still enough light. Some people with seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression usually linked to the shorter days and less sunlight of fall and winter, may struggle, too. Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have said it's time to do away with time switches and that sticking with standard time aligns better with the sun — and human biology. Two states — Arizona and Hawaii — don't change and stay on standard time. Here's what to know about the twice-yearly ritual. How the body reacts to light The brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that determines when we become sleepy and when we're more alert. The patterns change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into hard-to-wake teens. Morning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light in the evening — that extra hour from daylight saving time — delays that surge and the cycle gets out of sync. How do time changes affect sleep? Even an hour change on the clock can throw off sleep schedules — because even though the clocks change, work and school start times stay the same. That's a problem because so many people are already sleep deprived. About 1 in 3 U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven-plus hours nightly, and more than half of U.S. teens don't get the recommended eight-plus hours on weeknights. How to prepare for the time change Some people try to prepare for a time change jolt by changing their bedtimes little by little in the days before the change. There are ways to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep.	https://www.voanews.com/a/time-to-fall-back-an-hour-as-daylight-saving-time-ends-/7849055.html	2024-11-02T15:25:35-07:00	
VOA Interview: UN special rapporteur details Russia's state-sanctioned torture	washington — Mariana Katzarova, United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Russia, reported Tuesday on the human rights situation in Russia at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, describing torture as Moscow's main tool of repression. In an interview with VOA, Katzarova detailed how the Russian government has turned brutality into the new norm and how Russians are persecuted for their anti-war views. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: You came to Washington with a new report about torture in Russia. The torture system is not something new. Did it get worse during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine? U.N. Special Rapporteur on Russia Mariana Katzarova: The main message of this report was about the state-sanctioned system of torture being a tool used in a widespread and systematic manner by the authorities for oppression and control of Russian society. Yes, it did get worse. First of all, because it's a tool in the war against Ukraine. For example, we don't even know how many. Still, thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been detained in the occupied territories of Ukraine by the Russian forces and then deported to Russia proper in Russian prisons. They're kept incommunicado. They have been tortured, including with electric shocks, with sexual violence, rape against them. Many of them haven't even been charged with any criminal offenses; they're just kept there kidnapped. I've seen pictures of some of them who have been tried in Rostov-on-Don in military courts. I mean, they look like [they're] coming from concentration camps. Also, after the terrorist attack in March in Moscow, it was kind of, you know, a new page was turned where the authorities almost legitimized torture, normalized it, almost encouraged it to be happening because they allowed it on the national television to show torture of the suspects, Tajik migrants. As it happened, the suspects in the Crocus [City Hall] attack, terrorist attack, [were subjected to beatings and torture] including the electric shock to the genitals of one of the suspects or [the] cutting of the ear. There was another transmission on television. These people were [nearly] dead and were brought in front of a judge, and the judge completely pretended that nothing was happening. VOA: Are you expecting any reaction from Russian officials regarding that report? Katzarova: I, of course, as a special rapporteur of the U.N. system, I hope that the Russian Federation will pay attention because governments around the world are in charge of protecting the rights of their citizens. If the Russian authorities are not interested in the protection of the human rights of their own people, this is shocking. I mean, that's why I'm hoping that they're not going to turn a blind eye, particularly when we're talking about torture, which is entirely outlawed by international law under all circumstances. VOA: You said you would like to have some constructive dialogue with the Russian officials. Is that possible? Katzarova: All special rapporteurs of the U.N. are independent experts the governments appoint, members of the U.N., to advise and present the truth about the human rights situation in these countries. Of course, in normal circumstances, I should have had a constructive dialogue with the Russian authorities. So far, it's been one way. It's a monologue. I'm presenting my report. They're reading it, but they're not answering. All I can say is that I am planning to send them my new letters. I do it every year after my mandate is voted on by the governments of the Human Rights Council. They're not allowing me to visit Russia to meet with all the Russian people, victims of human rights violations, lawyers, the government authorities, the ombudsperson for human rights. This is what we should be doing as special rapporteurs. VOA: What kind of role can the U.N. play in helping the victims? Katzarova: First of all, this report is shedding light on the continuing almost full, complete impunity for torturing ill-treatment. Various people of various targeted groups, starting with [the ones] I just mentioned, the Ukrainian detained civilians and POWs, but also from the Russian society. These are the LGBT persons who are pronounced as extremist organizations by the Supreme Court of Russia. These are the mobilized conscientious objectors and the mobilized men who refuse to fight and who are tortured as well, subjected to torture, to ... convince them to continue fighting or join the war against Ukraine. And, of course, now another targeted group where the political prisoners, they're being subjected to torture as conditions of detention. They're also a target for the authorities, of course, to begin with. Alexey Navalny spent something like 394 and 96 days in SHIZO, which is a special punishment cell. Also, anti-war activists have been subjected in administrative detention to something called Carrousel. They're kept for two weeks, then another two weeks until criminal cases are fabricated against them. And we know of deaths in custody of such activists under torture. VOA: If some Russian officials, let's say, Sergey Lavrov, would listen to us right now, what would you say? Katzarova: I would say, 'Dear Mr. Lavrov, Your Excellency, please respect your own laws and most importantly, the international law and the rules of the United Nations. All the conventions that you have signed and ratified. And please respect the human rights of the Russian people. They're your people, and they deserve better than languishing in prisons. They deserve better than being herded, and then sent to fight in the war, which is not their war. So, please respect human rights and show the United Nations that you deserve to be a member of the Security Council and a beacon, a country to show the way for other countries that need to follow in your steps because you're one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. And please stop the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people and the Russian people suffered enough because of this aggressive war. What else can we do apart from shed light? Speak up, not be afraid, and wait for our messages and the truth to be heard. As we say in Bulgaria and other countries, the darkest time is before sunrise.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-interview-un-special-rapporteur-details-russia-s-state-sanctioned-torture-/7849048.html	2024-11-02T15:07:58-07:00	
Agreement signed at UN summit gives Indigenous groups voice	CALI, Colombia — After two weeks of negotiations, delegates on Saturday agreed at the United Nations conference on biodiversity to establish a subsidiary body that will include Indigenous peoples in future decisions on nature conservation, a development that builds on a growing movement to recognize the role of the descendants of some regions' original inhabitants in protecting land and combating climate change. The delegates also agreed to oblige major corporations to share the financial benefits of research when using natural genetic resources. Indigenous delegations erupted into cheers and tears after the historic decision to create the subsidiary body was announced. It recognizes and protects the traditional knowledge systems of Indigenous peoples and local communities for the benefit of global and national biodiversity management, said Sushil Raj, Executive Director of the Rights and Communities Global Program at the Wildlife Conservation Society. 'It strengthens representation, coordination, inclusive decision making, and creates a space for dialogue with parties to the COP,' Raj told The Associated Press, also known as the Conference of Parties. Negotiators had struggled to find common ground on some key issues in the final week but came to a consensus after talks went late into Friday. 'Historical debt' The COP16 summit, hosted in Cali, Colombia, was a follow-up to the historic 2022 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures to save Earth's plant and animal life, including putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030. A measure to recognize the importance of the role of people of African descent in the protection of nature was also adopted in Cali. The Indigenous body will be formed by two co-chairs elected by COP: one nominated by U.N. parties of the regional group, and the other nominated by representatives of Indigenous peoples and local communities, the AP saw in the final document. At least one of the co-chairs will be selected from a developing country, taking into account gender balance, the document said. 'With this decision, the value of the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities is recognized, and a 26-year-old historical debt in the Convention on Biological Diversity [CBD] is settled,' Susana Muhamad, Colombia's environment minister and COP16 president, posted on social media platform X shortly after the announcement. Who owns nature's DNA was one of the most contentious and fiercely negotiated topics at the summit as tensions spiked between poorer and developed countries over digital sequence information on genetic resources, or DSI. Negotiators consented on Saturday morning, however, to bind big companies to share benefits when using resources from animals, plants or microorganisms in biotechnologies. Delegations agreed on a genetic information fee of 0.1% of companies' revenues from products derived from such information. 'Many of the life-saving medicines we use today come from the rainforest. It is therefore right that a portion of the income companies generate from this information goes back to protect nature,' said Toerris Jaeger, executive director of Rainforest Foundation Norway. 'This is the absolute highlight from COP16.' Needs exceed pledges Also adopted was an agreement to protect human health from Earth's increasing biodiversity issues. Ecosystem degradation and loss of ecological integrity directly threaten human and animal health, environmental groups say. Pledges made by countries during the two weeks were far short of the billions needed to tackle plummeting global biodiversity, with only around $400 million in the fund. The modest pledges don't bode well for the next U.N. climate talks, COP29, to take place in Azerbaijan beginning later this month. COP29 is expected to focus on how to generate trillions of dollars needed for the world to transition to clean energies such as solar, wind and geothermal. Raising that money will require major commitments by nations, companies and philanthropies. In Montreal's biodiversity summit, wealthy nations pledged to raise $20 billion in annual conservation financing for developing nations by 2025, with that number rising to $30 billion annually by 2030. Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London biennial Living Planet report in October.	https://www.voanews.com/a/agreement-signed-at-un-summit-gives-indigenous-groups-voice-/7849034.html	2024-11-02T14:11:47-07:00	
Mexicans celebrate Day of Dead, grapple with keeping tradition	MEXICO CITY — Every year this time Mexico erupts in celebrations during the Day of the Dead. Families gather at cemeteries across the country on November 1 to reconnect with their dead just as their ancestors have done for centuries. For many more in small communities, it's also about preserving the core of their traditions as celebrations in places in bigger hubs have increasingly been marked by mass tourism. 'We're conserving our tradition, part of our heritage that my mother instilled in me,' said 58-year-old Antonio Melendez. 'We can't let it be lost.' Observance dates back centuries Melendez was among throngs of people gathered in the cemetery, tucked away in the maze of canals and brick buildings in Xochimilco, a borough in south of Mexico City that has long carried on traditions that have faded away in other parts of the country. He gathered with his two daughters around the grave of his mother, marked by orange flower petals spread out in the shape of a cross and bouquets of pink flowers, his mother's favorite color. Melendez said she died last year, and the loss was still fresh, so he was trying to remember her by continuing with the same rituals he watched her carry out growing up, this time with his daughters. He started preparing for the celebration four days before, making tamales from scratch and building a small altar for her in their home. Day of the Dead dates back centuries to ancient Indigenous civilizations, which would organize parties when someone died to guide them on to the next life, and lay out food in altars to nourish them on their journeys. When Spanish colonizers arrived and began forcing Catholicism upon Indigenous communities, they would mix Indigenous traditions with Catholic holidays. Celebrations of the dead then synced up with All Saints Day on November 1, ending on November 2. While celebrations begin ramping up at the end of October, Mexican tradition says that on that night their deceased are closest to the living world, and people hope to keep them company. Each family celebrates in different ways. In San Gregorio Pantheon, elderly women carry massive bundles of orange flowers, the iconic flower of death. Some families sob into each other's arms. Others sit alone next to loved one's graves in silence. Many more drink mezcal and tell stories of their family members. 'It's like being with them' Gathered with her daughter and granddaughter, 60-year-old Beatriz Chavez kneels at the graves of her son, nephew and father, quietly lighting candles. 'It's like being with them one more year, feeling like even if they don't see them, we feel like we're closer to them,' Chavez said, noting that she planned to sleep in the graveyard, just like she did every year since her father died when she was 10. Over the years, the tradition has been the focus of the Disney film Coco. A Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City was also featured in a James Bond film, despite such a parade not existing in real life. Annual celebrations later adopted the idea of the parade from the movie. Now, people from all over the world have flocked to the Latin American nation, eager to experience the rich tradition for themselves. But once quaint celebrations in hubs for the Day of the Dead like Mexico City, Oaxaca and Michoacan have started to brim with tourists, who snap photos of mourners. In recent years, many Mexicans have also started to mix the celebration with Halloween. Other new traditions — such as the James Bond parade — have popped up. Some, like Melendez, prickle at the shifts. 'Here, Halloween isn't ours, it's Day of the Dead,' he said. 'It's sad because it's getting distorted. We're losing the essence of who we are. This is a part of us, our roots.' For Melendez, it adds an extra level of importance to the celebration in their small cemetery, which he and others say has stayed true to the centuries-old traditions. It coincides with a larger conversation playing out across Mexico amid an influx of American 'expats' and tourists. As more move to or travel to Mexico City, rents have gotten so high that many Mexicans have been pushed out of areas they've lived in for much of their lives, leaving frustration simmering in much of the city. Those who wander the graves and sell flowers and food in the streets see the changes less as a loss of tradition, and more as an evolution — a way for younger generations to continue passing on their heritage in their own ways, and share it with new audiences.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexicans-celebrate-day-of-dead-grapple-with-keeping-tradition-/7849024.html	2024-11-02T13:29:47-07:00	
Israel captures senior Hezbollah operative in Lebanon, military says	BATROUN, Lebanon — Israeli naval forces captured a senior Hezbollah operative in north Lebanon, an Israeli military official said Saturday. Earlier on Saturday, Lebanese authorities said they were investigating whether Israel was behind the capture of a Lebanese sea captain who was taken away by a group of armed men who had landed on the coast near the northern town of Batroun on Friday. 'The operative has been transferred to Israeli territory and is currently being investigated,' the military official said, without providing the name of the person in detention. Two Lebanese military officials confirmed to the Associated Press that a naval force landed in Batroun, about 30 kilometers north of Beirut, and abducted a Lebanese citizen. Neither gave the man's identity or said whether he was thought to have links to Lebanon's Hezbollah group. They did not confirm whether the armed men were an Israeli force. Speaking to Lebanon's Al-Jadeed TV, Ali Hamie, Lebanon's minister of Public Works and Transport, declined to go into details or answer questions about whether it was thought to be an Israeli operation. Three Lebanese judicial officials told AP the incident occurred at dawn Friday, adding that the captain might have links with Hezbollah. The officials said an investigation is looking into the man to determine if he is linked to Hezbollah or working for an Israeli spy agency and an Israeli force came to rescue him. Both the military and judicial officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were unauthorized to share details about the incident or the ongoing investigation. Hezbollah issued a statement calling what happened a 'Zionist aggression in the Batroun area.' The statement did not give details or confirm whether one of Hezbollah's members was captured by Israel. Israel has carried out commando operations deep inside Lebanon to kidnap or kill Hezbollah and Palestinian officials. Residents of the apartment building where the man was seized said the armed group introduced themselves as state security. 'We were terrified. They were breaking into the apartment next to ours,' Hussein Delbani told The Associated Press near where the man was captured. 'I thought a state agency was doing a security operation,' said Delbani, who was displaced from south Lebanon a month ago when the Israel-Hezbollah war erupted. He said he saw from his balcony people down on the coast and they ordered him to go inside. Hamie told Al-Jadeed the man was a captain of civilian ships. He graduated in 2022 and in late September joined the Batroun's Maritime Sciences and Technology Institute for additional courses. Hamie said that the man lived some 300 meters from the institute. Hamie's remarks came shortly after two Lebanese journalists posted a video on social media showing what appeared to be about 20 armed men taking away a man from in front a house, his face covered with his shirt. Kandice Ardiel, a spokesperson for the United Nations peacekeeping force deployed in south Lebanon, denied allegations by some journalists who said the peacekeepers helped the landing force in the operation. The U.N. mission, known as UNIFIL, has a maritime force that monitors the coast. 'Disinformation and false rumors are irresponsible and put peacekeepers at risk,' Ardiel said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-captures-senior-hezbollah-operative-in-lebanon-military-says-/7849012.html	2024-11-02T12:35:14-07:00	
Iran arrests female student who stripped to protest harassment	Paris — Iranian authorities arrested a female student Saturday after she staged a solo protest against harassment by stripping to her underwear outside her university, reports said. The woman, who has not been identified, had been harassed inside the prestigious Tehran Azad University of Science and Research by members of the Basij militia who ripped her headscarf and clothes, according to reports by several news outlets and social media channels outside Iran. She then took off her clothes in protest and sat outside the university dressed just in her underwear before defiantly walking in the street to the astonishment of passers-by, videos posted on social media channels showed. Under the dress code mandatory in Iran, women must wear a headscarf in public and loose-fitting clothes that cover all bodily contours. The footage, which was first posted by Iranian student social media channel, the Amir Kabir newsletter, was published by numerous Persian-language outlets, including the Dadban legal affairs social media channel, the Hengaw rights group and Iran Wire news website. The footage appeared to have been shot by onlookers in a neighboring building. Another video showed her being bundled into a car by men in plain clothes and driven off to an undisclosed location. The Amir Kabir newsletter alleged she was beaten during the arrest. It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports, but Iran's conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident in a report, publishing a picture with the student heavily blurred out. It said the student had worn 'inappropriate clothes' in class and 'stripped' after being warned by security guards to comply with the dress code. Citing 'witnesses,' it insisted that the security guards spoke 'calmly' with the student and denied the reports that their action had been aggressive. Unprecedented women-led protests erupted in 2022 demanding the abolition of the mandatory dress code following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach. The protests, which saw women break taboos by removing their headscarves and on occasion even burning them, subsided in the face of a crackdown that left 551 protesters dead and thousands arrested.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-arrests-female-student-who-stripped-to-protest-harassment-/7849000.html	2024-11-02T12:02:39-07:00	
Presidential candidates make pitch to Black voters in North Carolina	North Carolina is one of seven so-called swing states that could determine the next U.S. president. Kamala Harris, Donald Trump and their surrogates have spent a lot of time campaigning in this southern state.

Indian troops kill 3 suspected rebels in disputed Kashmir	SRINAGAR, INDIA — Three suspected militants were killed Saturday in separate gunbattles in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Saturday. India’s military in a statement said soldiers intercepted a group of militants in a forested area in southern Anantnag district Saturday, leading to a gunbattle that killed two rebels. In a separate incident in the disputed region’s main city of Srinagar, police and paramilitary soldiers killed a militant in an exchange of gunfire after troops cordoned off a neighborhood on a tip that he was hiding in a house. Police said two soldiers and two police were injured in the fighting. Residents said the troops torched the home where the rebel was trapped, a common tactic employed by Indian troops in the Himalayan region. There was no independent confirmation of the incident. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-troops-kill-3-suspected-rebels-in-disputed-kashmir/7848957.html	2024-11-02T10:22:27-07:00

Clashes in Mozambique as police disperse election protests	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Police in Mozambique fired tear gas and rubber bullets Saturday as they dispersed protests in several cities over a disputed presidential election, according to local sources and AFP reporters. Unrest has rocked the southern African nation since an October 9 election, which was won by the ruling Frelimo party, in power since 1975, but denounced as fraudulent by opposition parties. Election observers, including some from the European Union, have noted irregularities and denounced violence before, during and after the vote. The leading opposition candidate, Venancio Mondlane, has called for nationwide protests until November 7, with a final rally planned in Maputo. On Saturday, hundreds of people who had gathered to protest the election results in Maputo were dispersed by police with tear gas and rubber bullets, according to AFP reporters on the scene. Police were seen patrolling the city Saturday to try to dissuade residents from other parts of the country from coming to next week's protest. In the northern province of Nampula, almost 2,000 kilometers (more than 1,200 miles) from the capital, clashes broke out in several areas Saturday between protesters and police, a witness and a local group told AFP. In the city of Nampula, 'at approximately 9 a.m. almost 500 people took to the street on Trabalho Avenue to contest election results,' said Constantino Jose, a taxi driver in the city. 'Protesters also gathered in Arresta [the largest market in Nampula] and blocked some roads,' said Jose. 'Police shot tear gas and real bullets to disperse the crowd,' he said, without giving further details. A local civil society group, Plataforma Decide, told AFP that 'Nampula province is in chaos' and that 'in Nampula City ... the police fired tear gas.' Police did not respond to AFP's request for comment on the reports. In the town of Namialo, some 95 kilometers (60 miles) from Nampula, 'over 100 demonstrators burnt tires on the street,' a local journalist said, adding that 'a strong police contingent' had been deployed to the area. He asked to remain anonymous as he feared for his safety. Another source said that at least nine people had been shot, but it wasn't immediately clear if it was by tear gas or bullets. A local official, Melchior Focas, an administrator in Meconta-Namialo, confirmed to AFP there had been 'clashes' in the area. Mozambique has imposed internet restrictions since post-electoral violence broke out, including blocking access to Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Mondlane has widely used social media platforms to communicate with his supporters and rally them to protest. The spiral of unrest started shortly after the election, turning violent on October 24 when the electoral commission declared Frelimo's Daniel Chapo, 47, winner with almost 71% of votes. Mondlane, 50, of the small Podemos party, came in second with 20% but said the results were 'false.' Police have said that 20 people have been injured in post-electoral violence and that two people have died, without giving details. An investigation was opened into Mondlane following the unrest and his calls for '25 days of terror.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-in-mozambique-as-police-disperse-election-protests/7848911.html	2024-11-02T09:23:56-07:00	
Greek anti-terror police arrest man after deadly Athens blast	ATHENS, GREECE — Greek anti-terror investigators have arrested a man in connection with a deadly explosion in Athens, police said Saturday, warning of 'a new generation of terrorists' at work. Thursday's blast in an apartment in the capital, which killed a man and seriously injured a woman, is suspected to have been caused by the accidental detonation of a homemade bomb. Police sources told AFP they had identified the dead man from his dismembered remains as a 36-year-old from the port city of Piraeus who had been previously arrested in Germany. His fingerprints were in the international database of Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, the sources said. Investigators have also opened a case for alleged participation in a terrorist organization and committing terrorist acts against the injured woman, 33, who was hospitalized under police supervision, and a 30-year-old woman who remains at large. In their statement, police said Saturday that the arrested man was detained after turning himself in Friday. He is believed to have a connection with one of the two women wanted in the case but has denied having anything to do with the explosion, police said. Police said that a search of the apartment produced two handguns, wigs and face masks among other materials. Greek police sources told AFP that investigations were ongoing and that the deceased and those charged were probably members of 'a new generation of terrorists.' The country has a decades-old history of far-left extremism involving small urban groups. The shadow November 17 group, named after an anti-junta student uprising, was behind the 1975 killing of the CIA’s Athens station Chief Richard Welch and claimed responsibility for assassinating 23 people in scores of attacks on U.S., British, Turkish and Greek targets between the 1970s and 1990s. In the past decade, scores of arson and bomb attacks in Greece have hit financial, diplomatic and political targets, with police blaming radical anarchists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greek-anti-terror-police-arrest-man-after-deadly-athens-blast/7848887.html	2024-11-02T08:48:06-07:00	
Russia jails ex-US consular employee on security charges	MOSCOW — A court in Russia's far east said on Friday it had convicted Robert Shonov, a former U.S. consular employee, of illegally and covertly cooperating with the U.S. government to harm Russia's national security and had jailed him for nearly five years. Russia's FSB security service detained Shonov, a Russian national, in Vladivostok in May 2023 and accused him of taking money to covertly supply U.S. diplomats with information that was potentially harmful to Russia. The United States on Saturday condemned the conviction, calling it 'an egregious injustice.' 'The allegations against Mr. Shonov are entirely fictitious and without merit,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement. A court in the Primorsky region in Russia's far east confirmed in a statement on Friday that it had found Shonov guilty and had sentenced him to four years and 10 months in a penal colony. Video of the verdict being read, released by the court, showed Shonov listening inside a courtroom cage as the judge sentenced him. The FSB published a video in August 2023 showing a purported confession by Shonov in which he said two senior U.S. diplomats based in Moscow whom Russia later expelled had asked him to collect information about Russia's war effort in Ukraine, its annexation of 'new territories,' its military mobilization and the 2024 Russian presidential election. In the video, Shonov said he was told to gather 'negative' information on these topics, to look for signs of popular protest, and to reflect these in his reports. It was not clear whether he was speaking under duress. Shonov was employed by the U.S. Consulate General in Vladivostok for more than 25 years until Russia in 2021 ordered the dismissal of the U.S. mission's local staff.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-jails-ex-us-consular-employee-on-security-charges/7848877.html	2024-11-02T08:38:01-07:00	
Patty to dump rain on the Azores; Tropical Storm Lane to weaken	MIAMI, FLORIDA — A storm system will likely bring heavy rain to the Azores islands over the weekend, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Saturday. Subtropical Storm Patty is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2.5 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2 inches) across the archipelago through Sunday. The Hurricane Center said swells generated by Patty are likely to cause dangerous surf and rip current conditions. Patty is clocking maximum sustained winds of nearly 80 kilometers per mile (50 miles per hour) with higher gusts. The Azores are an island chain are located about 1,290 kilometers (800 miles) from Portugal. Tropical Storm Lane Separately, a tropical storm formed over the Pacific Ocean early Saturday but remained far off the coast of Mexico. Tropical Storm Lane was located about 2,455 kilometers (1,525 miles) west-southwest off the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported in an advisory early Saturday. There were no immediate coastal watches or warnings in effect. The storm is expected to begin weakening sometime Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/patty-to-dump-rain-on-the-azores-tropical-storm-lane-to-weaken/7848867.html	2024-11-02T08:30:04-07:00	
Robot retrieves first melted fuel from Fukushima nuclear reactor	TOKYO — A remote-controlled robot has safely returned with a tiny piece of melted fuel it collected from inside one of three damaged reactors at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant for the first time since the 2011 meltdown. Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, said Saturday that the extendable fishing rod-like robot successfully clipped a gravel as big as 5 millimeters, the size of a tiny granola bit, from the top surface of a mound of molten fuel debris that sits on the bottom of the No. 2 reactor’s primary containment vessel. The Telesco robot, with its frontal tongs still holding the melted fuel bit, returned to the enclosed container for safe storage after workers in full hazmat gear pulled it out of the containment vessel earlier Saturday. The sample marks the first time that melted fuel has been retrieved out of the containment vessel. But the mission is not over until it's certain that the sample's radioactivity is below a set standard and safely placed into a container. If the radioactivity exceeds the limit, the robot must go back inside the reactor to find another piece. TEPCO officials said they expect the piece is small enough to meet the requirement. The mission initially started in August for what was supposed to be a two-week round trip but had been suspended twice due to mishaps. The first one was the procedural mistake at the beginning that held up the work for nearly three weeks. Then the robot’s two cameras, designed to transmit views of the target areas for its operators in the remote-control room, failed. The camera problem required the robot to be pulled out all the way for replacement before the mission resumed Monday. Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive molten fuel remains in them, and TEPCO has carried out a number of robotic probes to figure out how to decommission the plant. Telesco on Wednesday successfully clipped a piece presumably measuring less than 3 grams (0.1 ounce) from the planned area right underneath the Unit 2 reactor core, from which large amounts of melted fuel fell during the meltdown 13 years ago, TEPCO said. Plant chief Akira Ono said only the tiny spec can provide key data to plan decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and retroactively learn how the accident developed. The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target for the cleanup, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. No specific plan for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal has been decided.	https://www.voanews.com/a/robot-retrieves-first-melted-fuel-from-fukushima-nuclear-reactor/7848862.html	2024-11-02T08:18:13-07:00	
New leader of British Conservatives is first Black woman in the role	LONDON — Kemi Badenoch became the Conservatives' new leader and the first Black woman to a head a major British political party, after winning a leadership contest Saturday on a promise to return the party to its founding principles. Badenoch, 44, replaces former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and has pledged to lead the party through a period of renewal after its resounding defeat in Britain's July election, saying it had veered toward the political center by 'governing from the left.' On the right of the Conservative Party, Badenoch will likely back policies to shrink the state and challenge what she says is institutional left-wing thinking, saying it is time to defend the principles of free speech, free enterprise and free markets. Badenoch becomes the Conservatives' fifth leader since mid-2016 after winning 57% of party members' votes in the final stage of a monthslong contest that saw a field of six whittled to two. She beat a former immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, who received 43% of the votes. Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed her victory, saying 'the first Black leader of a Westminster party is a proud moment for our country.' Badenoch has publicly said she prefers not to focus on her race. Asked at the Conservative Party conference earlier this year how it would feel to become the first Black woman leader of the party, she said: 'I am somebody who wants the color of our skin to be no more significant than the color of our hair or the color of our eyes.' Vaughan Gething became the first Black leader of the Welsh Labour Party earlier this year but resigned after four months as the first minister of Wales after a wave of ministerial resignations in protest over his leadership. 'Tell the truth' Badenoch promised on Saturday to tackle problems in the party head-on. 'The time has come to tell the truth,' she told the audience at the final count of the leadership contest, promising to answer the main questions over how the Conservatives lost the July election so badly. 'It is time to get down to business, it is time to renew.' With forthright views on issues ranging from what she calls identity politics to the value of officials, Badenoch attracts strong admirers and detractors. She is certain to shake up the Conservatives, who saw their contingent of lawmakers in the 650-seat parliament fall in July to 121 from 365 seats in 2019. With the Labour government off to a bumpy start, some Conservatives are increasingly optimistic that they could win back power at the next election, which must be held in 2029. But some more centrist Conservatives worry Badenoch might alienate not only the more moderate wing of the party but also some voters who were won over by the centrist Liberal Democrats at the last election. The former trade minister's time in government was often marked by disputes with the media, celebrities and her own officials. But her no-nonsense approach has also won over many supporters, including the Conservative members who chose her over Jenrick. 'The task that stands before us is tough, but simple,' she told party members. 'Our first responsibility as his majesty's loyal opposition is to hold this Labour government to account. 'Our second is no less important: It is to prepare over the course of the next few years for government.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-leader-of-british-conservatives-is-first-black-woman-in-the-role/7848845.html	2024-11-02T07:52:04-07:00	
Taiwan expects Ukraine-tested weapons from US amid rising Chinese pressure	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan is expected to receive several weapons that have been battle tested in Ukraine from the United States over the next few years. Analysts say those weapons can help bolster Taiwan’s defense and strike capabilities amid growing military pressure from China. In the latest round of arms sales to Taiwan, worth about $2 billion, the United States plans to deliver three medium-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, also known as NASAMS. The weapons include advanced AMRAAM Extended Range surface-to-air missiles. The proposed sales will help improve Taiwan’s security and 'assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,' the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement released October 26. NASAMS has been battle-tested in Ukraine and is viewed by experts as a significant elevation of Taiwan’s air defense capabilities. Australia and Indonesia are the other countries in the Indo-Pacific region that have received the system from the U.S. Experts say that NASAMS has a high interoperation capability, and that the medium-range air defense system provides needed coverage in Taiwan’s existing air defense capabilities. 'Currently, Taiwan relies on Stinger missiles for short-range air defense while using the Patriot missile system or Taiwan’s indigenous Tien Kung for long-range air defense, so NASAMS can help fill the gap of Taiwan’s medium-range air defense,' said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. He told VOA by phone that when NASAMS is incorporated into Taiwan’s air defense system, it can improve the island’s capabilities to deal with the increasingly frequent patrols the Chinese military is conducting around Taiwan. 'As Chinese naval vessels and military aircraft increase the frequency of their combat-readiness patrols near Taiwan, the risk of abrupt missile attacks launched by Chinese vessels is also increasing, so acquiring NASAMS can further enhance Taiwan’s capabilities to deal with these potential threats,' Su said. In addition to the surface-to-air missile system, Taiwan’s National Defense Ministry said the island is expected to receive 29 sets of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, from the United States between the end of 2024 and 2026. The rocket system has been credited with helping Ukraine destroy Russian weapons or equipment in the ongoing conflict. Apart from receiving HIMARS from Washington, at least 17 Taiwanese soldiers were trained to use the rocket system at a military base in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, this past August. After a post on the military base’s official Facebook page showed Taiwanese soldiers participating in HIMARS training with counterparts from Romania and Estonia, which has since been removed, Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo said Friday that Taiwan had planned to send at least 30 soldiers to receive HIMARS training in the U.S. between February and October this year. Since Ukraine has used HIMARS to strike Russian military bases and weaken the Russian military’s momentum, some Taiwanese experts say the systems potentially can be used to target Chinese military facilities in coastal areas. 'The Taiwanese military can use HIMARS to hit some Chinese military facilities along the southeastern coast or target invading troops in different parts of Taiwan,' said Chieh Chung, a research fellow at the Association of Strategic Foresight in Taiwan. Overall, Chieh told VOA by phone, the acquisition of NASAMS and HIMARS can enhance Taiwan’s capabilities in conducting network-centric warfare and deter China from easily launching an attack against Taiwan. Other analysts say the series of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan reflects Washington’s commitment to supporting Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities, but China will interpret the latest developments as a provocation from Taiwan and the U.S. 'Beijing will interpret this as changing the status quo [across the Taiwan Strait] nevertheless,' Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told VOA in a written response. China views Taiwan as part of its territory and repeatedly has vowed to reunify with the island, by force, if necessary. In response to the latest U.S. arms sales to Taiwan last week, Beijing condemned it and urged Washington to stop what it called dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China showcases its naval capability The arms sales and training come as China’s two aircraft carriers, Liaoning and Shandong, conducted a dual formation exercise for the first time in the disputed South China Sea from late September to October. Chinese military analyst Song Zhongping told the state-run China Daily newspaper that the exercise will allow the two Chinese aircraft carriers to 'integrate and magnify the power' and 'enable the fleet to better organize strikes and handle threats from air and sea.' Chieh in Taiwan said China is showing the U.S. it could assert maritime claims in disputed waters in the Indo-Pacific region at a time when U.S. aircraft carriers are deployed to the Middle East. 'Since the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has forced the U.S. to deploy its aircraft carrier groups to the region, China is trying to remind Washington that it can impose control over certain parts of the Indo-Pacific region amid an American absence,' he said. Nagy in Japan said that while China can demonstrate its capability to operate aerial and naval assets near areas of potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific region — such as the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait — such a formation also exposes the Chinese aircraft carriers as obvious targets for more experienced fighting forces. 'Losing one or two of China’s few aircraft carriers would have a very serious reputational cost for the Chinese Communist Party, and the U.S. and its partners understand this, so they are preparing for their scenarios,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-expects-ukraine-tested-weapons-from-us-amid-rising-chinese-pressure/7848827.html	2024-11-02T07:25:33-07:00

War makes it harder to hold journalists’ killers accountable, experts say	WASHINGTON/NEW YORK — Achieving justice in the targeted killings of journalists is a difficult task made even more complicated in cases that take place in wartime, experts say. On a global scale, 85% of journalist killings around the world since 2006 remain unsolved, according to a report released by UNESCO on Saturday. In 2013, the United Nations declared November 2 the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. Impunity in journalist killings has long been the norm, and active conflict exacerbates the problem, according to Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. 'You have fewer resources to devote to investigations,' Ginsberg told VOA. 'Courts are often overwhelmed. The ability to do investigations is hampered because there’s a live conflict going on.' That has been the case in the Israel-Hamas war, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, civil war in Myanmar and gang violence in Haiti. The war in Gaza With the Israel-Hamas war, as of October 31, at least 134 journalists and media workers — primarily Palestinians — have been killed since the conflict began last year, according to CPJ. CPJ has determined that the Israeli military targeted five of them in direct connection to their work as journalists. Israel ranks second worst in the world in terms of impunity in journalist killings, according to CPJ’s index, which was published Wednesday. In one incident on October 13, 2023, the Israeli military fired two tank shells 37 seconds apart in southern Lebanon in the direction of media crews. The journalists were about one mile from the closest hostilities, wore vests marked 'PRESS' and stood next to a car marked 'TV,' according to reports. The attack killed Lebanese Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah and injured six other reporters. CPJ and news outlets have determined the case was a deliberate attack. At the time, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations said Israeli forces would never want to 'kill or shoot any journalist' who is working, but that 'in a state of war, things might happen. We regret them, we feel sorry.' The ambassador said that Israel would investigate. 'I’m dismayed that there has been no accountability since the attack on October 13, but not surprised,' Ginsberg told VOA in September in New York. Impunity in journalist killings has been a problem in Israel for decades, she added. CPJ is investigating the possible targeted killings of 10 more journalists in the Israel-Hamas war. Determining what happened is difficult because of the conflict and restrictions on access for foreign media to Gaza. 'Anyone responsible for the killing of a journalist, of a civilian, should be prosecuted and held accountable. Journalists are civilians. They’re not targets,' Ginsberg said. Israel’s military did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment for this story. Israel has previously denied targeting journalists. The civil war in Myanmar Accountability is also difficult in Myanmar’s civil war. Since the military launched a coup in 2021, more than 5,000 civilians have been killed, more than 27,000 people have been arrested, and more than 3.3 million people have been displaced, according to the U.N. human rights office. At least seven journalists have been killed over their work since the coup, according to CPJ. Three of those killings took place this year, including two who were killed by security forces in a raid on their house and another who was killed in military custody. Tom Andrews, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, told VOA: 'The assault on the media, the assault on journalism, the assault on the principle of the freedom of the press, is all part of their stock-in-trade to hide their systematic assaults on the people of Myanmar.' Myanmar ranks 10th in the world in terms of impunity in journalist killings, according to CPJ. Myanmar’s military did not reply to VOA’s request for comment. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Russia’s war in Ukraine has also led to calls for accountability. While Russia does not appear on the 2024 Impunity Index — which looks at targeted killings only — at least 15 journalists and media workers have been killed covering the war, according to CPJ. 'Without accountability, we’re essentially giving a green light for further attacks on journalists not only in Ukraine but potentially in future conflicts worldwide,' National Union of Journalists of Ukraine President Sergiy Tomilenko told VOA in an email. 'Protecting journalists isn’t just about individual cases — it’s about defending democracy and the right to truth. Each unpunished attack on a journalist emboldens those who want to silence independent media,' Tomilenko said. Russia’s Washington embassy and Foreign Ministry did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. Among the cases of journalists killed is that of Viktoria Roshchyna, a Ukrainian journalist who died in Russian custody in September. The circumstances surrounding Roshchyna’s death remain unclear because the Russian government has refused to return her body to Ukraine. Without a body, it will be difficult to determine how she died, according to Karol Luczka, who monitors Eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna. 'This is a particularly appalling case of impunity,' he said. Based on UNESCO data, a journalist was killed every four days for doing their job in 2022 and 2023. UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay called on member states to do more to hold perpetrators of these crimes accountable. 'Prosecuting and convicting the perpetrators is a major lever to prevent future attacks on journalists,' she said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/war-makes-it-harder-to-hold-journalists-killers-accountable-experts-say/7848766.html	2024-11-02T05:42:04-07:00	
Spain braces for more flood deaths, steps up aid	VALENCIA, SPAIN — Rescuers resumed a grim search for bodies on Saturday as Spain scrambled to organize aid to stricken citizens following devastating floods that killed more than 200 people. Hopes of finding survivors more than three days after torrents of mud-filled water submerged towns and wrecked infrastructure were slim in the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades. Almost all deaths have been recorded in the eastern Valencia region, where thousands of soldiers, police officers and civil guards were frantically clearing debris and mud in the search for bodies. Officials have said that dozens of people remain unaccounted for, but establishing a precise figure is difficult with telephone and transport networks severely damaged. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska on Friday told Cadena Ser radio station that 207 people had died and that it was 'reasonable' to believe more fatalities would emerge. It is also hoped that the estimated number of missing people will fall once telephone and internet services are running again. Restoring order and distributing aid to destroyed towns and villages — some of which have been cut off from food, water and power for days — is a priority. Authorities have come under fire over the adequacy of warning systems before the floods, and some residents have also complained that the response to the disaster is too slow. Susana Camarero, deputy head of the Valencia region, told journalists on Saturday that essential supplies had been delivered 'from day one' to all accessible settlements. But it was 'logical' that affected residents were asking for more, she said. Authorities in Valencia have restricted access to roads for two days to allow emergency services to carry out search, rescue and logistics operations more effectively. 'Overwhelmed' by solidarity Thousands of people pushing shopping trolleys and carrying cleaning equipment took to the streets on Friday to help with the effort to clean up. Camarero said some municipalities were 'overwhelmed by the amount of solidarity and food' they had received. The surge of solidarity continued Saturday as around 1,000 people set off from the Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia toward nearby towns laid waste by the floods, an AFP journalist saw. Authorities have urged them to stay at home to avoid congestion on the roads that would hamper the work of emergency services. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez chaired a meeting of a crisis committee made up of top cabinet members on Saturday and is due to address the country later. The storm that sparked the floods on Tuesday formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for this time of year. But scientists warn that climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-braces-for-more-flood-deaths-steps-up-aid/7848734.html	2024-11-02T03:42:34-07:00	
Jury convicts ex-officer of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor	LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — A federal jury on Friday convicted a former Kentucky police detective of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor during a botched 2020 drug raid that left her dead. The 12-member jury returned the late-night verdict after clearing Brett Hankison earlier in the evening on a charge that he used excessive force on Taylor's neighbors. It was the first conviction of a Louisville police officer who was involved in the deadly raid. Some members of the jury were in tears as the verdict was read around 9:30 p.m. They had earlier indicated to the judge in two separate messages that they were deadlocked on the charge of using excessive force on Taylor but chose to continue deliberating. The six-man, six-woman jury deliberated for more than 20 hours over three days. Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, celebrated the verdict with friends outside the federal courthouse, saying: 'It took a lot of time. It took a lot of patience. It was hard. The jurors took their time to really understand that Breonna deserved justice.' Hankison fired 10 shots into Taylor's glass door and windows during the raid but didn't hit anyone. Some shots flew into a next-door neighbor's adjoining apartment. The death of the 26-year-old Black woman, along with the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, sparked racial injustice protests nationwide. Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., called the verdict 'a long-awaited moment of accountability.' 'While it cannot restore Breonna to her family, it represents a crucial step in the pursuit of justice and a reminder that no one should be above the law,' King said in a social media post Friday night. A separate jury deadlocked on federal charges against Hankison last year, and he was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment in 2022. The conviction against Hankison carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. He will be sentenced on March 12 by U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings. Hankison, 48, argued throughout the trial that he was acting to protect his fellow officers after Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired on them when they broke down Taylor's door with a battering ram. This jury sent a note on Thursday to the judge asking whether they needed to know if Taylor was alive as Hankison fired his shots. That was a point of contention during closing arguments, when Hankison attorney Don Malarcik told the jury that prosecutors must 'prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Taylor was alive' when Hankison fired. After the jury sent the question, Jennings urged them to keep deliberating. Walker shot and wounded one of the officers. Hankison testified that when Walker fired, he moved away, rounded the corner of the apartment unit and fired into Taylor's glass door and a window. Meanwhile, officers at the door returned Walker's fire, hitting and killing Taylor, who was in a hallway. Hankison's lawyers argued during closing statements Wednesday that Hankison was acting properly 'in a very tense, very chaotic environment' that lasted about 12 seconds. They emphasized that Hankison's shots didn't hit anyone. Hankison was one of four officers charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2022 with violating Taylor's civil rights. Hankison's verdict is the second conviction from those cases. The first was a plea deal from a former officer who was not at the raid and became a cooperating witness in another case. Malarcik, Hankison's attorney, spoke at length during closing arguments about the role of Taylor's boyfriend, who fired the shot that hit former Sergeant John Mattingly at the door. He said Walker never tried to come to the door or turn the lights on as police were knocking and instead armed himself and hid in the dark. 'Brett Hankison was 12 inches away from being shot by Kenneth Walker,' Malarcik said. Prosecutors said Hankison acted recklessly, firing 10 shots into doors and a window where he couldn't see a target. They said in closing arguments that Hankison 'violated one of the most fundamental rules of deadly force: If they cannot see the person they're shooting at, they cannot pull the trigger.' Neither of the officers who shot Taylor — Mattingly and former Detective Myles Cosgrove — were charged in Taylor's death. Federal and state prosecutors have said those officers were justified in returning fire, since Taylor's boyfriend shot at them first.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jury-convicts-ex-officer-of-using-excessive-force-on-breonna-taylor/7848729.html	2024-11-02T03:27:21-07:00	
Japan urges 200,000 people to evacuate due to heavy rain	Tokyo — Nearly 200,000 people in western Japan were urged to evacuate Saturday as authorities warned of landslides and floods, while the remnants of a tropical storm trickle over the country. The Japan Meteorological Agency said 'warm, moist air... was causing heavy rainfall with thunderstorms in western Japan' partly due to Kong-rey, which was downgraded to an extratropical low-pressure system from a typhoon. The city of Matsuyama 'issued the top-level warning, urging 189,552 residents in its 10 districts to evacuate and immediately secure safety,' a city official told AFP. While the evacuation was not mandatory, Japan's highest-level warning is typically issued when it is extremely likely that some kind of disaster has already occurred. Forecasters warned that landslides and floods could affect western Japan on Saturday and eastern Japan on Sunday. Due to rain, Shinkansen bullet trains were briefly suspended between Tokyo and southern Fukuoka region in the morning before resuming on a delayed schedule. Kong-rey smashed into Taiwan on Thursday as one of the biggest storms to hit the island in decades. It claimed at least three lives and injured 690 people, according to the National Fire Agency, which added a migrant worker death to the toll on Saturday. The storm knocked out power to 957,061 households, 27,781 of which were still in the dark as of Saturday. Scientists say human-driven climate change is intensifying the risk posed by heavy rains because a warmer atmosphere holds more water.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-urges-200-000-people-to-evacuate-due-to-heavy-rain/7848720.html	2024-11-02T02:47:28-07:00	
Russia targets Kyiv in hours-long drone attack	KYIV, Ukraine — Russia unleashed an overnight drone attack on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv that lasted into late morning and wounded at least one person, city officials said on Saturday. Debris from downed drones struck six city districts, wounding a police officer, damaging residential buildings and starting fires, according to city military administrator Serhiy Popko. Mayor Vitalii Klitschko had earlier reported that two people had been injured. 'Another night. Another air-raid alert. Another drone attack. The armed forces of the Russian Federation attacked Kyiv again according to their old and familiar tactics,' Popko wrote on social media. He said all the drones aimed at Kyiv had been shot down, but warned that others currently located in airspace outside the city could turn toward the capital. Reuters correspondents reported hearing explosions in and around the city during an air-raid alert that lasted more than five hours. Russia has carried out regular airstrikes on Ukrainian towns and cities behind the front lines of the war which began when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022. Kyiv's military said on Friday that Moscow's forces had launched more than 2,000 drones at civilian and military targets across Ukraine in October alone. Russia has denied aiming at civilians and said power facilities are legitimate targets when they are part of Ukrainian military infrastructure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-targets-kyiv-in-hours-long-drone-attack/7848717.html	2024-11-02T02:35:23-07:00	
Iran's supreme leader threatens Israel and US with 'a crushing response' over Israeli attack	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran's supreme leader on Saturday threatened Israel and the U.S. with 'a crushing response' over attacks on Iran and its allies. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke as Iranian officials are increasingly threatening to launch yet another strike against Israel after its October 26 on the Islamic Republic that targeted military bases and other locations and killed at least five people. Any further attacks from either side could engulf the wider Middle East, already teetering over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon, into a wider regional conflict just head of the U.S. presidential election this Tuesday. 'The enemies, whether the Zionist regime or the United States of America, will definitely receive a crushing response to what they are doing to Iran and the Iranian nation and to the resistance front,' Khamenei said in video released by Iranian state media. The supreme leader did not elaborate on the timing of the threatened attack, nor the scope. The U.S. military operates throughout the Middle East, with some troops now manning a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, battery in Israel. The 85-year-old Khamenei had struck a more cautious approach in earlier remarks, saying officials would weigh Iran's response and that Israel's attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed.' Khamenei on Saturday met with university students to mark Students Day, which commemorates a November 4, 1978, incident in which Iranian soldiers opened fire on students protesting the rule of the shah at Tehran University. The shooting killed and wounded several students and further escalated the tensions consuming Iran at the time that eventually led to the shah fleeing the country and the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The crowd offered a raucous welcome to Khamenei, chanting: 'The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader!' Some also made a hand gesture given by the slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2020 in a speech in which he threatened that American troops would 'return in coffins.' Iran will mark the 45th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis this Sunday, following the Persian calendar. The November 4, 1979, storming of the embassy by Islamist students led to the 444-day crisis, which cemented the decades-long enmity between Tehran and Washington that persists today.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-supreme-leader-threatens-israel-and-us-with-a-crushing-response-over-israeli-attack/7848714.html	2024-11-02T02:20:25-07:00	
Israel’s attack on Iran has left Tehran offensively and defensively weaker	Iran was quick to downplay the impact of Israel's attack on key military sites on its territory on October 26. But satellite images suggest Israel has degraded Tehran's air defense and missile-production capabilities, analysts say. Fabian Hinz of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies said Israel had dealt a 'significant blow' to Iran's ability to produce long-range ballistic missiles. Ability to sustain long-range attacks On October 1, Iran launched its biggest-ever direct attack on Israel, firing nearly 200 ballistic missiles at its archenemy. Dozens of the missiles, aimed mostly at military sites, penetrated Israel's formidable air defenses. Israel's retaliatory strikes on October 26 were aimed at hindering Iran's production of solid-propellant ballistic missiles that were used by Tehran in its assault, the 'weapons that are of most concern to Israel,' Hinz said. Solid-propellant missiles require fewer personnel and little time to prepare for launch compared to liquid-propellant missiles, Hinz explains, making them ideal for launching volleys in quick succession. Israel struck missile-production sites around Tehran, including the Parchin military complex, the Khojir military base, the Shahrud missile site, and a factory in the Shamsabad Industrial Zone. Jeremy Binnie, a Middle East defense specialist at the global intelligence company Janes, says the full extent of the damage caused to the facilities is still unclear. But he adds that Israel likely wanted to prevent Iran from being able to sustain long-range missile exchanges, especially given the numbers it needs to penetrate Israel's formidable air defenses. 'The Israelis probably don't know precisely how many ballistic missiles [Iran] has with the requisite range, but have tried to reduce its ability to replenish is stockpile,' Binnie said. Blinded offensively and defensively? Israel's attack was also aimed at weakening Iran's ability to fend off aerial attacks by targeting its radars and Russian-made S-300 air-defense systems. There have been unconfirmed reports quoting U.S. and Israeli officials claiming that three S-300 systems were taken out in the Israeli attack. 'The S-300s are Iran's most capable air-defense capabilities, so targeting them again emphasizes Iran's inability to defend itself and gives the Israeli Air Force more freedom of operation in the future,' Binnie said. Satellite images also showed that at least two radar systems -- one in the western Ilam Province and another in the southwestern Khuzestan Province -- were hit. The radars are an essential part of Iran's early warning system, Hinz told RFE/RL's Radio Farda. Taking them out, he said, would mean Israel had 'degraded Iran's ability to resist any air attack even further, making it more vulnerable.' Fox News quoted a U.S. defense official as saying that the radars also had an offensive purpose, and have been used by Iran to track ballistic missiles after launch to assess their trajectories and course-correct if necessary. Binnie said that 'would be unusual but might explain how [Iran] has achieved a fairly high level of accuracy with its ballistic missiles -- though not good enough to do really significant damage.' Impact on Iranian retaliation There are growing numbers of reports that Tehran is considering retaliating against Israel as the extent of the damage caused by the October 26 attack becomes clearer. Given that Iran has suffered damage to both its offensive and defensive capabilities, it is unclear if it can launch another large-scale attack on Israel, experts say. Binnie said the United States' deployment to Israel of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), an advanced anti-missile system, will further 'swing the balance in [Israel's] favor.' Media reports citing Israeli sources say that Iran is preparing to launch an aerial attack on Israel using Tehran-backed Shi'ite militant groups in Iraq. That would suggest the Islamic republic hopes its proxies will absorb the brunt of a potential Israeli response. Hannah Kaviani of RFE/RL's Radio Farda contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-attack-on-iran-has-left-tehran-offensively-and-defensively-weaker/7848701.html	2024-11-02T01:34:21-07:00	
New Zealand city waves goodbye to its 'disturbing' giant hand	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Perched on two fingers on the roof of an art gallery in Wellington, New Zealand, the giant sculpture of a hand has loomed over the city for five years. Named Quasi, the 16-foot — almost 5-meter — creation of Australia-based sculptor Ronnie van Hout bears an unsmiling human face — because why not? Some found it disturbing, and now, after five years of provoking controversy and myriad emotions — from horror and revulsion to delight — among residents of New Zealand's capital, Quasi was set to be removed from the roof of City Gallery this week. It will be taken to a new home, the gallery said Wednesday. 'This is either a great day for Wellington or a terrible day for Wellington and there's not much view in between,' said Ben McNulty, a Wellington city council member. McNulty told The Associated Press he felt 'devastated' by the sculpture's departure. Quasi is made of steel, polystyrene and resin, and was based on scans of van Hout's hand and face. It was named in part for Quasimodo, the bellringer in Victor Hugo's 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. Hence, the male gender some have attributed to Quasi. Quasi first graced — or haunted — an art gallery in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2016 but proved polarizing. It was the subject of an op-ed in the local newspaper listing reasons the sculpture 'must go,' including claims that one of its outstretched fingers 'appears to be inappropriately and belligerently pointing at pedestrians and office workers.' 'Perhaps the monster just wants to be loved?' van Hout responded at the time. In 2019, Quasi was installed in Wellington, where he grew over time on its residents. 'He arrived and I won't say the city unanimously hated him but I reckon 80% were like, 'What is this monster? What have we done?' ' McNulty said. 'But I think that over time there's been a bit of a softening, there's sort of a pro-Quasi group, which I consider myself part of,' he added. On Wednesday, many at Wellington's Civic Square, where the gallery with Quasi is located, said they had warmed to him, too. 'It's really disturbing but it's a staple of Wellington now,' said Anja Porthouse, who had brought friends and family to see Quasi and was 'gutted' it was leaving. Quasi is to be lifted from the roof by helicopter on Saturday, when the giant hand will travel to an undisclosed location in Australia, the gallery said. 'Everything comes to an end eventually,' van Hout told the AP. 'I am sure it will be missed, but even Lovecraftian nightmares have to return to where they came from, and now you only have an absence to reflect on.' Dozens responded to the news on social media with dismay, glee and jokes about the curse that local lore has attributed to Quasi being lifted. The sculpture has adorned the Wellington skyline during 'some of its most difficult times,' McNulty said. The city has struggled with earthquake-prone buildings, widespread plumbing problems and political division in recent years. Other comments took guesses about where Quasi might end up. 'He's going to The Hague,' wrote one New Zealander on X. 'He will be missed,' said Jane Black, who heads the Wellington Sculpture Trust. 'I'll personally be pleased to see it head somewhere else for a change,' the city's mayor, Tory Whanau, told the AP. 'I think there's a strong feeling of relief.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-city-waves-goodbye-to-its-disturbing-giant-hand/7845742.html	2024-11-02T01:09:21-07:00	
At 50, Hello Kitty is as 'kawaii' — and lucrative — as ever	tokyo — Hello Kitty turned 50 on Friday. Befitting a pop icon at midlife, the bubble-headed, bow-wearing character's fictional birthday has brought museum exhibits, a theme park spectacle and a national tour. And that's just in Japan, her literal birthplace but not the one listed in her official biography. Confused? Welcome to the party. If there's one thing about Hello Kitty, it's that she's proven adaptable and as much a study in contrasts during her long career. She — and Kitty is a she, according to the company that owns her — may have been conceived as a vessel for the feelings of others, but some women see an empowering symbol in her mouthless face. 'Shrewd' is how Mika Nishimura, a design professor at Tokyo's Meisei University, describes the way Hello Kitty conquered the worlds of commerce, fashion and entertainment. As a tabula rasa open to interpretation, the non-threatening creation was the perfect vehicle for making money, she said. 'American feminists have said she doesn't say anything and acquiesces to everyone. But in Japan, we also see how she may appear happy if you're happy, and sad if you're feeling sad,' Nishimura told The Associated Press. 'It's a product strategy that's sheer genius. By being so adaptable, Kitty gets all those collaborative deals.' The character's semicentennial is evidence of that. Sanrio, the Japanese entertainment company that holds the rights to Hello Kitty's name and image, kicked off the festivities a year ago with an animation account on TikTok, Roblox games and an avatar for the social networking app Zepeto. There have been anniversary editions of merchandise ranging from pet collars, cosmetics and McDonald's Happy Meals to Crocs and a Baccarat crystal figurine. A gold coin pendant with the image of Hello Kitty holding the number 50 is selling for about 120,000 yen ($800), while a Casio watch costs 18,700 yen ($120). But first, more on the origin story. Unlike Mickey Mouse and Snoopy, Hello Kitty didn't start as a cartoon. A young Sanrio illustrator named Yuko Shimizu drew her in 1974 as a decoration for stationery, tote bags, cups and other small accessories. The design made its debut on a coin purse the next year and became an instant hit in Japan. As Hello Kitty's commercial success expanded beyond Asia, so did her personal profile. By the late 1970s, Sanrio revealed the character's name as Kitty White, her height as five apples tall and her birthplace as suburban London, where the company said she lived with her parents and twin sister Mimmy. 'The main theme of Hello Kitty is friendship. When I first created it, I made a family of which Kitty was a part. But then Hello Kitty started to appear in other settings as the character grew,' Shimizu told the BBC in June. 'Sanrio put a lot of effort into building the brand into what it is today.' At some point, Sanrio designated Kitty's birthday as November 1, the same as Shimizu's. Her background was embellished with hobbies that included playing piano, reading and baking. Her TV appearances required co-stars, including a pet cat named Charmmy Kitty that made its debut 20 years ago. But Hello Kitty's 40th birthday brought an update that astonished fans. Sanrio clarified to a Los Angeles museum curator that Kitty, despite her feline features, was a little girl. A company spokesperson repeated the distinction this year, renewing debate online about the requirements for being considered human. 'She is supposed to be Kitty White and English. But this is part of the enigma: Who is Hello Kitty? We can't figure it out. We don't even know if she is a cat,' art historian Joyce S. Cheng, a University of Oregon associate professor, said. 'There is an unresolved indeterminacy about her that is so amazing.' Part of the confusion stems from a misunderstanding of 'kawaii,' which is Japanese for 'cute' but also connotes a lovable or adorable essence. Sanrio recruited Shimizu and other illustrators to create 'kawaii' characters at a time when cute, girlish styles were popular in Japan. But the word is used often in Japanese society, and not only to describe babies and puppies. An elderly man, something as innocuous as an umbrella, a subcompact car or a kitchen utensil, or even a horror movie monster can get labeled 'kawaii.' By Western standards, the idea may seem embarrassingly frivolous. But it's taken seriously in Japan, where the concept is linked with the most honorable instincts. The complexity of 'kawaii' may help explain Hello Kitty's enduring appeal across generations and cultures, why Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne released a song titled 'Hello Kitty' a decade ago, and why Britain's King Charles wished Hello Kitty a happy 50th birthday when he hosted Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako at Buckingham Palace in June. Although Hello Kitty may seem to embody the self-sacrificing woman stereotype, it's revealing that three women have served as the character's chief designers at Sanrio. Yuko Yamaguchi, who has held the role since 1980, is credited with keeping the character both modern and timeless, giving Kitty black outfits or false eyelashes as trends dictated but never removing the bow from her left ear. 'Hello Kitty, this cultural object, has something to tell us about the history of women in East Asia, and how East Asian women modernized themselves and became professional citizens in a modern society,' the University of Oregon's Cheng said. Sanrio has come up with hundreds of creatures, all adorable and cuddly, but none with the lasting power of Hello Kitty. Forget the understated wabi-sabi aesthetic historically associated with Japan. A chameleon-like cat-girl who reflects unabashed kitsch is the cultural ambassador of a consumer-crazed, happy-go-lucky nation. 'It's the anti-wabi sabi, wanting to be as flashy and as bling-bling as possible, like Lady Gaga. In your face, but that's actually part of the genius, too. It's powerful,' Cheng said. Leslie Bow, a professor of English and Asian American Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that while many Asian and Asian American women see Hello Kitty as a symbol of defiance, the protective, caretaking instinct aroused by 'kawaii' isn't without power. 'We take care of our siblings, our babies, our pets, because we are in control. We control their actions. And so that is also the dark side of cute,' Bow said. Sanrio has taken advantage of the character's adaptability by allowing relatively unrestricted use of her image in return for a licensing fee. Just about anything goes for the wee whiskered one, from a growing global empire of Sanrio-sanctioned Hello Kitty cafes to an 'augmented reality' cellphone app that shows Kitty dancing in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, London's Big Ben and other tourist landmarks. On the unsanctioned side, Hello Kitty even has shown up on guns and vibrators. During a presentation earlier this year in Seoul, Hello Kitty designer Yamaguchi said one of her unfulfilled goals was finding a way 'to develop a Hello Kitty for men to fall in love with as well.' But she's still working on it. 'I am certain the day will come when men are no longer embarrassed to carry around Hello Kitty,' entertainment news site Content Asia quoted Yamaguchi as saying.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-50-hello-kitty-is-as-kawaii-and-lucrative-as-ever-/7847239.html	2024-11-02T01:08:35-07:00	
On Pakistan's southern coast, surfers chase waves and their dreams	KARACHI, Pakistan — Attiq Ur Rehman is determined to follow his dream to become Pakistan's first professional surfer despite his father's concern for his future, a lack of equipment and the messy waves near Karachi. 'I don’t care about the money right now. I just want to compete,' the 21-year-old says, shrugging off his father's plea to take up fishing so he can get married and support his family. 'It's my surfer attitude.' Rehman's family are part of a poor coastal community in southern Pakistan that usually make a living from fishing or as lifeguards watching over more affluent residents of Karachi when they come for a day at the beach. His father makes the equivalent of $100 a month to feed a family of 10 through fishing. 'I told him a thousand times (to stop surfing) but he still doesn't listen,' said Rehman's father, Muhammad Rafiq. Rehman was a lifeguard but gave it up to concentrate on his surfing, which he started at age 9, and founded a new community that calls itself 'Surfers of Bulleji.' The group has grown to around 50 and has gone viral on social media in a country where cricket and hockey are the main sports. The group consists of surfing enthusiasts from surrounding coastal villages, some as young as 8. On a sunny day, their passion for surfing is on display with the right window for waves to surf along a near-empty beach close to the metropolis of 20 million. One of cohort, Mujahid Baloch, a 24-year-old fisherman, first saw surfing on social media and instantly took a shine to it. 'Slowly, through watching, we learned. No one taught us,' he said. Though Sri Lanka and the Maldives to the south are on global surfers' hit lists, Pakistan's arid 1,000 kilometers of coastline is usually poorly suited for surfing, relying on local winds to generate waves that are often small and messy, or rare cyclone swells. 'When all of Karachi was being given an advisory to stay away from the sea, and a cyclone was approaching, me and the boys were getting ready to go to the beach,' said Rehman. 'The waves were ideal for us.' While an occasional visiting surfer might join them for a paddle and some other villages along the coast have small surfing groups, competition with global peers is a challenge. The International Surfing Association has 116 member countries, including places such as Ukraine and land-locked Switzerland, but Pakistan is not on the list. Still, members of Surfers of Bulleji idolize American professional surfer Kelly Slater, whose videos they often watch awestruck, and wish to emulate his skill. But access to surfing equipment is limited in Pakistan, with the group sharing about 25 surfboards and pitching in for repairs when they are needed. They sometimes find discarded boards in large containers of junk brought to Pakistan from around the world. They buy these junked boards for as little as $35 and repair them using basic materials like glue and resin. 'If it breaks, we repair it. Because we don't have surfboards here,' Baloch said. Pointing to a piece of foam, he said it was found at sea and shaped into a makeshift board. 'If we find more such foam, we can make our own boards here,' he said. 'Our community is getting bigger and stronger, so the shopkeepers know we will come and keep such finds safe for us,' Rehman said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-pakistan-s-southern-coast-surfers-chase-waves-and-their-dreams/7847300.html	2024-11-02T01:06:57-07:00	
Canada-India tensions could escalate cyber threats, hinder immigration	OTTAWA — Canada's deepening dispute with India over its alleged campaign of violence against Sikhs in Canada could intensify Indian-based cyber espionage and hold back immigration, but analysts and experts see no immediate impact on trade. Concern about a widening rift between the two countries comes after a senior Canadian official told a parliamentary national security committee on Tuesday that Indian Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah, a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the mastermind behind the alleged plots. While Indian officials dismissed the official's statement, the disclosure might worsen a dispute that started a year ago when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited credible evidence linking Indian agents to the June 2023 shooting of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia. In response, Canada expelled six Indian diplomats earlier this month, accusing them of involvement. Four men have been charged with his murder. The Canadian signals intelligence agency that monitors foreign-based cyber threats said New Delhi was most likely already conducting threatening cyber activity against Canadian networks for spying purposes. 'As Canada and India potentially may have some tensions, it is possible that we may see India want to flex those cyber threat actions against Canadians,' Caroline Xavier, head of the agency, known as Communications Security Establishment Canada, told a Wednesday news conference. The agency has previously described India as an emerging threat. On the diplomatic front, Ottawa is unlikely to take more punitive steps until more details of the Nijjar case emerge, said Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada think tank. Cabinet ministers are due to testify about the matter to the national security committee and the murder trial of the four men has yet to start, she noted. 'If there are charges laid in the process on individuals that are living in India at whatever level, then it would trigger an extradition process which could take years. And of course, India is unlikely to cooperate,' she said. Officials working for Trudeau and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly did not respond to requests for comment about what steps Ottawa might take next. India is the top source for temporary foreign workers and international students coming to Canada, but a backlog of applications has built since Trudeau's allegations last year. Canada only has four immigration officials left in India, down from 27 in October 2023. This affects Canada's ability to process visas on-site, Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. 'I have told my colleagues in Parliament that this could get worse before it gets better, and they need to brace for it,' he said in an interview last Friday. That could mean fewer people traveling between the countries for legitimate reasons, he said. Trade relations India is Canada's 10th largest trading partner and New Delhi has made clear it does not want flows to be hit. Nadjibulla's foundation carried out a study showing Trudeau's statement in October 2023 had little or no effect on bilateral trade. 'Whether that would be the case now I think it's a bigger question mark, because the disruption is on a bigger scale, and we are still not, I don't believe, at the bottom of this,' she said by phone. Canada is the biggest exporter of pulses, such as lentils, to India. Pulse Canada President Greg Cherewyk, asked about the potential impact of the diplomatic dispute, cited the strength of the relationship. 'In a time of stubborn food price inflation and strong demand for pulse crops, we are confident that affordability and availability will continue to drive decision-making at a government level,' he said in a statement. 'We have thankfully not seen the political tensions affect trade,' said Michael Harvey, executive director of the Canadian Agri-Food Trade Alliance. 'India and Canada have great potential in their trading relationship and CAFTA hopes we can work back to positive trade discussions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-india-tensions-could-escalate-cyber-threats-hinder-immigration/7847233.html	2024-11-02T01:06:13-07:00	
Vinyl thrives at United Record Pressing, oldest record maker in US	NASHVILLE, Tenn. — During the six decades since United Record Pressing stamped out the Beatles' first U.S. single, the country's oldest vinyl record maker has survived 8-tracks, cassettes, CDs, Napster, iPods and streaming services. Now, the Nashville-based company has rebounded so dramatically that some of its equipment and technology has been retrofitted to keep pace with an ever-growing demand for old-school vinyl. The 75-year-old company has adjusted its business from filling jukeboxes to helping DJs spin and stocking shelves despite a pandemic. On shelves in its warehouse are master versions by Johnny Cash, Kanye West and The Black Crowes. When Mark Michaels bought the company in 2007, vinyl was fading — its 38 employees mostly made singles for rap artists, often promos for clubs. Michaels wanted a hands-on chance to build a business and thought he could keep this one steady, but not grow it substantially. It also came with a rich history as the first record pressing plant in the South, including an apartment atop the factory that housed Black artists and music executives during segregation. 'You walked into this building and you just felt 50, 60 years of history and just the importance of what it stood for,' said Michaels, the company's CEO and chair. 'And yeah, you you get choked up, you get gooseflesh just experiencing that.' Today, United Record Pressing runs a newer factory six times bigger than what Michaels bought, with about 125 employees who make up to 80,000 records a day. A variety of factors have boosted vinyl in recent years, from independent artists insisting on vinyl albums to big box retailers getting on board again. In 2023, U.S. revenues from vinyl records grew 10% to $1.4 billion, the 17th-straight year of growth, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Records accounted for 71% of revenues from non-digital music formats, and for the second time since 1987, vinyl outpaced CDs in total sold. United Record Pressing underwent its own evolution. The initial pressing plant was formed in 1949 by Nashville label Bullet Records. In the 1950s, it changed to Southern Plastics Inc. and focused on 7-inch singles preferred by jukebox makers. In the early 1960s, the company was pressing more than 1 million records per month. It signed a deal to produce singles for Motown Records and moved to a bigger facility that included the apartment that hosted The Supremes, Smokey Robinson and others — and which became known as the 'Motown Suite.' In 1963, it pressed the Beatles' first U.S. single, 'Please Please Me.' Then in the 1970s, a restructuring turned the company into United Record Pressing. During the 1980s, records dwindled to a niche market. DJs still needed records for their turntables. Rap and hip-hop artists used them for 'scratching.' But CDs had overtaken them. By the late 2000s, indie artists were insisting on releasing vinyl records. By 2015, records were broadly embraced again, but there were few manufacturers, and they were relying on presses from the 1960s and 1970s and a limited number of specialists who could operate them, Michaels said. Demand increased again during the coronavirus pandemic. 'It's art,' Michaels said of vinyl records. 'Artists and fans, they want something tactile to hold on to and engage with. It's easy to stream music, and streaming music is a wonderful way to discover new music. But you know, at the end of the day, it's kind of sonic wallpaper.' Today, the factory mixes old and new. There's plenty of wood paneling on the throwback audio equipment used to test master versions of records before they are used to press copies. And the factory floor has its share of retrofitted pressing equipment that looks and sounds like it's been around since the last time vinyl ruled the market. Technology is improving the process, too. Beyond the older presses are sleek, newly made machines that plop out records more quietly and efficiently. And there are huge sacks of colorful pebbles from discarded material that can be pressed again into new records. The machines that stamp master copies use technology that had been in place to produce CDs and DVDs, now retooled for vinyl. In a room farther back in the factory, the whizzing of machinery gives way to music. That's where Tyler Bryant might listen to 10 records in a shift as the company's quality control lead. Talking over the rhythms of harmonica from a Cash album, Bryant said he discovers many artists and records that wouldn't be on his list, ranging from Harry Styles to Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter' to indie artists. 'A lot of variety, that's what I appreciate,' Bryant said. 'I don't like being stuck to just one genre, you know?' A few miles away, architects and a construction crew are at work to preserve the old 1962 plant and pave the way for its future. As for what that will look like, Michaels says stay tuned. 'My vision is not completely crystallized yet, but the mandate is, it's some of the most important space in all of music,' Michaels said. 'It needs to be celebrated. It needs to be something that people can engage with.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vinyl-thrives-at-united-record-pressing-oldest-record-maker-in-us/7845767.html	2024-11-02T01:04:54-07:00	
Missile strike in central Israel injures 19	Israeli police say at least 19 people have been injured by a missile strike in the city of Tira, some 25 kilometers northeast of Tel Aviv, after the military reported three projectiles were fired from Lebanon into central Israel early Saturday. The Israeli Foreign Ministry posted videos on social media showing fire and smoke spilling from a building and emergency responders at the site. 'This is the result of a direct hit of a Hezbollah rocket on a building in the Israeli Arab town of Tira, injuring 19 civilians,' the ministry said in the post, adding Israel will not rest until Hezbollah is dismantled. The Israeli army said on the social media platform Telegram that it had intercepted some of the projectiles. Israel airstrikes pounded Lebanon's Bekaa Valley early Friday, killing at least 52 people, wounding 72 others and sending families fleeing from their homes. Video from the scene showed some buildings in rubble as smoke rose above the skyline. Israeli warplanes also destroyed dozens of buildings Friday in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, but there were no reports of causalities. Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, reported that seven people were killed in northern Israel by cross-border rocket attacks from Hezbollah. In statement posted to its X social media account, the IDF said during the night Thursday into Friday, its fighter jets 'attacked with precise intelligence' sites for weapons production, as well as what it said were Hezbollah central headquarters and other 'military infrastructures' in the Beirut area. The IDF said its fighter jets also attacked overnight what it described as Hezbollah's 'southern front' headquarters throughout Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon. They said advance warnings were given to the population in the area to mitigate the risk to civilians. Lebanon's state National News Agency, or NNA, reported Lebanon's acting prime minister, Najib Mikati, said Friday the overnight strikes and the 'expansion of Israeli aggression' in Lebanon show that Israel 'rejects all efforts' to reach a cease-fire. Earlier this week he had expressed hope for the possibility of such an agreement. In Gaza, doctors and local sources reported more than 30 people killed in Israeli strikes on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza overnight Thursday into Friday. Officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah told The Washington Post that 26 bodies arrived at the hospital, including 21 from Nuseirat refugee camp. The leaders of 15 U.N. agencies and humanitarian organizations said Friday, 'the situation unfolding in northern Gaza is apocalyptic.' The officials, which included the heads of the World Health Organization, World Food Program and children's agency UNICEF said, 'The entire region is on the edge of a precipice' and said Palestinians have been denied basic humanitarian aid and lifesaving supplies. The IDF said in a statement its troops had identified and eliminated 'several armed terrorists' in central Gaza and had eliminated 'dozens of terrorists' in targeted raids in northern Gaza's Jabalia area. They also told the AP they had hit a Hamas infrastructure site and had targeted a militant who was operating in the Nuseirat area. The violence comes as U.S. diplomats, including U.S. CIA Director William Burns, left the region this week after a series of meetings to push for a cease-fire. A senior Hamas leader, Taher al-Nunu, told news outlets Friday that the militant group has rejected the latest short term cease-fire proposal presented by mediators from Egypt and Qatar because it did not include a lasting cease-fire. At a news conference Friday in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he remains optimistic regarding peace and cease-fire efforts on both fronts. Regarding Lebanon, Blinken said once again, the basis of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis would be the effective implementation of the 2006 U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for Hezbollah to withdraw its armed presence from an area south of the Litani River and for Israeli forces to get out of Lebanon. Blinken made the comments at a joint briefing with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The two held talks Friday with their South Korean counterparts in Washington. Blinken was asked about a letter he and Austin sent to Israel, calling on Tel Aviv to take steps to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza or face possible restrictions on U.S. military aid. The secretary of state said their teams are tracking 'very carefully' Israel's response and efforts regarding humanitarian assistance to Gaza. Blinken said there has been 'progress' but added it has been insufficient. 'We're working on a daily basis to make sure that Israel does what it must do to ensure that this assistance gets to people who need it inside of Gaza,' Blinken said. 'It's not enough to get trucks to Gaza; it's vital that what they bring with them can get distributed effectively inside of Gaza.' Blinken also mentioned the World Health Organization's successful initial polio vaccination campaign for hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children in Gaza. He said for that campaign to be concluded, there must be a second round of vaccinations completed quickly, and he called on Israel to facilitate that effort. The WHO said Friday the next phase of the polio vaccination campaign will begin Saturday after being postponed from October 23 due to a lack of access and a lack of humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza. The war in Lebanon erupted late last month, nearly a year after Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border fire into Israel in support of Hamas. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. The conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 43,259 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, where the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/missile-strike-in-central-israel-injures-19/7848694.html	2024-11-02T00:59:18-07:00	
Argentina's public universities are paralyzed by protests; here’s why	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — After 11 months in office, Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei has fulfilled his flagship pledge to eliminate the country's monumental deficits by shrinking the public payroll, slashing subsidies and suppressing already low wages of state workers. The austerity has spawned misery. But with the country's left-wing opposition in disarray after delivering the economic disaster that Milei inherited, Argentina hasn't seen the kind of widespread social unrest that has characterized past economic crises. That could change. The country's teachers are fed up. Milei's recent veto of a bill boosting spending on university budgets struck a collective nerve in a nation that long has considered free education a critical engine of social progress, drawing the broadest demonstrations since the libertarian leader took office. Last week's open-air classes held in Plaza de Mayo, the main square home to government headquarters, marked the latest in a new wave of protests supporting public universities that has gripped Argentina over the past month. Students are taking over college campuses in the coming days ahead of another mass protest. Here's a look at what students are protesting and what it means for Milei's effort to transform crisis-prone Argentina into an economic success story. What do protesters want? Professors and non-teaching staff at public universities across Argentina are demanding a pay raise to compensate for sky-high inflation that they say has shrunk their purchasing power by 60% this year. After a student-led march mobilized a half-million protesters in April, Milei's government compensated universities for operational costs but not for teachers' salaries. The average salary of an associate professor is now $320 per month. For teaching assistants, it's just $120 a month. The university funding bill that Milei vetoed would have increased staff salaries to make up for 2024 annual inflation — which now tops 200% — and adjusted them for inflation going forward. Even if Milei's drastic measures have recently dragged month-on-month inflation below 5%, the number of Argentines in poverty has swelled to more than 50%. The public university system hasn't seen this kind of budget shortfall since 2004, according to the Civil Association for Equality and Justice, an Argentine nonprofit. 'Our living conditions have visibly worsened,' said Nicolas Jose Lavagnino, a researcher in the philosophy of biology at Conicet, Argentina's leading research body that reported losing 250 scientists this year due to budget cuts. Unions reject the government's 6.8% pay raise offer as inadequate. The University of Buenos Aires — one of Latin America's biggest and most prestigious — has warned of mass resignations over depreciating salaries. At least 30 teachers have quit at UBA's Faculty of Agriculture alone. Milei has vowed to block any measure that jeopardizes the budget balance. In September, he vetoed a bill raising pensions — which would have cost his government over 1% of Argentina's gross domestic product — for the same reason. But the education bill would have cost only 0.14% of GDP, stirring doubts over the economic significance of Milei's battle. 'We see this as a direct attack on the philosophy of public education in our country,' said Matias Busi, a 25-year-old student at Argentina's University of La Plata. What does Milei say? The irascible president has lambasted universities as leftist indoctrination camps. 'What productivity do scientists have?' he said in 2023 on the campaign trail, advocating for the defunding of research institute Conicet. While promising not to get rid of free public education, Milei demands that universities undergo a government audit and do more to clean up corruption. 'If they don't want to be audited, it must be because they are dirty,' he said. Milei's party in recent weeks has also revived an unpopular attempt to charge tuition for foreign non-residents, who make up nearly 4% of total enrollment. The public education system in Argentina is rare in that there are no bars to entry — foreigners who can't afford a bachelor's degree in their own countries can enroll free of charge at first-rate public universities like UBA, where all five of the country's Nobel Prize winners studied. Half of Milei's Cabinet even graduated from public universities. Some say Milei is justified in requesting more financial transparency, pointing to the alleged misuse of funds and creeping politicization of what was once a universally respected institution. 'There were contracts with public sector figures where absurd things were funded,' said Argentine political consultant Sergio Berensztein, referring to scandals that erupted during the tenure of former leftist President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner over big-budget research projects that audits later revealed had never existed. 'They were simply mechanisms to divert funds for political interests.' What is the political context? After Milei's government mustered just enough votes to prevent the opposition from overriding his veto of the university funding bill on October 10, over 250,000 Argentines — spanning the far-left to center-right — flooded the streets. The student-led movement drew a range of Argentine protesters stung by austerity that has deepened the recession and pushed poverty to its highest level in 20 years — retirees desperate for better pensions, doctors furious over meager pay, artists against closure of the national film institute, scientists angry over gutted funds, pilots worried about Milei's plans to privatize Argentina's flagship airline. Santiago Gándara, a social sciences professor at both UBA and the University of La Pampa, said he believed Milei miscalculated in going after Argentina's proud symbol of publicly financed education for the masses. 'It is like someone coming and saying, 'We are going to get rid of the Plaza de Mayo,'' he said, referring to the historic Buenos Aires square that filled with protesters last week. 'Milei understood this too late. … You can't decide the fate of Plaza de Mayo. It belongs to all of us.' The question of whether the demonstrations morph into a real threat for Milei remains open. 'I think these protests are not at the point of being life-threatening to Milei, but it's obviously damaging,' said Ana Iparraguirre, an Argentine analyst and partner at Washington-based strategy firm GBAO. 'When students mobilize, you really never know where that movement is going to end.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-s-public-universities-are-paralyzed-by-protests-here-s-why/7847199.html	2024-11-02T00:28:05-07:00	
South Carolina to build first monument to an African American	BEAUFORT, SOUTH CAROLINA — South Carolina is preparing to put up its first individual statue for an African American on its Statehouse lawn, honoring a man who put on Confederate clothes in order to steal a slaveholder's ship and sail his family and a dozen others to freedom during the Civil War. But Robert Smalls isn't just being honored for his audacious escape. He spent a decade in the U.S. House of Representatives, helped rewrite South Carolina's constitution to allow Black men equality after the Civil War and then put up a valiant but doomed fight when racists returned to power and eliminated nearly all of the gains Smalls fought for. U.S. Representative Jermaine Johnson can't wait to bring his children to the Statehouse to finally see someone who is Black like them being honored. 'The man has done so many great things, it's just a travesty he has not been honored until now. Heck, it's also a travesty there isn’t some big Hollywood movie out there about his life,' said Johnson, a Democrat from a district just a few miles from the Statehouse. The idea for a statue to Smalls has been percolating for years. But there was always quiet opposition preventing a bill from getting a hearing. That changed in 2024 as the proposal made it unanimously through the state House and Senate on the back of Republican Representative Brandon Cox of Goose Creek. 'South Carolina is a great state. We’ve got a lot of history, good and bad. This is our good history,' Cox said. What will the Robert Smalls memorial look like? The bill created a special committee that has until January 15 to come up with a design, a location on the Statehouse lawn and the money to pay for whatever memorial they choose. But supporters face a challenging question: What best honors Smalls? If it's just one statue, is it best to honor the steel-nerved ship pilot who waited for all the white crew to leave, then mimicked hand signals and whistle toots to get through Confederate checkpoints, while hoping Confederate soldiers didn't notice a Black man under the hat in the pale moonlight in May 1862? Or would a more fitting tribute to Smalls be to recognize the statesman who served in the South Carolina House and Senate and the U.S. House after the Civil War? Smalls bought his master's house in Beaufort in part with money made for turning the Confederate ship over to Union forces, then allowed the man's penniless wife to live there when she was widowed. Or is the elder Smalls who fought for education for all and to keep the gains African Americans made during the Civil War the man most worth publicly memorializing? Smalls would see a new constitution in 1895 wipe out African Americans' right to vote. He was fired from his federal customs collector job in 1913 when then President Woodrow Wilson purged many Black men out of government jobs. Or would it be best to combine them all in some way? That's how Republican Representative Chip Campsen, an occasional ship pilot himself, sees honoring one of his favorite South Carolinians. 'The best way to sum up Robert Smalls' life is it was a fight for freedom as a slave, as a pilot and as a statesman,' Campsen said. Location, location, location Then there is the matter of location. While South Carolina has a monument with multiple panels honoring the struggle of African Americans from their journey on slave ships through today, it doesn't honor an individual Black man or woman among the two dozen monuments scattered around the Statehouse. At least six different monuments honor people such as Dr. J. Marion Sims, who some consider the father of modern gynecology but who underpinned his research operating without anesthesia on enslaved women and girls. There are several honoring Confederates who fought to protect slavery in the state that started the Civil War and hangs a marble copy of the Articles of Secession in the lobby between its House and Senate chambers. The dubious list includes 'Pitchfork' Ben Tillman, a governor and U.S. senator who bragged about how he led groups of whites who killed Black men trying to vote during the election of 1876 which led to the end of Reconstruction, the return of all-white rule and the collapse of everything for which Smalls had worked. None of that is on the plaque for Tillman's statue. Some supporters have suggested Smalls' statue could stand nearby and be taller and more prominent than Tillman's to give Smalls a triumph some 130 years in the making. Once design and location are determined, organizers hope raising the money gets easier with a concept in mind. 'We have to get the narrative right,' Republican Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said. 'This is going to tell a story. I think it is important that we tell that the right way to honor him and to honor South Carolina. I think it’s really cool.' Robert Smalls' monumental life Robert Smalls was born in 1839 in Beaufort and died in 1915 in his hometown a free, but somewhat forgotten man who lived a life unimaginable to a woman holding her son born into slavery. Supporters now have a chance to make sure he never fades into obscurity. 'Robert Smalls writes a new future for this county that in the moment no one can see is happening,' said Chris Barr, the Chief of Interpretation for the Reconstruction Era National Historic Park in Beaufort as he stood beside a bust of Smalls near his grave in his hometown. Driving a Confederate boat to freedom is what captures the most attention in that remarkable life, Barr said. 'If you’re an enslaved person working on one of these boats around the Charleston Harbor like Robert Smalls, you’ve got the tools, you’ve got the talent, you’ve got the boat and you know how to drive it,' Barr said 'And you can literally see freedom floating in the form of the United States Navy just a few miles offshore.

World's largest captive crocodile dies in Australia	sydney — A 5.48-meter Australian crocodile that held the world record as the largest crocodile in captivity has died, a wildlife sanctuary said on Saturday. He was thought to be more than 110 years old. Cassius, weighing in at more than one ton, had been in declining health since October 15, Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat said on Facebook. 'He was very old and believed to be living beyond the years of a wild croc,' according to a post by the organization, based on Green Island near the Queensland tourist town of Cairns. 'Cassius will be deeply missed, but our love and memories of him will remain in our hearts forever.' The group's website said he had lived at the sanctuary since 1987 after being transported from the neighboring Northern Territory, where crocodiles are a key part of the region's tourist industry. Cassius, a saltwater crocodile, held the Guinness World Records title as the world's largest crocodile in captivity. He took the title after the 2013 death of Philippines crocodile Lolong, who measured 6.17 meters long, according to Guinness.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-largest-captive-crocodile-dies-in-australia/7848686.html	2024-11-02T00:17:02-07:00	
Lebanon searches for survivors after Israeli airstrikes kill 52	Rescuers in northeastern Lebanon searched for survivors Friday after Israeli airstrikes killed at least 52 people, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. Israel airstrikes pounded Lebanon's Bekaa Valley early Friday, sending families fleeing from their homes. Video from the scene showed some buildings in rubble as smoke rose above the skyline. Lebanon's Health Ministry said 72 people were injured in the bombardment. Israeli warplanes also destroyed dozens of buildings Friday in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, but there were no reports of causalities. The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, reported that seven people were killed in northern Israel by cross-border rocket attacks from Hezbollah. In statement posted to its X social media account, the IDF said during the night Thursday into Friday, its fighter jets 'attacked with precise intelligence' sites for weapons production, as well as what it said were Hezbollah central headquarters and other 'military infrastructures' in the Beirut area. The IDF said its fighter jets also attacked overnight what it described as Hezbollah's 'southern front' headquarters throughout Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon. They said advance warnings were given to the population in the area to mitigate the risk to civilians. Lebanon's state National News Agency, or NNA, reported Lebanon's acting prime minister, Najib Mikati, said Friday the overnight strikes and the 'expansion of Israeli aggression' in Lebanon show that Israel 'rejects all efforts' to reach a cease-fire. Earlier this week he had expressed hope for the possibility of such an agreement. In Gaza, doctors and local sources reported more than 30 people killed in Israeli strikes on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza overnight Thursday into Friday. Officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah told The Washington Post that 26 bodies arrived at the hospital, including 21 from Nuseirat refugee camp. The leaders of 15 U.N. agencies and humanitarian organizations said Friday, 'the situation unfolding in northern Gaza is apocalyptic.' The officials, which included the heads of the World Health Organization, World Food Program and children's agency UNICEF said, 'The entire region is on the edge of a precipice' and said Palestinians have been denied basic humanitarian aid and lifesaving supplies. The IDF said in a statement its troops had identified and eliminated 'several armed terrorists' in central Gaza and had eliminated 'dozens of terrorists' in targeted raids in northern Gaza's Jabalia area. They also told the AP they had hit a Hamas infrastructure site and had targeted a militant who was operating in the Nuseirat area. The violence comes as U.S. diplomats, including U.S. CIA Director William Burns, left the region this week after a series of meetings to push for a cease-fire. A senior Hamas leader, Taher al-Nunu, told news outlets Friday that the militant group has rejected the latest short term cease-fire proposal presented by mediators from Egypt and Qatar because it did not include a lasting cease-fire. At a news conference Friday in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he remains optimistic regarding peace and cease-fire efforts on both fronts. Regarding Lebanon, Blinken said once again, the basis of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis would be the effective implementation of the 2006 U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for Hezbollah to withdraw its armed presence from an area south of the Litani River and for Israeli forces to get out of Lebanon. Blinken made the comments at a joint briefing with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The two held talks Friday with their South Korean counterparts in Washington. Blinken was asked about a letter he and Austin sent to Israel, calling on Tel Aviv to take steps to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza or face possible restrictions on U.S. military aid. The secretary of state said their teams are tracking 'very carefully' Israel's response and efforts regarding humanitarian assistance to Gaza. Blinken said there has been 'progress' but added it has been insufficient. 'We're working on a daily basis to make sure that Israel does what it must do to ensure that this assistance gets to people who need it inside of Gaza,' Blinken said. 'It's not enough to get trucks to Gaza; it's vital that what they bring with them can get distributed effectively inside of Gaza.' Blinken also mentioned the World Health Organization's successful initial polio vaccination campaign for hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children in Gaza. He said for that campaign to be concluded, there must be a second round of vaccinations completed quickly, and he called on Israel to facilitate that effort. The WHO said Friday the next phase of the polio vaccination campaign will begin Saturday after being postponed from October 23 due to a lack of access and a lack of humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza. The war in Lebanon erupted late last month, nearly a year after Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border fire into Israel in support of Hamas. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. The conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 43,259 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, where the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people.

Russian political prisoner dies in Belarus penal colony, rights group says	A 22-year-old Russian man considered a political prisoner by activists has died in a penal colony in Belarus, human rights group Viasna said Friday. The rights group said it confirmed the death of Dmitry Shletgauer, who was recently transferred to a penal colony in Mogilev in eastern Belarus. Viasna said Shletgauer had been at the penal colony for a short time before his death. 'Provisionally, this happened on October 11,' the rights group said. 'He spent less than a month in the penal colony. The exact cause of death is unknown.' Shletgauer received a 12-year sentence after being convicted of espionage and facilitating extremist activities. He was arrested in the crackdown in Belarus that occurred after the disputed 2020 presidential election of Alexander Lukashenko that gave the strongman a sixth term. In September, Shletgauer joined Viasna's list of recognized political prisoners in Belarus. Belarus, a close ally of Russia, is reported to have approximately 1,300 political prisoners, according to Viasna. Radio Free Europe reports Shletgauer was born in Slavgorod, Russia, and acquired residency in Belarus in 2018. Some information for this story came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-political-prisoner-dies-in-belarus-penal-colony-rights-group-says/7848588.html	2024-11-01T17:55:23-07:00	
Niger disputes French firm's uranium move	Niamey, Niger — Niger's military junta is disputing a decision by French nuclear fuel firm Orano to halt uranium production, according to a document from a state partner in the venture seen Friday by Agence France-Presse. Orano announced last month that it was stopping production as of Thursday, owing to what it termed increasingly difficult operating conditions in the country and financial issues. Nigerien state company Sopamin is a shareholder with Orano, which holds a majority stake in Somair, the last site that the French group was still operating in the country prior to Thursday. The French lamented the withdrawal by the junta in June of a permit for one of the largest uranium deposits in the world, Imouraren, and the impossibility of exporting the raw material with Niger's border with Benin closed for what Niamey says are security reasons. 'Despite its status as a co-shareholder, Sopamin was not consulted on this serious decision' to halt production, the company, which has operated for half a century in the country's north, said in a document dated Thursday. The Nigerien firm complained that the decision 'lacks transparency' and 'violates a number of principles and practices essential to governance and commitments between stakeholders.' Orano said it had proposed an alternative to the Nigerien authorities, namely exporting the uranium to France or Namibia, and expressed regret that there was no reaction to the suggestion. Niger states in the document seen Friday a wish to 'purchase 210 tons of uranium through the natural channel of Sopamin,' which it said would 'allow Somair to continue its activities.' Currently, 1,050 tons of uranium concentrate from stocks from 2023 and 2024, or around half of the site's average annual production worth an estimated 300 million euros ($360 million), are currently blocked, Orano estimates. The ruling junta, which took power last year in a July coup, says it will revamp rules regulating the mining of raw materials by foreign companies in what is the world's seventh-largest uranium producer. It has also downgraded links with former colonial power France and strengthened ties with new partners including Russia and Iran. In September, Niger's Council of Ministers adopted a draft decree creating a state entity, 'Timersoi National Uranium Company,' abbreviated to TNUC.	https://www.voanews.com/a/niger-disputes-french-firm-s-uranium-move-/7848381.html	2024-11-01T17:52:27-07:00	
UN chief 'appalled' at RSF attacks in Sudan's Al Jazirah state	united nations — The U.N. secretary-general on Friday strongly condemned recent attacks in Sudan's Al Jazirah state by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and reiterated his call for the war to end. 'The secretary-general is appalled by large numbers of civilians being killed, being detained or being displaced, as well as acts of sexual violence against women and girls, the looting of homes and the looting of markets and the burning of farms,' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. 'Such acts may constitute serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. Perpetrators of such serious violations must be held to account.' From October 20 to 30, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out major attacks in villages across eastern Al Jazirah state, reportedly killing more than 120 civilians. The International Organization for Migration said Friday that more than 135,000 people have fled the area in the past week, with most going to Gedaref and Kassala states. The U.N. office for humanitarian affairs says it and its partners, especially local organizations and volunteers, are supporting thousands of the new arrivals with humanitarian aid, mental health support, family reunification services and other assistance. The RSF has been locked in battle with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for nearly 19 months, since their leaders turned against one another and engaged in a power struggle that has tipped the nation into catastrophe. Dujarric said the U.N. chief is alarmed that the humanitarian situation continues to worsen and 'demands' that all parties to the conflict facilitate 'safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access to all civilians in need in Sudan.' Eleven million people have been displaced and half of Sudan's population, an estimated 25 million people, are struggling with crisis levels of food insecurity. Famine was confirmed in August in parts of Sudan's Darfur region. At least 14 other areas of Sudan are considered at risk of famine in the coming months. Meanwhile, diseases, including cholera, are spreading. 'The secretary-general renews his call for a cease-fire to spare Sudanese civilians from further harm,' Dujarric said. Security Council action Assistance has been slow to reach the Sudanese because of the fighting and lack of access to parts of the country. In August, the government reopened a critical border crossing from Chad that it had closed because it feared the RSF was using it to smuggle in arms and other war materiel. The Adre crossing reopened for an initial three-month period, which will expire on November 16. Humanitarians and diplomats have urged that it be permanently reopened. Britain assumed the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council on Friday, and Ambassador Barbara Woodward told reporters that scaling up the humanitarian response is a priority for the U.K. 'Even since the Adre border opened in August, fewer than 30 trucks of aid are getting in per week, and that is nowhere near enough to meet the needs of 9 million people suffering in Darfur,' she said. She said use of the border crossing must be renewed and 'all possible routes' for aid – whether across borders or conflict front lines – must be maximized. 'If they're not, countless lives will be lost,' Woodward said. On Monday, Sudan's U.N. ambassador, Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed, told Security Council members that his government had opened nine crossings in addition to Adre and seven airports for humanitarians. But he cautioned that his government needed to review every three months and consider the security risks of keeping Adre open. 'The border crossing at Adre is really a threat to national security,' Mohamed said. Britain's Woodward said her delegation would convene a meeting on Sudan on November 12 to be chaired by the U.K.'s minister for the United Nations and Africa, Lord Collins of Highbury, to focus on the protection of civilians and the scaling up of aid. She said Britain, which leads the negotiating and drafting of resolutions on Sudan, would soon circulate a draft resolution to Security Council members. 'The draft resolution will be based on the secretary-general's recommendations and will focus on developing a compliance mechanism for the warring parties' commitments they made on the protection of civilians in Jeddah over a year ago, in 2023, and ways to support mediation efforts to deliver a cease-fire, even if we start with local cease-fires before moving to a national one,' she said. Just weeks after the fighting erupted, the SAF and RSF signed a declaration in Saudi Arabia reaffirming their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and facilitate humanitarian aid for them, including precautions to avoid and minimize civilian harm, which both sides have failed to do.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-appalled-at-rsf-attacks-in-sudan-s-al-jazirah-state-/7848385.html	2024-11-01T17:05:22-07:00	
Brazil police indict 20 in connection with salt mine catastrophe	SAO PAULO — Brazil's federal police indicted 20 people Friday for rock salt mining in the northeastern coastal city of Maceio that destroyed five urban neighborhoods and forced tens of thousands of people to leave their homes. The alleged crimes include damage to public property and environmental crimes. A police source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed to The Associated Press that those indicted were employees or contractors of Braskem, one of the biggest petrochemical companies in the Americas. Braskem is owned primarily by Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras and construction giant Novonor, formerly known as Odebrecht. It operated the mining of rock salt in the area for four decades and has been under investigation since the neighborhoods began collapsing in 2018. In a statement to The Associated Press, Braskem said it had not yet reviewed the full police report and therefore would not comment on the individuals indicted who were connected to the company. The petrochemical firm stated that it has cooperated with the investigation and 'has always acted in compliance with industry laws and regulations, regularly informing and reporting to the competent authorities.' Rock salt mining is a process of extracting salt from deep underground deposits. However, brine-filled cavities left behind when the salt has been extracted can eventually collapse, causing the soil above to settle. Structures built on top of such areas can topple. Around 200,000 people in the Alagoas state capital Maceio were affected by the excessive extraction of rock salt, according to the Brazil Senate's website. In July 2023, Braskem announced a $356-million settlement with the city. The money would be used for structural works in the city and for a residents' support fund. In December, a closed rock salt mine partially collapsed. The area had been previously evacuated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-police-indict-20-in-connection-with-salt-mine-catastrophe-/7848359.html	2024-11-01T17:03:42-07:00	
Bolivia's Arce says Morales' backers behind takeover of military posts	la paz, bolivia — Bolivian President Luis Arce accused followers of his former mentor-turned-rival, Evo Morales, of being behind an armed takeover of military posts and holding soldiers hostage on Friday, ramping up tensions in the already restive Andean nation. Arce said the groups had forced their way into three military posts outside the central Bolivian city of Cochabamba, home to many supporters of ex-President Morales, after shooting at and launching dynamite at police. The groups have also broken into each post's armory, Arce said, calling the act 'criminal' and accusing the attackers of treason. Bolivia's military urged those responsible for the takeover to 'immediately and peacefully' abandon each post. Morales, in a press conference later on Friday, called for a dialogue with the government. Without taking responsibility for the assault on the military posts, Morales said he would launch a hunger strike until talks between the two sides began. 'The lives of my instructors and soldiers are in danger,' warned an unnamed military official in a recording broadcast on local media. Televised images showed a row of uniformed soldiers with their hands behind their backs, possibly tied, surrounded by members of the armed group. Arce urged solidarity, saying that many of the soldiers were working class and Indigenous, much like their captors. Earlier this week, police and military had attempted to clear a weeks-long highway blockade by Morales' supporters strangling traffic between Cochabamba and Oruro. Protesters retaliated by launching dynamite at them from nearby hills, with police then launching tear gas. Morales' followers set up road blockades in mid-October in support of him, pressuring for a criminal investigation into the former president for alleged abuse of a minor to be dropped. Morales has argued the investigation is politically motivated. Since then, the disruptions in transport have cost the impoverished South American economy more than $1.7 billion, Arce said on Wednesday. The two leftist leaders, both with roots in Bolivia's ruling socialist party, have gone from close allies to bitter rivals in recent months as they jockey for position ahead of next year's presidential election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-s-arce-says-morales-backers-behind-takeover-of-military-posts-/7848388.html	2024-11-01T16:47:50-07:00	
Pentagon sends bomber aircraft, warships to Middle East	washington — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is sending additional bomber aircraft and Navy warships to the Middle East to bolster the U.S. presence in the region as an aircraft carrier and its warships are preparing to leave, U.S. officials said Friday. Austin ordered several B-52 Stratofortress bomber aircraft, tanker aircraft and Navy destroyers to deploy to the Middle East, according to four U.S. and military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements. The military moves come as Israel's wars with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon rage, including a retaliatory strike on Iran a week ago that likely damaged a base that builds ballistic missiles and launches rockets as part of Tehran's space program. The U.S. is pressing for cease-fires, while repeatedly saying it will defend Israel and continue to protect the American and allied presence in the region, including from Yemen-based Houthi attacks against ships in the Red Sea. The long-range nuclear-capable B-52 bomber has been repeatedly deployed to the Middle East in pointed warnings to Iran and it is the second time this month that strategic U.S. bombers will be used to bolster U.S. defenses in the region. In October, B-2 stealth bombers were used to strike underground Houthi targets in Yemen. Officials did not provide the number of aircraft and ships that will move into the region. The shifts are likely to result in an overall decrease in the total number of U.S. service members in the region, largely because an aircraft carrier contains as many as 5,000 sailors. But the addition of bomber aircraft beefs up U.S. combat strength. There have been as many as 43,000 U.S. forces in the region recently. According to a U.S. official, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and the three Navy destroyers in its strike group are scheduled to leave the Middle East by midmonth and return to their home port in San Diego. When it departs, there will be no aircraft carrier in the Middle East for a period of time, the official said. Officials declined to say how long that gap would last. Military commanders have long argued that the presence of an aircraft carrier strike group, with its array of fighter jets, surveillance aircraft and heavily armed warships, is a significant deterrent, including against Iran. To make up for that gap, Austin is ordering the deployment of other Navy destroyers to the region. Those destroyers, which are capable of shooting down ballistic missiles, would come either from the Indo-Pacific region or Europe, the official said. Eventually, it is expected that the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier and its three warships will move to the Mediterranean Sea, but they won't get there before the Lincoln departs. The Truman strike group has been in the North Sea, participating in a NATO military exercise. The Lincoln and two of its destroyers are now in the Gulf of Oman, and its third destroyer is with two other warships in the Red Sea. There are also two destroyers and the Marine amphibious ready group — which includes three ships — in the Mediterranean Sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-sends-bomber-aircraft-warships-to-middle-east/7848373.html	2024-11-01T16:27:24-07:00	
29 Nigerian children could face death penalty for protesting cost of living	ABUJA, Nigeria — Twenty-nine children could be facing the death penalty in Nigeria after they were arraigned Friday for participating in a protest of the country's record cost-of-living crisis. Four of them collapsed in court due to exhaustion before they could enter a plea. A total of 76 protesters were charged with 10 felony counts, including treason, destruction of property, public disturbance and mutiny, according to the charge sheet seen by The Associated Press. According to the charge sheet, the minors ranged in age from 14 to 17 years old. Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to several mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot dead and hundreds more were arrested at a protest demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people. The death sentence was introduced in the 1970s in Nigeria, but there have been no executions in the country since 2016. Akintayo Balogun, a private lawyer based in Abuja, said the Child Rights Act does not allow any child to be subject to criminal proceedings and sentenced to death. 'So, taking minors before a federal high court is wrong ... except if the government is able to prove that the boys are all above 19 years,' Balogun said. The court eventually granted $5,900 bail to each of the defendants and imposed stringent conditions they are yet to meet, Marshal Abubakar, counsel to some of the boys, said. 'A country that has a duty to educate its children will decide to punish those children. These children have been in detention for 90 days without food,' Abubakar said. Yemi Adamolekun, executive director of Enough is Enough, a civil society organization promoting good governance in Nigeria, said authorities have no business prosecuting children. 'The chief justice of Nigeria should be ashamed, she is a woman and a mother,' Adamolekun said. Despite being one of the top crude oil producers in Africa, Nigeria remains one of the world's poorest countries. Chronic corruption means the lifestyle of its public officials rarely mirrors that of the general population. Medical professionals often strike to protest meager wages. The country's politicians and lawmakers, often accused of corruption, are some of the best paid in Africa. Even the president's wife — her office is nowhere in the constitution — is entitled to SUVs and other luxuries funded by taxpayers. Nigeria's population of over 210 million people — the continent's largest — is also among the hungriest in the world and its government has struggled to create jobs. The inflation rate is also at a 28-year high, and the local naira currency is at record lows against the dollar. On Thursday, Nigeria was classified as a 'hotspot of very high concern,' in a report from United Nations' food agencies, as large numbers of people are facing or are projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity in the West African country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-children-could-face-death-penalty-for-protesting-cost-of-living-/7848325.html	2024-11-01T16:18:45-07:00	
New York subway chokehold death trial begins	A New York prosecutor told jurors on Friday that the way veteran Daniel Penny defused an uncomfortable situation on the subway by using a chokehold 'went way too far.' Prosecutor Dafna Yoran said Penny, a white Marine veteran, continued to hold his arm around the neck of Jordan Neely, a homeless Black man who had been acting erratically, after Neely's body went limp. When the train stopped at a station, one rider told Penny, 'If you don't let him go now, you're going to kill him,' Yoran told the jury in her opening statement Friday. Penny has been charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He has pleaded not guilty, saying he was acting in self-defense. 'Deadly physical force is permitted only when it's absolutely necessary and only for as long as it's absolutely necessary,' Yoran said. Penny 'went quite literally for the jugular,' she added. The deadly encounter happened more than one year ago and received wide news coverage at the time, with some people casting Penny as a hero and others casting Neely as a victim of a vigilante. Neely, whom Yoran said was homeless and suffering with mental illness, entered the subway train on May 1, 2023, threw his coat to the ground and told the riders he was hungry, thirsty and wanted to return to jail. His erratic behavior is something that New Yorkers can witness daily. 'His voice was loud and his words were threatening,' Yoran said, but Neely was also unarmed and did not physically threaten any of the riders. Thirty seconds after Neely entered the train, the prosecutor said, Penny placed Neely in a chokehold. Yoran said Penny held Neely in the chokehold for about six minutes. Video of the incident, Yoran said, would show 'how unnecessary this deadly chokehold was.' There is cellphone video of the incident, recorded from the subway platform. The prosecutor also said that Penny, who has first aid training, did not try to revive Neeley. Penny later told police, 'I put him out' and said that he was trying to 'de-escalate' the scene on the subway. According to The Associated Press, Neeley was a Michael Jackson impersonator who sometimes performed his act for subway riders. His mental illness and drug abuse, AP said, was likely triggered by his mother's murder when he was a teenager. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-subway-chokehold-death-trial-begins/7848310.html	2024-11-01T16:08:33-07:00	
Hindus seek protection from attacks in Muslim-majority Bangladesh	DHAKA, Bangladesh — Tens of thousands of minority Hindus rallied Friday to demand that the interim government in Muslim-majority Bangladesh protect them from a wave of attacks and harassment and drop sedition cases against Hindu community leaders. About 30,000 Hindus demonstrated at a major intersection in the southeastern city of Chattogram, demanding their rights while police and soldiers guarded the area. Other protests were reported elsewhere in the country. Hindu groups say thousands of attacks against Hindus have happened since early August, when the secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was overthrown and Hasina fled the country following a student-led uprising. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel peace laureate named to lead an interim government after Hasina's downfall, says those figures have been exaggerated. Hindus make up about 8% of the country's nearly 170 million people, while Muslims constitute about 91%. The influential Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council has said that there have been more than 2,000 attacks on Hindus since August 4, as the interim government has struggled to restore order. U.N. human rights officials and other rights groups have expressed concern about human rights in the country under Yunus. Hindus and other minority communities say the interim government hasn't adequately protected them and that hard-line Islamists have become increasingly influential since Hasina's ouster. Concern from Modi The issue has reached beyond Bangladesh, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi voicing concern about reports of attacks. While the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden says it has been monitoring Bangladesh’s human rights issues since Hasina’s ouster, U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump has condemned what he described as 'barbaric' violence against Hindus, Christians and other minorities in Bangladesh. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said: 'I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos.' Hindu activists have been staging protest rallies in the capital, Dhaka, and elsewhere since August to press a set of eight demands, including a law to protect minorities, a ministry for minorities and a tribunal to prosecute acts of oppression against minorities. They also seek a five-day holiday for their largest festival, the Durga Puja. Friday's protest in Chattogram was hastily organized after sedition charges were filed Wednesday against 19 Hindu leaders, including prominent priest Chandan Kumar Dhar, over an October 25 rally in that city. Police arrested two of the leaders, angering Hindus. The charges stem from an incident in which a group of rallygoers allegedly placed a saffron flag above the Bangladesh flag on a pillar, which was considered disrespectful to the national flag. Hindu community leaders say the cases are politically motivated and demanded Thursday that they be withdrawn within 72 hours. Another Hindu rally has been planned for Saturday in Dhaka. Separately, supporters of Hasina's Awami League party and its allied Jatiya Party have said they also have been targeted since Hasina's ouster. Jatiya's headquarters was vandalized and set on fire late Thursday. On Friday, Jatiya Party Chairman G.M. Quader said his supporters would continue to hold rallies to demand their rights despite risking their lives. He said they would hold a rally Saturday at the party headquarters in Dhaka to protest price hikes of commodities, and what they call false charges against their leaders and activists. Later Friday, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police announced it was banning any rallies near the Jatiya headquarters. There was no immediate response from the party about whether it would press ahead with its attempts to hold the rally or change the venue. The police decision came after a student group strongly criticized the police administration for initially granting permission for the rally and then threatened to block it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hindus-seek-protection-from-attacks-in-muslim-majority-bangladesh/7848357.html	2024-11-01T16:07:51-07:00	
COVID-19 shots banned at public health district in Idaho, likely first in US	A regional public health department in Idaho is no longer providing COVID-19 vaccinations to residents in six counties after a narrow decision by its board. Southwest District Health appears to be the first in the nation to be restricted from giving COVID-19 shots. Vaccinations are an essential function of a public health department. While policymakers in Texas banned health departments from promoting COVID-19 vaccines and Florida's surgeon general bucked medical consensus to recommend against the vaccine, governmental bodies across the country haven't blocked the vaccines outright. 'I'm not aware of anything else like this,' said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. She said health departments have stopped offering the vaccine because of cost or low demand, but not based on 'a judgment of the medical product itself.' The six-county district along the Idaho-Oregon border includes three counties in the Boise metropolitan area. Demand for COVID-19 vaccines in the health district has declined — with 1,601 given in 2021 to 64 so far in 2024. The same is true for other vaccines: Idaho has the highest childhood vaccination exemption rate in the nation, and last year, the Southwest District Health Department rushed to contain a rare measles outbreak that sickened 10. On Oct. 22, the health department's board voted 4-3 in favor of the ban — despite Southwest's medical director testifying to the vaccine's necessity. 'Our request of the board is that we would be able to carry and offer those [vaccines], recognizing that we always have these discussions of risks and benefits,' Dr. Perry Jansen said at the meeting. 'This is not a blind, everybody-gets-a-shot approach. This is a thoughtful approach.' Opposite Jansen's plea were more than 290 public comments, many of which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district. At the meeting, many people who spoke are nationally known for making the rounds to testify against COVID-19 vaccines, including Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who sells 'contagion emergency kits' that include ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine — drugs that have not been approved to treat COVID-19 and can have dangerous side effects. Board Chairman Kelly Aberasturi was familiar with many of the voices who wanted the ban, especially from earlier local protests of pandemic measures. Aberasturi, who told The Associated Press that he's skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and national public health leaders, said in the meeting and in an interview with the AP that he was supportive of but 'disappointed' in the board's decision. He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients and their doctors — and possibly opened a door to blocking other vaccines or treatments. Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite evidence that they're safe and have saved millions of lives.) The people getting vaccinated at the health department — including people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term care facilities or in the immigration process — had no other options, Jansen and Aberasturi said. 'I've been homeless in my lifetime, so I understand how difficult it can be when you're ... trying to get by and get ahead,' Aberasturi said. 'This is where we should be stepping in and helping. 'But we have some board members who have never been there, so they don't understand what it's like.' State health officials have said that they 'recommend that people consider the COVID-19 vaccine.' Idaho health department spokesperson AJ McWhorter declined to comment on 'public health district business,' but noted that COVID-19 vaccines are still available at community health centers for people who are uninsured. Aberasturi said he plans to ask at the next board meeting if the health department can at least be allowed to vaccinate older patients and residents of long-term care facilities, adding that the board is supposed to be caring for the 'health and well-being' of the district's residents. 'But I believe the way we went about this thing is we didn't do that due diligence.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/covid-19-shots-banned-at-public-health-district-in-idaho-likely-first-in-us-/7848342.html	2024-11-01T15:49:00-07:00	
No war to access sea, says Ethiopia prime minister	As the dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia over sea access escalates, Ethiopia's prime minister on Thursday said his country was seeking access to the Red Sea 'through peaceful means.' Speaking at the parliament where he was questioned by lawmakers, Abiy Ahmed said Ethiopia has a 'clear stance' on the issue. 'Let the world hear today, Ethiopia maintains a clear national interest — it needs Red Sea access through peaceful means,' he said. 'If we do not succeed, our children will,' Abiy added. Somalia and Ethiopia have been involved in a heated diplomatic dispute since Addis Ababa in January signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the self-proclaimed independent republic of Somaliland, a move Somalia sees as infringing on its sovereignty. Ethiopia and Somaliland defended the MOU which, if implemented, would give Somaliland recognition from landlocked Ethiopia in return for the leasing of about 20 kilometers of seafront, according to Somaliland officials. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Somali Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre said Somalia faced a 'serious threat' from Ethiopia for signing a sea access deal with Somaliland. Barre said Somali ports have always been accessible for Ethiopia's legitimate commercial activities but alleged that Ethiopia has other motives. 'Ethiopia's attempts to annex parts of Somalia under the guise of securing sea access are both unlawful and unnecessary,' Barre said. Barre warned that Ethiopia's approach and deal with Somaliland could 'embolden secessionist movements.' Abiy on Thursday denied any interest in annexation. 'When we signed the MOU with Somaliland, we requested a 99-year lease, but they didn't agree, and we signed a 50-year lease agreement,' he said. 'How can a 50-year lease be an annexation?' Abiy asked. Abiy told MPs that Ethiopia did not have any agenda in Somalia other than access to the sea. 'Ethiopia is a country which has the second-largest Somali population in the world next to Somalia. They are our brothers,' he said. Ethiopia has several thousand troops in Somalia helping its government in its struggle against Islamist extremists. Somalia on Tuesday expelled an Ethiopian diplomat, accusing him of engaging in 'activities incompatible with his diplomatic role.' Somalia did not specify the actions allegedly committed by Ali Mohamed Adan, a counselor at Ethiopia's embassy in Mogadishu, but said in a statement that they 'constitute a breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.' Abiy did not comment on the expulsion of the diplomat during the session at Parliament.

Before US sanctions violations arrest, Russian businessman faced charge in Hong Kong	When the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on three companies belonging to Denis Postovoy on Wednesday, it was yet another move to break up what U.S. authorities say was an international scheme to violate sanctions. A month earlier, on September 16, law enforcement officials arrested the 44-year-old Russian national in Sarasota, Florida. He was charged with conspiring to violate sanctions on Russia, commit smuggling, commit money laundering and defraud the United States. According to the indictment, Postovoy used an international network of companies to export dual-use microelectronic components from the United States to Russia –– potentially spare parts for military drones used in the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine. Postovoy is not the first Russian charged with violating U.S. export controls. But he is one of the few who allegedly did it from inside the United States. Using court documents and open-source information, VOA pieced together Postovoy’s history, revealing a story involving international trade, criminal charges in two countries, a U.S. startup and Florida real estate. Postovoy pleaded not guilty to all the charges. If convicted, he could face decades in prison. Postovoy is in pretrial detention and could not be reached for comment. His lawyer did not respond to a VOA request for comment. When VOA reached Postovoy’s wife by phone, she hung up. She did not respond to questions sent to her on the WhatsApp messenger app. According to the latest court filings, Postovoy’s case was transferred to the U.S. District Court in Washington. American charges After Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the U.S. significantly expanded restrictions on the export of microelectronics to Russia. The Department of Justice has accused Postovoy and several unnamed co-conspirators of using a network of companies under their control in Hong Kong, Switzerland and Russia to violate those sanctions. It claims Postovoy misrepresented the buyers and destinations of the goods, routing them through Hong Kong, Switzerland, Turkey and Estonia. 'As alleged, he lied about the final destination for the technology he was shipping and used intermediary destinations to mask this illegal activity,' U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves stated in a press release. 'Fortunately, our skilled law enforcement partners at HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] and our dedicated attorneys unraveled the plot.' The prosecution states that Postovoy’s clients included the Russian company Streloi Ekommerts and other unnamed firms. According to the indictment, the contract with Streloi was completed before the company was added to the U.S. sanctions list in December 2023. An investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty found that Streloi actively helps Russia circumvent Western export restrictions. Another recipient of the microelectronics, according to an invoice included in the case materials, was the Russian technology company Radius Avtomatika. Neither company responded to emailed questions from VOA. It is unclear whether the microelectronics Postovoy allegedly exported were ultimately used in drones, but one court document states that the people he contacted were members of Russia’s military-industrial complex. Hong Kong story Originally from Novosibirsk, Russia, Postovoy had lived in Hong Kong since at least 2010 with his wife — a Ukrainian citizen from Crimea — and their three children. Shipping records indicate his companies were involved in exporting goods from Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, to Russia. Prosecutors allege that after the U.S. expanded its sanctions, some of this activity became illegal. When the DOJ announced Postovoy’s arrest, it also listed the names of his companies that it said were involved in the alleged scheme. Aside from the Russian-registered firm Vektor Group, all the others were in Hong Kong: Jove HK Limited, JST Group Hong Kong and WowCube HK Limited. All are now under U.S. sanctions, except for WowCube HK Limited. Its appearance in the indictment provoked a rapid response from Cubios, another company previously associated with Postovoy. It produces the WOWCube gaming console, wich looks like a Rubik’s cube with multiple screens. Just a day after Postovoy's arrest was announced, Cubios publicly denied any connection to WowCube HK Limited. 'Neither Cubios nor any of its officers, directors, managers or employees ... have any connection to the HK Entity whatsoever. We do not own, operate or are in any way affiliated with the HK Entity,' the company said in a statement on its website. The startup also said that Postovoy 'falsely listed himself as a VP of the Company' on LinkedIn. In fact, Postovoy was previously Cubios’ vice president for production, according to archived versions of its website. Ilya Osipov, CEO of Cubios, told VOA that a mutual friend introduced him to Postovoy. 'I was looking for someone who could help with production in China — they gave me Denis,' he wrote in a message to VOA. According to Osipov, Postovoy became a business partner and made important contributions to prototypes and test batches of the WOWCube. Later the company decreased cooperation with him. Although Postovoy did not have an official position, Cubios allowed him to call himself the vice president of production 'for business purposes,' Osipov told VOA. He claimed that Postovoy founded the Hong Kong firm without Cubios’ permission. It was planned to become a distributor of the consoles in Asia, but that never happened, Osipov said. Coming to America In 2022, Postovoy and his family moved to Sarasota, Florida, where Cubios' headquarters is. According to Osipov, Postovoy said the move was motivated by a desire to raise children in a Western country and concerns about increasingly strict Chinese control of Hong Kong. American prosecutors see a different motivation. In a response to U.S. federal investigators included in the case materials, Hong Kong police said Postovoy was charged on March 1, 2022, with money laundering — a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison and a fine of up to $643,000. According to the email, Postovoy was scheduled to appear in court on March 4 but left Hong Kong the day before. Hong Kong police did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. By June 2022, Postovoy's wife purchased a house in southeastern Sarasota. Sarasota County property records indicate the house was valued at around $980,000. A mortgage covered $680,000 of the cost. In August 2023, Postovoy bought another house, in the new Rivo Lakes gated community in Sarasota. According to purchase documents, it cost $1.13 million. In September, he transferred it to a trust controlled by his wife. On the same day, his wife transferred the house to another trust and later sold the property. According to a U.S. magistrate judge, Postovoy's decision to transfer the second house into a trust was likely an attempt to conceal his ownership. He 'did not list his home — which is valued at nearly a million dollars and held in the name of a trust controlled by his wife — on his financial affidavit submitted to this Court,' the judge wrote in a decision not to grant Postovoy bail. This may not be the only attempted cover-up in the case: Russian company records indicate that, in December 2023, a man named Dmitry Smirnov replaced Postovoy as owner of his Vektor Group company.

Recent US strikes spotlight growing Islamic State threat in Syria	WASHINGTON — Airstrikes carried out by the U.S. military this week against several Islamic State targets in Syria highlight concerns about the terror group's growing presence in the war-torn country, experts say. U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, said Wednesday that its forces had conducted strikes on Monday targeting multiple camps belonging to IS, or ISIS, in the Syrian desert. Nearly 35 IS operatives, including senior leaders, were killed in the airstrikes, the U.S. military said. Despite its territorial defeat in 2019, IS has been carrying out attacks through sleeper cells across Iraq and Syria. In recent months, militants affiliated with the group have increasingly become active in areas controlled by forces loyal to the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad and their Iranian and Russian allies. The Syrian Desert, also known as the Badia, where the U.S. forces struck IS positions this week, has seen a significant surge in violence by IS militants in recent months. IS had maintained training camps in the Syrian desert for many years, according to Gregory Waters, a research analyst at the Counter Extremism Project who closely follows IS activities in central Syria. 'These are the places where it trains the next generation of fighters — often children it recruits from northeast Syria — and where adult fighters can return to in between their operations,' Waters told VOA. 'While the central Syrian desert is under Russian and Syrian regime control, ISIS does not abide by these arbitrary lines.' He added that IS cells in the central desert support the cells operating in northeast Syria, which is largely under the control of U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. The United States has about 900 troops in northeast Syria as part of a global coalition against IS. 'Oftentimes the fighters will cross from one region to the other to either conduct attacks or to escape from counter-ISIS operations,' Waters said. Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group, said the U.S. strikes demonstrate that the terror group remains a significant threat in Syria. 'Moreover, the Assad regime lacks either the will or the capability to counter ISIS, so the United States has remained vigilant in its efforts to keep the group on the defensive,' he told VOA. 'Any time you have a terrorist group with the legacy of the Islamic State, with a proven track record of being able to recruit, plan and conduct attacks, including external operations in the West, it is never a good idea to become complacent,' Clarke said. 'The strikes are necessary to keep ISIS from regrouping, whether in Syria or the hinterlands of Afghanistan.' Abdul Wahab Assi, a researcher at the Istanbul-based Jusoor Center for Studies, said the U.S. strikes in the Syrian Desert carried a political message, as well. 'It sent a message to Russia, which ostensibly operates against IS in that particular area, that it's not doing enough' to counter IS activities in Syria, he told Syria TV, a news channel affiliated with the Syrian opposition. Last week, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani announced the killing of the IS leader in Iraq and eight other senior IS commanders in a joint operation by U.S. and Iraqi forces. CENTCOM said in its Wednesday statement that alongside its allies and partners in the region, it 'will continue to aggressively degrade ISIS operational capabilities to ensure its enduring defeat.'

Mideast-North Africa region sees surge in global investment despite conflicts	For the first time in years, the Middle East and North African region is seeing a surge in interest from international investors. Major companies like Google, Microsoft and Adobe recently took part in one of the largest technology events in the region when Dubai hosted Expand North Star 2024, which attracted over 6,500 exhibiting companies, 1,800 startups and 1,200 investors from 180 countries. Over the last year, more than half of all investors in regional startups have come from outside, reflecting how attractive the Middle East and North Africa, or MENA, have become for those seeking new areas for growth, including investors from the U.S., Europe and beyond. Farah el Nahlawi, a United Arab Emirates-based research team leader at venture data platform MAGNiTT, provided hard numbers on the surge of international investment in the MENA region. 'In the first nine months of 2024, we recorded a total of 390 investors in the MENA region, with 199 of them being international investors,' Nahlawi said. 'When we break down these international investors, we see a diverse mix of contributors: 37% from the USA, 13% from the U.K. and 8% from Singapore.' Financial technology According to a recent report from MAGNiTT, the financial technology sector emerged as a key driver, securing $480 million in funding. At the heart of this trend is the desire for many countries in the region, like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, to move beyond traditional resource-based industries like oil, Nahlawi, said. They’re investing heavily in technology, education and innovation, creating fertile ground for startups and entrepreneurs. Nahlawi pointed to significant government initiatives across the region. 'Programs such as Saudi Vision 2030 and the UAE's economic policies have been pivotal in attracting international capital,' she said. 'These initiatives have notably improved the investment climate through economic diversification, aimed at reducing reliance on oil,' she added. 'By promoting sectors like tourism, technology and renewable energy, these governments are making their economies more resilient and appealing to investors seeking long-term stability.' Willingness to do business in the region has drawn criticism from some venture capitalists who spoke on background to publications like Financial Times, calling the investments a 'Faustian bargain' with governments and monarchs accused of human rights violations. Saudi Arabia's alleged killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, CNBC reported in September, 'remains an issue for some Western partners and startups.' The Post reported in May that 'some tech executives and security researchers' remain wary about those abuses, along with the possibility that some countries in the region could 'use American technologies for surveillance — including to target U.S. citizens.' But for many international investors, the MENA region offers the chance to enter a fast-growing market with high returns. For local governments, it’s a way to secure long-term growth beyond oil. Sergii Malomuzh, founder of Rewump — a business incubator for next-generation web startups — said regional governments are adopting progressive and flexible regulatory approaches to support emerging technologies and industries. 'This supports innovation and creates a favorable business climate for foreign investments,' he told VOA. Malomuzh also said markets like the UAE remain attractive because of their high growth potential and stable economic policies. 'From my experience investing in and working with the MENA region, I’ve noticed that investors come from various places, including the U.S., Europe, and the Gulf.' Talent in Sudan Yousif Yahya, co-founder of Sudan’s Savannah Innovation Labs, a prominent incubator and consultancy firm, emphasized Sudan’s unique position within the MENA investment landscape. Although much of Sudan’s young, talented and mobile workforce has been displaced by war, Yahya told VOA that some victims were fortunate enough to find opportunities outside Sudan, sometimes filling skills gaps and contributing to cross-border innovation. Yahya also noted that a surge in international interest is partly driven by countries like Egypt, where comprehensive policy reforms have been enacted to attract and protect foreign investments. These measures, he argued, reflect a commitment across the region to build a stable, predictable and investor-friendly environment. Robert Mogielnicki, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, highlighted the region’s potential for entrepreneurial growth despite conflicts in several countries. 'Countries in the MENA region boast young and growing populations and contain many promising startup scenes,' he told VOA. Mogielnicki pointed out that many MENA governments, particularly in the Gulf, are actively investing in entrepreneurship. 'In some cases, government entities provide direct support and investments to startups. In other instances, governments are seeking to enhance the startup and entrepreneurial ecosystems through supportive policies.' However, he cautioned, wars and geopolitical tensions could impact startups differently. 'The implications for startups and their ability to secure investments depend greatly on the industry they operate within, the potential for disruptions to operations, and fluctuating levels of available investment capital,' Mogielnicki said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mideast-north-africa-region-sees-surge-in-global-investment-despite-conflicts-/7848223.html	2024-11-01T13:59:46-07:00	
Elon Musk loses bid to move $1 million voter prizes case	A U.S. judge on Friday denied Elon Musk's bid to move a Pennsylvania lawsuit over his $1 million voter prizes to federal court, moving the case back to state court. It was not immediately clear if the decision would affect the billionaire's plan to keep awarding money until the U.S. presidential election Tuesday. The decision was issued by U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert in Philadelphia federal court. Musk has been giving $1 million checks to randomly selected registered voters who sign a petition supporting free speech and gun rights. Musk's America PAC had awarded $1 million prizes to 14 people as of Friday and said the final prize will be given out Tuesday. Democratic Philadelphia District Attorney Lawrence Krasner sued Musk and his political action committee, which backs Republican former President Donald Trump, on Monday in a state court to try to block the giveaway. Krasner called the program an illegal lottery. Two days later, Tesla CEO Musk and his America PAC sought to move the case to federal court, arguing Krasner's lawsuit raised questions about free-speech rights and election interference that belong in federal court. That prompted the state judge who had been overseeing the case to put it on hold. In arguing that the case belonged in state court, Krasner called Musk's maneuver an attempt to 'run the clock until Election Day.' Krasner did not allege the giveaway violates federal law. Philadelphia is the largest city in Pennsylvania, one of seven battleground states likely to determine the outcome of the race between Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Musk's offer is limited to registered voters in the seven states expected to decide the election — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Musk gave away the first $1 million at an October 19 America PAC rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's state capital. The giveaway falls in a gray area of election law, and legal experts are divided on whether Musk could be violating federal laws against paying people to register to vote. The U.S. Department of Justice warned America PAC the giveaway could violate federal law, according to media reports, but federal prosecutors have not taken any public action. Musk has so far given nearly $120 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-loses-bid-to-move-1-million-voter-prizes-case/7848193.html	2024-11-01T13:11:19-07:00	
WHO says more than 50,000 vaccinated against mpox in DR Congo, Rwanda	geneva — More than 50,000 people have so far been vaccinated against mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, the World Health Organization's chief said on Friday. The outbreak is still not under control, the African Union's health watchdog warned a day earlier, appealing for resources to avoid a 'more severe' pandemic than Covid-19. More than 1,100 people have died of mpox in Africa, where some 48,000 cases have been recorded since January, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). The majority of deaths have been in the DRC, the epicenter of the outbreak, which launched a vaccination drive last month. 'So far, more than 50,000 people have been vaccinated against mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, thanks to donations from the United States and the European Commission,' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. He also said that nearly 900,000 vaccine doses had this week been allocated to nine countries under a mechanism set up by the WHO and its partners. The countries in question were to be informed on Friday, he added. 'This is the first allocation of almost six million vaccine doses that we expect to be available by the end of 2024' through the Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM), the WHO chief said. Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals that can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact. Related to smallpox, the viral disease causes fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes and a rash that forms into blisters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-says-more-than-50-000-vaccinated-against-mpox-in-dr-congo-rwanda/7848165.html	2024-11-01T12:43:54-07:00	
Erdogan sues opposition chief, Istanbul mayor for slander	istanbul — Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday sued the main opposition leader and Istanbul's powerful mayor over allegedly slanderous remarks made at a protest rally a day earlier, the Anadolu news agency reported. Filed on Friday, the two separate lawsuits targeted Ozgur Ozel, head of the Republican People's Party (CHP), and Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, also a top party official. One accused Ozel of 'publicly insulting the president' and 'clearly committing a crime against the reputation and honor of the office of the presidency.' The second suit alleged Imamoglu had made 'unfounded accusations including slander, that violated Erdogan's rights' and had 'acted with the aim of humiliating the president in front of the public.' Each lawsuit sought 1 million Turkish lira ($30,000) in damages from the accused. The legal action centers on remarks the pair allegedly made Thursday at a demonstration in the Istanbul district of Esenyurt a day after police arrested its opposition mayor for alleged links to the banned Kurdish PKK militant group. It was not immediately clear which remarks prompted the legal action, but Ozel, who took over as CHP leader just a year ago, quickly hit back. Erdogan 'pretends to have been insulted without any insult being made, and tries to make himself the victim ... as if it was not he who insulted and victimized Esenyurt' by arresting its mayor, he told reporters. Imamoglu, who was elected as Istanbul mayor in 2019, is often portrayed as Erdogan's biggest political rival and is widely expected to run in the 2028 presidential race. He is seen as one of Turkey's most popular politicians. Two years ago, Imamoglu was sued for defamation after describing Istanbul election officials as 'idiots' during the 2019 Istanbul mayoral election. A court found him guilty, sentenced him to nearly three years in jail and barred him from politics for the duration of the sentence, prompting an international outcry. Imamoglu has appealed while continuing to serve as mayor. At the time, Erdogan insisted the case had nothing to do with him. The 70-year-old Turkish leader launched his own political career in the 1990s by being elected as mayor of Istanbul.	https://www.voanews.com/a/erdogan-sues-opposition-chief-istanbul-mayor-for-slander/7848167.html	2024-11-01T12:43:19-07:00	
What US election results could mean for Africa	JOHANNESBURG — Whoever U.S. voters choose as their next president — former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris — the election has global implications, with the probability it will affect other economies, foreign conflicts and personal freedoms, analysts told VOA. South African independent political analyst Asanda Ngoasheng said the winner could usher in policies that affect ordinary people in Africa. 'I hope that as Americans vote, they’re aware that whatever decision they make, it’s going to determine the future of not only America but the rest of the world,' she said. 'How we engage with issues of termination of pregnancy, how we engage with issues of LGBT rights, how we engage with issues of race and racism will be determined by this election, not just for America but for everyone else and everywhere else in the world,' Ngoasheng continued. The abortion issue is a particularly divisive topic for U.S. Republicans and Democrats. While the United States is the largest funder of global reproductive health programs, Trump slashed that funding during his presidency by extending a policy that barred U.S. aid from going to any organization that supported abortion. Experts said they believe that a second Trump presidency would likely do that again and could negatively affect PEPFAR, the U.S.’s key HIV/AIDS program. Trade is another key area in which analysts think Harris and Trump would differ, given Trump’s 'America first' policy. African governments hope that next year the U.S. will renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a Clinton-era policy that gives countries duty-free access to the U.S. market. Ray Hartley, research director of South African Brenthurst Foundation think tank, does not have high hopes for a second Trump presidency. 'I think that a Trump presidency would reinforce America’s isolationist approach in international affairs, and that might not be good for trade,' he said. Other analysts said they believe general U.S. policy toward Africa won’t differ radically regardless of who wins. They said that while Africa was often neglected in terms of U.S. foreign policy, that has shifted in recent years amid renewed competition with Russia and China on the resource-rich continent. Moscow has strengthened military ties with many African governments, while U.S. troops have been kicked out of Niger and Chad. Beijing, meanwhile, is Africa’s largest trade partner and has been building infrastructure throughout the continent. Ebenezer Obadare, senior fellow for Africa studies at U.S. research organization Council on Foreign Relations, said, 'Insofar as the United States is intent on competing with those powers in Africa, keeping its old alliances and building new ones, I don’t think one administration is likely to differ much from another, strictly in terms of their Africa policy.' As vice president, Harris traveled to the continent, where she pushed President Joe Biden’s line that the U.S. was 'all in on Africa.' The Biden administration also started holding an annual U.S.-African leaders’ summit. And, as it increases competition with China, the current administration has also undertaken funding the biggest U.S. infrastructure project in Africa in generations: the Lobito corridor, a railway connecting Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo that will be used to transport critical minerals. Biden was forced to reschedule a promised visit to Africa and is now expected in Angola in December. The choice of country has been criticized by some for what they say is Angola's shoddy human rights record. Trump's signature initiative involving the continent was creating Prosper Africa, a U.S. agency designed to assist American companies doing business in Africa. However, he also offended many Africans during his first term, using a derogatory term to refer to countries on the continent and mispronouncing Namibia’s name. More recently he raised ire by comparing himself to South African icon Nelson Mandela. Analysts said that while Harris and Trump have generally ignored Africa over the course of their campaigns, whoever becomes America's next president would do well to keep up engagement with the continent, which boasts the world's youngest population.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-us-election-results-could-mean-for-africa/7848065.html	2024-11-01T12:11:49-07:00	
Trump to visit Dearborn, Michigan, 'capital' of Arab America	WASHINGTON — In the run up to the presidential election, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has increased its outreach to Arab and Muslim Americans, particularly in battleground state Michigan. But it is her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, who has made surprising gains with this group that makes up a significant portion of voters angry over President Joe Biden’s policies on the Gaza war. On Friday, Trump is expected to visit a halal cafe in Dearborn, Michigan, a city dubbed the Arab capital of America, in a state home to almost 400,000 Arab Americans. Many of them have expressed determination to punish Harris over the Biden administration’s support for Israel. Trump’s visit is a continuation of his outreach to the Arab and Muslim community that have borne him important endorsements from leaders of two nearby Michigan cities that, while tiny, carry symbolic importance. Bill Bazzi, the first Muslim and Arab American mayor of Dearborn Heights, and Amer Ghalib, the Yemeni American mayor of Hamtramck, the only U.S. city with an all-Muslim city council, have endorsed the Republican candidate. 'My meeting with President Trump was positive, and we hope that he can change the current situation,' Ghalib told VOA. 'He said he doesn't want wars, and he will listen to our concerns.' Three of the six members of the Hamtramck City Council followed Ghalib’s endorsement and the rest endorsed Harris — a split that reflects the community’s polarized views of the candidates. 'Harris has answered this question many times that she is going to work with Gaza. She’s going to be fair with people of Gaza,' council member Mohammed Alsomiri told VOA. 'Trump, I don't believe him, and I don't trust him.' The former president has been intensively courting the group. At a rally last week in the Detroit suburb of Novi, about a half-hour drive from Dearborn, he said Muslim and Arab voters 'want a stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East. That's all they want.' Trump was joined onstage by what his campaign described as 'prominent leaders of Michigan’s Muslim community,' including Imam Belal Alzuhairi of the Great Mosque of Hamtramck. 'We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war!' said Alzuhairi. This despite Trump suggesting that he would give Israel’s military offensives against Hamas and Hezbollah more leeway, telling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a recent call to, 'Do what you have to do.' He often boasts he will end the wars in the Middle East 'in 24 hours,' without explaining how. As president, in 2017 Trump called for a 'total and complete shutdown' on Muslims, banning individuals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering, a policy that activists say is 'cruel, inhumane, and violated international law.' The Trump campaign has not responded to VOA’s queries on outreach to the community. Harris' outreach On the first anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, 25 Muslim leaders released an open letter telling Muslim voters that backing Harris 'far outweighs the harms of the other options.' The Harris campaign said it is 'working hard' to engage the community. The vice president met twice with a small group of leaders in Michigan, in Detroit in August shortly after she became the Democratic nominee and in Flint in early October. She has had one other meeting since then, with Black imams and community leaders in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, another key swing state. Afghan American Nasrina Bargzie and Egyptian American Brenda Abdelal, two lawyers spearheading Muslim and Arab outreach for the Harris campaign, have met with groups in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Minnesota, Arizona and Nevada, the Harris campaign told VOA. Phil Gordon, Harris' national security adviser, met virtually in early October with leaders across the country, the campaign said. But many of these meetings have been with friendlier groups, suggesting that they were not aimed at changing hearts and minds. Gordon’s meeting excluded major Muslim and Arab organizations as well as pro-Palestinian activist groups and was more of a 'check the box' engagement, according to James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, who participated in the eight-person meeting. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Harris’ vice presidential pick, has had one engagement with Arab and Muslim Americans, an October virtual meeting with Engage Action, the political arm of an 18-year-old Muslim American advocacy group, which already endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate in September. Third-party candidates While polls suggest that support among Arab American and Muslim Americans for Trump is unlikely to surpass Harris’, they also show that third-party candidates could pull a significant portion of votes away from her. In Michigan, Green Party candidate Jill Stein has been campaigning on a platform to 'end the genocide.' A poll released Friday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy organization, showed that 29.4% of American Muslims plan to vote for Harris, 29.1% for Stein, and 11.2% for Trump. Some 16.5% remain undecided. The numbers suggest an improvement for Harris and Trump among the group. Before Biden’s withdrawal, CAIR’s poll showed Biden received 7.3% support and Trump 4.9%. Compared to Biden, Harris has been more vocal in expressing sympathy for Palestinians and calling out Israel to 'follow humanitarian law.' She has also addressed the suffering in Lebanon and announced $157 million in assistance from the administration. At a Harris rally in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this week, Assad Turfe, an Arab American official from nearby Wayne County, said that Harris is a leader 'who will give voice to our pain.' But as in her various campaign events, in that rally Harris was heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters. 'Hey guys, I hear you,' she said. 'We all want this war to end as soon as possible.' A candidate must secure a minimum of 270 out of 538 Electoral College votes to win. With 16 Electoral College votes, Michigan could tip the balance in what is expected to be a very close election. Biden won the state in 2020 with 154,000 votes more than Trump. In 2016, Trump won the state over Hillary Clinton by just under 11,000 votes. The Gaza war has been a divisive issue among the community. At a Dearborn press conference announcing Arab American leaders’ endorsement for Harris last week, a group of anti-Harris Arab Americans confronted them, calling them traitors. Ronald Stockton, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan-Dearborn who has studied the community for decades, said he has never seen such polarization. He fears the community may be torn apart for good, regardless of who wins. 'There will be permanent scars left behind,' Stockton told VOA, 'like battlefield scars that remain decades after the war ends.'

What's at stake in Moldova's weekend run-off election?	Moldova's Constitutional Court on Thursday validated the results of last month's referendum, formally recognizing the country's decision to join the European Union. The 'yes' result, however, was an incredibly close one, much closer than polls had predicted, and the road toward EU membership for Moldova is not expected to be smooth either. Supporters of the measure attribute the much closer than expected result to Russian meddling in the run-up to the vote held on October 20, together with the presidential election. Both campaigns were marred by massive Russian disinformation and an alleged vote-buying scheme said to have cost the Kremlin tens of millions of dollars. Some have described an atmosphere of bitterness and division with unprecedented mud-slinging and 'hate speech,' including ethnic slurs and fascist tropes, leaving the country, some would say, dangerously divided. The top two presidential candidates, incumbent pro-Europe President Maia Sandu and pro-Kremlin former prosecutor general Alexandr Stoianoglo, face a run-off vote on Sunday. 'I hope that the pro-European forces, that Maia Sandu will win elections, but I am worried that this victory will be achieved with a small margin,' Ludmila Barba, host of Moldovan program The European Vector, told VOA. 'That was the case with the referendum. And this state of affairs means that this antagonism in society will remain.' Moldova is a parliamentary republic and those elections will take place next year. Right now, the government is controlled by Sandu's PAS party, but some predict it could lose control next year. Analysts expect Moldova will remain a battleground for hearts, minds and political allegiances for some time to come and Moscow is no doubt poised to further exploit divisions. It has been throwing its weight around Moldova since the collapse of the USSR but has been honing its meddling technique since last year's local elections. 'It was like a bootcamp for them [the Kremlin] for interference and then they scaled it,' Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at London's Chatham House, told VOA. 'They've seen what worked and that was vote-buying, trying to put eggs in different baskets … but underneath it all, having influence, having them on the payroll of Russia.' The most audacious part of the scheme was the participation of fugitive Russia-based oligarch Ilan Shor, who was convicted in 2017 of banking fraud in Moldova. He is accused of buying off a network of up to 300,000 Moldovans, paying them to vote against Europe in last month's referendum. 'They have been paid for their activity, from the equivalent of 50 euros a month and up. It's not big money, but when you take into account the complicated economic and social situation in Moldova, for people with a low income, these 50 euros are important,' Barba said. President Sandu called out the scheme but was unable to stop it. Moldovan runoff follows Georgia election Moldova's runoff comes on the heels of a hotly disputed victory for Georgia's pro-Russian Georgian Dream party. Georgia's opposition-aligned president, Salome Zourabichvili, declared the results illegitimate, describing a 'Russian Special Operation' to undermine the vote and she is fighting back, at this point, with uncertain effect. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE]) has noted voter intimidation, ballot stuffing and bribery in Georgia, but Moscow claims its hands are clean. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, the showing by the pro-Russian party is a dramatic turn for a country that had full-blown war with Russia in 2008. 'I would never have imagined Russia or a Russian agenda having such a strong comeback in Georgia. There was for a while so much open hatred toward Russia, that anything suspected to be related to Russia would immediately be rejected,' Lutsevych said. 'This is where Russians are smart in how they play the subversion game. They are not openly saying this is a Russian agenda.' The recent passage in Georgia of a 'Foreign Agent' law, an act clearly inspired by Moscow, got the EU to pause further discussion about bringing Georgia into the bloc. And the conduct of last week's elections was to be another 'litmus test' for Brussels on Tbilisi's readiness to join. While there may be clever, forward-thinking manipulation on the part of Moscow, Barba says one cannot ignore the effect of the immediate raw rage coming from the Kremlin. 'This is the first election since the Russian aggression in Ukraine began. The situation is more complicated because Russia is furious that it didn't manage to take Ukraine in three days and that makes it more aggressive,' she says. 'Since it was not able to clinch victory in Ukraine, it is going after smaller ones in Georgia and Moldova to prove or assert its status.' For the people of Moldova, fear has become the main theme of the elections. Barba points out that the pro-Russian side has said that if Moldova stays close to Russia, 'the country will be safe. That Ukraine has war because they went toward the EU.' 'That narrative is going around. And thepro-Europeans say if we end up with Russia, we will have war, we will be dragged in. Both sides are trying to say that the other option could lead to war.' According to Lutsevych, fear can ultimately drown out Sandu's main message that Moldova can have a brighter future with Europe. And this is taking its toll on some young members of Sandu's team. 'They don't feel it's a fair game. They don't feel they can win against that. It's so powerful. It's hard to compete when someone like Russia fuels anger, fear, and you have to compete on a positive agenda.' Still, getting into Europe is a fight in itself and Lutsevych praises Sandu for taking up that fight. And the nature of this election campaign, she concludes, has put Moldova more front and center on Europe's agenda and perhaps put enhanced focus on what Russia is doing on the sidelines of the Ukraine war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-s-at-stake-in-moldova-s-weekend-run-off-election-/7847965.html	2024-11-01T10:34:28-07:00	
Before US sanctions violations arrest, Russian businessman faced charges in Hong Kong	When the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on three companies belonging to Denis Postovoy on Wednesday, it was yet another move to break up what U.S. authorities say was an international scheme to violate sanctions. A month earlier, on September 16, law enforcement officials arrested the 44-year-old Russian national in Sarasota, Florida. He was charged with conspiring to violate sanctions on Russia, commit smuggling, commit money laundering and defraud the United States. According to the indictment, Postovoy used an international network of companies to export dual-use microelectronic components from the United States to Russia –– potentially spare parts for military drones used in the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine. Postovoy is not the first Russian charged with violating U.S. export controls. But he is one of the few who allegedly did it from inside the United States. Using court documents and open-source information, VOA pieced together Postovoy’s history, revealing a story involving international trade, criminal charges in two countries, a U.S. startup and Florida real estate. Postovoy pleaded not guilty to all the charges. If convicted, he could face decades in prison. Postovoy is in pretrial detention and could not be reached for comment. His lawyer did not respond to a VOA request for comment. When VOA reached Postovoy’s wife by phone, she hung up. She did not respond to questions sent to her on the WhatsApp messenger app. According to the latest court filings, Postovoy’s case was transferred to the U.S. District Court in Washington. American charges After Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the U.S. significantly expanded restrictions on the export of microelectronics to Russia. The Department of Justice has accused Postovoy and several unnamed co-conspirators of using a network of companies under their control in Hong Kong, Switzerland and Russia to violate those sanctions. It claims Postovoy misrepresented the buyers and destinations of the goods, routing them through Hong Kong, Switzerland, Turkey and Estonia. 'As alleged, he lied about the final destination for the technology he was shipping and used intermediary destinations to mask this illegal activity,' U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves stated in a press release. 'Fortunately, our skilled law enforcement partners at HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] and our dedicated attorneys unraveled the plot.' The prosecution states that Postovoy’s clients included the Russian company Streloi Ekommerts and other unnamed firms. According to the indictment, the contract with Streloi was completed before the company was added to the U.S. sanctions list in December 2023. An investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty found that Streloi actively helps Russia circumvent Western export restrictions. Another recipient of the microelectronics, according to an invoice included in the case materials, was the Russian technology company Radius Avtomatika. Neither company responded to emailed questions from VOA. It is unclear whether the microelectronics Postovoy allegedly exported were ultimately used in drones, but one court document states that the people he contacted were members of Russia’s military-industrial complex. Hong Kong story Originally from Novosibirsk, Russia, Postovoy had lived in Hong Kong since at least 2010 with his wife — a Ukrainian citizen from Crimea — and their three children. Shipping records indicate his companies were involved in exporting goods from Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, to Russia. Prosecutors allege that after the U.S. expanded its sanctions, some of this activity became illegal. When the DOJ announced Postovoy’s arrest, it also listed the names of his companies that it said were involved in the alleged scheme. Aside from the Russian-registered firm Vektor Group, all the others were in Hong Kong: Jove HK Limited, JST Group Hong Kong and WowCube HK Limited. All are now under U.S. sanctions, except for WowCube HK Limited. Its appearance in the indictment provoked a rapid response from Cubios, another company previously associated with Postovoy. It produces the WOWCube gaming console, wich looks like a Rubik’s cube with multiple screens. Just a day after Postovoy's arrest was announced, Cubios publicly denied any connection to WowCube HK Limited. 'Neither Cubios nor any of its officers, directors, managers or employees ... have any connection to the HK Entity whatsoever. We do not own, operate or are in any way affiliated with the HK Entity,' the company said in a statement on its website. The startup also said that Postovoy 'falsely listed himself as a VP of the Company' on LinkedIn. In fact, Postovoy was previously Cubios’ vice president for production, according to archived versions of its website. Ilya Osipov, CEO of Cubios, told VOA that a mutual friend introduced him to Postovoy. 'I was looking for someone who could help with production in China — they gave me Denis,' he wrote in a message to VOA. According to Osipov, Postovoy became a business partner and made important contributions to prototypes and test batches of the WOWCube. Later the company decreased cooperation with him. Although Postovoy did not have an official position, Cubios allowed him to call himself the vice president of production 'for business purposes,' Osipov told VOA. He claimed that Postovoy founded the Hong Kong firm without Cubios’ permission. It was planned to become a distributor of the consoles in Asia, but that never happened, Osipov said. Coming to America In 2022, Postovoy and his family moved to Sarasota, Florida, where Cubios' headquarters is. According to Osipov, Postovoy said the move was motivated by a desire to raise children in a Western country and concerns about increasingly strict Chinese control of Hong Kong. American prosecutors see a different motivation. In a response to U.S. federal investigators included in the case materials, Hong Kong police said Postovoy was charged on March 1, 2022, with money laundering — a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison and a fine of up to $643,000. According to the email, Postovoy was scheduled to appear in court on March 4 but left Hong Kong the day before. Hong Kong police did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. By June 2022, Postovoy's wife purchased a house in southeastern Sarasota. Sarasota County property records indicate the house was valued at around $980,000. A mortgage covered $680,000 of the cost. In August 2023, Postovoy bought another house, in the new Rivo Lakes gated community in Sarasota. According to purchase documents, it cost $1.13 million. In September, he transferred it to a trust controlled by his wife. On the same day, his wife transferred the house to another trust and later sold the property. According to a U.S. magistrate judge, Postovoy's decision to transfer the second house into a trust was likely an attempt to conceal his ownership. He 'did not list his home — which is valued at nearly a million dollars and held in the name of a trust controlled by his wife — on his financial affidavit submitted to this Court,' the judge wrote in a decision not to grant Postovoy bail. This may not be the only attempted cover-up in the case: Russian company records indicate that, in December 2023, a man named Dmitry Smirnov replaced Postovoy as owner of his Vektor Group company.

US border arrests remained lower in October amid Biden asylum restrictions	U.S. border authorities apprehended some 54,000 migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in October, according to preliminary figures obtained by Reuters, showing a marginal rise from September but continuing the broader downward trend since June when new restrictions were imposed under President Joe Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has called for even tougher border restrictions in the face of criticism by Republican candidate Donald Trump over illegal immigration as the two compete in a tight race. Immigration is a top issue for voters heading into Tuesday's election, particularly among Republicans, and Trump has intensified his language. The roughly 54,000 migrant arrests from October 1 through October 30 were far less than the U.S. Border Patrol's monthly arrest average of 160,000 through the first eight months of fiscal year 2024, before the Biden restrictions were imposed. The preliminary data reviewed by Reuters did not include the final day of October. In fiscal year 2023, border agents apprehended an average of 170,000 migrants per month. In fiscal year 2019, before the pandemic and during Trump's presidency, the monthly average was about 71,000. 'We feel very confident in the strategy that we're employing to manage this,' a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said, requesting anonymity to discuss unpublished statistics. The official said the reduced crossings had allowed more agents to move to the field and target trafficking of people and drugs. Biden's restrictions blocked most people crossing illegally from claiming asylum. At the same time, Mexico stepped up its immigration enforcement following U.S. pressure. Trump cracked down on both legal and illegal immigration during his 2017-2021 presidency and has promised historic levels of deportations if reelected. Harris blames Trump for helping kill bipartisan legislation earlier this year that aimed to increase border security. The Biden administration has also launched programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter legally through emergency 'parole,' which Biden officials say has reduced illegal crossings. Republicans argue the Biden programs exceed the bounds of the law and serve as a workaround to allow migrants to enter the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-border-arrests-remained-lower-in-october-amid-biden-asylum-restrictions/7847826.html	2024-11-01T09:16:37-07:00	
Eight die in Serbian railway station roof collapse	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Eight people were killed and two hospitalized on Friday when the roof of a railway station in the Serbian town of Novi Sad collapsed, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said in a televised statement. Local television stations showed emergency services at the scene, including medical staff who were preparing stretchers nearby. Two large diggers for removing rubble were also stationed in front of the station. 'It is an extremely difficult rescue operation that will last for several more hours. We have around 80 rescuers from several towns working and heavy machinery,' Dacic said, adding that two more people were still under the rubble but were alive. Local media said potentially dozens of people were injured. The mayor's office in the city acknowledged the incident but did not say how many were hurt. N1 news channel said that train departures were halted from the station about 70 kilometers northwest of the capital, Belgrade.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eight-die-in-serbian-railway-station-roof-collapse/7847824.html	2024-11-01T09:15:24-07:00	
Spanish floods' death toll climbs to 205; shock turns to anger, frustration	CHIVA, SPAIN — The death toll from historic flash floods in Spain climbed to least 205 people Friday, with many more believed to be missing, as the initial shock gave way to anger, frustration and a wave of solidarity. Spanish emergency authorities said 202 of the victims were in the Valencia region, and officials warned that more rain was expected in the next days. The damage from the storm Tuesday and Wednesday recalled the aftermath of a tsunami, with survivors left to pick up the pieces as they mourned loved ones lost in Spain’s deadliest natural disaster in living memory. Many streets were still blocked by piled-up vehicles and debris, in some cases trapping residents in their homes. Some places still don’t have electricity, running water or stable telephone connections. 'The situation is unbelievable. It’s a disaster and there is very little help,' said Emilio Cuartero, a resident of Masanasa, on the outskirts of Valencia. 'We need machinery, cranes, so that the sites can be accessed. We need a lot of help. And bread and water.' In Chiva, residents were busy Friday clearing debris from mud-filled streets. The Valencian town received more rain in eight hours on Tuesday than it had in the preceding 20 months, and water overflowed a gully that crosses the town, tearing up roads and walls of houses. Mayor Amparo Fort told RNE radio, 'Entire houses have disappeared. We don’t know if there were people inside or not.' So far 205 bodies have been recovered — 202 in Valencia, two in the Castilla La Mancha region and one more in Andalusia. Members of the security forces and soldiers are busy searching for an unknown number of missing people, many feared to still be trapped in wrecked vehicles or flooded garages. 'I have been there all my life, all my memories are there, my parents lived there ... and now in one night it is all gone,' Chiva resident Juan Vicente Perez told The Associated Press near the place he lost his home. 'If we had waited five more minutes, we would not be here in this world.' Before-and-after satellite images of the city of Valencia illustrated the scale of the catastrophe, showing the transformation of the Mediterranean metropolis into a landscape inundated with muddy waters. The V-33 highway was completely covered in the brown of a thick layer of mud. The tragedy has unleashed a wave of local solidarity. Residents in communities such as Paiporta — where at least 62 people died — and Catarroja have been walking kilometers in sticky mud to Valencia to get supplies, passing neighbors from unaffected areas who are bringing water, essential products and shovels or brooms to help remove the mud. The number of people coming to help is so high that the authorities have asked them not to drive there because they block the roads needed by the emergency services. In addition to the contributions of volunteers, associations such as the Red Cross and town councils are distributing food. And as authorities repeat over and over, more storms are expected. The Spanish weather agency issued alerts for strong rains in Tarragona and Catalonia, as well as part of the Balearic Islands. Meanwhile, flood survivors and volunteers are engaged in the titanic task of clearing an omnipresent layer of dense mud. The storm cut power and water services on Tuesday night, but about 85% of 155,000 affected customers had their power back on by Friday, the utility said in a statement. 'This is a disaster. There are a lot of elderly people who don’t have medicine. There are children who don’t have food. We don’t have milk, we don’t have water. We have no access to anything,' a resident of Alfafar, one of the most affected towns in south Valencia, told state television station TVE. 'No one even came to warn us on the first day.' Juan Ramon Adsuara, the mayor of Alfafar, said the aid isn't nearly enough for residents trapped in an 'extreme situation.' 'There are people living with corpses at home. It’s very sad. We are organizing ourselves, but we are running out of everything,' he told reporters. 'We go with vans to Valencia, we buy, and we come back, but here we are totally forgotten.' Rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that tore through homes and businesses, leaving many uninhabitable. Some shops have been looted, and the authorities have arrested 50 people. Social networks have channeled the needs of those affected. Some posted images of missing people in the hope of getting information about their whereabouts, while others launched initiatives such as Suport Mutu — or Mutual Support — which connects requests for help with people who are offering it. Others organized collections of basic goods throughout the country or launched fundraisers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spanish-floods-death-toll-climbs-to-205-shock-turns-to-anger-frustration/7847799.html	2024-11-01T09:10:44-07:00

US employers add 12,000 jobs last month as hurricanes, strikes reduce payrolls	WASHINGTON — America’s employers added 12,000 jobs in October, a total that economists say was held down by the effects of strikes and hurricanes that left many workers temporarily off payrolls. The report provided a somewhat blurry view of the job market at the end of a presidential race that has pivoted heavily on voters’ feelings about the economy. Last month’s hiring gain was down significantly from the 223,000 jobs that were added in September. But economists have estimated that hurricanes Helene and Milton, combined with strikes at Boeing and elsewhere, had the effect of pushing down net job growth by tens of thousands of jobs in October. Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the unemployment rate remained at 4.1% last month. The low jobless rate suggests that the labor market is still fundamentally healthy, if not as robust as it was early this year. Combined with an inflation rate that has tumbled from its 2022 peak to near prepandemic levels, the overall economy appears to be on solid footing on the eve of Election Day. The government did not estimate how many jobs were likely removed temporarily from payrolls last month. But economists have said they think the storms and strikes caused up to 100,000 jobs to be dropped. Reflecting the impact of the strikes, factories shed 46,000 positions in October. Health care companies added 52,000 jobs in October, and state and local governments tacked on 39,000. The employment report for October also revised down the government's estimate of the job gains in August and September by a combined 112,000, indicating that the labor market wasn't quite as robust then as initially thought. 'The big one-off shocks that struck the economy in October make it impossible to know whether the job market was changing direction in the month,’’ Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, wrote in a commentary. 'But the downward revisions to job growth through September show it was cooling before these shocks struck.’’ Still, economists have noted that the United States has the strongest of the world’s most advanced economies, one that has proved surprisingly durable despite the pressure of high interest rates. This week, for example, the government estimated that the economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annual rate last quarter, with consumer spending — the heart of the economy — helping drive growth. Yet as voters choose between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, large numbers of Americans have said they are unhappy with the state of the economy. Despite the plummeting of inflation, many people are exasperated by high prices, which surged during the recovery from the pandemic recession and remain about 20% higher on average than they were before inflation began accelerating in early 2021. With inflation having significantly cooled, the Fed is set to cut its benchmark interest rate next week for a second time and likely again in December. The Fed’s 11 rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 managed to help slow inflation without tipping the economy into a recession. A series of Fed rate cuts should lead, over time, to lower borrowing rates for consumers and businesses. In the meantime, there have been signs of a slowdown in the job market. This week, the Labor Department reported that employers posted 7.4 million job openings in September. Although that is still more than employers posted on the eve of the 2020 pandemic, it amounted to the fewest openings since January 2021. And 3.1 million Americans quit their jobs in September, the fewest in more than four years. A drop in quits tends to indicate that more workers are losing confidence in their ability to land a better job elsewhere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-employers-add-12-000-jobs-last-month-as-hurricanes-strikes-reduce-payrolls/7847691.html	2024-11-01T07:44:13-07:00	
Ethiopian students find success despite years of hardship	First, it was the COVID-19 pandemic that halted education in the Tigray region, and then, a deadly war, claiming many lives and displacing hundreds of thousands. Tenth-graders Yonas Nugus and Helen Berhe escaped with their families when their school in the town of Maychew was closed due to the war. Education was the last thing on their minds at the time, but they said they did not give up hope. 'The situation seemed hopeless and never-ending. It was tough to overcome, but we managed to get through it,' said Yonas, who like Helen recently completed a national exam and qualified to go on to university. The Tigray conflict flared up in November 2020 following a dispute between Ethiopia’s federal government and the Tigray regional administration led by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, or the TPLF party, which previously ruled the country. The United Nations and other institutions estimate that 600,000 civilians died in Tigray and more than 2 million were displaced from November 2020 to August 2022. In addition to the death and displacement, some women and girls were subjected to rape, as recorded by human rights agencies. 'During the war, a smart student with us committed suicide when they entered her area and raped her,' Helen said. 'When I heard stories like that, I wasn’t sure that something like that could happen to me tomorrow. It was not the time you could come in peacefully for school. So, even if I was going to die, I believed I would die fighting for my freedom.' For Yonas and Helen, both 17 at the time, the war had halted their dreams, but it did not kill those dreams; it just delayed them. In November 2022, the government and TPLF rebels concluded a cessation of hostilities agreement in Pretoria, South Africa. As the recovery from war began, school restarted, and the survivors came out of hiding and returned to Kallamino school in Maychew. The students from Tigray whose education had been disrupted were provided with special teaching materials and teachers to make up for the lost time. 'When we returned, our school lay in ruins. Our belongings left behind due to the COVID-19 pandemic were strewn about,' Helen said. 'Before the war, it took us a year to complete a class in school. However, we had to finish a year's education in just four months after the war. Then, we had to take the test. It was a very irregular learning process.' For Helen, the past has been challenging, filled with fear and anxiety. She has forgotten much of what she was taught before the war and faces a new language barrier because the instruction is now in English. But she also said the war taught her a different kind of lesson. 'It taught me to find purpose in life,' she said, attributing her success to this experience. 'I convinced myself that the past three years had been wasted and I needed to work hard for the future. I learned from the difficult times that I must walk with purpose. So, with the help of our friends, we finished our two-year course quickly,' Helen said. In the latest national exam results in Ethiopia, only 5.4% of high school students passed the university entrance exam, according to Minister of Education Birhanu Nega. Of the 674,823 students who took part in the entrance exam in the last academic year (2022-2023), only 36,409 obtained the average required to be admitted to university. That figure was an improvement compared with the previous year, when only 3.3% passed the exam. Yonas recorded the highest score of all those taking the test, scoring 675 out of 700 points. Helen scored highest among female students, getting 662 points out of 700. Yonas and Helen will now pursue higher education at the University of Mekelle, the region’s capital, or in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital. Yonas has chosen to study computer science; Helen plans to study medicine, specializing in neurology. Schools halted in Amhara region As Tigray starts recovering from war, students in another part of Ethiopia face an uncertain future as schools were shut by a new conflict between government forces and Fano rebels. In the town of Bahirdar, capital of Amhara region, parents did not send their children to school for a week after explosions shook the city earlier this month. Two students and a teacher were injured in an explosion on October 4, said Mulualem Abe, the head of the city's Education Department. Days earlier, two teachers were killed in Sinan district of East Gojam zone in Ethiopia's Amhara region after being shot by gunmen, authorities said. In a statement posted on its Facebook page, the local administration said the teachers were preparing to start their teaching work for the current school year, which started in late September. Without naming a particular group, the statement accused armed groups 'who swear in the name of the Amhara people' of being behind the killing. A spokesperson for the Fano rebel group denied involvement in the killing of the teachers but indicated they are against the reopening of schools.

US envoy sees some 'concerning signals' in Russia-China military cooperation in Arctic	The United States is watching growing cooperation between Russia and China in the Arctic closely and some of their recent military collaboration in the region sends 'concerning signals', the U.S. Arctic ambassador said. Russia and China have stepped up military cooperation in the Arctic while deepening overall ties in recent years that include China supplying Moscow with dual-use goods despite Western sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine. Russia and the United States are among eight countries with territory in the resource-rich Arctic. China calls itself a 'near-Arctic' state and wants to create a 'Polar Silk Road' in the Arctic, a new shipping route as the polar ice sheet recedes with rising temperatures. Michael Sfraga, the United States' first ambassador-at-large for Arctic affairs, said the 'frequency and the complexity' of recent military cooperation between Moscow and Beijing in the region sent 'concerning signals'. 'The fact that they are working together in the Arctic has our attention,' Sfraga, who was sworn in last month, told Reuters in a telephone interview from Alaska. 'We are being both vigilant and diligent about this. We're watching very closely this evolution of their activity.' 'It raises our radar, literally and figuratively,' he added. Sfraga cited a joint run by Russian and Chinese bomber planes off the coast of Alaska in July, and Chinese and Russian coast guard ships sailing together through the Bering Strait in October. He said these activities had been conducted in international waters, in line with international law, but the fact that the bombers flew off the coast of Alaska had raised concerns for U.S. security. 'We do need to think about security, heighten our own alliances, our own mutual defences,' Sfraga said. 'Alaska, the North American Arctic, is NATO's western flank and so we need to think about the Arctic that way.' The activity was also a concern for U.S. allies as the Bering Strait and the Bering Sea give access to the North Pacific and South Pacific, he said. The Pentagon said in a report released in July that the growing alignment between Russia and China in the Arctic was 'a concern'. China and Russia are trying to develop Arctic shipping routes as Moscow seeks to deliver more oil and gas to China amid Western sanctions. Beijing is seeking an alternative shipping route to reduce its dependence on the Strait of Malacca. The Arctic also holds fossil fuels and minerals beneath the land and the seabed that could become more accessible with global warming.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-sees-some-concerning-signals-in-russia-china-military-cooperation-in-arctic/7847586.html	2024-11-01T06:16:31-07:00	
Japan, EU announce new defense pact	TOKYO — Japan and the European Union announced a sweeping new security and defense partnership in Tokyo on Friday. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell hailed it as a historic and 'very timely' step. Borrell and his Japanese counterpart, Takeshi Iwaya, unveiled the pact to develop cooperation on joint military drills, the exchange of information related to the defense industry and space security, among other matters. 'I am extremely pleased to be here with Minister Iwaya to announce the conclusion of this security and defense partnership between the European Union and Japan,' Borrell said. He called it the 'the first agreement of this nature' the EU has made with an Asia-Pacific country, describing it as 'historical and very timely.' 'We live in a very dangerous world' and 'given the situation in both of our regions, this political framework deepens our ability to tackle emerging threats together,' Borrell told reporters. He did not mention China, but Japan has previously called its neighbor its greatest security challenge as Beijing builds up military capacity in the region. After the Tokyo talks, Borrell heads to South Korea, where concerns about North Korea will top the agenda. The United States has said thousands of North Korean troops are in Russia readying to fight in Ukraine. Pyongyang also test-fired one of its newest and most powerful missiles on Thursday, demonstrating its threat to the US mainland days ahead of elections. Defense industries The text of the EU-Japan Security and Defense Partnership, seen by Agence France-Presse, said they would promote 'concrete naval cooperation,' including through activities such as joint exercises and port calls, which could also include 'mutually designated third countries.' It also said the EU and Japan would discuss 'the development of respective defense initiatives including exchange of information on defense industry-related matters.' Japan, which for decades has relied on the United States for military hardware, is also developing a new fighter jet with EU member Italy and Britain that is set to be airborne by 2035. The agreement on industrial cooperation could 'turbo-charge collaboration, such that joint defense projects between Japanese and European firms funded through EU mechanisms may be on the cards,' analyst Yee Kuang Heng of the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Public Policy told AFP. Japan is ramping up defense spending to the NATO standard of 2% of GDP by 2027, partly to counter China, which is increasing military pressure on Taiwan. Beijing claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to bring it under its control. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who could head a minority government after a disastrous general election last week, has said that 'today's Ukraine could be tomorrow's East Asia.' Ishiba has also called for the creation of a NATO-like regional alliance with its tenet of collective security, although he has conceded this will 'not happen overnight.' The same warning was issued by Ishiba's predecessor, Fumio Kishida, who was hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden for a state visit in April at which the allies announced plans to boost their defense partnership. On Friday, Borrell and Iwaya also 'exchanged an instrument of ratification for Japan EU Strategic Partnership Agreement, or SPA,' Iwaya said, referring to a separate, previously agreed-upon pact. 'This SPA will formally enter into force on January 1 next year. It will be a legal foundation to strengthen the Japan-EU strategic partnership into the future,' Iwaya said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-eu-announce-new-defense-pact/7847578.html	2024-11-01T06:15:09-07:00	
Is China a hero or villain in the climate fight?	Berlin — China is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases that cause global warming — but the country is also the global leader in developing sources of so-called green technology, such as solar and wind power. So, is China it a problem or a solution in the climate fight? As the climate conference COP29 draws near in Baku, Azerbaijan, China’s seemingly contradictory position in the climate fight has come into focus. More than 80% of China’s energy is produced using fossil fuels, with a heavy reliance on coal. The country’s coal production broke a record last year, and more coal-fired plants are being built. Despite that, China’s carbon emissions will likely peak in 2025, five years ahead of its target in 2030, according to the projection of Yiyun Cui, associate research professor and acting director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland. 'This is mainly driven by the very fast development of green technologies, particularly solar and wind. We’re seeing EV deployment very fast. [It’s] also driven by declining demand for a lot of energy intensive products like construction materials because of economic slowdown and restructuring,' said Cui. The latest report from the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a Finland-based research and policy organization, showed that in the third quarter of this year, China’s coal emissions rose, but was offset by a reduction in emissions caused by steel, cement and oil production, a result of China’s slowing economy. Meanwhile, China is the global leader in building renewable energy capacity. The amount of energy supplied by the wind and solar power plants it’s building, when they come online, is expected to double the rest of the world combined, enough to power the whole of South Korea. For the past few years, Beijing has pushed a series of national policies, including allocating land to build wind plants and boosting the use of rooftop solar panels. These policies have stimulated China’s green economy and it is in Beijing’s interest to export green technology, Lauri Myllyvirta, senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA News. 'There’s a lot of enthusiasm from local governments, state banks, private investors for solar and wind projects, because they are profitable especially after the real estate market contraction. All of these players were looking for new targets for investment and sources of growth,' said Myllyvirta. China’s solar industry, for instance, is experiencing oversupply, which threatens to keep equipment prices low for years to come. While countries like the United States warned of threats to local production, Cui said this pulls down the cost for global energy transition, especially for countries in the so-called Global South. Countries are due to submit new climate plans early next year to reach the Paris Agreement Goal aimed at limiting the global temperature rise. As the world’s largest emitter, China’s commitment is expected to be 'absolutely crucial for the global climate effort,' said Myllyvirta. COP29 is set to take place from November 11th to 22nd in Azerbaijan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/is-china-a-hero-or-villain-in-the-climate-fight-/7847472.html	2024-11-01T04:51:32-07:00	
Kenya’s new deputy president sworn in	Nairobi — Kithure Kindiki was sworn in as Kenya’s deputy president Friday, less than 24 hours after a court lifted orders blocking his nomination to replace impeached DP Rigathi Gachagua, who has filed lawsuits to regain his position. In a televised ceremony at Nairobi's Kenyatta International Convention Center, Kindiki said he will always serve his country and will not let down President William Ruto, who appointed him. Ruto told attendees he knows his former interior minister as 'a dedicated professional,' and 'a patriot whose dedication to cohesion, national unity and inclusivity is beyond reproach.' Kindiki has been part of Ruto's cabinet for two years and came under fire for supporting alleged police brutality during anti-government protests earlier this year. He also faced criticism when Kenya decided to send police forces to Haiti, a deployment he and his boss vehemently defended. The swearing in ceremony took place 24 hours after a court lifted orders blocking Kindiki’s nomination, dealing a blow to former DP Gachagua, who was impeached and removed from office in mid-October amid accusations of gross misconduct and undermining the president. Gachagua's lawyers filed about 30 court cases arguing against the decision in the last two weeks. A three-judge bench appointed to hear the case made the highly anticipated announcement Thursday. 'Public interest in this matter favors giving way to the constitution, which in any event is the will of the people,' said Judge Antony Mrima, who heard the case along with Eric Ogola and Freda Mugambi. 'We choose to abide by that calling, as such public interest demands that the office of the deputy president should not remain vacant.' President Ruto took less than a day to nominate Kindiki, after Gachagua’s removal from office. The selection was approved by lawmakers in the National Assembly a few hours later. However, the court suspended any further action until it could hear the case. Since then, the three-judge bench has faced questions and petitions from Gachagua's lawyers contesting the validity of their appointment and their own impartiality. Those challenges were rejected. Gachagua was convicted on five of 11 charges against him, which included accusations of gross misconduct, irregular acquisition of wealth and undermining the president. Gachagua has denied all the charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-s-new-deputy-president-sworn-in-/7847463.html	2024-11-01T04:36:13-07:00

Moscow says it destroyed 83 Ukrainian drones	Russia's Defense Ministry said its defenses shot down 83 Ukrainian drones over six regions early on November 1. '36 drones were shot down over the Kursk region, 20 over the Bryansk region, 12 over Crimea, eight over the Voronezh region, four over the Oryol region, and three over the Belgorod region,' the ministry said in a statement on its Telegram channel. Separately, Aleksandr Bogomaz, the governor of Bryansk, said one person was wounded when a Ukrainian drone crashed into an apartment building in the city of Bryansk. In the Stavropol region, a drone fell on an oil depot in the city of Svetlograd, regional Governor Vladimir Vladimirov said on Telegram. In Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa, a Russian missile struck a fire station, wounding two firefighters, regional Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air force said its defenses shot down 31 Russian drones and one missile.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moscow-says-it-destroyed-83-ukrainian-drones/7847369.html	2024-11-01T02:34:09-07:00	
North Korean foreign minister arrives in Moscow for talks	moscow — North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui has arrived in Moscow and will hold strategic consultations with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the ministry, in a post on her official Telegram channel, published photographs of Lavrov meeting Choe at a Moscow train station. 'Today, talks between the heads of Russia and the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) will be held in Moscow. Sergei Lavrov greeted his counterpart with a bouquet of flowers,' said Zakharova. 'The meeting began at the Yaroslavsky railway station (in Moscow), where a memorial plaque was unveiled to mark the occasion of Kim Il Sung's 1949 visit to the USSR,' she said, referring to the founder of the DPRK. The visit, Choe's second in six weeks, comes after Pyongyang tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile this week and as Washington says there are 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia, including as many as 8,000 deployed in Russia's Kursk region where Ukrainian troops have dug in. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that the United States expected the North Korean troops in Kursk region to enter the fight against Ukraine in the coming days. Moscow has neither denied nor directly confirmed the presence of North Korean troops on its soil. President Vladimir Putin has said it is for Russia to decide how to implement a treaty he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June that includes a mutual defense clause.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-foreign-minister-arrives-in-moscow-for-talks/7847365.html	2024-11-01T02:25:41-07:00	
Israeli strikes kill 47 Palestinians in central Gaza, Palestinian news agency says	Gaza, Gaza Strip — Forty-seven Palestinians were killed and dozens injured, most of them children and women, in overnight Israeli bombardment of the the central Gaza Strip, the Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Friday. The attacks occurred in the city of Deir Al-Balah, the Nuseirat camp and the town of Al-Zawayda, it said. The Israeli military said its troops had identified and eliminated 'several armed terrorists' in central Gaza and had eliminated 'dozens of terrorists' in targeted raids in northern Gaza's Jabalia area. The Gaza war began after a Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,400 Palestinians, with more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters. Hamas has been designated terrorist organizations by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. At least 46 Palestinians were killed in Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, mostly in the north where one attack hit a hospital, torching medical supplies and disrupting operations, the enclave's health officials said. Israel's military has accused the Palestinian militant group Hamas of using Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya for military purposes and said 'dozens of terrorists' have been hiding there. Health officials and Hamas deny the assertion. The health ministry in the Gaza Strip called for all international bodies 'to protect hospitals and medical staff from the brutality of the (Israeli) occupation.' Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said Thursday that one of its doctors at the hospital, Mohammed Obeid, had been detained Saturday by Israeli forces. It called for the protection of him and all medical staff who 'are facing horrific violence as they try to provide care.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-kill-47-palestinians-in-central-gaza-palestinian-news-agency-says/7847357.html	2024-11-01T02:16:39-07:00	
Russia gives former US Consulate employee nearly 5-year jail term	moscow — A Russian former employee of the U.S. Consulate in Russia's Far Eastern city of Vladivostok has been sentenced to four years and 10 months in prison for 'secret collaboration with a foreign state,' Russian agencies said Friday. Robert Shonov worked for more than 25 years for the U.S. Consulate until 2021, when Moscow imposed restrictions on local staff working for foreign missions. Afterward, he worked as a private contractor compiling news accounts from publicly accessible Russian media, according to the U.S. State Department. He was arrested this year on suspicion of passing secret information about Russia's war in Ukraine to the United States in exchange for money. According to the judgment published on the website of Valdivostok's Primorye court, $4,343 and an electronic device linked to the commission of the offense were seized. In September 2023, Russia also expelled two U.S. diplomats it accused of acting as liaison agents for Shonov. According to Washington, Shonov had only been hired by the U.S. Consulate to carry out routine monitoring of freely accessible Russian media. In recent years, several U.S. citizens have been arrested and sentenced to long jail terms in Russia. Others are being held pending trial. Washington, which supports Ukraine militarily and financially against Russia's invasion, accuses Moscow of wanting to exchange them for Russians held in the United States. The United States and Russia exchanged prisoners including The Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in a landmark swap in August, but several U.S. nationals and dual nationals remain in detention in Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-gives-former-us-consulate-employee-nearly-5-year-jail-term/7847354.html	2024-11-01T02:00:07-07:00	
Exclusive: US says it is looking into case of American jailed in Iran	The Biden administration says it is looking into Iran's apparent recent detention of an Iranian American dual national who is the only U.S. citizen publicly reported to have been jailed by the Islamic republic since a rare U.S.-Iran prisoner swap in September 2023. Responding to a VOA inquiry last week the State Department said in a statement that it was 'aware of reports that a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen has been arrested in Iran.' The reports refer to Reza Valizadeh, a former journalist for VOA sister network Radio Farda who had left the Persian-language network in 2022. He flew to Tehran in February to visit his family after living in the West for 14 years, according to his last post on the X platform in August. Iran views Radio Farda and other Western-based Persian media as hostile entities because they draw attention to public dissent and protests against the nation's authoritarian Islamist rulers. 'We are working with our Swiss partners who serve as the protecting power for the United States in Iran to gather more information about this case,' a State Department spokesperson said. 'Iran routinely imprisons U.S. citizens and other countries' citizens unjustly for political purposes. This practice is cruel and contrary to international law,' the spokesperson added. An informed source inside Iran told VOA's Persian Service that Valizadeh was arrested in Iran in late September on charges of collaborating with overseas-based Persian media. The source requested anonymity due to Iran's repeated harassment of individuals who provide comments publicly to Western media. The Iran-based human rights group Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRAI) and the U.S.-based media rights group Committee to Protect Journalists reported in mid-October that Valizadeh had been held in Tehran's Evin prison without access to a lawyer since his arrest. The reports cited two sources: one close to Valizadeh's family, and one who previously worked with Valizadeh. Iran's U.N. mission in New York acknowledged receiving a VOA request for comment about Valizadeh's case last week but provided no response. Skylar Thompson, HRAI's Washington-based deputy director, said in a message to VOA that the State Department 'must utilize all available diplomatic channels to investigate Valizadeh's detention and ensure his immediate, unhindered access to legal counsel.' In his last X post in August, Valizadeh wrote that he had returned to Iran in February after having only 'half-completed' a negotiation with the intelligence arm of Iran's top military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He said he decided to return voluntarily, even without having received a prior written or verbal commitment that the IRGC would not impede his visit. In Valizadeh's previous X post, published in February upon arrival in Iran, he said Iranian intelligence agents had summoned and pressured his family members to persuade him to return. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has tried to persuade Iranians living abroad that they have nothing to fear by returning. 'We must assure them that if they return to Iran, we will not file a case against them. We will not harass them, and we will not prevent them from leaving,' Pezeshkian said in an August interview with state news agency ISNA. Jason Brodsky, policy director of U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran, told VOA that Valizadeh's arrest should be a warning to Iranians with dual nationalities that Tehran's assurances cannot be trusted. 'There have been cases over the years in which Iranians abroad will get authorization from one governmental entity in Iran to enter, and then a competing agency will scoop up this person and take him hostage,' Brodsky said. Valizadeh was slated to go on trial before Revolutionary Court judge Abolghassem Salavati, according to sources cited by HRAI and Iranian freelance journalist Nejat Bahrami, who first reported Valizadeh's arrest in a social media post on October 13. Salavati has been sanctioned by the U.S. government for harshly punishing Iranian citizens and dual nationals for exercising their freedoms of expression or assembly. 'It seems as though Valizadeh is wrongfully detained,' said Kylie Moore-Gilbert, an Australian political scientist who herself was detained in Iran from 2018 to 2020 on what Western nations said were bogus security charges. In an email to VOA, Moore-Gilbert wrote that Valizadeh's journalism 'would certainly make him a person of interest to the IRGC.' 'The fact that he has been referred to the Revolutionary Court of Salavati is also telling, as this judge is favored by the IRGC for dealing with political cases including the wrongful detention of foreign and dual nationals,' she wrote. Granting a wrongful detention designation to a U.S. national means U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens is authorized to work with a coalition of government and private sector organizations to secure the detainee's freedom. Designations are granted if a review by the secretary of state concludes that the U.S. national's case meets criteria defined in the Levinson Act of 2020. Any of Valizadeh's family members residing abroad or legal representatives should 'immediately apply' to the U.S. secretary of state for a wrongful detention designation, Moore-Gilbert said. Valizadeh's recent work as a journalist should make the process 'relatively straightforward' in contrast to other cases, she added. The State Department spokesperson who sent the statement to VOA said the agency 'continuously monitors the circumstances surrounding the detentions of U.S. citizens overseas for indicators that the detentions may be wrongful.' The Biden administration secured the release of five Iranian Americans whom it deemed wrongfully detained in Iran in a September 2023 deal in which five Iranians in the U.S. also won reprieves from detention and prosecution. That deal is the only U.S.-Iran prisoner exchange of Biden's term so far. It also involved the U.S. allowing $6 billion in Iranian funds frozen under U.S. sanctions in South Korean banks to be transferred to Qatar for Iran to use for humanitarian purchases. A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson told U.S. media this month that the funds remain 'immobilized' following Iran's backing of the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel. 'Valizadeh's detention raises questions as to whether the Iranians are holding him hostage for an exchange involving the movement of those assets in Qatar or something even greater,' Brodsky said. 'Every time we do a deal like that, it emboldens the Iranians to take more hostages,' he added. 'So we need a comprehensive strategy, working with our allies and partners, to employ common hostage-taking penalties against Iran involving sanctions and diplomatic isolation.'

Russian disinformation campaign creates 'climate of chaos,' say experts	Washington — For regular audiences of Polish public broadcaster Polskie Radio, the headlines on its website appeared strange: 'The unacceptable truth: The EU will manage without Poland' and 'Ukraine will stay outside of the EU.' The pro-Russian, Euroskeptic narratives didn't align with the broadcaster's usual coverage. But at first glance, the website appeared legitimate. Those who looked closer saw the giveaway: The domain name of the site was polskieradio.icu. The real Polskie Radio’s domain is polskieradio.pl. The pro-Russian narratives were placed on a Russian cloned website — one specifically designed to mislead. The incident, recorded in April, is part of a wider trend of fake websites employed in a 'persistent' disinformation campaign spanning two years, according to an article published on the website of the Austria-based International Press Institute and signed by it and three other European press freedom groups. These watchdogs say Russian agents are creating false news websites that mimic reputable sources and posting fake stories to those phony sites. 'It’s really hard to see that it’s a fake website, so it really works,' said Camille Magnissalis, who monitors press freedom violations for the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ). 'If you don’t know, you can be easily misled.' The U.S. Department of Justice said in a September press release that such websites are part of 'Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns' informally known as 'Doppelganger,' after the German word for a person who is almost exactly identical to another. At the time, the Justice Department announced its 'ongoing seizure' of 32 internet domains used in Doppelganger campaigns. The websites may look like trusted European media outlets but in fact mislead readers with malicious stories and propaganda. That content is often shared on social media either through advertisements or bot accounts. 'It’s often related to political stakes because they want to influence people,' Magnissalis told VOA. 'In the end, these stories are integrated into the media landscape and have impact.' The Media Freedom Rapid Response (MFRR) consortium described the Russian disinformation campaign in its biannual media monitoring report covering the first half of 2024. European press freedom watchdogs, including EFJ and IPI, make up the consortium. In 2023, fake articles made up most of the content on the phony websites, according to the MFRR report. This year, most attacks have involved artificial intelligence, or AI, either as deepfake images or fake audio clips of well-known journalists. Such content destabilizes trust in the news and creates a 'climate of chaos' for European news readers, according to the report. The domains for these fake websites were purchased through cryptocurrency transactions, obscuring the identity of the purchaser. The crypto wallets used were associated with Russia, according to the IPI article. 'They use really refined techniques to mask the fact that they’re trying to misinform anyone,' said Karol Luczka, IPI's Eastern Europe monitoring and advocacy officer. 'They try to make sure nobody realizes that Russia is doing this.' The Russian operation has targeted Ukraine, Poland and Germany. It targeted France ahead of its presidential elections last summer, spoofing the website of the French daily Le Monde. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment. Although the campaign is widespread throughout Europe, doppelganger websites first started appearing in Ukraine, attempting to manipulate the public's opinion of the Russia-Ukraine war, Luczka said. According to Luczka, the false stories on those sites primarily pushed one of three narratives: that Ukraine is losing the war, that Ukraine is running out of resources, or that the Ukrainian government is corrupt. Before 2022, Russia had primarily published disinformation in the Russian language. The modern-day doppelganger campaign, however, adapts its language to the targeted country. This difference makes audiences much more likely to believe what they are reading, Luczka told VOA. 'Russian disinformation tactics are becoming more subtle and more refined,' he said. 'That means they are also becoming more efficient, sadly and worryingly.' Facebook has been crucial to the popularization of these websites and their false information, Luczka said, adding that it is the main social media platform where Ukrainians receive news. Around 54% of the Ukrainian population uses Facebook, according to data collected by the World Population Review. This creates a challenge for big tech companies like Meta, Facebook's owner, Magnissalis of EFJ said. These platforms have a responsibility to monitor the disinformation posted to their website, she said, including that coming from Russian actors. 'They just create fake accounts and spread links to those websites everywhere,' Magnissalis said. 'It’s not new, but it is problematic.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-disinformation-campaign-creates-climate-of-chaos-say-experts/7847280.html	2024-11-01T01:36:13-07:00	
Moldova faces decisive vote under shadow of Russian interference	Chisinau, Moldova — Moldova's pro-Brussels leader Maia Sandu is in a tough fight in Sunday's presidential election with a challenger who wants closer ties with Moscow only two weeks after she won an EU membership referendum by a razor-thin margin. With Georgia reeling from a disputed election which returned its Moscow-friendly ruling party to power, all eyes are now on Moldova, which borders war-torn Ukraine. Russia has been accused of interfering in the elections of both former Soviet states, allegations rejected by Moscow. Sandu said her camp 'won justly in an unjust struggle' in the EU referendum on October 20 amid claims that pro-Russian opposition engaged in disinformation and vote-buying. But the 52-year-old former World Bank economist admitted she was in a 'difficult fight' in the second round of the presidential vote, after taking nearly 42.5 % of the vote in the first round. Her rival, Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor backed by the pro-Russian Socialists, picked up a higher-than-expected 25.95%. Vote-buying 'thieves' But Sunday's vote is likely to be a lot closer. Several pro-Russian candidates who ran in the first round have thrown their weight behind Stoianoglo, saying Moldova risked being dragged into war and becoming a second Ukraine. During his campaign, Stoianoglo -- who was fired as prosecutor by Sandu -- vowed to wage a 'balanced foreign policy' that would include both the EU and Russia. The 57-year-old boycotted the referendum he denounced as a 'parody,' with the socialists now contesting the results. With Washington warning that Moscow 'will again attempt to prevent Moldovans from exercising their sovereign right to choose their own leaders,' the government has been raising the alarm over 'electoral fraud.' Sandu took to social media to call on Moldovans not to give in to the 'thieves who give you money for votes and trample on your dignity, steal your freedom' and who will 'destroy Moldova for decades to come.' She also appealed to the judiciary to step up the fight against corruption, accusing 'criminal groups' of trying to bribe up to 300,000 voters. 'If you are offered money to vote against a candidate, refuse, otherwise you risk a fine,' loudspeakers warned shoppers in a supermarket in the capital of Chisinau, local media reported. Torn between 'East and West' Fears of Russian meddling have long been looming large. Fugitive oligarch and former politician Ilan Shor is suspected of having funneled almost $40 million from Russia into Moldova since September in a bid to corrupt voters. Convicted in absentia last year for fraud, Shor regularly brands Moldova a 'police state' and the West's 'obedient puppet.' Experts say the economic woes of Moldova -- already one of Europe's poorest countries -- have deepened amid high inflation, with European aid often providing the only lifeline. But four years after Sandu became Moldova's first woman president, the former Soviet republic appears deeply divided. Moldova's large diaspora as well as people living in the capital are mostly in favor of the pro-EU course. On the other hand, some remote villages and the inhabitants of the breakaway region of Transnistria as well as Gagauzia have been traditionally close to Russia. 'Both the East and the West want to drag us to their side,' Maria told AFP on the streets of Chisinau. The 30-year-old, who declined to give her surname, said Moldova should be 'independent' while maintaining 'good relations' with both sides. 'We will lose financial resources and the image our European partners have of us will be damaged' if Sandu does not win, said student Denis Parnao. Kalman Mizsei, an EU adviser to the government, said he is optimistic that 'Moldova's European course is going to continue.' Amid 'the terrible war in Ukraine and the bad news in Georgia, I still want to hope that Moldova will continue to offer a glimpse of hope,' he told journalists earlier this week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldova-faces-decisive-vote-under-shadow-of-russian-interference/7847348.html	2024-11-01T01:35:24-07:00	
North Korea says record test was new Hwasong-19 ICBM	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19, state media said on Friday, amid international uproar over its troops deployed to aid Russia in Ukraine. The launch on Thursday flew higher than any previous North Korean missile, according to the North as well as militaries in South Korea and Japan that tracked its flight deep into space before it splashed down in the ocean between Japan and Russia. State news agency KCNA lauded it as 'the world's strongest strategic missile.' While questions remain over North Korea's ability to guide such a missile and protect a nuclear warhead as it reenters the atmosphere, the Hwasong-19, like North Korea's other latest ICBMs, demonstrated the range to strike nearly anywhere in the United States. 'The new-type ICBM proved before the world that the hegemonic position we have secured in the development and manufacture of nuclear delivery means of the same kind is absolutely irreversible,' North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said while overseeing the launch, KCNA reported. The launch, days before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, drew swift condemnation from Washington and its allies in South Korea, Japan and Europe, as well as the United Nations secretary-general. 'The missile continues to underwrite the growing credibility of North Korea's strategic deterrent capabilities,' said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, adding that Kim appeared specifically interested in communicating that message to the United States. Pyongyang-Moscow ties On Friday, South Korea imposed new sanctions on 11 North Korean individuals and four entities over the ICBM test, naming officials for contributing to missile and nuclear development and channeling illegal foreign funds back to the country. A spokesperson for South Korea's unification ministry, which handles relations with the North, said the launch could have been for several purposes, including demonstrating military technology, pressuring Washington and diverting attention from the issue of sending North Korean troops to Russia. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy blasted what he called his allies' 'zero' response to Russia's deployment of North Korean troops for the war in Ukraine, which has also sparked worries that Moscow could provide sensitive military technology to Pyongyang in return. Russia and North Korea have not denied the troop deployments and have defended their right to help each other. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Pentagon was very early in its assessment phase of the missile launch 'and we don't see any indication at this point that there was Russian involvement.' KCNA said the launch did not affect the safety of neighboring countries and was an appropriate military step in the face of threats from North Korea's enemies. Although Russia may provide some specialists to assist with inspections or modifications, Kim Dong-yup of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul expressed skepticism it would share sensitive technology with Pyongyang. 'Even if some level of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia is possible, they are likely to be very cautious when it comes to core military technologies.' Heavier payloads The Hwasong-19 will deploy alongside the Hwasong-18, which was first launched last year and is also powered by solid fuel, KCNA said. Solid-fuel missiles do not need to be fueled immediately ahead of launch, are often easier and safer to operate and require less logistical support than liquid-fuel weapons. 'It can be stored and moved anywhere, allowing for excellent mobility, stealth and survivability,' said Kim of the University of North Korean Studies. Photos released by KCNA showed a large, multi-stage missile launched from a canister carried by a transporter-erector-launcher vehicle. The agency showed photos from cameras that appeared to be attached to the missile, taking images of stage separations and the Earth. 'The increased length likely means a greater fuel capacity, which directly affects thrust and potentially increases range,' Kim said. But North Korea's existing missiles already had the range to reach anywhere in the United States, and the Hwasong-19's expanded capacity combined with larger payload section is more likely designed to be able to carry heavier, and potentially multiple, nuclear warheads, he said. 'North Korea may continue testing to see if, during the final reentry phase, the warheads can separate and each head toward individual targets,' Kim added. The Hwasong-19 flew of 1,001.2 kilometers for 85 minutes and 56 seconds before landing in the sea off the east coast of the Korean peninsula, with a maximum altitude of 7,687.5 kilometers, KCNA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-says-record-test-was-new-hwasong-19-icbm/7847343.html	2024-11-01T01:16:24-07:00	
Bomb kills 7, mostly schoolchildren, in southwest Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — A bomb blast in southwestern Pakistan early Friday morning killed at least seven people, including five schoolchildren, and injured 17 others. Authorities said that a homemade bomb attached to a motorcycle was detonated in Mustang, a district in the violence-affected Balochistan province, apparently targeting a police patrol near a school. At least one police officer was among the dead, and several others also suffered injuries. The provincial government and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, condemned the violence as a 'terrorist attack.' No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing in Balochistan, renowned for its abundant natural resources, where several ethnic Baloch separatist groups routinely target security force members and government installations. On Tuesday, gunmen attacked workers at the site of a dam in the sparsely populated province’s Panjgur district, killing five and wounding two others. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, claimed responsibility for that attack. Last month, heavily armed assailants stormed a coal mine in another district and massacred 21 coal workers. BLA, listed as a global terrorist organization by the United States, and other allied insurgent groups claim to be fighting for Balochistan’s independence. They have also targeted China-funded projects in the province and Chinese nationals working on them, alleging Beijing is assisting Islamabad in exploiting the region’s resources. Both countries reject the charges and label insurgents as enemies of the development in impoverished Balochistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bomb-kills-7-mostly-schoolchildren-in-southwest-pakistan/7847333.html	2024-11-01T00:54:06-07:00	
Botswana's president concedes defeat in election; ruling party's 58 years in power end	GABORONE, Botswana — Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat in the general election Friday, in a seismic moment of change for the county that ended the ruling party's 58 years in power. Masisi's concession came before final results were announced, with his Botswana Democratic Party trailing in fourth place in the parliamentary elections. The main opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change held a strong lead in the partial results, making its candidate, Duma Boko, the favorite to become president of a southern African country that is one of the world's biggest producers of mined diamonds. Masisi said he had called Boko to inform him he was conceding defeat. 'I concede the election,' Masisi said in an early morning news conference two days after the election. 'I am proud of our democratic processes. Although I wanted a second term, I will respectfully step aside and participate in a smooth transition process.' 'I look forward to attending the coming inauguration and cheering on my successor. He will enjoy my support.' Masisi's BDP dominated politics in Botswana for nearly six decades, since independence from Britain in 1966. The nation of just 2.5 million people will now be governed by another party for the first time in its democratic history. Botswana has been held up as one of Africa's most stable democracies, with its economy largely relying on diamonds. Botswana is the world's second biggest natural diamond producer behind Russia. But the mood for change was evident as a downturn in the global demand for diamonds badly impacted Botswana's economy, with unemployment rising to more than 27% this year as the government saw a sharp decrease in revenue from diamonds. Masisi and his party had faced criticism for not having done enough to diversify the economy. Doko is a 54-year-old lawyer who also contested elections in 2014 and 2019.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-president-concedes-defeat-in-election-ruling-party-s-58-years-in-power-end-/7847324.html	2024-11-01T00:44:00-07:00	
Tropical Storm Kong-rey threatens Shanghai and China's coast	BEIJING — Typhoon Kong-rey weakened to a tropical storm overnight and was forecast to bring heavy rain and high winds to Shanghai and other parts of China's east coast Friday. The storm crossed Taiwan at typhoon strength the previous day, bringing down trees and causing landslides that covered roads and damaged houses. Two people died and more than 500 others were injured. As workers and residents cleared up fallen trees and scattered scaffolding, a ride-hailing driver recounted a harrowing tale of being trapped in his vehicle after a huge tree uprooted and smashed into the passenger compartment Thursday night in Taipei, the capital city. Elsewhere in Taiwan, authorities in the east coast province of Hualien said they had restored contact with a Czech couple feared missing. The two had pitched a tent in Taroko National Park and were in good condition, according to the official Central News Agency. Kong-rey, which is a Cambodian name, was heading northeast along the Chinese coast with winds of 83 kph and could make landfall in Zhejiang province before veering back out to sea, the National Meteorological Center said. The passing storm is expected to affect Shanghai and parts of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, with torrential rain of 10 to 12 centimeters possible in some areas. Zhejiang and neighboring Fujian province suspended multiple ferry routes ahead of the approaching storm. In Taiwan, light rain fell Friday morning in the capital of Taipei, while island-wide, schools and offices had largely reopened and public services were mostly restored. The typhoon passed north of the Philippines earlier in the week, prompting fresh evacuations just days after devastating Tropical Storm Trami killed at least 145 people the previous week. Intense rainfall caused in part by Trami also killed seven people in China's Hainan province as the storm passed by the island, which is known for its beach resorts, off the country's southern coast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-kong-rey-threatens-shanghai-and-china-s-coast/7847317.html	2024-11-01T00:17:08-07:00	
Toxic smog cloaks New Delhi a day after Diwali festival	NEW DELHI — A thick layer of toxic smog cloaked India's capital on Friday as smoke from firecrackers used to celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, pushed air pollution to hazardous levels. New Delhi's air quality index plunged into the 'severe' category, according to SAFAR, India's main environmental monitoring agency. In many areas, levels of deadly particulate matter reached seven times the World Health Organization's safety limit. Authorities in the capital have banned the use and sale of traditional firecrackers since 2017, asking people to opt for environmentally friendly ones or light shows instead, but the rule is often flouted. New Delhi, home to more than 33 million people, is regularly ranked one of the most polluted cities in the world. The air pollution crisis deepens particularly in the winter when the burning of crop residue in neighboring states coincides with cooler temperatures that trap deadly smoke. That smoke travels to New Delhi, leading to a surge in pollution and worsening the public health crisis. Emissions from industries without pollution controls and the use of coal, which produces most of the country's electricity, are also linked to poor air quality in urban areas. 'We may not realize it now, but later we will face lung problems,' said Manoj Kumar, a New Delhi resident who does his morning runs around the capital's iconic India Gate monument. Several studies have estimated that more than a million Indians die each year from air pollution-related diseases. Tiny particulate matter in polluted air can lodge deep in the lungs and cause a variety of major health problems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/toxic-smog-cloaks-new-delhi-a-day-after-diwali-festival/7847314.html	2024-11-01T00:06:15-07:00

Iraq gets new parliament speaker after yearlong deadlock	After nearly a year’s deadlock, Iraq’s parliament elected a new speaker Thursday. Prominent Sunni lawmaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, who served as parliament’s speaker from 2006 to 2009, was elected by 182 of the 269 politicians in attendance. Iraq’s parliament has been without a speaker since last November, following a ruling of the Federal Supreme Court in a case that involved then-speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi, the country’s most powerful Sunni politician, and fellow lawmaker Laith al-Dulaimi, also Sunni. In the lawsuit, Dulaimi claimed Halbousi forged Dulaimi’s signature on a resignation letter, according to an Associated Press report. Halbousi denied the claim. Iraq’s top court’s ruling in the case dismissed both lawmakers from parliament but did not give a reason for the verdict. Iraq’s political landscape operates under a delicate power-sharing system, created to avoid factional conflict. Under the arrangement, the country’s president is always a Kurd, the prime minister is Shite and parliament’s speaker is Sunni. Mashhadani’s selection as speaker was made possible by a Sunni and Shite bloc, according to reports. Under such a fragmented system, the speaker plays a critical role. The speaker is expected to ensure that politicians adhere to proper legislative order. In addition, the speaker is also tasked with resolving conflicts and building consensus among the lawmakers. Mashhadani assumes the speaker position at a critical and fractious time, as the Middle East has erupted in wars and Iraq is seeking to maintain its relationships with several countries, including former adversaries Iran and the U.S. Some information provided by Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraq-gets-new-parliament-speaker-after-yearlong-deadlock/7847278.html	2024-10-31T21:33:59-07:00	
College athletes push for voter turnout while largely avoiding controversy as election nears	Lily Meskers faced an unexpected choice in the lead-up to the first major election she can vote in. The 19-year-old University of Montana sprinter was among college athletes in the state who received an inquiry from Montana Together asking if she was interested in a name, image and likeness deal to support Sen. Jon Tester, a three-term Democrat seeking re-election. The group, which is not affiliated with the Tester campaign, offered from $400 to $2,400 to athletes willing to produce video endorsements. Meskers, who is from Colorado but registered to vote in Montana, decided against the deal because she disagrees with Tester's votes on legislation involving transgender athletes in sports. 'I was like, OK, I believe that this is a political move to try to gain back some voters that he might have lost,' Meskers said. 'And me being a female student-athlete myself, I was not going to give my endorsement to someone who I felt didn't have the same support for me.' Professional athletes such as LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick and Stephen Curry have taken high-profile stances on hot-button topics and political campaigns in recent years, but college athletes are far less outspoken — even if money is available, according to experts in the NIL field. Being outwardly political can reflect on their school or endanger potential endorsement deals from brands that don't want controversy. It can certainly establish a public image for an athlete — for better or for worse — or lead to tensions with teammates and coaches who might not feel the same way. There are examples of political activism by college athletes: A Texas Tech kicker revealed his support for former President Donald Trump on a shirt under his uniform at a game last week and a handful of Nebraska athletes a few days ago teamed up in a campaign ad against an abortion measure on the Tuesday's ballot. Still, such steps are considered rare. 'It can be viewed as risky and there may be people telling them just don't even take that chance because they haven't made it yet,' said Lauren Walsh, who started a sports branding agency 15 years ago. She said there is often too much to lose for themselves, their handlers and in some cases, their families. 'And these individuals still have to figure out what they're going to do with the rest of their lives, even those that do end up getting drafted,' she added. College coaches are not always as reticent. Auburn men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl has used social media to make it clear he does not support Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic opponent in next week's presidential election. Oklahoma State football coach Mike Gundy once caused a stir with a star player for wearing a shirt promoting a far-right news outlet. Blake Lawrence, co-founder of the NIL platform Opendorse, noted that this is the first presidential election in the NIL era, which began in July 2021. He said athletes are flocking to opportunities to help increase voter turnout in the 18-to-24 age demographic, adding that one of his company's partners has had 86 athletes post social media messages encouraging turnout through the first half of the week. He said athletes are shying away from endorsing specific candidates or causes that are considered partisan. 'Student-athletes are, for the most part, still developing their confidence in endorsing any type of product or service,' he said. 'So if they are hesitant to put their weight behind supporting a local restaurant or an e-commerce product, then they are certainly going to be hesitant to use their social channels in a political way.' Giving athletes a voice Many college athletes have opted to focus on drumming up turnout in a non-partisan manner or simply using their platforms to take stands that are not directly political in nature. Some of those efforts can be found in battleground states. A progressive group called NextGen America said it had signed players in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia to encourage voting among young people. Another organization, The Team, said it prepped 27 college athletes in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Michigan to lead volunteer voter participation opportunities for students. The organization also said it got more than 625 coaches to sign a nonpartisan pledge to get their athletes registered to vote. The Team's executive director is Joe Kennedy, a former coach who coordinated championship visits and other sporting events at the White House during President Barack Obama's administration. In early October, it hosted a Zoom event during which panelists such as NCAA President Charlie Baker and WNBA players Nneka Ogwumike and Natasha Cloud gave college athletes advice about using their platforms on campus. In its early days, The Team seized upon momentum from the record turnout seen in the 2020 election. The NCAA that year said Division I athletes could have Election Day off from practice and play to vote. Lisa Kay Solomon, founder of the All Vote No Play campaign, said even if the athletes don't immediately take stands on controversial issues, it's important for them to learn how. 'It is a lot to ask our young people to feel capable and confident on skills they've never had a chance to practice,' Solomon said. 'We have to model what it means to practice taking risks, practice standing up for yourself, practice pausing to think about what are the values that you care about — not what social media is feeding into your brain, but what do you care about and how do you express that? And how do you do it in a way that honors the kind of future that you want to be a part of?' Shut up and play? Two years ago, Tennessee-Martin quarterback Dresser Winn said he would support a candidate in a local district attorney general race in what experts said was very likely the first political NIL deal by a college athlete. There have been very few since. The public criticism and fallout for athletes who speak out on politics or social issue can be sharp. Kaepernick, the Super Bowl-winning quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, hasn't played in an NFL game since January 2017, not long after he began kneeling during the national anthem at games. Meskers, the Montana sprinter, said political endorsements through NIL deals could create problems for athletes and their schools. 'I just think that NIL is going to run into a lot of trouble and a lot of struggles if they continue to let athletes do political endorsements,' she said. 'I just think it's messy. But I stand by NIL as a whole. I think it's really hard as a student athlete to create a financial income and support yourself.' Walsh said it's easier for wealthy and veteran stars like James and Ogwumike to take stands. James, the Los Angeles Lakers star, started More Than a Vote — an organization with a mission to 'educate, energize and protect Black voters' — in 2020. He has passed the leadership to Ogwumike, who just finished her 13th year in the WNBA and also is the president of the Women's National Basketball Players Association. More than a Vote is focused on women's rights and reproductive freedom this year. 'They have very established brands,' Walsh said. 'They know who they are and they know what their political stance is. They know that they have a really strong following that -- there's always going to be haters, but they're also always going to have that strong following of people who listen to everything that they have to say.' Andra Gillespie, an associate professor at Emory University who teaches African American politics, also said it is rare that a college athlete would make a significant impact with a political stand simply because they tend to have a more regional platform than national. Even celebrities like Taylor Swift and Eminem are better at increasing turnout than championing candidates. 'They are certainly very beneficial in helping to drive up turnout among their fans,' Gillespie said. 'The data is less conclusive about whether or not they're persuasive – are they the ones who are going to persuade you to vote for a particular candidate?' Athletes as influencers Still, campaigns know young voters are critical this election cycle, and athletes offer an effective and familiar voice to reach them. Political and social topics are not often broached, but this week six Nebraska athletes — five softball players and a volleyball player — appeared in an ad paid for by the group Protect Women and Children involving two initiatives about abortion laws on Tuesday's ballot. The female athletes backed Initiative 434, which would amend the state constitution to prohibit abortions after the first trimester, with exceptions. Star softball player Jordy Bahl said on social media that the athletes were not paid. A University of Montana spokesperson said two athletes initially agreed to take part in the NIL deal backing Tester. The school said one withdrew and the other declined to be interviewed. For Meskers, deciding against the offer boiled down to Tester twice voting against proposals to bar federal funds from going to schools that allow transgender athletes to play women's sports, a prominent GOP campaign topic. Tester's campaign said the proposals were amendments to government spending packages, and he didn't want to play a role in derailing them as government shutdowns loomed. 'As a former public school teacher and school board member, Jon Tester believes these decisions should be made at the local level,' a Tester spokesperson said. 'He has never voted to allow men to compete against women.' Meskers said she believes using influence as college athletes is good and she is in favor of NIL. She just doesn't think the two should mix specifically for supporting candidates. 'I think especially as student athletes, we do have such a big voice and we do have a platform to use,' she said. 'So I think if you're encouraging people to do their civic duties and get up and go (vote), I think that's a great thing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/college-athletes-push-for-voter-turnout-while-largely-avoiding-controversy-as-election-nears/7847277.html	2024-10-31T21:24:35-07:00	
Ukraine doubles down on psychological campaign against North Korean troops	Washington — As North Korean troops prepare to join Russian forces in the war on Ukraine, Kyiv is stepping up a psychological warfare campaign to target the North Korean soldiers, a high-ranking Ukraine official said. The effort is liable to get a boost from a team of South Korean military observers that Seoul’s defense minister, Kim Yong-hyun, said this week will be going to Ukraine to watch and analyze the North Korean troops on the battlefield. Last week, the Ukrainian military intelligence service-run project 'I Want to Live' released a Korean-language video message on YouTube and X. The project also posted a Korean-language text message on Telegram. The messages urged North Korean soldiers to surrender, arguing that they do not have to 'meaninglessly die on the land of another country.' It also offered to provide food, shelters and medical services. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the Center for Combating Disinformation under Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told VOA Ukrainian on Wednesday that 'in the future, additional videos featuring North Koreans will be published.' 'The North Koreans will undergo training in modern warfare and then be used in actual combat,' Kovalenko said. 'We (the Center for Combating Disinformation) are actively involved in identifying the individuals who have arrived and the units they are joining, as well as gathering evidence of their presence in Russia, their likely participation in combat against the Ukrainian army, and their presence in temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine.' Influence campaign Ukraine has been running similar psychological operations toward the Russian soldiers since the beginning of the Russian invasion, U.S. experts said. 'Ukraine has been doing that with the Russians early on in the war,' Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, told VOA Korean on the phone Thursday. 'They got a lot of Russians to defect, and I suspect they will try to do the same things with the North Koreans.' Bennett added that drones can also be used for sending messages in leaflets and in audio form to North Korean soldiers in the war zone. David Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces colonel who served on the Combined Forces Command of the U.S and South Korea, said this could be 'a great opportunity' to learn how to employ psychological tactics on North Korean forces in the time of war. 'Bombing and gunfire doesn’t happen 24/7,' he told VOA Korean by phone on Wednesday. 'Military operations are also characterized by large amounts of boredom and inactivity, where soldiers are waiting for something to happen, and this is the time when loudspeakers and leaflets can really have an effect, because those messages give them something to think about.' Earlier this week, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed in a phone call 'to intensify the intelligence and expertise exchange' and 'to develop an action strategy and a list of countermeasures,' according to a statement released by the Ukrainian presidential office. Some experts in South Korea said the team of South Korean military observers headed to Ukraine will likely include psychological warfare strategists who can offer advice to the Ukrainian officials. Cho Han-bum, a senior research fellow at the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification, said psychological warfare could be a real threat to the North Korean army. 'In the case of North Korean soldiers, they now have been mobilized for a war without any justification,' he told VOA Korean by phone on Tuesday. 'It is hardly likely that they have a strong will or high morale.' South Korea’s role Cho said the South Korean government can help Ukraine develop psychological tactics against North Korean soldiers, since the country 'has the know-how of a long-term psychological war with North Korea.' Ban Kil-joo is a senior research professor at Korea University’s Ilmin International Relations Institute. He told VOA Korean in a phone interview Tuesday that psychological warfare could help weaken the military cohesiveness between Russia and North Korea. 'The Ukrainians don't know much about North Korea, don’t understand the North Korean culture, as we do,' Ban said. 'We can provide indirect support in a more social sense, rather than military or operational support.' Ban added that it is important for the South Korean team to be 'well-integrated with the Ukrainian forces through its supporting role,' to achieve the desired political and operational effect of a psychological campaign. Other experts, however, are not convinced that psychological warfare will be effective to persuade North Korean soldiers to surrender. Mykola Polishchuk, a Ukrainian author who wrote the book Northern Korea in Simple Words, said Ukraine’s counterpropaganda will not work with North Korean soldiers. 'As for North Koreans, they are not particularly politicized,' Polishchuk told VOA Ukrainian. 'These individuals have little interest in politics.' Robert Rapson, a former charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean that South Korea should carefully make a decision about whether to be engaged in Ukraine’s psychological warfare. 'If the ROK [Republic of Korea] does decide to deploy technical personnel to Ukraine to solely monitor and help advise the Ukraine military on matters related to North Korean troops deployed to the region, they would need to ensure they do not acquire, inadvertently or otherwise, status as combatants,' he said. 'There are, of course, clear risks to ROK personnel whether they’re combatants or not.' Since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has deepened military ties with North Korea. North Korea has exported dozens of ballistic missiles and more than 18,000 containers of munitions and munitions-related material to Russia since the invasion, according to the U.S. State Department. In June, the two countries signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement mandating immediate military assistance if either of them is attacked by a third country.

Bird flu infects 3 more people; number of human cases in US grows to 39	Bird flu has infected three more people from Washington state after they were exposed to poultry that tested positive for the virus, according to health authorities in Washington and in Oregon, where the human cases were identified. A total of 39 people have tested positive for bird flu in the U.S. this year, including nine from Washington, as the virus has infected poultry flocks and spread to more than 400 dairy herds, federal data show. All of the cases were farm workers who had known contact with infected animals, except for one person in Missouri. The people from Washington cleaned facilities at an infected chicken farm after birds were culled to contain the virus, the Washington State Department of Health said in an email on Thursday. Officials tested workers who had symptoms, including red eyes and respiratory issues, and those with potential exposure to the birds, the department said. People with symptoms were told to isolate and given antiviral treatment, it added. Oregon identified the three new cases after the people traveled to the state from Washington while infected, the Oregon Health Authority said in a Thursday statement. They have since returned to Washington, where public health staff are monitoring them, according to the statement. There have been no infections among people living in Oregon and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the Oregon Health Authority said. It said the risk for infection to the general public remains low. Since 2022, the virus has wiped out more than 100 million poultry birds in the nation's worst-ever bird flu outbreak. H5N1 bird flu was confirmed in a pig on a backyard farm in Oregon, the first detection of the virus in swine in the country, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bird-flu-infects-3-more-people-number-of-human-cases-in-us-grows-to-39/7847242.html	2024-10-31T20:05:14-07:00	
Mystery surrounds detention of Wagner Group operative in Chad	A shadowy Russian political operator with close ties to the notorious Wagner Group and its late founder Yevgeny Prigozhin is detained in Chad on unexplained charges, adding a fresh chapter to his long career of mystery and intrigue. Russian officials and state-controlled media maintain that Maxim Shugaley, who was detained on September 19 along with two other Russians, is an innocent sociologist who was in Chad to deliver humanitarian aid and participate in a pro-Russian event in the capital, N'Djamena. But years of reporting on his exploits in countries as far-flung as Afghanistan and Libya present a picture of a master propagandist who has worked behind the scenes to advance the Kremlin's interests with some of the world's least reputable regimes. Shugaley, president of the St. Petersburg-based Foundation for National Values Protection, or FNZC, was arrested at N'Djamena's airport 'without explanation,' according to an account this week in the Russian news agency RIA Novosty. The report quoted the press attache at Russia's mission in Chad saying the three Russians are being well-treated and that she looks forward to their early release. But it offered no explanation of why they were detained and little on why they were there. However the Russian daily Kommersant and a Paris-based weekly Jeune Afrique reported in late September and early October that Chadian military intelligence was behind Shugaley's arrest, and said he was accused of espionage and influence activities on behalf of the Wagner Group. Kommersant said Shugaley maintains his innocence and 'had no knowledge of Wagner activities in N'Djamena' — this despite his reputed role in directing communications and hybrid warfare activities by the Kremlin-financed mercenary, which according to the U.S. State Department plotted to overthrow the government of Chad last year. The Russian newspaper cited people close to Shugaley as saying that the 'sociologist's mission' in Chad was 'strictly humanitarian.' It added that a suitcase in his possession at the time of his arrest 'was full of souvenirs and cookies to be handed over at the pro-Russian rally in N'Djamena.' Citing a source familiar with the case, Central African Republic-based Corbeau news Centrafrique reported that Shugaley and his companions were arrested for trying to 'infiltrate the Chadian security services.' Whatever the truth of those reports, they are not out of character with previous accounts of Shugaley's career and his own postings on Telegram — the Wagner Group's favored messaging app — where he runs his own channel with almost 18,000 subscribers. In 2019, the FNZC organization that Shugaley heads was sanctioned by the U.S. State Department for serving in a covert operation to manipulate African politics in favor of the Kremlin by 'sponsoring phony election monitoring missions,'' and promoting 'disinformation operations.' The Wall Street Journal profiled Shugaley in 2021 as a 'spy' and a 'shadowy figure' pursuing the Kremlin's strategic goals across Africa. His latest post on Telegram, dated August 23, laments the death of Prigozhin, killed in a suspicious helicopter crash a year earlier. Shugaley calls the Wagner founder a 'Russian hero' who is 'very much needed now in the Kursk Oblast.' The post coincided with Ukraine's military intrusion into Russia's Kursk region. In earlier posts dating back to May of this year, Shugaley reported he was in Chad to observe the presidential elections, which he describes as successful, 'despite the U.S. destabilizing efforts.' In June, Shugaley said in a Telegram post that he was in Chad 'for the second time in less than two months' to prepare the introduction of a Russian House in N'Djamena, which he said was a 'natural development' given the Chadians 'anti-French sentiments and mistrust of the U.S. actions in the region.' In April 2023, The Washington Post reported that leaked U.S. intelligence documents showed the Wagner Group was trying to recruit 'Chadian rebels and establish a training site for 300 fighters in the neighboring Central African Republic as part of an evolving plot to topple the Chadian government.'' The European Union sanctioned Shugaley in February 2023 for operating 'as the public relations arm' of the Wagner Group. Shugaley's role 'includes directing propaganda and disinformation campaigns in favor of the Wagner Group, particularly to improve the reputation of Wagner and support its deployment, as well as interfering in a covert manner on behalf of the Wagner group in the various countries where the group is active,' the EU said. In May 2019, Shugaley and his interpreter Samer Sueifan were jailed for 18 months in Libya on charges of espionage and election interference. Libyan officials said the mission of the two was to 'recruit Libyans to gather information and to train them on how to influence any future Libyan elections.'' Shugaley credited Prigozhin for his freedom in interviews with Russian media and in social media posts, saying that under his order, Wagner troops stormed the prison in Tripoli in December 2020 to free him. Prigozhin later commissioned an action movie lauding Shugaley and Wagner. His company, Concord, paid a $250,000 bonus to Shugaley and Sueifan. Shugaley is a common figure in Central Africa Republic, a territory where Wagner mercenaries have been deeply embedded in the security system since 2018. In February, the U.S. State Department issued a report titled, 'The Wagner Group Atrocities in Africa: Lies and Truth,' which documented violations committed by the group in CAR, Libya, Sudan, and Mali. The State Department said, 'In CAR, Wagner forces used indiscriminate killing, abductions, and rape to gain control of a key mining area near the city of Bambari, with survivors describing the attacks in detail.' A BBC documentary in 2019 reported that 'at least six candidates were offered money by Russians in the lead-up to the 2018 presidential elections in Madagascar.' The BBC reported that Shugaley was among those 'offering money' to various actors to sway the votes in favor of a Kremlin-backed candidate. According to the Geneva-based Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, after the death of Prigozhin, Shugaley partnered with the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was released from a U.S. jail in 2022 in a prisoner swap for the American basketball star Brittney Griner. The group said Shugaley assisted Bout in winning a seat in the regional assembly of the city of Ulyanovsk in September 2023 as part of an ultra-nationalist party. ''In updates posted on the Telegram channel, Shugaley has reported on discussing plans with Bout to export military utility vehicles and aircraft to Africa,' the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mystery-intrigue-surround-detention-of-wagner-group-operative-in-chad-/7847204.html	2024-10-31T20:02:25-07:00

N. Korea boasts about new long-range missile, calls it 'world's strongest'	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Friday bragged about its recently tested new intercontinental ballistic missile, calling it 'the world's strongest.' Outside experts saw the claim as propaganda, though the test did show advancement in the North's quest to build a more reliable weapons arsenal. A missile that North Korea launched Thursday flew higher and stayed in the air longer than any other weapon the country has so far fired. It signaled that the North has achieved progress in acquiring a nuclear-armed ICBM that can hit the U.S. mainland. But foreign experts said the country has still a few technological issues to master. On Friday, the North's Korean Central News Agency identified the missile as the 'Hwasong-19' ICBM and called it 'the world's strongest strategic missile' and 'the perfected weapon system.' KCNA said leader Kim Jong Un observed the launch, describing it as 'an appropriate military action' to express North Korea's resolve to respond to its enemies' moves that escalated tensions and threats to North Korea's national security. It said Kim thanked weapons scientists for demonstrating North Korea's 'matchless strategic nuclear attack capability.' South Korea's military earlier said that North Korea could have tested a solid-fuel missile, but Friday's KCNA dispatch didn't say what propellant the Hwasong-19 ICBM uses. Observers said the color of exhaust flames seen in North Korean media photos of the launch suggested the new ICBM uses solid fuels. Before Thursday's test, North Korea's most advanced ICBM was known as the Hwasong-18 missile, which uses solid fuels. Pre-loaded solid propellants make it easier to move missiles and require much less launch preparation times than liquid propellants that must be fueled before liftoffs. So it's more difficult for opponents to detect launches by solid-fuel missiles. In recent years, North Korea has reported steady advancement in its efforts to obtain nuclear-tipped missiles. Many foreign experts believe North Korea likely has missiles that can deliver nuclear strikes on all of South Korea, but it has yet to possess nuclear missiles that can travel to the mainland U.S. There are questions about whether North Korea has acquired the technology to shield warheads from the high-temperature, high-stress environment of atmospheric reentry. Many foreign analysts say North Korea also must improve altitude control and guidance systems for missiles. They say North Korea needs the ability to place multiple warheads on a single missile to defeat its rivals' missile defenses. All of North Korea's known ICBM tests, including Thursday's, have been performed at steep angles to avoid neighboring countries. South Korean military spokesperson Lee Sung Joon said Thursday that a high-angle trajectory launch cannot verify a missile's re-entry vehicle technology, though North Korea has previously claimed to have acquired that technology. Observers say that Thursday's launch, the North's first ICBM test in almost a year, was largely meant to grab American attention days before the U.S. presidential election and respond to international condemnation of North Korea's reported dispatch of troops to Russia to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. North Korea's reported troop dispatch highlights the expanding military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. South Korea. the U.S. and others worry North Korea might seek high-tech, sensitive Russian technology to perfect its nuclear and missile programs in return for joining the Russia-Ukraine war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/n-korea-boasts-about-new-long-range-missile-calls-it-world-s-strongest-/7847221.html	2024-10-31T18:55:25-07:00

Trump sues US television network for $10 billion over Harris interview	washington — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sued CBS News on Thursday over an interview of Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on the network's '60 Minutes' news program this month. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Northern District of Texas, alleged that the network aired two different responses from Harris responding to a question about the Israel-Hamas war. The version that aired during the '60 Minutes' program on October 6 did not include what the lawsuit referred to as a 'word salad' response from Harris about the Biden administration's influence on Israel's conduct of the war. The lawsuit follows Trump's threats to revoke CBS's broadcasting license if elected. Trump's campaign and office did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment. The suit called for a jury trial and about $10 billion in damages, the filing showed. It alleges violations of a Texas law that prohibits deceptive acts in the conduct of business. A CBS News spokesperson told VOA that 'Trump's repeated claims against 60 Minutes are false' and that the interview was not doctored. '60 MINUTES fairly presented' the interview 'to inform the viewing audience, and not to mislead it,' the spokesperson said in an email. 'The lawsuit Trump has brought today against CBS is completely without merit and we will vigorously defend against it.' In a statement earlier this month, CBS said '60 Minutes' gave an excerpt of the Harris interview to 'Face the Nation' that used a longer section of her answer than what was aired on '60 Minutes.' 'Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response,' the statement said. 'The portion of her answer on '60 Minutes' was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide-ranging, 21-minute-long segment.' And in a letter to Trump's legal counsel earlier this month, CBS said Trump has no legal basis to sue over the interview, CNN reported. Trump had also agreed to give an interview to '60 Minutes' before ultimately backing out. Clayton Weimers, the head of the U.S. office of Reporters Without Borders, dismissed the lawsuit as a publicity stunt. 'The lawsuit itself looks like a publicity stunt, but it reinforces the very real threats that Trump has issued to use the U.S. government to punish media outlets he doesn't like should he regain the White House,' Weimers told VOA. Some information for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-sues-us-television-network-for-10-billion-over-harris-interview-/7847189.html	2024-10-31T18:00:44-07:00	
Junta airstrikes lay waste to civilian lives in Myanmar's Karenni State	Paekon Township, Myanmar / WASHINGTON — In a crowded church filled with mourners on September 6, a young high school teacher sat among friends, her face streaked with tears as she gazed at the makeshift shrouds covering the small bodies laid out before her. Among them were her students — children she had taught, known and cared for deeply. 'I couldn't recognize some of them,' she whispered to me, her voice trembling. The previous night, the war refugee camp where she lives in Myanmar's Paekon Township, near the Karenni and Shan state borders, had been transformed into a scene of unimaginable loss. The ruling junta had dropped two 500-pound bombs on the camp, killing 10 people, seven of them children. The attack unfolded just before 9 p.m. local time, as families were settling in for the night. The ominous hum of a military plane filled the air, circling over the camp. Shouts of 'Run! Run!' echoed as people scrambled for safety, but there was barely time to react. The teacher described the chaos, recounting how, on its second pass, the plane released a bomb that tore through makeshift shelters filled with families. 'The children were covered in blood, wandering aimlessly in the dark,' she said, her voice heavy with grief. 'Some were hit directly — only their small hands were visible. It was horrific.' On the ground, scattered amid the rubble, lay textbooks and notebooks filled with the handwriting of the students — evidence of lives interrupted and dreams shattered. Pages written by those young hands lay torn and trampled, a haunting reminder of the futures lost in the blast. Throughout the night, Karenni Armed Revolutionary Forces and camp officials worked tirelessly to rescue survivors and tend to the wounded, but the losses were devastating. In the dim light of the following morning, the teacher's sorrow echoed through the crowd of mourners, each bearing the weight of lives cut short. 'There is no safe place, no demilitarized zone,' she told me. 'We cannot live like this, in constant fear.' State symbolizes hope Karenni State, known as Kayah, a beautiful mountainous region in eastern Myanmar, has become a powerful symbol of resistance and resilience in the country's fight for democracy and federalism. Nestled along the border with Thailand, Karenni is home to a diverse ethnic community with a distinct cultural heritage. Decades of conflict with Myanmar's military regimes, beginning with Karenni's fight for independence in 1957, have left the region deeply scarred. Yet its people push forward, determined to build a self-governing future and protect their land. Reaching Karenni involved a challenging three-week journey, crossing from Thailand along rugged mountain roads while carefully avoiding junta outposts. Travel was only possible in areas controlled by Karenni resistance forces, who provided protection along the way. Eventually, I reached Demoso, a town about 138 miles from Naypyidaw, the junta's military-built capital. In Demoso, where electricity is rare, residents depend on generators and Starlink for internet, though outages are frequent. Artillery fire and airstrikes echo through the hills, a constant reminder of the relentless conflict gripping the region. Despite these challenges, local leaders have forged ahead with efforts to establish a self-governing administration, train young resistance fighters and rebuild communities. Their successes have made them a model for other ethnic states in Myanmar striving for a future grounded in democracy and federalism. 'Feels like retaliation' The day after the airstrike, survivors and community members gathered at a Catholic cathedral about a 20-minute drive from the refugee camp to mourn the 10 lives lost in the junta's assault. Inside the church, the bodies of six children lay surrounded by grieving friends and neighbors; outside, makeshift graves marked the final resting places of others who had perished in the attack. The crowd gathered in silence, their faces clouded with sorrow as they paid their last respects. A Catholic priest who also volunteers as a health worker voiced his suspicions about the timing of the bombing. 'The junta's soldiers are dying in battles at the front. Just days ago, their chairman, Min Aung Hlaing, visited Loikaw and was fired upon,' he said. 'This [bombing] feels like retaliation against innocent refugees who had no way to defend themselves,' he said, his voice filled with quiet anger. 'No time to run' As I spoke with the survivors, their tragic stories weighed on me. I met a 14-year-old girl with severe injuries to her face and thigh when I visited a makeshift hospital whose exact location cannot be disclosed for security reasons. Her younger brother, just 2 years old, had been hit in the head and could not be saved. 'We were all sitting in our tent. I heard the plane but had no time to run,' she said. Two sisters, both young students, lay nearby with broken bones and deep wounds. Their parents had sent them to the camp to protect them from the fighting. I spoke to another seriously injured patient, the wife of a police officer who was injured in an earlier bombing that same morning. Her husband, standing next to her, told me, 'They dropped two bombs on the building, then opened fire with machine guns. My wife is four months pregnant, and we lost the baby.' Junta denies responsibility At Dosei Middle School, located west of Demoso, the principal described to me the devastating attack on February 5 that leveled all three of the school's buildings. 'The school, once filled with the lively shouts of students, fell silent within minutes as the sound of an approaching plane grew louder,' she recounted. 'The roar of bombs exploding was quickly followed by the rattle of machine gunfire, leaving the classroom lifeless — the last refuge of four middle school students. There was no time to reach a bomb shelter.' She added, 'The elementary school children were incredibly lucky — they were outside for physical activities when the junta's jet dropped bombs on the other side of the building. Otherwise, every child, including my youngest daughter, who studies here, would have been buried beneath the rubble.' The junta consistently denies responsibility for civilian deaths caused by airstrikes in Karenni. Following the jet attack on February 5, the junta's information team stated, 'There were no Tatmadaw [Myanmar army] flights in Demoso Township on that day.' Since the military seized power on February 1, 2021, Karenni State has become a battlefield, with civilians trapped between junta forces and Karenni resistance fighters. Just one day before the September 5 airstrike, General Min Aung Hlaing arrived in Loikaw to meet with his troops. In response, the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force fired artillery toward Loikaw. The following night, junta forces shelled northern areas of Demoso, forcing families to flee again. Pleas for protection Throughout Karenni State, survivors echo the same plea — a desperate call for protection from relentless airstrikes and shelling. The Interim Executive Council of Karenni State, or IEC, condemned the bombing as 'unprovoked violence' targeting civilians, including children. At the site of the attack, the head of the Interior Department of the IEC expressed his outrage: 'I absolutely condemn this. It's pure bullying — a brutal act of violence that I cannot accept. This is Karenni territory, where our people live and work. The damage is not only to property but to lives.' The principal of Dosei Middle School also made a heartfelt appeal for action by the international community, including a halt to the sale of jet fuel to the junta and for stronger international pressure to stop the use of airstrikes against civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/junta-airstrikes-lay-waste-to-civilian-lives-in-myanmar-s-karenni-state/7846878.html	2024-10-31T17:39:26-07:00	
Chinese student convicted in US returned to China	washington — Xiaolei Wu, a Chinese student who had been serving a nine-month prison sentence for threatening pro-democracy activists in Boston, received an early release on September 16 and returned to China, according to federal documents obtained by VOA’s Mandarin Service. U.S. and Chinese officials have not commented publicly on Wu and whether he may have been part of a prisoner swap, but his return to China came about the time that American pastor David Lin was released and returned to the United States after serving 18 years in prison. Documents from the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts and the U.S. Justice Department confirm Wu's release and that President Joe Biden signed a clemency document on September 12, reducing Wu's total sentence to time served, saying that it was in the 'national interest' of the United States for him not to serve his full sentence. The pardon document states that Wu began serving his sentence on June 7. The conditions for the commutation said Wu must leave the United States and never again set foot on U.S. soil and territories, and that he must not commit any crimes against the U.S. or violate U.S. laws again. Wu, a former student of Berklee College of Music, was found guilty in January of stalking and threatening a pro-democracy activist in Boston in fall 2022. On April 24, Wu was sentenced to nine months in prison and three years of supervised release. Prosecutors said Wu, 26, threatened to chop off the hands of a Chinese pro-democracy activist known as 'Zooey,' a pseudonym that the Berklee student has used to avoid retaliation. Wu threatened to report Zooey’s family to Chinese police and asked others to find out where she lived. He also published Zooey’s email address. Two of Zooey's friends told VOA Mandarin on Wednesday that Zooey learned from prosecutors in September that Wu had been released and reciprocally exchanged for Lin. The two friends, who requested anonymity, citing security concerns, said Zooey was shocked and puzzled by this and worried about her safety. One of Zooey's friends said he received a threatening message from Wu on Instagram a few days ago. The message said: 'Do you really think that I won't be able to find you if you wear a mask and change your voice on Voice of America?' Another friend said that Wu recently posted a video of himself playing guitar on WeChat, China’s biggest social media platform. The location indicated it was published in Beijing. Zhou Fengsuo, a former student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement in China and co-founder of the NGO Humanitarian China, told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview that while Wu had gotten off easy, his case may serve as a deterrent against future similar cases. 'This is a very important case. We have observed that the Chinese pro-CCP nationalists have been restrained a lot on American campuses,' Zhou said. 'I have participated in activities in many American universities this year and have not encountered any of these people. I believe this has a lot to do with Wu’s conviction. Of course, his early release is not the result we want to see.' Zhou also said that if Wu's release is indeed part of an exchange for David Lin, it could mean that Wu has certain connections in China. He also told VOA Mandarin the swap is still beneficial. 'Pastor David Lin was detained in China for a very long time, so it is still very precious to exchange for his return,' Zhou said. VOA was unable to independently confirm whether Wu's early release was directly related to the release of Lin. VOA contacted the U.S. State Department and the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's Office in charge of Wu's case but has yet to receive a response. The White House declined to comment to VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-student-convicted-in-us-returned-to-china-/7846888.html	2024-10-31T17:20:05-07:00	
Germany closes 3 Iranian consulates following Iran's execution of German Iranian national	Germany will close three Iranian consulates in response to Iran’s announcement of the execution of Jamshid Sharmahd, a German Iranian national and a U.S. resident, earlier this week. 'We have repeatedly and unequivocally made it clear to Tehran that the execution of a German citizen will have serious consequences,' German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Thursday in announcing the closure of the consulates in Frankfurt, Munich and Hamburg. Germany will allow Iran’s embassy in Berlin to remain open. And Germany will 'continue to maintain our diplomatic channels and our embassy in Tehran,' Baerbock said. 'The fact that this assassination took place in the light of the latest developments in the Middle East shows that [Iran's] dictatorial, unjust regime ... does not act according to normal diplomatic logic,' she said. 'It is not without reason that our diplomatic relations are already at an all-time low.' Sharmahd, 69, was accused of a role in the deadly bombing of a mosque in Shiraz in 2008. He was convicted of the capital offense of 'corruption on Earth,' a term Iranian authorities use to refer to a broad range of offenses, including those related to Islamic morals. His family has denied the charges against him. In an exclusive interview with VOA’s Persian Service, Sharmahd’s daughter Ghazaleh Sharmahd warned that her father's execution on Monday would not silence the movement for justice. 'They made a huge mistake, thinking that by killing my father and the people of Iran, these movements would end. But they were wrong — killing only makes these movements stronger, more intense and more energized. ... The Islamic Republic made a huge mistake,' she said. Ghazaleh Sharmahd also said she is seeking the truth of her father’s death. She told VOA that the Islamic Republic informed the U.S. and Germany about her father’s death. 'They accept the words of terrorists and send me their condolences?' she said. 'They have a duty to investigate what really happened.' VOA’s Persian Service contributed to this report.

Turkish winemaking booms in face of Islamist policies	Turkey is seeing a boom in winemaking, with hundreds of new producers emerging over the last few years. The trend runs counter the Islamist, conservative policies of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that have included restrictions and taxes on alcohol.

Russia fines Google $20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000	Russia has fined Google an amount larger than the entire world's gross domestic product over restricting Russian propaganda channels on YouTube. Russian business newspaper RBC reported this week that legal claims brought by 17 Russian TV channels against Google in Russian courts, which have imposed compound fines on Google, had reached $20 decillion — an incomprehensible sum with 34 zeros. By comparison, the International Monetary Fund estimates the world's total gross domestic product to be $110 trillion. Google's parent company Alphabet, meanwhile, has a market value of around $2 trillion. On Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov admitted to reporters that he 'can't even pronounce this figure right.' But he said the fine was 'filled with symbolism.' 'Google should not restrict the activities of our broadcasters, and Google is doing this,' he said. The Russian state-run outlet Tass reported this week that a Russian court had previously ordered Google to restore the blocked YouTube channels or face rising charges. The fine has grown so high because it doubles every week. Earlier this year, Russia experienced a mass YouTube outage in August. The platform is considered one of the few remaining sites where audiences can access independent information in Russia, where Moscow blocks independent news sites and press freedom has all but disappeared. Google did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment.

US: 8,000 N. Korean troops expected to join Ukraine fight 'in coming days'	state department — Most of the North Korean troops sent to Russia are now deployed near the Ukrainian border and are expected to join the fight against Ukraine 'in the coming days,' according to top U.S. and South Korean diplomats and military officials. 'We now assess that there are some 10,000 North Korean soldiers in total in Russia, and the most recent information indicates that as many as 8,000 of those North Korean forces have been deployed to the Kursk region,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin co-hosted South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun in Washington on Thursday to discuss pressing security threats as they closely monitor North Korea's deployment of thousands of troops to Russia. 'Our assessment is that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's forces have trained these North Korean soldiers in artillery operations, UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] operations and basic infantry operations,' Austin said during a joint press conference. He also noted that Putin has provided the North Korean troops with Russian 'uniforms and equipment,' and 'all of that strongly indicates that Russia intends to use these foreign forces in front-line operations in its war of choice against Ukraine,' Austin added. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, over half a million Russian troops have been killed or wounded, according to U.S. officials. Facing an estimated 1,200 casualties daily, Russia is now turning to North Korea, a pariah state, to bolster its forces. While Russia has used foreign volunteers and mercenaries in the Ukraine war, the current deployment marks the first time in 100 years that Russia has invited regular forces of another nation onto its soil. Should these North Korean troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets, U.S. officials said. In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is in talks with North Korea to deploy a 'large number of civilians' to work at Russian weapons production facilities. Zelenskyy said he plans to discuss air defense assistance with South Korea. Western nations have also expressed concerns about what North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime will get in return from Moscow for its troops. North Korea is under international sanctions for its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs. No evidence of Russian technology Earlier Thursday, North Korea test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time in nearly a year, demonstrating a potential advancement in its ability to launch long-range nuclear attacks on the mainland U.S. It prompted swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States, which accused Pyongyang of raising tensions and risking the destabilization of regional security. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated through a spokesperson that North Korea's missile launches using ballistic technology violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. South Korea announced it would impose new sanctions on North Korea, including export controls on materials essential for producing solid-fuel missiles. 'It’s very early in our assessment phase, and we don't see any indication at this point that there was Russian involvement,' said Austin. Meanwhile, visiting South Korean officials in Washington noted that, although they cannot confirm Russian technical support in North Korea's latest ICBM launch, they remain concerned about the potential transfer of technology and arms from Russia to North Korea. Through a translator, Foreign Minister Cho told reporters, 'We also need to watch what kind of quid pro quo the DPRK will receive from Russia' before deciding on weapons support to Ukraine. 'Currently, we're not in a position to share the specifics,' he added. Cho was referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. The South Korean government indicated it would consider sending 'weapons for defense and attack' and may also dispatch military and intelligence personnel to Ukraine to analyze North Korean battlefield tactics and assist in interrogations of captured North Koreans. U.S. officials said additional security assistance for Ukraine will be announced soon, with continued support from over 50 countries to strengthen Ukraine's defense in the coming months. China’s silence Washington and Seoul also urged Beijing to use its influence over Pyongyang to curb North Korea’s provocative activities. This week, senior U.S. officials engaged in 'a robust conversation' with Chinese officials, according to Blinken. He voiced alarm about Russia's possible efforts to strengthen North Korea's military capabilities, which 'should be a real concern to China because it's profoundly destabilizing in the region.' Through a translator, Defense Minister Kim told reporters, 'China still continues to be silent,' noting that a clearer assessment is that Beijing is watching and waiting. However, if the situation worsens, China may intervene, either as a mediator or in some other capacity. 'There will be a point where the interests of China will be violated, and it is at that point that China will begin to play a certain role,' Kim added. Domestic instability Some experts suggest that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is facing domestic instability. Although he has managed to alleviate some of these issues by securing money and food from Russia through the sale of munitions, his dwindling stockpiles have led him to shift to selling soldiers as a new source of revenue. 'The Russians are running 1,200 casualties a day in their fight in Ukraine,' said Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation. 'If they use the North Koreans the same way — likely they will — there are going to be massive casualties in the North Korean forces.' 'This is a really dire development for the [North Korean] families whose kids have been sent to Ukraine. There could be some real instability that's generated by his action,' Bennett told VOA.

Thousands of passenger flight signals jammed over war zones in Ukraine, Middle East	The navigation systems of thousands of passenger aircraft are being disrupted every day as they fly close to conflict zones, according to researchers, who warn that the blocking or spoofing technology could one day put lives at risk. There has been a big increase over the past two years in the use of electronic warfare technology, which is frequently used to disrupt drones or missiles that use global positioning system or other satellite navigation technology to home in on their targets. However, the blocking or spoofing of GPS signals also affects commercial aircraft, explained Raphael Monstein, a research associate at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. 'Spoofing is when an actor sends out malicious signals to all the receivers that are in the coverage area. And it tricks the receiver into believing that it is in a different position than it actually is. And particularly in aviation, that has quite some consequences, which can be quite negative,' he told VOA. 'It has a lot of side effects in the cockpit, and they can range from spurious warnings — obviously the loss of situational awareness because you're not quite sure when your GPS indicates you're somewhere else. You can have very different reactions of the aircraft, depending a bit on the aircraft type,' Monstein said. Conflict zones Monstein and his team in Zurich track GPS interference of civilian aircraft in real time and publish it on an online map. They have detected a big increase in such incidents since the beginning of the year. 'And they are mainly around conflict zones. One of them would be the Middle East. One would be the Black Sea and around Russia,' he said. 'We talk about on an average day about 1,000 aircraft at least being affected by that. And that is a very big scale. That is novel. We haven't seen that kind of [interference] anywhere in the world so far.' Commercial aircraft The disruption isn’t only happening above war zones. In April, Finnair, Finland’s national carrier, suspended flights to Tartu in eastern Estonia near Russia after GPS disruptions prevented two aircraft from landing at the airport. Finnair resumed the flights in June after the airport installed navigation systems that do not rely on GPS. Experts say most airports have such alternative equipment already installed. Finnair previously reported similar problems when flying close to the Finland-Russia border and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The interference began in 2022, the year Finland applied to join NATO, after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of that year. At the time, Estonia’s defense minister said it was a deliberate Russian tactic. 'We all understand that these hybrid attacks are still very acute. We have to be ready also for these,' Hanno Pevkur told reporters on May 15. Russia denies seeking to disrupt GPS signals of commercial aircraft. Passenger dangers How dangerous is GPS disruption for air travelers? 'It's not that an aircraft is going to fall out of the sky because it loses its GPS signal,' Monstein explained. 'There are a lot of systems in aviation that were built in for a reason, and one of them is, for example, the ground proximity warning system. And if you have to deselect that one because it gives you spurious warnings, it chips away on the safety margins, and that is not good. And in the long run, there can be a high risk for something to happen,' he added. GPS blocking and spoofing also affects navigation systems on the ground. Residents of Moscow have recently complained of malfunctioning smartphone applications, such as map, taxi-hailing or food delivery apps. Experts have linked the disruption to Russian attempts to defend against Ukrainian drone attacks. Moscow has not commented on the issue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-of-passenger-flight-signals-jammed-over-war-zones-in-ukraine-middle-east-/7846589.html	2024-10-31T15:07:24-07:00

Anti-China sentiment said to be growing in Myanmar	bangkok — A recent attack on a Chinese consulate in Myanmar reflects growing anti-Chinese sentiment in the country fed by Beijing's support of the ruling junta, experts say. On October 18, the Chinese consulate in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, was struck by a small explosive device. Reports say the building was damaged but there were no casualties. It was the first attack was on a Chinese diplomatic facility in Myanmar since anti-China riots in Yangon in 1967. In a statement to journalists, the nation's military authorities said the blast damaged tiles on the roof of the two-story building and that they were seeking to identify and arrest the 'terrorists' who were responsible. Two weeks later, no one has been caught and no group has claimed responsibility, but anti-China sentiment exists, experts say. Ye Myo Hein, a visiting senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace and global fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington, said strong anti-China sentiment has been brewing since Myanmar's military seized power on February 1, 2021. 'Immediately following the coup, the public perceived China as supportive of the junta, resulting in strong anti-Chinese sentiment among the general population,' he told VOA. Anti-Chinese sentiment grows Myanmar has been in chaos since General Min Aung Hlaing and his military forces overthrew the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Backers of the ousted government have joined forces with various ethnic armies to resist the junta's rule. China distanced itself from the junta for a time, but recently renewed its support. When it did, Ye Myo Hein said, anti-Chinese sentiment began to rise again. 'It is difficult to determine who was responsible for the attacks on the Chinese consulate, but if China continues its pro-junta stance, it will likely face growing public animosity,' he said. The military has been sanctioned and condemned by the U.S. and Western countries, but it has retained some support from countries such as China and Russia. 'Whoever was behind the consulate bombing, it suggests that there are multiple strands of anti-Chinese anger, against the support for the regime and against the perceived support of China for the Kokang occupation of Lashio,' David Scott Mathieson, an independent analyst with more than two decades of experience focusing on Myanmar, told VOA. Kokang, which is in northern Myanmar's Shan State, sits on the border with China. It is home to 90% ethnic Chinese and is an important trade route between the two countries. In the past year, three allied pro-democracy ethnic groups have captured the city from Myanmar military forces. Beijing negotiated a cease-fire between the allied brotherhood and the junta in January but it was short-lived. China did succeed in getting the ethnic groups to assist in a crackdown on Chinese crime rings in northern Shan state that had been targeting Chinese citizens with online scams. China now appears to be backing both sides of the conflict. But with rebel forces capturing more territory over the past year, Beijing is showing its concern over the rapid deterioration of the junta's position. In late July, after ethnic groups captured Lashio, a town in the northeast, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyitaw. China also recently closed its borderlands and key trade routes under the control of Myanmar's rebel groups, Reuters reported. One Chinese national who lives in Myanmar told VOA's Mandarin Service that he believes the consulate attack was not a terrorist incident, but an expression of dissatisfaction with China. He added that since the coup, there have been protests against China's government in various parts of Myanmar. In March 2021, several Chinese factories in Myanmar were burned and destroyed during mass protests against the coup. 'China has to take this rising public anger very seriously, as it could potentially descend into violence in urban areas and against Chinese nationals and economic assets, but also Myanmar-Chinese communities as well,' Mathieson told VOA this week. 'Has Beijing really thought through all these dilemmas? Or is its cynically arrogant support for the SAC at such levels the Chinese leadership don't care about consequences?' The SAC is short for the State Administration Council, a reference to the junta. History of supporting military Over the last three decades, Beijing has supplied the Myanmar military with major arms. The military has used those arms to crush those opposing their rule, with nearly 6,000 people killed, according to rights groups. China is also Myanmar's biggest trade partner and has invested billions into the country's oil and gas sector. 'Since the junta is widely despised, Beijing's support for it will almost certainly fuel anti-Chinese sentiment,' Ye Myo Hein said. Nevertheless, diplomacy is continuing between the two regimes, as Myanmar junta boss Min Aung Hlaing is expected to pay a return visit to China in November.

UN warns global hunger hot spots growing	new york — A new U.N. report warned Thursday that conflict, climate and economic stress are driving severe hunger and in some cases famine conditions, in 22 countries and territories, with no likelihood for improvement in the next six months. 'So, you have conflict impacts, climate impacts in the same countries, as well as both the combination of the two turns into economic devastation for people,' Arif Husain, chief economist of the World Food Program, said of the main drivers of the hunger crises to reporters in a video briefing. The situation is most severe in the Gaza Strip, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali, where millions of people are in the highest levels of food insecurity, meaning famine, risk of famine or starvation are happening. In Gaza, U.N. food agencies have been warning about the critical situation for months. It is fueled by the nearly 13-month war between Israel and Hamas, which has made it dangerous and difficult for humanitarians to get food and other assistance to about 2 million Palestinians trapped in the crossfire. WFP’s Husain said 91% of Gazans are at crisis levels or worse for hunger, with about 345,000 of them in faminelike conditions. 'And the report says basically that there is a risk — there's a persistent risk — of famine for the entire Gaza Strip,' Husain said. The situation in Sudan is even worse because the numbers of people are dramatically higher. 'Time is running out to save lives,' Rein Paulsen, director of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Office of Emergencies and Resilience, told reporters of Sudan. 'People are facing total collapse of livelihoods and starvation in areas where conflict is hitting the hardest across the country, including in Darfur, in Jazira, in Khartoum and in Kordofan,' he said. Paulsen noted that famine levels of food insecurity were reported two months ago in the Zamzam camp in North Darfur, where several hundred thousand internally displaced people are sheltering. Fighting has escalated in recent months in that region between the army and a rival paramilitary group. 'And those famine conditions are likely — highly likely — to persist unless something changes,' he said. In the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is in the grip of a serious hunger crisis because of the rampant violence from armed gangs whose kidnappings, killings, rapes and looting have left Haitians in the capital and some outlying areas afraid to leave their homes. Two million people do not have enough to eat, and about 6,000 of them are experiencing famine levels of food insecurity, Paulsen said. 'Immediate action is imperative to save lives, to prevent starvation, and to help vulnerable populations restore their livelihoods amidst unprecedented violence and displacement,' he added. In Africa, Mali and South Sudan are also at the top of the list of hunger hot spots. WFP’s Husain said about 2,500 people are at catastrophic or famine levels of hunger in Mali and another 121,000 are right behind them. In South Sudan, affected by the war in Sudan and severe flooding, the number of people facing starvation and death was projected in the report to nearly double between April and July to 2.3 million, compared with the same period in 2023. Hunger is expected to worsen when the next lean season begins in May. A step behind these most affected countries are those of 'very high concern' for humanitarians, including Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen. 'These are classified and categorized in this context where we have a high number of people facing particular acute food insecurity, and where we also see drivers that are expected to further intensify life-threatening conditions in the coming months,' Paulsen said. Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia and Niger are new to the list of hunger hot spots this year, joining Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe to round out the list. WFP’s Husain said humanitarians need both resources and safe access to assist the millions of people in need to bring the high rates of hunger and malnutrition down.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-global-hunger-hot-spots-growing/7846797.html	2024-10-31T14:35:03-07:00	
Residents in Ethiopia’s Oromia region report network disruptions as government forces fight rebels	ADAMA, ETHIOPIA — Residents in Ethiopia’s Oromia region say access to phone communication and internet service has been disrupted for months as government forces fight against two rebel groups. The disruption of mobile phone calls and internet data has been concentrated in conflict-hit Oromia zones, where government forces have engaged in fighting against the Oromo Liberation Army, or the OLA. A resident from South Oromia of Guji Zone Wadera Wereda, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity for safety reasons, said phone and internet data connections have been cut in his area due to the fighting. He said there was fighting on Monday and the week before in Wadera Wereda, where regional security personnel including local police were killed. Other residents confirmed the same clashes without giving specific casualty figures. Local authorities could not be reached for comment. The data outage and network disruptions were also reported in the North Shewa Zone administration of Oromia region. 'The zone has been under network blockade for the last two months due to the insurgency,' said a second resident from Dera Wereda in North Shewa, who also sought anonymity due to safety reasons. Residents also said people who lost their SIM cards or want replacements could not do so at local telecom offices because the conflict has affected supplies. Network disruptions also impacted schools in the area that access materials online. He says his school had to transfer all its grade-12 students this year to neighboring Wereda due to a lack of service. 'We cannot manage to send their details and credentials to relevant bodies,' with the downed service, he told VOA in a phone interview. Journalists have waited for hours to speak to residents in Kelem Welega Zone, whose network is down during morning hours. One resident traveled to Dembi Dolo, about 620 kilometers west of the capital, Addis Ababa, to speak with the media about the network outages. The disruptions have been present since the yearslong fighting between federal forces and the OLA began in 2019. In one of the latest deadliest attacks, suspected OLA fighters killed as many as 17 pro-government militiamen in the West Showa zone of Oromia on October 17, according to residents and local officials. A second rebel group, Fano, is also fighting in the neighboring Amhara region, which spills over on either side. Residents say as the intensity of the clashes increases, the network situation becomes worse, as the government resorts to shutting down communication. 'It's a very unfortunate tactic that is usually used by governments that are struggling with legitimacy issues,' said Horn of Africa security analyst Samira Gaid. 'It only serves to convince the masses that the government has something to hide. Rather than controlling the narrative or news reporting, it elevates mistrust in government, adds to misinformation and disinformation, and contributes to groups becoming more covert with their communications,' she told VOA. Ethiopia’s state-run communication outlets have not responded to repeated VOA requests for comment. Speaking at a press conference in Addis Ababa last month, Frehiwot Tamiru, CEO of Ethio Telecom, admitted that such problems exist in conflict areas. She declined to give specific answers, referring reporters to other government entities. In June, the company said it has repaired and restored service to dozens of mobile stations that had previously been damaged in the western region of the country. This story originated in VOA’s Horn of Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/residents-in-ethiopia-s-oromia-region-report-network-disruptions-as-government-forces-fight-rebels/7846799.html	2024-10-31T14:34:13-07:00	
Harris, Trump trade barbs over treatment of women	U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump sparred over how women should be treated in society as they looked for votes Thursday in Arizona and Nevada, two Southwest political battleground states. Polling shows Harris, the Democratic candidate, and Trump, the Republican candidate, are virtually tied in the two states. Arizona and Nevada are among seven closely contested states across the 50-state country that are likely to determine the national outcome in next Tuesday’s election. In the other 43, polling shows Trump or Harris with either decisive or comfortable leads. Appeals to Latino voters are central to the campaigns in both Arizona and Nevada. Trump won Arizona in his successful 2016 campaign for the presidency but lost it to President Joe Biden in 2020. Democrats won Nevada in both elections. Migrants crossing from Mexico into the United States across the border in Arizona are at the center of the political debate in the state. Trump has pledged to finish the border wall he started during his 2017-2021 White House tenure. He has also vowed to round up and deport undocumented migrants living in the U.S., while accusing Harris of being weak on controlling the influx of migrants. Harris has said she will look to enact legislation calling for tougher asylum rules at U.S. entry points to curb the tens of thousands of migrants crossing into the U.S. She supports an immigration bill drafted by a bipartisan group of U.S. senators that Trump leaned on Republican lawmakers to kill earlier this year. Pop icon Jennifer Lopez is to join Harris on stage Thursday night at a rally in Las Vegas, the U.S. gambling mecca. Trump has scheduled an interview in Arizona with ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson and a rally in neighboring Nevada. Harris and Trump met only once face to face in a debate, but trade insults and taunts every day from rally stages, in campaign ads and over the airwaves. Their latest dispute is over the treatment of women. Trump said at a rally on Wednesday in the Midwest state of Wisconsin that he would protect American women 'whether the women like it or not.' He cast the remark as paternal, but it served to remind his critics of his history of misogynistic statements and a civil court case that found him liable for sexual abuse of a New York writer in the 1990s. Trump told supporters that his advisers had urged him to stop proclaiming his desire to protect women, saying they had called it 'inappropriate.' But he told rally-goers, 'I said, ‘Well, I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not. I am going to protect them.’' Polls show Harris with a wide lead among female voters; Trump substantially leads with men. Harris quickly jumped on Trump’s remark, writing on X, 'Donald Trump thinks he should get to make decisions about what you do with your body. Whether you like it or not.' On Thursday, she said that Trump’s views on women showed that he does not understand 'their rights and their ability to make decisions about their own lives.' Nearly 62 million people have already voted at polling stations or by mail. More than 155 million voted in the 2020 election, about two-thirds of them early or by mail and a third of them on the official Election Day. The importance of battleground states like Arizona, Nevada and the five others cannot be overstated. U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular vote but through the Electoral College, which turns the election into 50 state-by-state contests, with 48 of the states awarding all their electoral votes to the winner in that state. Nebraska and Maine allocate theirs by both statewide and congressional district vote counts. The number of electoral votes in each state is based on population, so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall national outcome, with the winner needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes to claim the presidency. Polls show either Harris or Trump with substantial or comfortable leads in 43 of the states, enough for each to get to 200 electoral votes or more. Barring an upset in one of those states, the winner will be decided in the remaining seven states, where both Harris and Trump have staged frequent rallies, all but ignoring the rest of the country for campaign stops. Polling in the seven states is easily within the margins of statistical error, leaving the outcome in doubt in all seven.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-trade-barbs-over-the-treatment-of-women-/7846803.html	2024-10-31T14:31:43-07:00

Accused of interference in Georgia, Russia pumps up anti-US propaganda	Tbilisi and Moscow have exchanged harsh rhetoric about the results of the October 26 parliamentary elections in Georgia that brought thousands to the streets protesting the victory of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, who is aligned with the pro-Western opposition, accused Russia of running a 'special operation' to 'falsify' the election results in favor of the ruling party, which is widely seen as increasingly pro-Kremlin and authoritarian. In response, Russia denied involvement and framed the United States and European Union as destabilizing powers. In doing so, Moscow’s network of officials and state-owned outlets engaged in disinformation and conspiracy theories, going so far as to allege on a state-controlled news agency that the U.S. and Ukraine were secretly deploying snipers to shoot at protesters in Tbilisi to escalate the situation. Zourabichvili also told Reuters that Russian 'methodology and the support of most probably Russian FSB [Federal Security Service] types is shown in this election.' 'The propaganda that was used ahead of the election ... was a direct duplication, a copy-paste, of Russian clips and videos used at the time of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's election,' said Zourabichvili, whose position as president is largely ceremonial. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Russian interference in the election and accused Zourabichvili of 'attempting to destabilize the situation.' Peskov had earlier alleged it was the European countries that 'tried to influence the outcome of this vote.' Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called Zourabichvili a 'puppet president' who 'refused to accept the election and went against the Constitution by calling for a coup.' 'The standard practice in such cases is removal from office and arrest,' Medvedev wrote on X. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the U.S. of engaging in 'neo-colonialism' after U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller warned the Georgian government could face 'consequences' if it did not 'walk back its anti-democratic actions and return to its Euro-Atlantic path.' Russian state media went further, spreading a conspiracy theory that the West was seeking to foment violence in Georgia. 'In their attempts to knock off balance the internal political situation in Georgia following the October 26 election and set off another color revolution, Westerners stop at nothing,' the Russian state-owned Sputnik news agency said, quoting unnamed 'sources in the region.' 'Ukraine-trained snipers are arriving in the republic to organize provocations during mass protests,' Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency reported Monday, citing a 'regional official familiar with the matter.' The term 'color revolution' was widely adopted after the 2004-05 Orange Revolution in Ukraine was sparked by a corruption-ridden presidential runoff that saw the pro-Russian candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, emerge victorious. Russia typically uses the term when accusing the West of orchestrating movements to destabilize or overthrow Kremlin-preferred governments. In the months leading up to Georgia’s parliamentary poll, Russian state media ran reports alleging the U.S. was seeking to foment a color revolution or 'a Ukraine-style coup.' In July, Russia’s state-run Sputnik news agency cited an anonymous Russian intelligence official who claimed U.S. authorities were planning a 'sacred sacrifice' from among the protest participants. The disinformation narrative in Sputnik’s report reflects a well-worn Kremlin conspiracy theory going back to the 2013-14 pro-Europe rallies in Ukraine, when the Russians claimed that American-trained Georgian 'mercenaries' were responsible for shooting protesters in Kyiv during the 2014 demonstrations at the city’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti, widely known as the Maidan or Independence Square. Russian state media and top officials, including Putin, falsely claimed that the U.S. organized protests in Ukraine to propagate a coup. That narrative included a conspiracy theory that Victoria Nuland, an American diplomat and former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, had ordered 'American specialists' to lead the 'snipers, who shot people at the Maidan.' Amid ongoing protests in Georgia, the U.S. and the EU have joined calls from international and local observers to investigate alleged election-related violations. On Thursday, Georgian authorities launched an investigation into election-fraud allegations. The EU and U.S. have repeatedly warned Georgia about what they call its 'democratic backsliding,' even freezing financial support to the country’s government, focusing instead on supporting civil society initiatives. In June, Georgian Dream officials signed into law a bill that required nongovernmental agencies receiving at least 20% of their funding from abroad to label themselves as foreign agents 'pursuing the interests of a foreign power.' In response, Brussels paused Georgia’s accession process to the EU, saying the foreign agent law is incompatible with EU membership. Georgia’s opposition has nicknamed Tbilisi’s new foreign agent law the 'Russian law,' a reference to similar legislation enacted in Russia in 2012 that has been used to silence civil society and independent media. The EU also warned it may freeze visa-free travel with Georgia if it finds the parliamentary poll neither free nor fair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/accused-of-interference-in-georgia-russia-pumps-up-anti-us-propaganda-/7846721.html	2024-10-31T13:09:01-07:00	
Hundreds in Turkey protest arrest, ouster of opposition mayor	ISTANBUL — Hundreds gathered Thursday in Istanbul to protest the arrest and removal from office of a mayor from Turkey's main opposition party for his alleged links to a banned Kurdish militant group. Ahmet Ozer, mayor of Istanbul's Esenyurt district and a member of the Republican People's Party, or CHP, was detained on Wednesday by anti-terrorist police over his alleged connection to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Turkey's government on Thursday replaced Ozer with Istanbul's deputy governor, a move the CHP's leader, Ozgur Ozel and other politicians described as a 'coup.' The mayor's arrest comes as Turkey is debating a tentative peace process to end a 40-year conflict between the PKK and the Turkish state that has led to tens of thousands of deaths. Demonstrators filled a square in Esenyurt after the government banned a rally outside the municipality building. Some carried banners that read: '(We want) an elected mayor not an appointed mayor' and called for the resignation of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government. 'In our view, this (government), which acts against the law and violates the constitution, has carried out a political coup. We will never accept it,' said Tulay Hatimogullari, the leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party, whose supporters joined the rally in a show of solidarity. Ozel, whose CHP made significant gains in local elections earlier this year, called for early elections. Ozer, 64, is a former academic originally from Van in eastern Turkey. He was elected mayor of Esenyurt, a western suburb in Istanbul's European side, in March local elections. The Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office said an investigation found Ozer had maintained contacts with PKK figures for more than 10 years, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. Politicians and members of Turkey's pro-Kurdish movement have frequently been targeted over alleged links to the PKK, which is considered a terror organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. Legislators have been stripped of their parliamentary seats and mayors removed from office. Several lawmakers as well as thousands of party members have been jailed on terror-related charges since 2016. Other opposition parties have been largely unscathed but the CHP metropolitan mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, is currently appealing a prison sentence and political ban imposed by a court in December 2022 for 'insulting' members of Turkey's election board in 2019. Imamoglu accused Erdogan's government of 'plotting a dirty game' to snatch Esenyurt municipality away from the opposition 'by declaring [Ozer] a terrorist for fictitious reasons.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-in-turkey-protest-arrest-and-ouster-of-opposition-mayor/7846538.html	2024-10-31T10:46:53-07:00	
Hungary's Orban finds key ally in Georgia amid Western concerns	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Standing side by side with Georgia's prime minister, Hungary's Viktor Orban was among the first to congratulate the ruling Georgian Dream party on its recent electoral victory. This endorsement came as much of the Western world raised questions about the legitimacy of the election and tens of thousands of Georgians were in the streets to protest it. Orban's swift acknowledgment underscored his bond with Georgia's government. 'I congratulate the prime minister on his election victory,' Orban declared, adding, 'I see that nobody dares to question that this election was a free and democratic choice.' For many observers, this alliance was hardly surprising. Both leaders have shown authoritarian tendencies in their governance styles, said Irakli Porchkhidze, senior fellow at the Georgian Institute for Strategic Studies. 'They reinforce each other's positions,' he told VOA. Orban's enthusiastic embrace of the Georgian Dream victory stands in contrast to the stance of the European Union, which expressed concerns over the election's fairness. The EU noted that Orban was not speaking on its behalf. Analysts argue that the alliance between Orban and Georgia's ruling party is not based on any ideological commitment but rather on mutual convenience. Aka Zarqua, editor-in-chief of Realpolitik, described it to VOA as 'a marriage of convenience between two autocrats.' Hungary has reportedly lobbied against EU sanctions on Georgia's leadership and pushed Brussels to grant Tbilisi EU candidate status ahead of the elections. Notably, in 2012, Orban stood next to then-President Mikheil Saakashvili in Georgia, who is now Georgian Dream's chief adversary. 'As a Hungarian friend, believe me — don't go back. ... I would like to ask you to keep your country on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration,' Orban said on October 27, 2012, standing next to Saakashvili. That year, Saakashvili lost the elections, and Georgian Dream came to power. 'That was a different Orban,' Dalibor Rohac, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA in a phone call. Twelve years later, when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, EU and NATO members criticized Orban for his determination to remain friendly with Russia, something Georgia's ruling party has also done. Hungary, under Orban's leadership, has become a template for Georgia's leaders as they seek to consolidate power while maintaining the appearance of democracy, Zarqua said. 'One of them is leading, offering lessons to [former Prime Minister Bidzina] Ivanishvili and his Georgian Dream party on how to control civil society and establish what political scientists call competitive authoritarianism,' Zarqua said. Georgian Dream's ties to Russia have been widely discussed, with Rohac referring to the party as 'Russia's fifth column' in Georgia, underscoring the growing perception that Georgian leadership is aligning itself with Moscow. '[Georgian Dream] is a political force that has dragged Georgia into Russian and, to a lesser extent, Chinese spheres of influence. And Viktor Orban, since his transformation, since 2010, has been doing the same for Hungary,' Rohac said. Pro-Russian narratives have increasingly shaped Georgian politics, much like Hungary under Orban. Both governments have cast themselves as challengers to Western liberalism, amplifying Kremlin talking points to rally domestic support. They've also enacted Russian-inspired foreign agent laws to target foreign-funded organizations, a tactic critics see as a way to silence opposition. 'They have copied each other in how they manage elections,' Porchkhidze said. 'They are hostile toward the dissent. Let it be the opposition, media or civil society organizations,' he said. However, the differences are significant. Hungary is already a member of NATO and the European Union, providing it with a certain degree of protection and a security umbrella. 'It's much more dangerous for Georgian society to follow these tendencies than it is for Hungarian society,' Zarqua cautioned. Hungary and Georgia have experienced Russian aggression — Hungary during the Soviet crackdown of 1956 and Georgia in the 1990s and again in 2008, with Russian forces still occupying 20% of Georgia's territory. Both countries have since invoked these fears, warning of potential Russian threats if they lose power. 'They are exploiting the trauma of Russia's aggression,' Zarqua said, calling it 'just political technology.' Orban’s Fidesz party and the Georgian Dream party have also tapped into anti-Western narratives that have gained traction across Europe. The rhetoric often centers on portraying the West as decadent and in decline, a narrative that finds strong echoes in Russian propaganda. 'There's a common thread running through the messaging of Russian propaganda, Georgian Dream and Orban — that the West is decadent, and these countries should place their bets elsewhere rather than in the West,' Rohac said. This anti-Western sentiment is often couched in the language of 'traditional values' and opposition to LGBTQ rights, a tactic aimed at appealing to domestic audiences, said the AEI’s Rohac. 'For Orban, the most important consideration is staying in power,' Rohac said. 'Sometimes that means turning against LGBTQ rights. Georgian Dream is doing the same. I don't think this really reflects a deep commitment to cultural conservatism.' The West's lack of a coherent strategy for the post-Soviet space has also contributed to the rise of leaders like Orban and their allies, Zarqua said. 'The West is not as attractive as it was during the unipolar moment of the 1990s and 2000s,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hungarys-orban-finds-key-ally-in-georgia-amid-western-concerns/7846516.html	2024-10-31T10:44:54-07:00

Kenyan court lifts orders blocking swearing-in of deputy president nominee	Nairobi, Kenya — A Kenyan court has lifted orders blocking the swearing-in of Deputy President nominee Kithuri Kindiki — dealing a blow to former DP Rigathi Gachagua who was impeached and removed from office in mid-October amid accusations of gross misconduct and undermining the president. Gachagua's lawyers filed about 30 court cases arguing against his ouster in the last two weeks. The three-judge bench appointed to hear the case by the deputy chief justice, made the highly anticipated announcement Thursday. 'Public interest in this matter favors giving way to the constitution, which in any event is the will of the people,' said Judge Antony Mrima, who heard the case along with Eric Ogola and Freda Mugambi. 'We choose to abide by that calling, as such public interest demands that the office of the deputy president should not remain vacant.' President William Ruto, who had 14 days after Gachagua removal to replace him, took less than a day to nominate Interior Minister Kindiki. The selection was approved by lawmakers at the National Assembly a few hours later. However, the court suspended any further action until it could hear the case. Since then, the three-judge bench has faced questions and petitions from Gachagua's lawyers contesting the validity of their appointment and their own impartiality. Those challenges were rejected. Gachagua was convicted on five of the 11 charges against him, which included accusations of gross misconduct, irregular acquisition of wealth and undermining the president. Gachagua denied all the charges. Public opinion has been mixed, with some telling VOA they agree with the removal of Gachagua while others found it distasteful, especially because the deputy president fell ill while the proceedings were happening. 'The outgoing deputy president was too abrasive. He couldn't tone down his language. He seemed divisive,' said James Chege. 'It wasn't good, especially when you are impeaching someone who's in the hospital. It was so untimely,' Edwin Mugalo said. Gachagua was Ruto's running mate in the 2022 election but had recently complained of about being left out, highlighting the friction and tension between him and his former boss. Kenneth Ombongi said he was surprised the Ruto-Gachagua partnership lasted as long as it did. Ombongi is the former chair of the department of history and archeology and is now associate dean of postgraduate studies at the University of Nairobi. 'If I look at historical patterns, what’s happening is not new and was expected. The office of the vice president or the deputy president has always been as delicate as it is now,' Ombongi said. 'The two are of the same characteristics … I know our president ... He's strong, determined, opinionated, same thing with Gachagua. We say two bulls cannot share the same corral.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-court-lifts-orders-blocking-swearing-in-of-deputy-president-nominee/7846440.html	2024-10-31T09:37:24-07:00	
Moroccan authorities detain human rights activist who accused government of 'blackmailing' France	RABAT, Morocco — A Moroccan economist known for his work defending human rights was detained after criticizing the government in remarks posted on social media during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to the North African kingdom. Prosecutors apprehended Fouad Abdelmoumni in Casablanca on Wednesday and announced he was under investigation on suspicion of disseminating false information and accusing others of crimes on social media, Morocco's state news agency reported. If charged and convicted, he could face up to five years in prison under cybercrime statutes. 'This arbitrary arrest is part of a series of harassments targeting Abdelmoumni, as a measure aimed at retaliating against his bold positions in expressing his opinions and defending human rights,' the Moroccan Association in Support of Political Prisoners said in a statement Wednesday. 'This arrest represents a further escalation in the authorities' policy of repression against human rights and political activists in the country.' Abdelmoumni, a former political prisoner, is the group's coordinator. While Macron toured Rabat with Moroccan leaders including King Mohammed VI, the activist alleged in a post that Morocco was attempting to 'blackmail' France using methods including espionage and withholding cooperation on managing illegal immigration. Abdelmoumni is yet to be officially arraigned. When he appears in court on Friday, he will likely be charged with crimes related to the post, one of his attorneys, Souad Brahma, said. In Morocco, authorities can hold people under investigation for 48 hours without charging them. Brahma said Abdelmoumni was arrested for expressing his opinion and called his detention a violation of his right to freedom of expression. She said she was denied a chance to visit him on Thursday despite receiving authorization from the court. Officials have not responded to allegations that the arrest was politically motivated. Macron throughout his visit referred to opening a new chapter in relations between France and Morocco after years of strain. The causes of friction included the 2021 'Pegasus Affair,' in which Amnesty International and the Paris-based nonprofit group Forbidden Stories published a report alleging that Moroccan authorities had used the Israeli software Pegasus to infiltrate the electronic devices of human rights activists including Abdelmoumni and politicians all the way up to Macron. Morocco strenuously denied the allegations and sued, claiming defamation. Abdelmoumni, 66, has been prominent in defending human rights since he was imprisoned and tortured alongside other left-wing activists during King Hassan II's era of repression known as the 'Years of Lead.' He has publicly supported pro-democracy efforts in the country, including during the Arab Spring and Morocco's 2017 'Hirak' movement. After the investigation into Pegasus software, Abdelmoumni was among the activists profiled in a 2022 Human Rights Watch report on Morocco's targeting of critics. The report said an anonymous person distributed a video of him and his then-partner-now-wife having sex, likely shot from a hidden camera inside his home's air conditioner. In Morocco, non-marital sex is a crime and information about their relationship later appeared in pro-government media as part of an effort that Abdelmoumni said was designed to intimidate him. This week, he participated in a vigil demanding justice for a Moroccan nationalist who was 'disappeared' in France in 1965, and appeared at a courthouse where Morocco's ex-human rights minister was facing trial. He was going to a meeting of the Moroccan Association for the Support of Political Prisoners when he was apprehended. Macron's political party helped push through a 2023 resolution in the European Union's Parliament condemning human rights abuses in Morocco. But the two countries have recently deepened political and economic ties. This week, they announced economic agreements and lucrative contracts on projects ranging from transportation to desalination infrastructure, and Macron reiterated his support for Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara. During his three-day visit, Macron did not mention human rights in speeches at a business forum, to the country's French community or at the country's parliament.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moroccan-authorities-detain-human-rights-activist-who-accused-government-of-blackmailing-france/7846302.html	2024-10-31T08:40:16-07:00	
Analysts see Iran's deterrence vis-a-vis Israel weakened	Recent attempts by Iran to establish deterrence through direct strikes on Israel have mainly failed, according to analysts, leaving the Islamic Republic more vulnerable to its prime foe. Israel’s recent retaliatory airstrikes on Iran are said to have dismantled all of Iran’s S-300 defense missile system. The strikes came in response to Iran's October 1 ballistic missile attacks against Israel. Iran says it is still assessing damage from the strikes. Nicholas Heras of the Washington-based New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy told VOA that the airstrikes showed Israel has 'the qualitative military edge when it comes to war with Iran,' impacting the Muslim nation’s deterrence strategy. 'They struck advanced S-300 anti-air systems — which allowed them to evade Iranian air defenses and sites that are important for building vehicles for intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as the fuel for ballistic missiles, which is a key component of Iran’s deterrent strategy,' Heras said. 'They fundamentally wanted to send a signal to the Iranians that the Iranians are far behind the Israelis when it comes to the tech war,' he said. Writing in the online Diwan publication, Nicole Grajewski, a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace fellow in its nuclear program, said, 'Iran’s attempts to deter Israel through direct attacks have proven counterproductive, instead revealing gaps in its own defenses that Israel is increasingly willing to target … [and] likely places Iran in an even more precarious position than before October 1.' Thomas Newdick, writing in The War Zone, agreed. 'Putting the Iranian S-300s out of action leaves the door open to follow-up strikes by Israel, including larger scale direct attacks.' This, he said, 'serves as both a contingent opportunity for the Israel Defense Forces and a deterrent against a response from Iran.' 'It is almost inevitable that Israel has several follow-up options already planned should Iran respond with another barrage,' Newdick said. Another component of Iran’s deterrent strategy has been the development of relationships over the years with Syria as well as regional militant groups, including those in Iraq, Hamas in Gaza, Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Israel assassinated Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, chief among them Yahya Sinwar and Hassan Nasrallah. Analyst Steven Simon of Washington’s Quincy Institute, during an online presentation, said there are many unknowns about Iran’s 'axis of resistance.' Simon questioned 'how much is left of this axis of resistance for advancing Iran’s objectives, let alone their own.' 'Hamas is destroyed, basically, as a military organization,' Simon said. 'Hezbollah has been very badly wounded. They took a serious beating: the pager attacks, the assassination of Nasrallah and [Hezbollah official Hashem] Safieddine, and others in their hierarchy. 'I don’t know how accurate the latest Israeli assessments are of the destruction they’ve inflicted on Hezbollah’s missile and rockets inventories,' he said, but 'they are now saying that 80% of those rockets and missiles have either been expended or destroyed in Israeli airstrikes.' Simon added that Hezbollah will find it difficult to replenish its Iranian arms supplies because Syria, as a conduit, is incapable of ensuring weapons can cross its borders into Lebanon. Carnegie’s Grajewski said she believes Iran’s response options are now 'severely constrained,' given the weakening of its proxy network and now that its own 'missile arsenal proved both limited in scope and questionable in its reliability.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-see-iran-s-deterrence-vis-a-vis-israel-weakened/7846212.html	2024-10-31T07:36:56-07:00	
Chinese online retailer Temu faces EU probe into rogue traders, illegal goods	LONDON — The European Union is investigating Chinese online retailer Temu over suspicions it's failing to prevent the sale of illegal products, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm said on Thursday. The European Commission opened its investigation five months after adding Temu to the list of 'very large online platforms' needing the strictest level of scrutiny under the bloc's Digital Services Act. It's a wide-ranging rulebook designed to clean up online platforms and keep internet users safe, with the threat of hefty fines. Temu started entering Western markets only in the past two years and has grown in popularity by offering cheap goods — from clothing to home products — that are shipped from sellers in China. The company, owned by Pinduoduo Incorporated, a popular e-commerce site in China, now has 92 million users in the EU. Temu said it 'takes its obligations under the DSA seriously, continuously investing to strengthen our compliance system and safeguard consumer interests on our platform.' 'We will cooperate fully with regulators to support our shared goal of a safe, trusted marketplace for consumers,' the company said in a statement. European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said in a press release that Brussels wants to make sure products sold on Temu's platform 'meet EU standards and do not harm consumers.' EU enforcement will 'guarantee a level playing field and that every platform, including Temu, fully respects the laws that keep our European market safe and fair for all,' she said. The commission's investigation will look into whether Temu's systems are doing enough to crack down on 'rogue traders' selling 'noncompliant goods' amid concerns that they are able to swiftly reappear after being suspended. The commission didn't single out specific illegal products that were being sold on the platform. Regulators are also examining the risks from Temu's 'addictive design,' including 'game-like' reward programs, and what the company is doing to mitigate those risks. Also under investigation is Temu's compliance with two other DSA requirements: giving researchers access to data and transparency on recommender systems. Companies must detail how they recommend content and products and give users at least one option to see recommendations that are not based on their personal profile and preferences. Temu now has the chance to respond to the commission, which can decide to impose a fine or drop the case if the company makes changes or can prove that the suspicions aren't valid. Brussels has been cracking down on tech companies since the DSA took effect last year. It has also opened an investigation into another e-commerce platform, AliExpress, as well as social media sites such as X and Tiktok, which bowed to pressure after the commission demanded answers about a new rewards feature. Temu has also faced scrutiny in the United States, where a congressional report last year accused the company of failing to prevent goods made by forced labor from being sold on its platform.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-online-retailer-temu-faces-eu-probe-into-rogue-traders-illegal-goods/7846144.html	2024-10-31T06:44:33-07:00	
Pakistan says China's remarks on safety of its citizens 'perplexing'	Islamabad — Pakistan pushed back Thursday against China's criticism of the safety of Chinese personnel in the country, calling the comments 'perplexing' and contrary to established diplomatic traditions between the neighbors. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch said at a weekly news conference in Islamabad that the government is dedicated to ensuring the security of Chinese nationals, projects, and institutions in Pakistan. Baloch was responding to a rare public warning from the Chinese ambassador to the country, Jiang Zaidong, who urged Islamabad to take action against militants responsible for several deadly attacks on Chinese workers. Jiang labeled the violence 'unacceptable' and cautioned that it poses 'a constraint' on Beijing’s investments under its Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI. 'The statement of the Chinese ambassador is perplexing and is not reflective of the diplomatic traditions between Pakistan and China,' Baloch said. 'We will continue to engage with our Chinese brothers to reassure them of Pakistan’s complete commitment to their security and well-being in Pakistan,' she added. Jiang, while addressing a seminar in Islamabad, referenced suicide car bombings in March and October of this year, which resulted in the deaths of seven Chinese personnel. It raised the number of Chinese workers killed in Pakistan to 21 since the countries launched a massive infrastructure project as part of the BRI about a decade ago. 'It is unacceptable for us to be attacked twice in only six months,' the Chinese diplomat stated, speaking through his interpreter. He stressed the need for Islamabad to take 'effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such terror acts and ensure that perpetrators are identified, caught, and punished.' It is unprecedented for Pakistan to respond publicly to China’s criticism, and it is extremely rare for the Chinese ambassador to admonish Islamabad for alleged security lapses against Chinese engineers and workers. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, considered the flagship project of the BRI, has brought more than $25 billion in Chinese investment to enhance Pakistan’s infrastructure, facilitating improved bilateral trade and further integrating the broader South Asian region. Jiang urged Pakistan to take action against 'all anti-China terrorist groups,' stating that 'security is the biggest concern' for Beijing. He added that 'without a safe and sound environment, nothing can be achieved.' Baloch said investigations into attacks on Chinese workers are ongoing and said the findings have been communicated to Beijing. She did not elaborate. CPEC has resulted in roads, highways, primarily coal-fired power plants, and the strategic deepwater Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea in the country’s southwestern Balochistan province. Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, while addressing Tuesday’s seminar organized by the Islamabad-based independent Pakistan-China Institute, assured the Chinese ambassador that his country was taking action against terrorists and tightening the security of Chinese nationals. Dar stated that Pakistan would share the progress with China in high-level talks next month. 'The Chinese are very clear; no matter how lucrative an investment is anywhere, if the security issue is there, they do not send Chinese personnel. Your country is the only exception,' he told the audience, quoting Chinese leaders as telling Pakistani counterparts in recent meetings. Critics argue that Pakistan's financial difficulties and political instability have discouraged China from making new investments in the CPEC. After the launch of CPEC projects, Pakistan’s military formed a specially trained unit of over 13,000 troops to safeguard the initiatives nationwide. But the attacks on Chinese nationals have led to doubts about the effectiveness of the military unit. Most of the recent attacks on Chinese workers and engineers have been claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, a prominent separatist group waging insurgent attacks in Balochistan. The group, which is made up of militants from the Baloch ethnic minority, accuses China of helping Pakistan exploit the province’s natural resources and has been calling for Beijing to withdraw its CPEC and other investments. Both countries reject the allegations, saying Baloch insurgents are on a mission to subvert development in the impoverished province and undermine Pakistan’s close ties with China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-says-china-s-remarks-on-safety-of-its-citizens-perplexing/7846101.html	2024-10-31T06:34:45-07:00	
IMF: Mideast conflicts to leave 'lasting scars'	Gaza, Lebanon and Sudan will take decades to recover from the conflicts raging on their soil, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday after downgrading the region's growth forecast. Israel's military actions against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Sudan's civil war would have enduring impacts, the IMF said. 'The damage caused by these conflicts will leave lasting scars at their epicenters for decades,' the global lender said in a statement. The IMF has lowered its predicted growth for the Middle East and North Africa to 2.1 percent for 2024, a drop of 0.6 percent due to the wars and lower oil production. Depending on the conflicts, growth should rise to 4.0 percent next year, according to the IMF's Regional Economic Outlook which was compiled in September. 'This year has been challenging with conflicts causing devastating human suffering and lasting economic damage,' Jihad Azour, the IMF's Middle East and Central Asia Department director, told reporters in Dubai. 'The recent escalation in Lebanon has greatly increased the uncertainty in the whole MENA region.' IMF forecasts for Lebanon, where conflict with Israel has sharply escalated this month, have been suspended. But 'conservative' estimates show a 9.0-10 percent contraction this year, Azour said. 'The impact (on Lebanon) will be severe and it will depend how long this conflict will last,' said the former Lebanese finance minister. Saudi-led oil cuts through the OPEC+ cartel, aimed at propping up prices, 'are contributing to sluggish near-term growth in many economies', the IMF said. For the region's oil exporters, 'medium-term growth is projected to moderate, as economic diversification reforms will take time to yield results', it added. Downside risks continue to dominate, the lender said, including fluctuating commodity prices, conflicts and climate shocks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/imf-mideast-conflicts-to-leave-lasting-scars-/7846098.html	2024-10-31T05:57:00-07:00	
Papua New Guinea to boycott 'waste of time' UN climate summit	Papua New Guinea on Thursday declared a boycott of next month's UN climate summit, branding the global warming negotiations a 'waste of time' full of empty promises from big polluters. While plenty have criticized the annual COP summit in the past, it is rare for any government to so totally dismiss the UN's premier climate talks. 'There's no point going if we are falling asleep because of jet lag because we're not getting anything done,' Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told AFP ahead of November's COP29 summit in Azerbaijan. 'All the big polluters of the world promise and commit millions to assist in climate relief and support. And I can tell you now it's all going to consultants.' The island of New Guinea is home to the third-largest expanse of rainforest on the planet, according to the World Wildlife Fund, and has long been celebrated as one of the 'lungs of the earth.' Impoverished, flanked by ocean, and already prone to natural disasters, Papua New Guinea is also considered to be highly vulnerable to the unfolding perils of climate change. 'COP is a total waste of time,' Tkatchenko said. 'We are sick of the rhetoric as well as the merry-go-round of getting absolutely nothing done over the last three years.' 'We are the third-biggest rainforest nation in the world. We are sucking up the pollutants of these major countries. And they are getting away with it scot-free.' 'Talk fest' The COP summit in 2015 hammered out the landmark Paris Agreement, under which almost every country in the world has agreed to slash emissions to limit soaring global temperatures. But subsequent gatherings have been dogged by growing criticism, stoked by a perception that big polluters are using their sway to limit further climate action. Meanwhile, adaptation funds set up through COP to help developing nations have been accused of sluggish bureaucracy that fails to grasp the urgency of the crisis. Civil society groups banded together last year to urge a boycott of the COP summit hosted by the United Arab Emirates, claiming the meeting would 'greenwash' the petrostate's poor climate credentials. Underwhelmed by proposed emissions cuts, dozens of African nations led a temporary walkout of developing nations during the 2009 COP talks in Copenhagen. And Ukraine has pressed its allies to avoid this year's summit if Russian leader Vladimir Putin shows face. But Papua New Guinea is among the first nations to have voiced such a full-throated call to boycott the COP summit altogether. 'Why are we spending all this money going to the other side of the world going to these talkfests,' said Tkatchenko. 'No traction' Papua New Guinea is one of five Pacific nations involved in a pivotal International Court of Justice case that will soon test whether polluters can be sued for neglecting their climate obligations. Low-lying Pacific nations such as Tuvalu could be almost entirely swallowed by rising oceans within the next 30 years. Tkatchenko said the decision to pull out of COP talks had been applauded by others within the Pacific bloc. 'I'm speaking up on behalf of the smaller island states that are worse off than Papua New Guinea. They were getting no traction and acknowledgement at all.' Papua New Guinea would instead seek to strike its own climate deals through bilateral channels, said Tkatchenko, flagging that negotiations were already under way with Singapore. 'With like-minded countries like Singapore, we can do 100 times more than COP. 'They have a big carbon footprint, and we would like to think about how they can work with Papua New Guinea to fix that up.' A key meeting ahead of COP29 ended in frustration earlier this month, with countries making little progress on how to fund a new finance deal for poorer nations.

Vatican tribunal explains conviction of cardinal and others in 'trial of the century'	The Vatican tribunal said Wednesday it convicted a cardinal of aggravated fraud and other charges because of his 'objectively inexplicable behavior' in paying a self-styled intelligence analyst over a half-million euros in Vatican money that she then spent on luxury items and vacations. The city-state’s tribunal issued 816 pages of written motivations from its Dec. 16 verdicts in the Vatican’s 'trial of the century.' The two-year trial of 10 people was borne out of the Holy See’s $380 million investment in a London property but grew to include a host of other financial dealings. Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a once-powerful cardinal who was the No. 3, or 'substitute,' in the Vatican’s secretariat of state, was the most prominent of the nine people convicted. He faces five and a half years in prison after being convicted of embezzlement, fraud and other charges. He and the eight other defendants have announced appeals, as has the Vatican prosecutor. With the tribunal’s written explanations now filed — nearly a year after the convictions were handed down — both sides can elaborate the basis of their appeals. The trial focused on the Vatican secretariat of state’s participation in a fund to develop a former Harrod’s warehouse into luxury apartments. Prosecutors alleged Vatican monsignors and brokers fleeced the Holy See of tens of millions of euros in fees and commissions and then extorted the Holy See for 15 million euros to cede control of the building. Becciu was convicted of embezzlement stemming from the original Vatican investment of 200 million euros into the fund that invested in the London property. The tribunal determined that canon law prohibited using church assets in such a speculative investment. Becciu was also convicted of aggravated fraud for his role in paying a self-proclaimed intelligence expert from his native Sardinia, Cecilia Marogna, 575,000 euros in Holy See money. He had said the payments were authorized by Pope Francis as ransom to free a Colombian nun held hostage by al-Qaida-linked militants in Mali. The investigation showed, however, that Becciu essentially double-billed the Vatican, with the same amount of money being sent to a British security firm that actually has expertise in liberating hostages. The nun was subsequently freed, but there is no indication Marogna had anything to do with it, the tribunal noted. The tribunal, headed by Judge Giuseppe Pignatone, said Becciu never provided a reasonable explanation for why he paid Marogna the same amount of money, or why he never asked her for any updates on her alleged efforts to liberate the nun. Even when told by Vatican gendarmes that Marogna had instead spent the Vatican’s money on luxury vacations and purchases at Prada, Becciu didn’t file a complaint with prosecutors or keep his distance from Marogna. Instead, they continued to communicate via a family friend. 'An objectively inexplicable behavior, all the more for someone in a position of the defendant, a cardinal prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and for seven years the substitute in the secretariat of state, who for a long period enjoyed the full trust of the pope,' the tribunal wrote. 'A behavior, moreover, that the defendant has never explained in any way.' Marogna, for her part, was tried in absentia and provided contradictory and inconclusive explanations in her written defense, the tribunal said. She too was convicted and sentenced to three years and nine months in prison. The bulk of the written motivations were devoted to deciphering the complicated transactions at the heart of the London deal. The text also repeated the tribunal’s previous rejection of defense arguments that the trial itself was fundamentally unfair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-tribunal-explains-conviction-of-cardinal-and-others-in-trial-of-the-century-/7845950.html	2024-10-31T03:52:37-07:00	
China tells carmakers to pause investment in EU countries backing EV tariffs, sources say	China has told its automakers to halt big investment in European countries that support extra tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles, two people briefed about the matter said, a move likely to further divide Europe. The new European Union tariffs of up to 45.3% came into effect on Wednesday after a year-long investigation that divided the bloc and prompted retaliation from Beijing. Ten EU members including France, Poland and Italy supported tariffs in a vote this month, in which five members including Germany opposed them and 12 abstained. Chinese automakers including BYD, SAIC, and Geely were told at a meeting held by the Ministry of Commerce on Oct. 10 that they should pause their heavy asset investment plans such as factories in countries that backed the proposal, said the people. They declined to be named, as the meeting was not public. Several foreign automakers also attended the meeting, where the participants were told to be prudent about their investments in countries that abstained from voting and were 'encouraged' to invest in those that voted against the tariffs, the people said. Geely declined to comment. SAIC, BYD and the commerce ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The move by Chinese authorities to suspend some investment in Europe would suggest the government is seeking leverage in talks with the EU over an alternative to tariffs, keen to avoid a sharp fall in EV exports to the key market. Europe accounted for more than 40% of EVs shipped from China in 2023, according to Reuters' calculations using data from the China Passenger Car Association. Given 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs in the United States and Canada, a drop in EV exports to Europe would risk deepening overcapacity Chinese automakers face in their home market. Investments in Europe During a visit to China by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez last month, a Chinese company agreed to build a $1 billion plant in Spain to make machinery used for hydrogen production. Spain was one of the 12 EU states that abstained. Italy and France are among EU countries that have been courting Chinese automakers for investments, but they have also warned of the risks that a flood of cheap Chinese EVs pose to European manufacturers. State-owned SAIC, China's second-largest auto exporter, is choosing a site for an EV factory in Europe and has been separately planning to open its second European parts center in France this year to meet growing demand for its MG-brand cars. An aide to France's junior trade minister Sophie Primas said they had no comment to make ahead of her trip to China next week. The Italian government is in talks with Chery, China's largest automaker by exports, and other Chinese automakers, including Dongfeng Motors, about potential investments. Italy's industry ministry declined to comment. Dongfeng didn't immediately respond, while Chery declined to comment. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, which voted against the tariffs. The Chinese EV giant has also been considering relocating its European headquarters from the Netherlands to Hungary due to cost concerns, two separate people with knowledge of the matter said. Even before Beijing issued its guidance, Chinese companies were cautious about independently setting up production sites in Europe, as it requires large sums of investment and a deep understanding of local laws and culture. The automakers were also told at the Oct. 10 meeting that they should avoid separate investment discussions with European governments and instead work together to hold collective talks, the people said. The directive follows a similar warning in July when the commerce ministry advised China's automakers not to invest in countries such as India and Turkey, and to be cautious with investments in Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tells-carmakers-to-pause-investment-in-eu-countries-backing-ev-tariffs-sources-say/7845941.html	2024-10-31T03:39:30-07:00	
Low consumer spending in China hinders economy there and abroad	U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has joined several independent economists to express her frustration about low consumer spending and the property crisis in China. Some experts have expressed disappointment over Beijing's limited measures to stimulate consumer spending, which is one of the biggest hurdles in the Chinese economy. 'Our view has been that raising consumer spending in China as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) is really important, along with measures to address problems in the property sector,' Yellen said recently. 'So far, I would say, I haven't really heard any policies on the Chinese side that address that.' Yellen has criticized China for its focus on subsidizing large state-owned companies instead of working to revive the wider economy, the world's second largest. Analysts have suggested that China should stop subsidizing manufacturing companies with the money of households. The World Bank has predicted that China's GDP growth will be 4.8% this year, short of the country's 5% goal. It will slip further to 4.3% in 2025, the bank predicted. Low consumer demand in China can bring down the rate of growth in the global economy and affect the prospects of businesses in the U.S. and other parts of the world. 'For U.S. companies like Apple, Nike, Microsoft, KFC, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Tesla or General Motors, to name a few, China is a big market. Any increase or decrease in consumption in China can influence their bottom line,' Lourdes Casanova, director at Cornell University's Emerging Markets Institute, told VOA. There are serious fears about the U.S. and the European Union slipping into recession, said Francesco Sisci, an expert on China affairs and director of Appia Institute, an Italy-based think tank. 'In China, there's deflation and no sign of getting out of it. If China doesn't get out of deflation, it could multiply recessionary forces worldwide. It might actually happen,' Sisci said. Tendency to save, not spend China has taken several measures to revive the economy in recent weeks. They include lowering mortgage rates and cutting the reserve requirement ratios (RRR) to encourage banks to lend more money. The idea is to support households repaying home loans and encourage people to purchase more houses from the crisis-hit property business. However, analysts are not convinced about the effectiveness of the move. 'Housing demand is unlikely to see any meaningful revival just because of lower mortgage rates and down payment requirements, as experience shows,' the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) said in a commentary. Casanova thinks low consumer demand is not an easy problem to resolve because the average Chinese believes in savings more than spending. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) as a percentage of GDP stands at 68% in the United States, 53% in Europe and 39% in China. Americans represent 31% of global PCE, while China's people represent just 11%. 'There is room for improvement in China but, you can't change consumers' habits overnight and, clearly, Chinese consumers are much thriftier than the American ones,' she said. Americans often keep their cars outside the garage because garages are full of household items, clothes, toys, garage tools and other things, she pointed out. One way to increase consumer demand is to increase salaries and take additional social security measures. But for companies that would increase production costs and hurt exports, Sisci said. 'What China needs is transformative reforms that would have a political price, and the ruling Communist Party is not eager to pay it,' he said. Contradicting the World Bank's view, China's Vice Minister of Finance Liao Min said the economy was responding positively to a series of stimulus measures taken by the government. 'These initiatives aim to leverage government spending to stimulate overall social investment and consumption, thereby increasing effective market demand,' Liao said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/low-consumer-spending-in-china-hinders-economy-there-and-abroad/7845928.html	2024-10-31T03:22:43-07:00	
North Korea leader says ICBM test 'appropriate military action' against enemies	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA/TOKYO — North Korea said it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday, upgrading what it called the 'world's most powerful strategic weapon,' as Seoul warned Pyongyang could get missile technology from Russia for helping with the war in Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the test was a warning to enemies that have been threatening the country's security, KCNA state news agency said. 'The test-fire is an appropriate military action that fully meets the purpose of informing the rivals, who have intentionally escalated the regional situation and posed a threat to the security of our Republic recently, of our counteraction will,' Kim was quoted as saying by KCNA. The muscle-flexing comes amid international outcry and rising alarm over what the U.S. and others say is North Korea's deployment of 11,000 troops to Russia -- 3,000 of them close to the western frontlines with Ukraine. The launch drew swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States. A day earlier, Seoul cited military intelligence suggesting the North may test-launch an ICBM or conduct a seventh nuclear test around the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, seeking to draw attention to its growing military prowess. Shin Seung-ki, head of research on North Korea's military at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, said the launch was likely to test improved booster performance of an existing ICBM -- possibly with Russia's help. 'North Korea will want to keep getting help like this, because it saves times and costs while improving performance and upgrading the stability of weapons system,' he said. It could also be Pyongyang's response to pressure over its engagement with Russia, Shin said. 'The intention may be to show that it will not bow to pressure, that it will respond to strength with strength, and also to seek some influence on the U.S. presidential election.' New records The launch early on Thursday was the longest ballistic missile test by the North with a flight-time of 87 minutes, according to South Korea. KCNA said the test set new records of its missile capabilities. The missile took off on a sharply lofted trajectory from an area near the North's capital and splashed down about 200 kilometers west of Japan's Okushiri island, off Hokkaido. It reached an altitude of 7,000 kilometers and flew a distance of 1,000 kilometers, the Japanese government said. The so-called lofted trajectory of a projectile flying at a sharply raised angle is intended to test its thrust and stability over much shorter distances relative to the designed range, partly for safety and to avoid the political fallout of sending a missile far into the Pacific. North Korea's last ICBM, dubbed the Hwasong-18, was tested in December 2023. Fueled by solid-propellant and fired from a road launcher, it was also launched at a sharply raised angle and flew for 73 minutes, translating to a potential range of 15,000 kilometers on a normal trajectory. That is a distance that puts anywhere in the mainland United States within range. South Korea announced on Thursday new export controls on materials needed by North Korea to produce solid-fuel missiles. Asked about the missile launch, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said China 'has always believed that peace and stability, and promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue are in accordance with the common interests of all sides.' Pyongyang's latest test came just hours after U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-hyun met in Washington to condemn the North Korean troop deployment in Russia. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have directly acknowledged the deployment, but Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia on Wednesday questioned why its allies like North Korea could not help Moscow in its war against Ukraine when Western countries claim the right to help Kyiv. South Korea said the deployment directly threatened its security because the North would gain valuable combat experience in a modern warfare and was likely to be rewarded by Moscow with 'technology transfers' in areas such as tactical nuclear weapons, ICBMs, ballistic missile submarines, and military reconnaissance satellites.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-leader-says-icbm-test-appropriate-military-action-against-enemies/7845919.html	2024-10-31T03:06:40-07:00	
Trump, Harris discuss China through the lens of domestic concerns	Washington — With domestic hot-button issues dominating the final week of the U.S. presidential campaign, any mention of the U.S.-China competition by candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump has been through the lens of domestic concerns, analysts say. 'American voters are more concerned about domestic issues. Polls show that the so-called China threat ranks behind the economy, immigration, abortion, climate, democracy and other issues for voters,' said Liu Yawei, director of the Carter Center's China Program. According to a survey released by YouGov, a U.S. polling organization, only a minority of voters listed U.S. foreign policy as one of the top three issues for them. The survey found Trump’s supporters cared slightly more about foreign policy than Harris’ supporters. China and domestic policies Any mention of China has largely been in the context of domestic issues. In an October 27 rally in New York City, Trump mentioned China twice, saying that if the United States and China were to go to war, the U.S. would 'beat them,' and that he would 'pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, meaning if China or any other country charges us a 100 or 200% tax or tariff, we [the United States] will then charge them a 100 or 200% tax or tariff.' Harris made no mention of China during a rally on the same day in the key swing state of Pennsylvania. Trump has focused on the potential economic effects of competition with China as it relates to American jobs, highlighting trade concerns, flooding of goods, and unfair business practices. 'China has been killing us in trade for years. If I get elected, that’s going to stop,' said Trump at a rally in Cedar Rapids Iowa, in July. At the Republican National Convention in July, Trump condemned China over several matters including an accusation that Beijing has taken away jobs in the American auto manufacturing industry and that China has posed threats Taiwan. At a rally in April, Trump said many migrants coming to the U.S. from China are men of 'military' or 'fighting' age who may be coming here to form a sort of 'army.' Trump has also mentioned China in the context of the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. 'They’re flooding our country with illegal drugs like fentanyl, killing Americans. This has to end, and it’s going to end when we bring tough measures back against China,' he said at a town hall event in New Hampshire in May. Although Harris has had less to say about China on the campaign trail, she mentioned China at the Democratic National Convention in August, saying she would work to ensure the United States wins the competition on being the global leader in artificial intelligence and space. She 'advocates 'de-risking' — reducing interdependence between the United States and China in arenas of advanced technology, principally to ensure that Washington is not assisting Beijing's military modernization — but she has warned against a tariff-centric economic policy toward China,' said Ali Wyne, a senior researcher at the International Crisis Group, as he described her policies on China. But the two candidates and their respective political parties have more in common than differences in their rhetoric on China, said Dennis Wilder, the CIA’s former deputy assistant director for East Asia and the Pacific and National Security Council's (NSC) director for China under President George W. Bush. 'China has not been debated in this election because the American public and political class almost universally share the same negative views of China. Polling shows favorable views of China in the U.S. in single digits.' While Washington’s policies toward Beijing can impact domestic issues such as jobs and cost of products, conflicts in other parts of the world have also overshadowed U.S. policy toward China in the eyes of many American voters, analysts said. 'Strategic competition between the United States and China is not top of mind for American voters. They are more concerned about the state of the economy and the cost of health care, said Wyne. 'And to the extent that foreign policy issues are shaping their considerations, they are understandably focused on a raging war between Russia and Ukraine and the potential for a regional war in the Middle East.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-harris-discuss-china-through-the-lens-of-domestic-concerns/7845906.html	2024-10-31T02:39:37-07:00	
European allies face challenging times, whoever wins US presidential election	BERLIN — The United States' European allies are bracing for an America that's less interested in them no matter who wins the presidential election — and for old traumas and new problems if Donald Trump returns to the White House. The election comes more than 2 1/2 years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in which Washington has made the single biggest contribution to Kyiv's defense. There are question marks over whether that would continue under Trump, and how committed he would be to NATO allies in general. A win by Vice President Kamala Harris could be expected to bring a continuation of current policy, though with Republican opposition and growing war fatigue among the U.S. public there are concerns in Europe that support would wane. Trump's appetite for imposing tariffs on U.S. partners also is causing worry in a Europe already struggling with sluggish economic growth. But it's not just the possibility of a second Trump presidency that has the continent anxious about tougher times ahead. European officials believe U.S. priorities lie elsewhere, no matter who wins. The Middle East is top of President Joe Biden’s list right now, but the long-term priority is China. 'The centrality of Europe to U.S. foreign policy is different than it was in Biden’s formative years,' said Rachel Tausendfreund, a senior research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. 'And in that way, it is true that Biden is the last trans-Atlantic president.' The U.S. will continue to pivot toward Asia, she said. 'That means Europe has to step up. Europe has to become a more capable partner and also become more capable of managing its own security area.' Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, remarked when he signed a new defense pact with NATO ally Britain that the U.S. will focus more on the Indo-Pacific region, 'so it is only a question of, will they do much less in Europe because of that or only a little bit less.' Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels, said that 'above all, Europe is looking for predictability from Washington,' and that's in short supply in a turbulent world in which any administration will face other demands on its attention. 'But the potential for disruption is clearly greater in the case of a potential Trump administration.' 'There is an assumption of essential continuity' under Harris that's probably well-founded, he said, with many people who have shaped policy under Biden likely to remain. 'It's very much the known world, even if the strategic environment produces uncertainties of its own.' While both the U.S. and Europe have been increasingly focused on competition with Asia, the ongoing war in Europe means 'the potential costs of a shift away from European security on the American side are very much higher today than they might have been a few years ago,' Lesser said. Europe's ability to deal with that depends on how quickly it happens, he said. Europe's lagging defense spending irked U.S. administrations of both parties for years, though NATO members including Germany raised their game after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. NATO forecasts that 23 of the 32 allies will meet its target of spending 2% or more of gross domestic product on defense this year, compared to only three a decade ago. During his 2017-21 term, Trump threatened to abandon ' delinquent ' countries if they weren’t paying their 'bills.' In campaigning this time, he suggested that Russia could do what it wants with them. His bluster has undermined trust and worried countries nearest to an increasingly unpredictable Russia, like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Europeans see the war in Ukraine as an existential challenge in a way the United States eventually may not, even with some signs of war fatigue emerging in Europe itself. If Trump wins, 'there's every indication that he has no interest in continuing to support Ukraine in this war' and will push quickly for some kind of cease-fire or peace agreement deal that Kyiv may not like and Europe may not be ready for, Tausendfreund said. 'And there is also just no way that Europe can fill the military gap left if the U.S. were to withdraw support.' 'Even with a Harris administration there is a growing, changing debate — frankly, on both sides of the Atlantic — about what comes next in the war in Ukraine, what is the end game,' Lesser said. Biden emphasized the need to stay the course in Ukraine during a brief recent visit to Berlin when he conferred with German, French and British leaders. 'We cannot let up. We must sustain our support,' Biden said. 'In my view, we must keep going until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace.' The times he has lived through have taught him that 'we should never underestimate the power of democracy, never underestimate the value of alliances,' the 81-year-old Biden added. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who bestowed Germany's highest honor on Biden for his service to trans-Atlantic relations, hopes Biden's compatriots are listening. 'In the months to come, I hope that Europeans remember: America is indispensable for us,' he said. 'And I also hope that Americans remember: Your allies are indispensable for you. We are more than just ‘other countries’ in the world —we are partners, we are friends.' Whoever wins the White House, the coming years could be bumpy. 'Whatever the outcome next week, half of the country will go away angry,' Lesser said, noting there's 'every prospect' of divided government in Washington. 'Europe is going to face a very chaotic and sometimes dysfunctional America.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-allies-face-challenging-times-whoever-wins-us-presidential-election/7845899.html	2024-10-31T02:12:42-07:00	
Palestinian health officials say Israeli raid kills 3 in West Bank	Palestinian health officials said an Israeli raid Thursday in the occupied West Bank killed at least three people. The operation included airstrikes in the area of the Nur Shams refugee camp. The Israeli military said it was targeting 'terrorist infrastructure' and that it killed a Hamas militant who was involved in planning attacks. Since Hamas attacked southern Israel in October 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 763 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israeli airstrikes Wednesday hit the historic eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, killing at least 19 people, according to Lebanon's health ministry. Hours before it struck, Israel's military issued evacuation orders for the entire city and parts of eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, where Baalbek is located. Tens of thousands of Lebanese fled in a chaotic scene of panic, one Lebanese civil defense official said. 'The whole city is in a panic trying to figure out where to go; there's a huge traffic jam,' Bilal Raad, regional head of the Lebanese civil defense, told Reuters. Baalbek is the site of a Roman temple complex listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Israel's warning said it was targeting Hezbollah. It has also issued evacuation orders before military strikes in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. U.N. officials and humanitarian organizations have criticized the evacuation orders, saying civilians have little chance to prepare and often nowhere safe to go. U.S. President Joe Biden and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides met at the White House on Wednesday to discuss how to bring an end to the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza. Cyprus, the European Union nation closest to Gaza, has played a key role in enabling the delivery of humanitarian aid into the territory. After his meeting with Biden, Christodoulides said he was 'quite optimistic' that a Lebanese cease-fire deal would be reached soon. Senior White House officials Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein are scheduled to be in Israel on Thursday. There, they will discuss a wide range of issues, including cease-fire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon and the release of the hostages that Hamas still holds. New Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said Wednesday that the militant group would continue fighting Israel in Lebanon and northern Israel until it is offered cease-fire terms it considers acceptable. 'If the Israelis decide to stop the aggression, we say that we accept, but according to the conditions that we see as suitable,' Kassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a recorded televised address. 'We will not beg for a cease-fire as we will continue [fighting] ... no matter how long it takes,' he said. His remarks came a day after being named the militant group's new leader, replacing longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb in late September. Kassem had served as Nasrallah's deputy for more than three decades. Kassem's speech came as international mediators launched a new push for negotiated cease-fires in Lebanon and in Gaza, where Israeli forces have been fighting Hamas militants for more than a year. Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen said the government's security Cabinet is discussing the terms of a truce with Hezbollah in south Lebanon, where Israeli troops are conducting a ground offensive. 'There are discussions. I think it will still take time,' Cohen told Israeli public radio. Israel's Channel 12 television said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held talks with top officials Tuesday evening on Israel's demands in return for a 60-day truce with Hezbollah. Israel is demanding that Hezbollah pull back to north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometers from the Israeli frontier. In addition, Israel wants the Lebanese army to deploy along the border, an international intervention mechanism to enforce the truce, and that Israel will remain free to respond militarily in case of threats. The war in Lebanon erupted late last month, nearly a year after Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border fire into Israel in support of Hamas following its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The war has killed at least 1,754 people in Lebanon since September 23, according to an Agence France-Presse tally of health ministry figures, although the actual number is likely to be higher due to gaps in the data. Israel's military says 37 of its soldiers have died in its Lebanon campaign since it launched ground operations on Sept. 30. The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, while the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people. VOA U.N.

Spain searches for bodies after flood of the century kills at least 95	BARRIO DE LA TORRE, Spain — Survivors of the worst natural disaster to hit Spain this century awoke to scenes of devastation on Thursday after villages were wiped out by monstrous flash floods that claimed at least 95 lives. The death toll could rise as search efforts continue with an unknown number of people still missing. The aftermath looked eerily similar to the damage left by a strong hurricane or tsunami. Wrecked vehicles, tree branches, downed power lines and household items all mired in a layer of mud covered the streets of Utiel, just one of dozens of towns in the hard-hit region of Valencia, where 92 people died between late Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Walls of rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that ripped into the ground floors of homes and swept away cars, people and anything else in its path. 'The neighborhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it's literally smashed up,' said Christian Viena, a bar owner in the Valencian village of Barrio de la Torre. Regional authorities said late Wednesday it appeared there was no one left stranded on rooftops or in cars in need of rescue after helicopters had saved some 70 people. But ground crews and citizens continued to inspect vehicles and homes that were damaged by the onslaught of water. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is heading to the region to witness the destruction firsthand as the nation starts a three-day period of official mourning. Thousands of people were left without water and electricity, and hundreds were stranded after their cars were wrecked or roads were blocked. The region remained partly isolated with several roads cut off and train lines interrupted, including the high-speed service to Madrid, which officials say won't be repaired for several days. While Valencia took the brunt of the storm, another two casualties were reported in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region. Southern Andalusia reported one death. The relative calm of the day after has also given time to reflect and question if authorities could have done more to save lives. The regional government is being criticized for not sending out flood warnings to people's mobile phones until 8 p.m. Tuesday, when the flooding had already started in some parts. Spain's Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding. But this was the most powerful flash flood event in recent memory. Scientists link it to climate change, which is also behind increasingly high temperatures and droughts in Spain and the heating up of the Mediterranean Sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-searches-for-bodies-after-flood-of-the-century-kills-at-least-95/7845891.html	2024-10-31T01:56:15-07:00	
Uganda struggles to feed 1.7 million refugees as international support dwindles	RWAMWANJA, Uganda — For months, Agnes Bulaba, a Congolese refugee in Uganda, has had to get by without the food rations she once depended on. Her children scavenge among local communities for whatever they can find to eat. 'As a woman who's not married, life is hard,' Bulaba told The Associated Press. Some locals 'keep throwing stones at us, but we just want to feed our kids and buy them some clothes,' said the mother of six, who often works as a prostitute to fend for her family. Uganda is home to more than 1.7 million refugees, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Despite being renowned for welcoming those fleeing neighboring violence, Ugandan officials and humanitarians say dwindling international support coupled with high numbers of refugees have put much pressure on host communities. Approximately 10,000 new arrivals enter Uganda each month, according to U.N. figures. Some have recently fled the war in Sudan, but most are from neighboring South Sudan and Congo. Bulaba is among tens of thousands in Rwamwanja, a refugee settlement in southwestern Uganda. As in other settlements across the east African country, refugees there are given small plots of land to cultivate as they are slowly weaned off total dependence on humanitarian food rations. Since 2021, as funding consistently declined, the U.N.'s World Food Program has prioritized the most vulnerable groups for food assistance, in food items or cash, which can be as little as $3. After spending three months in Uganda, refugees are eligible to get 60% rations, and the number falls by half after six months. Only new arrivals get 100% food assistance, leaving the vast majority of some 99,000 refugees in Bulaba's settlement vulnerable to hunger and other impoverishment. In 2017, the Ugandan government and the U.N. held a summit in Kampala, the capital, and appealed for $8 billion to deal with the sharp influx of refugees from South Sudan at the time. Only $350 million was pledged. Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, visited Uganda last week in a trip partly aimed to underscore the funding shortage. The international community 'should not take Uganda's generosity and the global public good it provides for granted,' Grandi said in a statement at the end of his visit. 'Services here are overstretched. Natural resources are limited, and financial support is not keeping pace with the needs.' He also said international support 'is urgently needed to sustain Uganda's commitment to refugees,' urging donors and humanitarian partners to 'come together with the government to address the needs of refugees and the generous communities hosting them.' Refugees in Uganda have access to the same hospitals as locals, and their children can attend school. While this helps integrate them into the Ugandan community, sometimes the competition for limited resources sparks tension. However, violence is rarely reported. Hillary Onek, the Ugandan government minister in charge of refugees, said during Grandi's visit that local officials need support to help refugees become more self-reliant. Though he said the country was 'overloaded' with refugees, he cited several training options to help refugees become self-sufficient, including carpentry, bricklaying and metal welding. 'We are trying to be innovative,' he said. 'Given the fact that funding for refugee programs dwindled over the years, there is not enough money to meet their demands, not even giving them enough food to eat.' Onek said the alternative is 'to survive on your own, using your skills, using whatever capacity you have.' But Bulaba, the Congolese refugee who has been in Uganda since 2014 after fleeing violence in her home country with her two children, said she can't find a job. She has since had four other children who often go barefoot and without appropriate clothing. She misses the cash-for-food stipend she used to get. 'For us to eat, we look for work, but there's no work,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-struggles-to-feed-1-7-million-refugees-as-international-support-dwindles/7845883.html	2024-10-31T01:43:39-07:00	
Use of firecrackers renews air pollution debate in India ahead of Diwali	NEW DELHI — As India gears up for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, people are divided over whether they should celebrate by setting off firecrackers, which worsen the country's chronic air pollution. Diwali, which will be celebrated Thursday, is marked by socializing and exchanging gifts with family and friends. Many Indians light earthen oil lamps or candles. But every year the festivities are tinged with worries over air pollution, as smoke-emitting firecrackers cause toxic smog that can take days to clear. The capital, New Delhi, which is among India's worst cities for air quality, is particularly impacted by the problem and is usually shrouded in toxic gray smog a day after Diwali. Authorities there and in some other states have banned the use and sale of firecrackers since 2017, asking people to opt for more sustainable options like environmentally friendly firecrackers and light shows, but the rule is often flouted. Firecrackers can be easily bought from roadside stalls and stores. Some residents in New Delhi say the ban doesn't make much difference, while others see it as a necessary measure to fight pollution. Vegetable vendor Renu, who only uses one name, loves celebrating Diwali in the city. Every year her kids set off firecrackers at night. She tells them to be careful but not to refrain from using them. 'Diwali is a day of celebration and happiness for us which comes only once a year, and I feel the ban should not be there,' she said. Others are against it. Unlike most kids, Ruhaani Mandal, 13, doesn't light firecrackers. She acknowledges it is fun but says it is hazardous for people and animals. 'I have seen firsthand the struggle of my father, who has lost his sense of smell due to pollution, and I see how his health worsens after Diwali celebrations,' she said. New Delhi and several northern Indian cities typically see extremely high levels of air pollution between October and January each year, disrupting businesses and shutting schools and offices. Authorities close construction sites, restrict diesel-run vehicles and deploy water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to control the haze and smog that envelopes the skyline. This year, thick, toxic smog has already started to engulf New Delhi. On Wednesday, authorities reported an AQI of over 300, which is categorized as 'very poor.' Several studies have estimated that more than a million Indians die each year from air pollution-related diseases. A high level of tiny particulate matter can lodge deep into the lungs and cause major health problems, including chronic respiratory diseases. New Delhi's woes aren't only due to firecrackers. Vehicular emissions, farm fires in neighboring states and dust from construction are the primary causes of the capital's air pollution woes. But health experts say the smoke emitted from firecrackers can be more hazardous. 'The smoke that is produced by firecrackers contains heavy metals like sulphur, lead and toxic gases like carbon monoxide and fumes of heavy metals that are dangerous to our respiratory system,' said Arun Kumar Sharma, a community medicine professor at New Delhi's University College of Medical Sciences. Meanwhile, authorities in New Delhi have largely failed to enforce a strict ban on the use of firecrackers to avoid offending millions of Hindus across the country, for whom Diwali is one of the biggest festivals. To sidestep the ban, many sellers offer firecrackers online, some with the convenience of home delivery. Shopkeeper Gyaanchand Goyal said the ban on firecrackers has disadvantaged sellers like him and affected their biggest source of income during the festive season. 'The government enforces a restriction on firecrackers solely to demonstrate their commitment to the environment. Other than that, I don't think there are any other consequences of this ban,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/use-of-firecrackers-renews-air-pollution-debate-in-india-ahead-of-diwali/7845877.html	2024-10-31T01:21:49-07:00	
Taiwan shuts down as strong Typhoon Kong-rey hits, 1 dead	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A strong Typhoon Kong-rey made landfall on Taiwan's east coast on Thursday, the largest storm by size to hit the island in nearly 30 years, closing financial markets, causing hundreds of flights to be canceled and reducing rail services. The typhoon knocked out power to nearly half a million households, the government said. The storm hit the mountainous and sparsely populated east coast county of Taitung, according to Taiwan's Central Weather Administration, with strong winds and torrential rain affecting almost all the island. The fire department reported one person had died when their truck hit a fallen tree in central Taiwan. At one point a super typhoon, Kong-rey slightly weakened overnight but remained powerful as the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane packing gusts of more than 250 kph (155 mph), according to Tropical Storm Risk. Taiwan's weather administration put the typhoon's size at the biggest to hit the island since 1996. 'I hope that everyone in the country will co-operate in avoiding disaster and refraining from engaging in dangerous behavior such as wave watching during the typhoon,' President Lai Ching-te wrote on his Facebook page. Administration forecaster Gene Huang said after hitting the east coast it would head toward the Taiwan Strait as a much weakened storm and urged people across the island to stay at home due to the danger of high winds. Environmental officials were working on Thursday to prevent oil leaking from a Chinese cargo ship beached against rocks on Taiwan's northern coast after losing power in turbulent weather. Warnings for destructive winds of more than 160 kph (100 mph) were issued in Taitung, whose outlying Lanyu island recorded gusts above 260 kph (162 mph) before some of the wind-barometers there went offline. 'It was terrifying last night. Many people on the island didn't sleep, worrying about something happening to their house,' Sinan Rapongan, a government official on Lanyu, also known as Orchid Island, told Reuters. Some roofs had been damaged and more than 1,300 homes had lost power but so far no injuries had been reported, she added. Parts of eastern Taiwan recorded one meter (3.3 feet) of rainfall since the typhoon began approaching on Wednesday. The defense ministry has put 36,000 troops on standby to help with rescue efforts, while almost 10,000 people have been evacuated from high risk areas ahead of time, the government said. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's largest contract chipmaker and major supplier to companies like Apple and Nvidia, said it has activated routine typhoon alert preparation procedures at all its factories and construction sites. 'We do not expect significant impact to our operations,' it said in an emailed statement. Taiwan's transport ministry said 314 international flights had been canceled, along with all domestic flights. Taiwan's high speed railway, which connects major cities on its populated western plains, continued to operate with a much-reduced service. Kong-rey is forecast to graze China along the coast of Fujian province on Friday morning. China's financial hub Shanghai is bracing for potentially the worst rains in more than 40 years. Subtropical Taiwan is frequently hit by typhoons. The last one, Typhoon Krathon, killed four people earlier this month as it passed through the south of the island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-shuts-down-as-strong-typhoon-kong-rey-hits-1-dead/7845876.html	2024-10-31T01:04:40-07:00	
Slovak PM Fico visits China in attempt for a pro-Beijing diplomatic turn	Vienna — Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico begins a six-day visit to China Thursday that includes a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and stops in the central city of Hefei and Shanghai to attend the opening ceremony for this year's China International Import Expo. Analysts say China is hoping to use the visit to strengthen ties with Slovak’s prime minister who is an ally of Viktor Orban and, like Hungary’s leader, has been critical of Russian sanctions and the EU’s support of Ukraine. Since coming to power, Fico has been interested in a more pro-China foreign policy. His trip to China, which was scheduled for June, was aborted due to an assassination attempt in May and has not been possible until now. Fico is the longest-serving prime minister since the founding of the Republic of Slovakia in 1993. Since first taking office in 2006, Fico has stepped down twice between 2010 and 2012 and between 2018 and 2023. In 2018, he resigned and gave way to his political ally, Peter Pellegrini, because of a political crisis sparked by the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak. After Pellegrini's defeat in the 2020 parliamentary elections, the Ordinary People and the Independent Personalities Party formed a new coalition government. During this period, Slovakia pushed for a more pro-Taiwan and values-oriented diplomatic line, which drew resentment in Beijing. In the 2023 parliamentary elections, Fico won again and returned to power. The Fico government advocates an 'all-azimuth' foreign policy, including strengthening cooperation with Russia and China. In addition to this year's trip to China, Fico plans to visit Russia next year to attend the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Matej Šimalčík, executive director of the Central European Institute of Asian Studies, told VOA the so-called 'all-azimuth' foreign policy is a euphemism that means 'to engage in economic relations with any country, without taking any considerations for political values, human rights, or security considerations.' Šimalčík said, 'Fico’s government has also markedly toned down the scope of interactions with Taiwan, with some of his close political allies being outright proponents of PRC’s [China’s] interpretation of the 'One-China Principle,' which holds that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. Filip Šebok, head of the Prague office at the Central European Institute of Asian Studies, said, 'Fico has many times declared he does not want ‘Brussels’ to dictate Slovakia on these issues, and for him, it is a way to boost his credentials in leading a ‘sovereign’ Slovak foreign policy, despite criticism. 'Actually, domestically, it is good for Fico to claim he is doing something that is opposite to what is the Western mainstream, as he can maintain the support of his electorate. It is also a way to differentiate from the previous government, which was hawkish on Russia, and on China to some extent as well.' Analysts say that Fico's visit to China also serves an economic purpose. Pavel Havlíček, a research fellow at the Association for International Affairs, said Fico is seeking partnerships and investments from countries outside of Europe. 'Among them, Russia and China are playing a special place, as was repeatedly mentioned when — for example — referring to the plan of the Slovak government to restore economic relations with Russia after the war. 'In the case of the PRC, the Slovak government is seeing investments and enhanced relations, too, to compensate for the lack of economic growth.' Šebok said the Slovak government has pledged to focus more on supporting economic engagement, such as boosting Slovak exporters or attracting investments in Slovakia. 'The government has, for example, increased the number of economic diplomats around the world and also opened new embassies in Asia or Africa explaining them mostly as a way to boost economic diplomacy,' Šebok said. 'In this perspective, China is presented as a major economic partner, and Fico will be leading a relatively large business delegation to China. Fico specifically wants to engage China in PPP [public private partnership] projects for the reconstruction/construction of transport infrastructure around the country.' Fico plans to work with China to promote large-scale infrastructure projects in Slovakia, including the reconstruction of roads and bridges, the expansion of the railway between the capital Bratislava and the city of Komárno, the completion of the Bratislava highway bypass and the construction of a hydroelectric power plant. In the recent vote on European tariffs on electric vehicles from China, the Fico government voted against it. 'Slovakia, through the Volkswagen plant, has exported a large number of cars to China,' Šebok said. 'It is particularly exposed to Chinese retaliation to EU tariffs on Chinese EV imports, as China directly hinted that it might target large engine vehicles from the EU, which are exported from Germany and Slovakia. 'What is paradoxical is that tariffs on Chinese EVs can actually be also indirectly good for Slovakia, as they can push more Chinese EV producers to set up manufacturing in Europe as a way to avoid tariffs,' he added.

Musk's X ineffective against surge of US election misinformation, report says	The crowd-sourced fact-checking feature of Elon Musk's X, Community Notes, is 'failing to counter false' claims about the U.S. election, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) said in a report Wednesday. Out of the 283 misleading posts that CCDH has analyzed on the digital social media platform, 209 or 74% of the posts did not show accurate notes to all X users correcting false and misleading claims about the elections, the report said. 'The 209 misleading posts in our sample that did not display available Community Notes to all users have amassed 2.2 billion views,' CCDH said, urging the company to invest in safety and transparency. X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. X launched its 'Community Notes' feature last year, which allows users to comment on posts to flag false or misleading content, in effect crowd-sourcing fact checking to users rather than a dedicated team of fact checkers. The report comes after X lost a lawsuit brought by CCDH earlier this year that faulted it for allowing a rise in hate speech on the social media platform. Social media platforms, including X, have been under scrutiny for years over the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, including false information about elections and vaccines. Secretaries of state from five U.S. states urged billionaire Musk in August to fix X's AI chatbot, saying it had spread misinformation related to the November 5 election. Musk, who endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in July, himself has been accused of spreading misinformation. Polls show Trump is in a tight race with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-s-x-ineffective-against-surge-of-us-election-misinformation-report-says/7845866.html	2024-10-31T00:37:33-07:00	
Botswana counts votes as ruling party seeks to extend its 6-decade rule	Gaborone, Botswana — The arid and sparsely populated African nation of Botswana counted votes Thursday from elections expected to return President Mokgweetsi Masisi to office after a first term marked by growing unemployment and concerns over the diamond-dependent economy. Voting on Wednesday was orderly in a country proud of its democratic system installed on independence from Britain in 1966, making it the oldest democracy in the region although it has always been governed by the same party. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) is confident the results, which are expected late Thursday, will extend its 58 years in power, although commentators said weakened support may see the country's first hung parliament. Counting for the municipal ballot started immediately as polls closed late Wednesday while the parliamentary ballot boxes were transported to separate centers. With 61 parliamentary seats up for grabs, Botswana's first-past-the-post system means the first party to 31 seats will be declared the winner and install its candidate as president. Masisi, one of four presidential candidates, said after casting his ballot Wednesday he was confident that 'victory is certain.' But many voters said it was time for a change amid allegations of government corruption, nepotism and mismanagement. Most of Botswana's financial assets are held by a wealthy 10% of its people and the gap between rich and poor is one of the largest in the world, according to the World Bank. Unemployment rose to 27% as the economy suffered from a slump in the market for diamonds, its main source of income. 'The first priority for the next government or president would be to stabilize the economy, create a degree of strategic certainty in the mining sector,' political commentator Olopeng Rabasimane said. 'The second has to be employment generation, especially for young people. The third one would be diversification of the economy away from dependency on diamonds,' he said. Masisi acknowledged concerns about a decline in Botswana's foreign reserves and weakened international diamond sales, saying the government would increase local investments as a countermeasure. 'We intend to address that by putting money into the pockets of citizens and building infrastructure,' he told reporters. But the country needs more than construction, said Rabasimane. 'You cannot build roads only where there is no money to service those roads.' In 2023 growth fell to 2.7% from 5.5% in 2022, the IMF says. It is projected at 1% in 2024. Weakened opposition Masisi was elected in 2019 with around 52% of votes. The party is not expected to win many more this time and the opposition has been weakened by division. Ahead of the election, two key parties quit the left-leaning Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), whose leader Duma Boko, 54, is also in the running. The populist Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and social democratic Botswana Congress Party (BCP) are fielding their own candidates, Mephato Reatile, 57, and Dumelang Saleshando, 53, respectively. The independent Mmegi newspaper said this week that 'historical momentum and the limping opposition' suggested that a BDP victory appeared evident. The UDC has claimed several irregularities around voting day. 'Our fear is that we are going to have another rigged election just as in 2019,' the head of a UDC monitoring group, Mike Keakopa, said. The party would decide later whether to take these complaints to court or choose other action, he said. Its attempt to have the results of the 2019 election thrown out over alleged irregularities was dismissed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-counts-votes-as-ruling-party-seeks-to-extend-its-6-decade-rule/7845861.html	2024-10-31T00:26:27-07:00	
Iran wary over US presidential election	TEHRAN, Iran — America's presidential election next week comes just after Iran marks the 45th anniversary of the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis — and for many, tensions between Tehran and Washington feel just as high as they did then. Iran remains locked in the Mideast wars roiling the region, with its allies — militant groups and fighters of its self-described 'Axis of Resistance' — battered as Israel presses its war in the Gaza Strip targeting Hamas and its invasion of Lebanon amid devastating attacks against Hezbollah. At the same time, Iran still appears to be assessing damage from Israel's strikes on the Islamic Republic last Saturday in response to two Iranian ballistic missile attacks. Iran's currency, the rial, hovers near record lows against the dollar, battered by international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program of enriching uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. In public spaces, women still openly defy Iran's mandatory law on the headscarf, or hijab, a result of the mass demonstrations over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini that still haunts the country. That has left a feel of fatalism among some on the streets of the capital, Tehran, as Americans cast ballots for either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. Many are split on which candidate would be better for their country — if at all. 'All U.S presidents elected after the (1979) revolution had the same views about Iran and I think that’s unlikely to change,' said Sadegh Rabbani, 65. Harris and Trump have offer hard-line views on Iran Both candidates have either undertaken or expressed tough stances on Iran. In 2018, Trump unilaterally pulled America out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, setting off years of attacks across the Middle East even before Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Trump has been briefed on Iranian plots to retaliate against him, as well over his decision to launch a 2020 drone strike that killed Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad. Harris, meanwhile, vowed at the September presidential debate that she would always 'give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel.' For its part, the Biden administration did try indirect negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program that produced no tangible results, though it did reach one prisoner swap deal that saw five Americans detained for years in Iran walk free in September 2023. In an outdoor coffeeshop in downtown Tehran, popular among the youth, 22-year-old Zahra Rezaei said she preferred a Harris win. 'We saw Trump in the past and he just ran an anti-Iran policy,' Rezaei told The Associated Press. 'It is time for a woman ... I think she (Harris) will better since she is not after war.' Ebrahim Shiri, a 28-year-old postgraduate political sciences student, agreed. 'I think Harris knows the world better,' he said. 'She and (Joe) Biden convinced Israel not to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities. This mean moving toward peace.' Others believe Trump, with his promises of dealmaking, might be a better fit. 'I do not know what the American people think, but Trump is able to get a quick deal with Iran,' said Mohammad Ali Raoufi, 43, who runs a double-glazed window workshop. 'The Biden administration including Harris failed to reach any (deal) with Iran over the past years when they were in power.' Reza Ghaemi, a 31-year-old taxi driver, also suggested Trump may lessen tensions in the region since he pushed to withdraw U.S. troops from the Mideast during his term in office. Iran's government wants sanctions gone Many declined to speak to the AP on camera — Iran has only state-run television and radio stations, so people are suspicious of reporters with video cameras working openly on the street. A woman walking by immediately tightened her previously loose headscarf after seeing the camera. Those who did speak to the AP mostly expressed worries about a direct United States-Iran war — especially if Trump wins. While saying he wants Trump to win 'for my own reasons,' 53-year-old Ahmad Moradi claimed that would make a U.S.-Iran war '100%' sure to happen. A woman who only gave her name as Mahnaz, fearing repercussions for speaking openly, suggested that Harris, as a woman, couldn’t reach any deals with Iran because 'men can talk to men.' 'I think if Trump is elected, it will be much harder for our kids. Of course it doesn’t matter which one is elected, it’s already tough for us,' said Fariba Oodi. 'We the Iranian people are trapped in some political game. And our kids are paying a price for that,' she added. 'But I still think if it’s Trump, it will be more difficult, especially for my son who is a student and plans to apply' to study in America. Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, elected after a helicopter crash killed hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, came to power on a promise to reach a deal to ease Western sanctions. Iranian officials maintain that separating nuclear negotiations from Mideast wars is possible, even as the U.S. has accused Iran of meddling in the November election, which Tehran denies. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Pezeshkian's administration, said Tehran wants to see a change in U.S. policies and a respect for the 'national sovereignty of other countries.' It also wants Washington to 'avoid tension-making activities as we witnessed in recent years,' she said. Analysts, however, see a difficult road ahead for any possible U.S.-Iran talks, no matter who wins next Tuesday. 'The talks will be a war of attrition,' Ali Soufi told the pro-reform Shargh newspaper. Saeed Nourmohammadi, another analyst, suggested such talks 'are unlikely to be fruitful.' But ultimately, any decision rests with Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 'You know, Khamenei has seen eight U.S. presidents' come and go, said Abbas Ghasemi, a 67-year-old retired teacher 'He knows how to deal with the next one.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-wary-over-us-presidential-election/7845855.html	2024-10-30T23:58:19-07:00	
Ukraine says Russian attack killed 1, injured dozens in Kharkiv	The governor of northeastern Ukraine’s Kharkiv region said Thursday one person was dead and 29 others injured after a Russian missile strike on a residential building. Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram the person killed in the late Wednesday attack was 11 years old. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russian attack hit a nine-story building, and he reiterated his calls for more help in defending Ukraine. 'Partners see what happens every day,' Zelenskyy said. 'In these circumstances, every delayed decision on their part means dozens or even hundreds more Russian bombs used against Ukraine. Their decisions are the lives of our people. That is why we must stop Russia together — and do so with all possible force.' Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said Thursday that Ukrainian air defenses downed a wave of drones targeting the Ukrainian capital overnight. Popko reported on Telegram that falling debris from downed drones damaged two residential buildings and an administrative building. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it shot down 21 Ukrainian drones. The intercepts took place over the Rostov, Kursk, Volgograd, Bryansk, Belgorod and Voronezh regions, and over the Black Sea, the ministry said. North Korean troops U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-hyun, urged North Korea on Wednesday to withdraw from Russia an estimated 10,000 troops, which both countries believe are headed to fight alongside Russia in its war in Ukraine. 'They're doing this because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has lost a lot of troops, a lot of troops. And, you know, he has a choice of either getting other people to help him, or he can mobilize. And he doesn't want to mobilize, because then the people in Russia will begin to understand the extent of his losses, of their losses,' Austin said during a joint news conference at the Pentagon. More than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022, U.S. officials say. Russia, they say, is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. 'Kim Jong Un didn't hesitate to sell out his young people and troops as cannon fodder mercenaries,' Kim Yong-hyun said. 'I believe such activities are a war crime that is not only anti-humanitarian but also anti-peaceful.' Western nations have expressed concerns about what Kim Jong Un's regime will get in return from Moscow for its troops. North Korea is under international sanctions for its illicit nuclear ballistic missile programs. The South Korean defense minister said it was likely that North Korea would seek nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile technology in exchange for the troops, escalating security threats on the peninsula and across the globe. UN Security Council meeting At the United Nations, Ukraine — with the support of the United States, Britain, France, Japan, South Korea, Slovenia and Malta — requested the Security Council meet to discuss the development. Russia's envoy dismissed the meeting, saying it was convened to tarnish Moscow with more lies and disinformation, adding it was 'bare-faced lies' that North Korean soldiers are in Russia. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia's comments appeared to contradict Putin, who last week did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia, saying it was up to Moscow to decide how to deploy them as part of a mutual defense security pact that he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. Nebenzia went on to assert that the Western nations were making accusations about North Korean troops assisting Moscow to lure South Korea into providing Ukraine with arms. 'We can see the Western spectacle in the Security Council today pursuing another goal. The Zelenskyy regime and collaborators for two years have been trying to compel the Republic of Korea [South Korea] to more actively cooperate with the Kyiv regime, and to have them provide and supply the much-needed lethal weapons. And here, the anti-Pyongyang frenzied rhetoric is very convenient for Washington, London and Brussels, because their own supply is something that the Kyiv regime has drained,' Nebenzia said. 'We do hope that our South Korean colleagues will be wise enough not to fall for this trick.' Since the war started, Seoul has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and sent both humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv but has not sent weapons, in line with its policy of not arming countries actively engaged in conflicts. On Tuesday, Seoul said it could consider sending weapons to Ukraine in response to the North dispatching troops to Russia. Troop estimates Ukraine's ambassador said as many as 12,000 North Korean troops are being trained at five training grounds in Russia's eastern military district. 'This contingent includes at least 500 officers of the DPRK army, with at least three generals from the general staff,' Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said, using the abbreviation for North Korea's full name. 'Subsequently, it is planned to form at least five units or formations from DPRK military personnel, consisting of 2,000 to 3,000 servicemen each.' The troops' identities are expected to be concealed, Kyslytsya said, and they will be provided with Russian military uniforms and weapons and identity papers. They are likely to be integrated into units with ethnic minorities from the Asian part of Russia, he said. 'According to available information, between October 23 and 28, at least seven aircraft carrying military personnel of up to 2,100 soldiers flew from the Eastern Military District to Russia's border with Ukraine,' Kyslytsya said, adding that they are expected to begin directly participating in combat operations against Ukrainian troops in November. The Pentagon said Tuesday that a 'small number' of North Korean troops have deployed to Russia's Kursk region, where they are likely to be used in combat against Ukrainian troops. Kyslytsya told the Security Council that they number about 400. Pyongyang and Moscow are in close contact and are entitled to develop bilateral relations in many fields, said North Korea's envoy, citing their strategic partnership treaty. 'If Russia's sovereignty and security interests are exposed to and threatened by continued dangerous attempts of the United States and the West, and if it is judged that we should respond to them with something, we will make a necessary decision,' Ambassador Kim Song told the council.

Americans are anxious and frustrated about the presidential campaign, an AP-NORC poll finds	WASHINGTON — Most Americans are feeling a lot of emotions heading into Election Day, but excitement is not one of them. A new poll from The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that about 7 in 10 Americans report feeling anxious or frustrated about the 2024 presidential campaign, and a similar share say they're interested. Only about one-third say they feel excited. There's a broad feeling of uncertainty hanging over the 2024 presidential contest during the last week of the campaign. The race is competitive nationally and in key swing states, according to recent polls, with neither Democrat Kamala Harris nor Republican Donald Trump showing a measurable advantage. At the same time, the candidates have offered closing arguments that are in stark contrast with each other, with Harris arguing that Trump is obsessed with revenge and his own personal needs, while Trump referred to Harris at a rally on Sunday night as 'a trainwreck who has destroyed everything in her path.' Some groups are even more anxious than they were four years ago, even though that election took place in the midst of a deadly pandemic. In 2020, an AP-NORC poll found that about two-thirds of Americans were anxious about the election, which is not statistically significant from the new result. But for partisans, anxiety is dialed a little higher. About 8 in 10 Democrats say anxious describes how they are feeling now, up slightly from around three-quarters in the last election. About two-thirds of Republicans are anxious, a moderate uptick from around 6 in 10 in 2020. Independents, by contrast, haven't shifted meaningfully, and they're also feeling less worried than Democrats or Republicans. About half say they are anxious, similar to the finding in 2020. Other emotions have gotten more intense compared to past election cycles, including excitement. About one-third of Americans report feeling excited about the 2024 campaign, up from around one-quarter in 2016. But a majority of Americans say they are not excited about this year's race. One thing has stayed fairly constant, though: Americans' level of frustration with the campaign. Roughly 7 in 10 Americans say frustrated describes their emotional state, similar to 2020. For those Americans, though, there is light on the horizon — soon, the election will be over. The poll of 1,233 adults was conducted Oct. 24-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.	https://www.voanews.com/a/americans-are-anxious-and-frustrated-about-the-presidential-campaign-an-ap-norc-poll-finds-/7845844.html	2024-10-30T22:31:54-07:00	
2 Mexican journalists shot dead in past 24 hours	MEXICO CITY — Two Mexican journalists were shot dead in less than 24 hours in western states, according to authorities, as the country faces a flare-up of violence in the region. A Mexican journalist was shot dead in the western state of Colima on Wednesday afternoon, the state persecutor's office told Reuters. Her name was Patricia Ramirez, also known by her nickname Paty Bunbury, and she worked as an entertainment reporter, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a New York-based rights group. It was the second journalist shot dead in less than 24 hours in Mexico, ranked as one of the deadliest countries for journalists by press freedom groups, after the head of an online news outlet in Mexico was killed late on Tuesday. The killings marked the first of a journalist under President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office at the beginning of this month and has pledged to combat violence and crime. Mauricio Cruz was shot dead Tuesday in the city of Uruapan, in the violence-plagued western state of Michoacan, according to the state prosecutor's office. Another person, who the prosecutor did not identify, was wounded in the shooting. Uruapan is known for brazen crimes such as beheadings stemming from fighting between drugs cartels or face-offs with law enforcement. Cruz's news outlet, MinutoXMinuto Michoacan, posted a tribute to the journalist on its Facebook page featuring his last live video recorded minutes before his death. While the nation has been rocked by a wave of violence, Sheinbaum has followed the work of her predecessor and mentor, former president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, stating that her government would not wage a new war on Mexico's drug cartels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-journalists-shot-dead-in-past-24-hours/7845835.html	2024-10-30T22:05:10-07:00	
Dozens of North Korean defectors caught by secret police 'vanish,' rights group says	seoul, south korea — More than 100 North Koreans have gone missing after being caught by secret police while trying to defect from the isolated country or even for trying to call relatives in South Korea, a Seoul-based human rights group said Thursday. The Transitional Justice Working Group (TJWG) released a report detailing patterns of enforced disappearances through its study based on interviews with 62 North Korean escapees in South Korea. Tens of thousands of North Koreans have defected in the decades since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, with many of those caught or repatriated sent to prison camps or other detention facilities before being released. The group identified 113 people in 66 disappearance cases, including the cases in an archive run with other international organizations, as well as maps depicting transfer routes. Of the 113, 80%, or 90, were arrested inside North Korea and the rest in China or Russia, with about 30% disappearing since leader Kim Jong Un took power in late 2011. Almost 40% of them went missing after being caught trying to flee the country, while 26% took responsibility for another family member's crime. Nearly 9% were accused of being in touch with those in South Korea or other countries. More than 81% vanished after being transferred to and detained by the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the North's secret police known as 'bowibu,' according to the report. An interviewee who defected to the South in 2018 from the Chinese border city of Hyesan said his friend was arrested by the MSS while trying to recover a Chinese mobile phone hidden in the mountains and was now rumored to have died. 'Once (the MSS) finds call records with South Korea, they are considered serious offenses,' the interviewee was quoted in the report as saying. Kang Jeong-hyun, director of the project, said the report was intended to underscore enforced disappearances committed by the Kim regime as transnational crimes also involving China and Russia. The report was published just days before the U.N. Human Rights Council is due to issue its Universal Periodic Review on North Korea. The United Nations estimates up to 200,000 people are held in a vast network of gulags run by the MSS, many of them for political reasons. A 2014 U.N. Commission of Inquiry report said the prisoners faced torture, rape, forced labor, starvation and other inhumane treatment. Pyongyang has long denounced defectors as 'human scum,' and Kim has further tightened border controls over the past few years. The North's Korea Association for Human Rights Studies this month rejected a U.N. report on its human rights violations including forced disappearances, calling them 'fabrications' and a conspiracy by the West to escalate confrontation and tarnish the country’s image. Beijing has denied there are any North Korean defectors in China, instead describing them as illegal economic migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-north-korean-defectors-caught-by-secret-police-vanish-rights-group-says/7845827.html	2024-10-30T21:53:30-07:00	
Los Angeles Dodgers win World Series, defeating New York Yankees in five games	The Los Angeles Dodgers roared back from a 5-0 deficit late Wednesday to beat the New York Yankees 7-6 and win baseball’s 2024 World Series in five games. The championship is the eighth in the Dodgers’ 140-year history and was clinched in front of nearly 50,000 fans at Yankee Stadium in New York, most of whom hoped the Yankees could pull out a victory and take the series back to Los Angeles. The Yankees, trying to hold off elimination, jumped out to an early lead on the strength of home runs from sluggers Aaron Judge, Jazz Chisholm and Giancarlo Stanton. But the Dodgers tied the game with five runs in the fifth inning, aided by an error in center field by Judge, who dropped what appeared to be an easy fly ball off the bat of the Dodgers’ Tommy Edman. After the Yankees scored in the next inning, Los Angeles went ahead for good with two runs in the top of the eighth, with the go-ahead run coming via a sacrifice fly from star outfielder Mookie Betts. Walker Buehler, normally a starting pitcher, entered the game in relief to shut down the Yankees in the bottom of the ninth inning and clinch the title. Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman was named the World Series’ Most Valuable Player after hitting four home runs and driving 12 runs during the five-game series. The Series drew high TV ratings not only in the United States but also in Japan because of the Dodgers’ Shohei Otani, who began his career in his native land and is a lock to be named National League Most Valuable Player after hitting a league-topping 54 home runs this season. The Dodgers won the first three games of the Series before the Yankees claimed game four. No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to win the World Series. This was the Dodgers’ first championship since the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. Fans of the Yankees, baseball’s most successful and renowned franchise, were hoping for an end to a 15-year title drought. This was the first time the Yankees had reached the World Series since winning the championship in 2009.	https://www.voanews.com/a/los-angeles-dodgers-win-world-series-defeating-new-york-yankees-in-five-games/7845833.html	2024-10-30T21:53:15-07:00	
Bolivia president calls for end of blockades, says costs exceed $1.7 billion	LA PAZ, Bolivia — Bolivian President Luis Arce on Wednesday called for the end of costly highway blockades that have paralyzed parts of the South American country and fueled an increasingly volatile conflict with his main political rival. The economic costs of the blockades over 17 days run into over $1.7 billion, Arce said in a message to the nation. Arce also said 70 people, including 61 police officers, have been injured in the blockades, organized by supporters of former President Evo Morales. 'We demand the immediate lifting of all blockade points for the re-establishment of normalcy in our country,' Arce said, adding that the government will implement the necessary measures to safeguard Bolivians if protesters do not follow that request. Arce's conference is his latest attempt to curb the growing tensions in the country, as Morales supporters have blocked key highways and prevented the delivery of food and fuel, particularly in the center of the country, the Cochabamba tropics. Coca growers, peasants and miners who make up many of the demonstrators have clashed with security forces trying to clear the obstacles from the roads. Morales criticized Arce, an ally turned rival, for not seeking dialog to solve the protests and holding him responsible for violence. 'Only sincere dialog will solve the serious problems that the country is currently facing,' Morales said on social media X after Arce's address, adding that the president had threatened the demonstrators. Morales told Reuters on Monday that Arce's government was behind an alleged gun attack on his convoy, lashing out at what he called a 'dark plot to destroy' him. Arce's government denied the accusations it had led an attack on Morales, calling it 'theater' and claiming the former leader's convoy had instead fired on special anti-narcotics police who were carrying out a patrol.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-president-calls-for-end-of-blockades-says-costs-exceed-1-7-billion/7845812.html	2024-10-30T20:31:01-07:00

Dominant parties maintain hold in parliament election for Iraq’s Kurdish region	IRBIL, Iraq — Election results from the vote for the regional parliament in Iraq's semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region show the two dominant Kurdish parties have maintained their hold while an opposition party has made inroads, officials said Wednesday. According to the Independent High Electoral Commission, the Kurdistan Democratic Party — with its base of support in the regional capital, Irbil, and in the city of Dohuk — made the strongest showing, securing 39 seats. The rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan won 23 seats, continuing its influence over the city of Sulaymaniyah. In the 2018 elections, the two parties won 45 and 21 seats, respectively. A relatively new opposition party, New Generation, won 15 seats, a significant increase from the eight seats it got in 2018, when the party was first established. The Kurdistan Islamic Union, which came in fourth with seven seats, announced it will join the New Generation in opposition in the regional, 100-seat parliament. Other minor parties took a smattering of seats. Despite some technical issues at the polls, voters turned out in large numbers, with 72% of eligible voters casting ballots. The surge in support for the New Generation appeared to stem from growing disillusionment among younger voters, who are increasingly frustrated with the region's ongoing economic challenges, including delays in salary payments, high unemployment, and perceived corruption within the traditional political leadership. Economic concerns remain at the forefront — widespread dissatisfaction over delayed payments to civil servants, fluctuating oil prices, and ongoing budget disputes with the central government in Baghdad have fueled calls for reform. Three Assyrian Christian candidates and two Turkmen candidates secured the five remaining quota seats for minorities, despite the Iraqi federal court's controversial elimination of the reserved seats for ethnic and religious minorities earlier this year. These seats are usually filled by candidates backed by the major political parties, leading some to say that they do not offer genuine minority representation. 'We no longer have true representation in the parliament or the government; our voices are being silenced,' said Toma Khoshaba, an Assyrian ethnic activist. Khoshaba argued that that these 'so-called independent Assyrian representatives occupying the quota seats are largely supported by the Kurdistan Democratic Party' or by Shiite factions. 'Their loyalty lies with these dominant political groups, not with our communities,' he said. The election outcome will also play a pivotal role in determining how Kurdish leaders handle ongoing disputes with Baghdad, particularly over oil revenue sharing and budget allocations, as well as the region's broader economic challenges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dominant-parties-maintain-hold-in-parliament-election-for-iraq-s-semi-autonomous-kurdish-region/7845793.html	2024-10-30T19:43:02-07:00	
North Korea long-range ballistic missile test splashes down between Japan and Russia	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired a long-range ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on Thursday, South Korea and Japan said, a day after Seoul reported the North was making preparations to test-launch an intercontinental ballistic missile. The launch, at a sharply raised angle, was from an area near the North's capital, Pyongyang, at 7:10 a.m. (2210 GMT), the Joint Chiefs said in a statement. The Japanese government later said the missile dropped into the sea at 8:37 a.m. (2337 GMT). 'It is believed the North Korea ballistic missile is a long-range ballistic missile fired at a high angle,' the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. Earlier, the Japanese government said the missile was expected to land about 300 kilometers west of its Okushiri Island off its northern Hokkaido region, outside its exclusive economic zone and toward the Russian coast. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba later said there had been no reported damage from the launch. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Japan strongly condemns the North's action, which threatened not only Japan but also the international community. He said the flight time was likely the longest of North Korean missile launches and could be a new type of missile. On Wednesday, South Korea's Defense Intelligence Command said the North had placed a mobile launcher at a location making preparations to launch what could be an ICBM around the time of the U.S. presidential election, which takes place Tuesday. North Korea has conducted a series of ICBM test launches at a sharply steep trajectory to let the projectiles drop within much shorter distances relative to the designed range, partly for safety and to avoid the political fallout of sending a missile far into the Pacific. But a launch with a flatter, standard trajectory is considered essential for ICBM development to ensure the warhead is capable of making a reentry into the atmosphere while maintaining control to hit an intended target. The North last test launched an ICBM in December last year, a projectile fueled by solid-propellant and fired from a road launcher. That launch was also at a sharply raised angle and gave a flight time that could translate to a potential range of 15,000 kilometers on a normal trajectory. That is a distance that puts anywhere in the mainland United States within range. North Korea has come under international condemnation after South Korea and the United States said Pyongyang had dispatched 11,000 troops to Russia for deployment in the war in Ukraine, with 3,000 of them already moved close to the front lines. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-hyun condemned the deployment at a meeting in Washington on Wednesday. North Korea's move to make its troops co-belligerents fighting alongside the Russians has the potential to lengthen the already 2 ½-year Ukraine conflict and draw in others, Austin said. North Korea has already been supplying arms to Russia including missiles, artillery and anti-tank rockets in more than 13,000 containers since August last year, according to the South's intelligence agency. Ukraine authorities have also said some of missiles fired by Russia were from the North. At a summit in June in Pyongyang, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive partnership treaty that included a mutual defense pact. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang directly acknowledged the supply of weapons from North Korea or the deployment of North Korean troops to the Ukraine war. Putin has said how Russia implements its partnership with North Korea is its own business. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui will hold strategic consultations in Moscow with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, Russia said Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-long-range-ballistic-missile-test-splashes-down-between-japan-and-russia/7845788.html	2024-10-30T19:31:09-07:00	
Mexico Supreme Court judges resign after judicial reforms	mexico city — A majority of Mexico's Supreme Court judges have submitted their resignations and declined to stand for election under controversial judicial reforms, the top court said Wednesday. In a move that has sparked opposition street protests and diplomatic tensions, Mexico is set to become the world's only country to allow voters to choose all judges, at every level, starting next year. Eight of 11 Supreme Court justices — including court president Norma Pina — decided not to seek election in June 2025, a statement said, adding that most of the resignations would take effect next August. The announcement came as the Supreme Court prepares to consider a proposal to invalidate the election of judges and magistrates. President Claudia Sheinbaum, however, has said that the court lacks the authority to reverse a constitutional reform approved by Congress. 'Eight people intend to change a reform about the people of Mexico... Do they realize the magnitude?' she told a news conference Wednesday. A day earlier Sheinbaum suggested the judges' real motive was to protect their retirement benefits. 'If they resign now, they will leave with all their retirement benefits,' Sheinbaum said. 'If they do not resign now, they will no longer have their retirement benefits... which is a lot of money,' she added. Former president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who enacted the reforms in September before leaving office, argued the changes were needed to clean up a 'rotten' judiciary serving the interests of the political and economic elite. Critics fear that elected judges could be swayed by politics and vulnerable to pressure from powerful drug cartels that regularly use bribery and intimidation to influence officials. During his six years in office, Lopez Obrador often criticized the Supreme Court, which impeded some of his policies in areas such as energy and security. Sheinbaum, a close ally of Lopez Obrador who became Mexico's first woman president on October 1, strongly supported the judicial reforms. The changes sparked diplomatic friction with key economic partners the United States and Canada, upset financial markets and prompted a series of protests by judicial workers and other opponents. Washington warned the reforms threatened a relationship that relies on investor confidence in the Mexican legal framework.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-supreme-court-judges-resign-after-judicial-reforms/7845790.html	2024-10-30T19:29:14-07:00	
Bidens host Halloween celebration at White House; first lady dresses as panda	washington — President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, who dressed as a giant panda, hosted trick-or-treaters on the White House South Lawn on Wednesday for the last time. The first lady had participated in the National Zoo's announcement earlier this year that pandas would be returning to Washington. They arrived in the nation's capital in mid-October and Jill Biden donned the panda suit Wednesday as a 'welcoming gesture,' the White House said. Jill Biden added an educational theme to the event and named it 'Hallo-Read' to help encourage reading. She has been a teacher for 40 years. Earlier Wednesday, she read a short story about spooky pumpkins to a group of costumed children gathered on the lawn. She and the president later ventured outside at sunset and spent about an hour handing out treats. Biden, in a suit and tie, dropped boxes of White House Hershey's Kisses chocolates in the kids' tote bags while the first lady handed out copies of '10 Spooky Pumpkins.' Up to 8,000 people, including students and children tied to the military, were expected to pass through the White House gates during the day. A large orange moon and a sign that said 'Hallow-Read at the White House' decorated the south face of the executive mansion. The decorations also included cardboard representations of Willow, the family cat who is rarely seen in public, and stacks of books. Giant pumpkin decorations flanked the door. Biden dropped his bid for reelection in July. He leaves office in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bidens-hosted-their-final-halloween-trick-or-treat-event-first-lady-came-as-a-giant-panda-/7845758.html	2024-10-30T18:43:56-07:00	
Israeli airstrikes target historic Lebanese city	Israeli airstrikes hit the historic eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek on Wednesday, killing at least 19 people, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Hours before it struck, Israel’s military issued evacuation orders for the entire city and parts of eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, where Baalbek is located. Tens of thousands of Lebanese fled in a chaotic scene of panic, one Lebanese civil defense official said. 'The whole city is in a panic trying to figure out where to go; there's a huge traffic jam,' Bilal Raad, regional head of the Lebanese civil defense, told Reuters. Baalbek is the site of a Roman temple complex listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Israel’s warning said it was targeting Hezbollah. It has issued evacuation orders before military strikes in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. U.N. officials and humanitarian organizations have criticized the evacuation orders, saying civilians have little chance to prepare and often nowhere safe to go. U.S. President Joe Biden and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides met at the White House on Wednesday to discuss how to bring an end to the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza. Cyprus, the European Union nation closest to Gaza, has played a key role in enabling the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza After his meeting with Biden, Christodoulides said he was 'quite optimistic' that a Lebanese cease-fire deal would be reached soon. Senior White House officials Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein are scheduled to be in Israel on Thursday. There, they will discuss a wide range of issues, including cease-fire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon and the release of the hostages that Hamas still holds. New Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said Wednesday that the militant group would continue fighting Israel in Lebanon and northern Israel until it is offered cease-fire terms it considers acceptable. 'If the Israelis decide to stop the aggression, we say that we accept, but according to the conditions that we see as suitable,' Kassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a recorded televised address. 'We will not beg for a cease-fire as we will continue (fighting) ... no matter how long it takes,' he said. His remarks came a day after being named the militant group’s new leader, replacing longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb in late September. Kassem had served as Nasrallah's deputy for more than three decades. Kassem’s speech came as international mediators launched a new push for negotiated cease-fires in Lebanon and Gaza, where Israeli forces have been fighting Hamas militants for more than a year. Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen said the government’s security Cabinet is discussing the terms of a truce with Hezbollah in south Lebanon, where Israeli troops are conducting a ground offensive. 'There are discussions, I think it will still take time,' Cohen told Israeli public radio. Israel's Channel 12 television said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held talks with top officials Tuesday evening on Israel's demands in return for a 60-day truce with Hezbollah. Israel is demanding a Hezbollah pullback to north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometers from the Israeli frontier. In addition, Israel wants the Lebanese army to deploy along the border, an international intervention mechanism to enforce the truce, and that Israel will remain free to respond militarily in case of threats. Cohen, a former intelligence minister, said, 'Thanks to all the army's operations these past months and particularly these past weeks ... Israel can come in a position of strength after the entire Hezbollah leadership was eliminated and over 2,000 Hezbollah terrorist infrastructures were hit.' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Tuesday that Hezbollah's 'residual capabilities in terms of missiles and rockets' were estimated to be at 20% of what they had been. He said Hezbollah had been 'pushed back from all villages' on the border with Israel. Israeli media reported that U.S. President Joe Biden's Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, and special envoy Amos Hochstein, are headed to the Mideast Wednesday to meet Netanyahu and other Israeli officials to discuss conditions for a cease-fire with Hezbollah. The war in Lebanon began late last month, nearly a year after Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border fire into Israel in support of Hamas following its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terrorist organizations by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. The war has killed at least 1,754 people in Lebanon since Sept. 23, according to an Agence France-Presse tally of health ministry figures, although the actual number is likely to be higher due to gaps in the data. Israel's military says it has lost 37 soldiers in its Lebanon campaign since it launched ground operations on September 30. Israel’s military issued new evacuation warnings Wednesday for people in parts of eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, warning of military actions against Hezbollah targets in the area. An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said people in Baalbek, Ain Bourday and Douris should leave their homes. Israeli forces have frequently followed such warnings with airstrikes as they carry out a campaign Israeli officials say is meant to push Hezbollah back from the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel has used the same methods in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, while U.N. officials and humanitarian organizations have criticized the evacuation orders saying civilians have little chance to prepare and often nowhere safe to go in the midst of the war. UNRWA ban U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has written to Netanyahu expressing his concern over new Israeli legislation that would ban the main U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees. 'Obviously, if it is implemented, it is clear that it will have a devastating impact on the humanitarian situation of Palestinians in the occupied territory,' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. He said Guterres has also written to the president of the U.N. General Assembly, which created UNRWA, the Palestinian relief agency, in December 1949. Guterres called on Israel to uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law and said national legislation 'cannot alter those obligations.' Israel's U.N. envoy, Danny Danon, said 'UNRWA Gaza has become a front for Hamas' and accused Guterres of ignoring that 'indisputable fact.' The new Israeli legislation bans the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and forbids Israeli officials from having any contact with UNRWA representatives. Norway's prime minister said Tuesday his government will submit a resolution to the U.N. General Assembly for it to request a ruling from the International Court of Justice on whether Israel would be violating international law. The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, while the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people. VOA U.N.

Pentagon, South Korea urge North Korea to withdraw troops from Russia	Pentagon and United Nations — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-hyun, urged North Korea on Wednesday to withdraw from Russia an estimated 10,000 troops, which both countries believe are headed to fight alongside Russia in its war in Ukraine. 'They're doing this because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has lost a lot of troops, a lot of troops. And, you know, he has a choice of either getting other people to help him, or he can mobilize. And he doesn't want to mobilize, because then the people in Russia will begin to understand the extent of his losses, of their losses,' Austin said during a joint news conference at the Pentagon. More than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022, U.S. officials say. Russia, they say, is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. 'Kim Jong Un didn't hesitate to sell out his young people and troops as cannon fodder mercenaries,' Kim said. 'I believe such activities are a war crime that is not only anti-humanitarian but also anti-peaceful.' Western nations have expressed concerns about what Kim Jong Un's regime will get in return from Moscow for its troops. North Korea is under international sanctions for its illicit nuclear ballistic missile programs. The South Korean defense minister said it was likely that North Korea would seek nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile technology in exchange for the troops, escalating security threats on the peninsula and across the globe. UN Security Council meeting At the United Nations, Ukraine — with the support of the United States, Britain, France, Japan, South Korea, Slovenia and Malta — requested the Security Council meet to discuss the development. Russia's envoy dismissed the meeting, saying it was convened to tarnish Moscow with more lies and disinformation, adding it was 'bare-faced lies' that North Korean soldiers are in Russia. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia's comments appeared to contradict Putin, who last week did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia, saying it was up to Moscow to decide how to deploy them as part of a mutual defense security pact that he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. Nebenzia went on to claim that the Western nations were making accusations about North Korean troops assisting Moscow to lure South Korea into providing Ukraine with arms. 'We can see the Western spectacle in the Security Council today pursuing another goal. The Zelenskyy regime and collaborators for two years have been trying to compel the Republic of Korea [South Korea] to more actively cooperate with the Kyiv regime, and to have them provide and supply the much-needed lethal weapons. And here, the anti-Pyongyang frenzied rhetoric is very convenient for Washington, London and Brussels, because their own supply is something that the Kyiv regime has drained,' Nebenzia said. 'We do hope that our South Korean colleagues will be wise enough not to fall for this trick.' Since the war started, Seoul has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and sent both humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv but has not sent weapons, in line with its policy of not arming countries actively engaged in conflicts. On Tuesday, Seoul said it could consider sending weapons to Ukraine in response to the North dispatching troops to Russia. Troop estimates Ukraine's ambassador said as many as 12,000 North Korean troops are being trained at five training grounds in Russia's eastern military district. 'This contingent includes at least 500 officers of the DPRK army, with at least three generals from the general staff,' Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said, using the abbreviation for North Korea's full name. 'Subsequently, it is planned to form at least five units or formations from DPRK military personnel, consisting of 2,000 to 3,000 servicemen each.' The troops' identities are expected to be concealed, Kyslytsya said, and they will be provided with Russian military uniforms and weapons and identity papers. They are likely to be integrated into units with ethnic minorities from the Asian part of Russia, he said. 'According to available information, between October 23 and 28, at least seven aircraft carrying military personnel of up to 2,100 soldiers flew from the Eastern Military District to Russia's border with Ukraine,' Kyslytsya said, adding that they are expected to begin directly participating in combat operations against Ukrainian troops in November. The Pentagon said Tuesday that a 'small number' of North Korean troops have deployed to Russia's Kursk region, where they are likely to be used in combat against Ukrainian troops. Kyslytsya told the Security Council that they number about 400. Pyongyang and Moscow are in close contact and are entitled to develop bilateral relations in many fields, said North Korea's envoy, citing their strategic partnership treaty. 'If Russia's sovereignty and security interests are exposed to and threatened by continued dangerous attempts of the United States and the West, and if it is judged that we should respond to them with something, we will make a necessary decision,' Ambassador Kim Song told the council.

Georgia investigates election rigging claims	State prosecutors in the country of Georgia said Wednesday that they had initiated an investigation into Saturday’s parliamentary election amid claims that the vote was rigged. The Georgian Dream ruling party won the election with 54% of the vote, according to the electoral commission, a figure that would give the party a clear majority in Parliament. The opposition alleged the election was rigged. Western countries and international observers also raised concerns, citing instances of voter intimidation, vote buying, double voting and violence. The opposition took its protest to the streets of Tbilisi early this week in a rally condemning the results. Prosecutors have summoned President Salome Zourabichvili, who is aligned with the pro-Western opposition, to testify, but she questioned why she should provide testimony about election rigging. 'It's not up to the president to provide proof of election fraud,' she told reporters Wednesday. 'Observers and everyday citizens have shown proofs of how massive the rigging of elections was.' The investigative body, she said, 'should have found the evidence itself.' Zourabichvili charged in an interview with Reuters on Monday that Georgian Dream used a Russian methodology to falsify some election results. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, a member of Georgian Dream, has called on Zourabichvili to turn over any evidence of rigging to authorities. He said he believed she did not have such evidence. Zourabichvili said the opposition was calling for an investigation 'conducted by an international mission with the adequate mandate and qualification' to look into how the election was conducted. Until that can be done, she said, 'this election cannot and will not have legitimacy or trust.' Some election observers have been cautious about labeling Georgia’s vote as rigged. Some observers, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, admitted there were reports of voter irregularities, but the organization stopped short of labeling the election as rigged. Russia has denied any interference in Georgia’s election. Georgia’s election came at a crucial moment for the former Soviet republic as it seeks to join the European Union. However, Georgian Dream is seen by many as more aligned with Russia than with the EU.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-investigates-election-rigging-claims-/7845431.html	2024-10-30T16:41:18-07:00

China-Russia cooperation blocks Antarctic conservation proposals	taipei, taiwan — China and Russia are deepening cooperation in Antarctica in a trend that analysts say could undermine marine conservation efforts and disrupt the long-standing status quo in the resource-rich region. China and Russia were accused of collaborating to block key proposals that would establish new marine protected areas and revise the krill fishery management plan in the Southern Ocean, during the annual conference of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Australia last week. The commission was established in 1982 and is a part of the Antarctic Treaty System, which establishes the legal status of Antarctica and comprises four different treaties. CCAMLR focuses on preserving marine life and other resources in the Antarctic. The commission has 26 members, including China, Russia, the United States, Australia and the European Union. Any member state can veto a proposed measure, and Russia and China have repeatedly used that power to block proposed conservation efforts by the council over the years. Some member states said every proposed measure at this year’s conference, including the establishment of four new marine protected areas and an extension of existing krill management measures, was blocked by China or Russia or both. 'Most concerning was the failure of some members to support the extension of existing krill management measures while the harmonization process is progressed,' a spokesperson of the Australian Antarctic Division told VOA in a written response. 'This is a backwards step for CCAMLR and puts krill, and the ecosystems and predators it supports, at risk,' the spokesperson added. Krill are small shrimp-like crustaceans that play a crucial role in the marine food chain. Limit on krill fishing The measure that CCAMLR member states hope to preserve is the mechanism that limits krill fishing in a protected area near the Antarctic Peninsula to no more than 620,000 tons. Another 620,000 tons of fishable krill are redistributed across several subareas to prevent overconcentration of krill fishing in one area. The measure needs to be renewed annually during the CCAMLR meeting with the approval of all the commission’s member states. Analysts said China's and Russia’s move to block the rollover of the krill measure will affect the sustainability of a crucial food source for species such as penguins, seals and whales. 'If there’s too much krill fishing in one small region of Antarctica, it will restrict the amount of food available to the seal and penguin populations,' Tony Press, an expert on Antarctic affairs at the University of Tasmania, told VOA in a video interview. In his view, other countries within CCAMLR should try to collectively challenge China's and Russia’s decisions to block the proposed conservation measures through diplomatic means or decide to implement the proposed measures without involving Beijing or Moscow. 'Other countries could decide that Russia and China’s behaviors mean they would have to start implementing decisions among themselves,' Press said. Experts say China and Russia refuse to support the proposed measures because they think setting up more marine protected areas will lead to more areas in the Antarctic becoming unavailable for use or development. 'They think once a marine protected area is adopted, it creates a snowball effect and generates more support behind the development of additional marine protected areas, which both countries think could lead to all marine living resource exploitation in the Southern Ocean being completely prohibited,' said Donald Rothwell, professor of international law at Australian National University. Lynda Goldsworthy, a research associate at the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, said one of China’s objectives in increasing its fishery footprint in the Southern Ocean is to 'increase geopolitical influence in the Antarctic region.' But since Russia is not as invested in the Southern Ocean as before, Goldsworthy said its decision to block marine conservation efforts in Antarctica is driven by an attempt to challenge the rules-based world order. 'Russia is playing the disruptor and [the objections] are part of their global disruption approach,' she told VOA by phone. The Russian Foreign Ministry and Russian Embassy in the U.S. have not responded to VOA’s request for comments. The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Chinese Embassy in Australia also have not responded to requests for comments from VOA. CCAMLR successfully established two marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean in 2009 and 2017, but no new zones have been established since then. The four new zones proposed during the 2024 meeting would increase the protected area in the Southern Ocean to 26%. Antarctic status quo The deepened cooperation between China and Russia in Antarctica comes as Beijing expands its presence across the continent. In February, China inaugurated a new scientific research station near a U.S. research station. The development raises concerns among some security analysts that China may collect intelligence or develop its dual-used capabilities through the station. China’s increased presence in Antarctica has allowed Beijing to more boldly assert its agenda in some regional bodies such as CCAMLR, said Press. China’s behavior at last week’s conference 'is a reflection of their confidence because they are now a party with a significant presence in the Antarctic,' he told VOA. 'A lot of what they [China and Russia] are doing points to the idea that the actions they take now are to ensure there are no curbs on any future actions they might take,' Press added. Goldsworthy said the growing synergy between China and Russia in Antarctica could create potential challenges for the Antarctic Treaty System. 'There had been blockages for the protection of penguins on the Antarctic continent, and I do think both Russia and China are positioning themselves for [mineral mining] when or if the current mining ban is lifted,' she told VOA. While Beijing and Moscow have been consistently blocking CCAMLR’s proposals, Rothwell said it is unclear whether that trend has 'totally infected decision-making within the Antarctic Treaty,' which designates the continent as a demilitarized zone for peaceful purposes and scientific research. Even if China and Russia can’t easily challenge the treaty, Rothwell said that China 'will find it advantageous to align itself with Russia,' in order to fulfill its aspirations to exercise control and influence in Antarctica. Goldsworthy added that if China and Russia maintain their 'combative approach' in the Antarctic Treaty System, which includes CCAMLR, it could turn 'a safe and secure region' into a 'much less peace-oriented' continent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-russia-cooperation-blocks-antarctic-conservation-proposals/7845395.html	2024-10-30T15:56:37-07:00	
Somalia's leaders agree on framework for universal suffrage	WASHINGTON — Political leaders in Somalia agreed Wednesday on a framework for the country’s first national one-person, one-vote elections, a government statement said. The decision followed marathon monthlong talks led by Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud that saw the withdrawal of Jubaland President Ahmed Mohamed Islam, also known as Madobe, from the National Consultative Council meeting in Mogadishu. Somalia's government and federal member states said Wednesday that direct universal suffrage would be introduced with local elections set for June 2025. The agreement signed by Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre, the leaders of three regional states and Mogadishu’s governor laid out a path to nationwide one-person, one-vote elections. 'The leaders agreed to introduce national elections, where citizens will vote for their leaders, starting with the local, regional and municipal elections set for June 2025,' read a communique released at the end of the meeting in Mogadishu. 'The election of parliamentary and presidential leaders of the Federal Member states will be held on September 2025,' the statement said. The members of NCC also have ordered the completion of Somalia's National Independent Electoral Commission to facilitate the electoral process. Opposition stand In March, Somalia's parliament unanimously approved a bill overhauling the country's electoral system to reintroduce universal suffrage, a plan that has been criticized by some leading politicians. The leaders of two federal member states, the Puntland President Said Abdullahi Deni and Jubaland President Islam, opposed Wednesday’s decision. Unlike Islam, who stepped out of the NCC meetings two weeks ago, Deni repeatedly said that Puntland no longer would recognize federal institutions, accusing President Mohamud of violating the constitution and losing his legitimacy. Additionally, prominent Somali opposition leaders, including former President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, former Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire, and MP Abdirahman Abdishakur Warsame, have vehemently condemned Wednesday’s decision, calling it illegal. 'The decision illegally extends the terms of the regional presidents, threatens the national stability, the efforts of building good governance,' according to a statement from the opposition. 'We will never accept it.' The country has not had nationwide one-person, one-vote elections since 1969, when dictator Siad Barre seized power. Mohamud was elected by lawmakers in May 2022 and previously said the next national elections would be by universal suffrage. Currently, voting follows a complex, indirect model where state legislatures and clan delegates pick lawmakers for the national parliament, who in turn choose the president. UN Security Council Wednesday’s agreement comes on the heels of another significant development for Somalia. The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution on Wednesday facilitating the transition of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Somalia, or UNSOM, to the U.N. Country Team, or UNCT. This shift, prompted by a formal request from the Somali government, presented by the United Kingdom, received unanimous support from all 15 member states of the council. It establishes that during this transition phase, the U.N.'s support activities in Somalia will be rebranded as the U.N. Transitional Mission in Somalia, or UNTMIS. According to the resolution, the transfer of responsibilities from UNSOM to UNTMIS, alongside national authorities, will commence on November 1, and is anticipated to conclude by October 31, 2026. U.K. Ambassador to the U.N. Barbara Woodward characterized the passage of the resolution as the 'beginning of a crucial period for Somalia.' 'UNSOM has played an important role since its inception in 2013, supporting peace building and state building in Somalia through implementing its good offices, policy guidance, coordination, technical assistance and capacity building functions,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-s-leaders-agree-on-framework-for-universal-suffrage/7845398.html	2024-10-30T15:32:31-07:00	
Militant attacks in Pakistan hinder polio immunization campaigns	washington — Militant groups have intensified attacks against polio vaccination teams and their police escorts in Pakistan amid a dramatic resurgence of polio cases in the country. Officials say because of the deteriorating security situation, polio vaccination teams cannot reach communities in high-risk areas where polio is endemic. On Tuesday, militants attacked two health centers in the tribal districts of Orakzai and Waziristan that are being used in the polio vaccination campaign. Two police officials were killed in the attack in the restive region along the Afghan border. According to local officials in North Waziristan, militants took guns from the police officers guarding the polio team and warned the health workers not to take part in the anti-polio campaign. Pakistan Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in reaction to the latest violence, said in a statement, 'The terrorists' attack on the polio team is an attack on the safe future of Pakistan.' Violence has heightened safety concerns among front-line polio workers in the country. 'When I go out as part of [a] polio vaccination team, I am not sure I will return home safely,' Fahima Bibi, a front-line polio worker supervising vaccinations in northwestern Pakistan, told VOA. But Bibi said she is determined to do the job. 'The cause is bigger and needs bigger commitment and sacrifice,' she told VOA. Bibi's concerns for safety are shared by many of her co-workers. According to the Pakistan National Emergency Operations Center for Polio Eradication, 225,440 female vaccinators are working in the immunization workforce, going door to door to administer polio drops to children. They travel to hard-to-reach and remote, conservative regions in Pakistan, breaking cultural barriers. Ihtesham Ali, minister of health in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, expressed concern Wednesday over the surge in attacks. He told VOA that the 'security situation in the southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is quite bad. And it is affecting access to communities. It is creating difficulties in our access for polio vaccinations.' 'A fearful environment' Most of the recent cases in Pakistan were reported in southwestern Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. World Health Organization officials in southern Balochistan province say militant violence has affected polio campaigns in the province. 'Polio teams go house to house in a fearful environment,' said Dr. Nayyar Khan Loni, a WHO official in Balochistan. He said that the recent attacks in Balochistan have forced polio teams to rush the vaccination of children in some areas. He said immunization campaigns have been modified because of security concerns. He attributed the recent polio outbreak in Balochistan to several factors, including cross-border mobility with Afghanistan and misinformation among certain parents about polio vaccines. Campaign against polio vaccinators Pakistan's hard-line extremist group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has sustained a violent campaign against polio vaccinators and security forces guarding polio team workers in Pakistan for nearly 15 years. Militants spread false claims that polio vaccines are part of a Western agenda to sterilize Muslim children. Also, militants target polio teams suspected of being government spies. In January, at least five policemen were killed and more than a dozen injured in a major attack on polio teams and security personnel in northwestern Pakistan. According to the Emergency Operations Center in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, militants have carried out 23 attacks against polio teams and security escorts in Pakistan this year. Overall, militant-sponsored violence has increased in Pakistan since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021. According to independent think tanks tracking violence in Pakistan, militant violence has killed more than 1,000 Pakistanis, half of them security forces, in the first 10 months of this year. The Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition identified 16 incidents of violence against or obstruction of health care in Pakistan in 2022, an increase from seven in 2021. Nearly 90% of these incidents involved threats and violence against polio vaccination workers, undermining health care providers' ability to meet vaccination targets. Experts say the TTP has ignored local and international religious scholars' fatwa (edicts) that support polio vaccination in Pakistan. Fakhar Hayat Kakakhel, a Pakistan-based researcher on militancy, said that because of military operations, militants lost space and polio vaccination teams gained more access to conflict areas. 'After August 2021, when the Pakistani Taliban regrouped in the region and got space, they restarted their anti-polio vaccination campaigns. And now we are seeing a sudden surge in cases of polio,' he said. Sindh province health officials say the security situation in Sindh is not like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but police are providing security to polio teams in Karachi and other parts of the province. 'Police are patrolling the streets in Karachi so that polio teams feel safe. We do not have any security issue, but [the] police department is with us,' Shumaila Rasool, spokesperson for Emergency Operations Center in Sindh, told VOA. Afghanistan and Pakistan launched synchronized polio immunization campaigns on Monday. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped.

China warns security threats to its nationals impede BRI investments in Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — China has increased diplomatic pressure on close ally Pakistan to take action against the militants responsible for repeated attacks on Chinese workers, warning that the violence is 'unacceptable' and poses 'a constraint' on Beijing’s investments under its Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI. The rare public warning accusing Islamabad of consistent security lapses concerning Chinese workers was issued by Beijing’s ambassador, Jiang Zaidong, while addressing a seminar in Islamabad this week. Analysts said the remarks reflect China's increasing frustration with the security risks facing its workers in the South Asian nation. Jiang referenced suicide car bombings in March and October of this year, which resulted in the deaths of seven Chinese personnel. It raised the number of Chinese workers killed in Pakistan to 21 since the countries launched a massive bilateral connectivity project as part of the BRI about a decade ago. 'It is unacceptable for us to be attacked twice in only six months,' the Chinese diplomat stated, speaking through his interpreter. He stressed the need for Islamabad to take 'effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such terror acts and ensure that perpetrators are identified, caught, and punished.' The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, considered the flagship project of the BRI, has brought more than $25 billion in Chinese investment to enhance Pakistan’s infrastructure, facilitating improved bilateral trade and further integrating of the broader South Asian region. Jiang urged Pakistan to take action against 'all anti-China terrorist groups,' stating that 'security is the biggest concern' for Beijing and 'a constraint on CPEC' projects. He added that 'without a safe and sound environment, nothing can be achieved.' The CPEC has built roads, highways, primarily coal-fired power plants, and the strategic deepwater Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea in the country’s southwestern Balochistan province. Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, while addressing Tuesday’s seminar organized by the Islamabad-based independent Pakistan-China Institute, assured the Chinese ambassador that his country was taking action against terrorists and tightening the security of Chinese nationals. Dar stated that Pakistan would share the progress with China in high-level talks next month. 'The Chinese are very clear; no matter how lucrative an investment is anywhere, if the security issue is there, they do not send Chinese personnel. Your country is the only exception,' he told the audience, quoting Chinese leaders as telling Pakistani counterparts in recent meetings. Critics argue that Pakistan's financial difficulties and political instability have discouraged China from making new investments in the CPEC. Michael Kugelman, an expert on South Asian affairs based in Washington, told VOA that Beijing's security concerns have made it challenging for the mega project to regain momentum anytime soon. 'When the Chinese envoy publicly upbraids Pakistan for not providing proper security, you know there is a big problem,' said Kugelman, who directs the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. 'I imagine the objective moving forward will be carefully working to maintain and advance existing projects but being cautious about agreeing to new ones until China feels less concerned about security risks,' he added. After the launch of CPEC projects, Pakistan’s military formed a specially trained unit of over 13,000 troops to safeguard these initiatives nationwide. But the attacks on Chinese nationals have led to concerns regarding the effectiveness of this military unit. Hasnain Javed, a Beijing-based Pakistani foreign research associate, noted that China had never before publicly criticized Islamabad. 'This is a strong rebuttal and a serious dissatisfaction over the poor security around CPEC,' Javed told VOA in written comments. 'Now, when the military is the main guarantor, particularly for security, the Chinese seem to be running on low patience.' Most of the recent attacks on Chinese workers and engineers have been claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, a prominent separatist group waging insurgent attacks in Balochistan. The group, which is made up of militants from the Baloch ethnic minority, accuses China of helping Pakistan to exploit the province’s natural resources and has been calling for Beijing to withdraw its CPEC and other investments. Both countries reject the allegations, saying Baloch insurgents are on a mission to subvert development in the impoverished province and undermine Pakistan’s close ties with China. The BLA, listed as a global terrorist organization by the United States, has lately intensified guerrilla attacks in Balochistan, killing hundreds of Pakistanis, primarily security force members, in recent months. During his visit to Pakistan earlier in October, Chinese Premier Li Qiang also highlighted the significance of security for economic development and cooperation. A post-visit joint statement quoted the Chinese side as stressing 'the need and urgency to take targeted security measures in Pakistan to jointly create a safe environment for cooperation between the two countries.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-warns-security-threats-to-its-nationals-impede-bri-investments-in-pakistan-/7845351.html	2024-10-30T14:31:16-07:00	
Cartoonist sentencing shows Saudis' 'determination to silence any voice,' analysts say	The decision by Saudi authorities to sentence a cartoonist to an extra 23 years in prison marks an escalation in the kingdom’s suppression of dissent, analysts say. Mohammed al-Ghamdi, a cartoonist for Qatar-based Lusail newspaper, was already serving six years on a range of charges. But a court in October reopened the case and sentenced him to an additional 23 years without the possibility of appeal. Known as al-Hazza, al-Ghamdi gained prominence for cartoons that critiqued Saudi policies and highlighted sociopolitical issues in the Gulf. But his work, considered by some as sympathetic to Qatar during a politically tense period, was labeled as anti-state by Saudi authorities. Al-Ghamdi was arrested in 2018 on charges including alleged sympathy for Qatar and for producing what Saudi authorities said were 100 insulting drawings. At the time, he was sentenced to six years in prison and a travel ban. His case, along with that of blogger and podcast host Hatem al-Najjar, who was detained in January, suggest a broader strategy of repression that contradicts Saudi Arabia’s outward image of reform and modernization, analysts say. 'The Saudi authorities’ conflation of journalistic activities with threats to national security reveals their determination to silence any voice that deviates from the state narrative,' said Yeganeh Rezaian, a researcher at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. 'The severity of al-Ghamdi’s punishment underscores how this crackdown has expanded to include nontraditional journalists such as cartoonists, who globally often critique political power,' she told VOA. Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman assumed greater powers in 2017, Saudi Arabia has seen an intensified crackdown on dissent. One of the most widely publicized cases is that of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who in 2018 was killed and dismembered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in an operation that U.S. intelligence concluded had been approved by the crown prince. The country is the ninth worst jailer of journalists, according to CPJ data, and ranks 166 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best environment. Reporters Without Borders, which compiles the index, says independent media are 'non-existent … and Saudi journalists live under heavy surveillance, even when abroad.' The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s requests for comment sent via email and the embassy’s website. Abdullah Alaoudh, senior director for countering authoritarianism at the U.S.-based nonprofit Middle East Democracy Center, told VOA that under the crown prince’s leadership, targeting and detaining journalists, activists and even royal family members has become routine. 'Many journalists and activists have been targeted and detained. This has been continuous because there were no real consequences for such actions,' Alaoudh said. 'We have documented and proved that many activists have been electrocuted, sexually harassed and tortured in jail. There are even businessmen and princes tortured. People have died under torture, and others have succumbed to medical negligence,' Alaoudh said. He believes the cases are intentionally publicized to create a chilling effect. Reports from rights organizations indicate that al-Ghamdi has been mistreated in custody, including allegations of torture and forced confessions. Alaoudh said international influence could help bring change. But 'unfortunately, international leverage is being channeled into deals and transactions with the Saudi government, not human rights protections,' Alaoudh said. Reports of torture and forced confessions are prevalent in cases involving detained journalists in Saudi Arabia. 'Authorities frequently employ these tactics to extract confessions and validate harsh sentences against individuals who have merely exercised their right to press freedom,' Rezaian said. Haydee Dijkstal, a barrister and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told VOA that the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has also flagged a troubling pattern of arrests in Saudi Arabia. 'The documented pattern of suppression has already broadly extended from activists and political opponents to ordinary citizens,' Dijkstal said. She cited the case of a person sentenced to death in 2023 for tweeting about government policy to just a small number of followers. 'The U.N. and international community must insist that Saudi Arabia comply with the remedies accompanying the U.N. findings, and that it genuinely respect and protect these most basic rights,' Dijkstal said. Saudi Arabia is an ally of the United States and several European Union countries. Recently, Salman attended the EU-Gulf Summit in Brussels. 'It is disheartening that the U.S. and the EU, who purport to champion press freedom globally, are not prioritizing the press freedom situation in the kingdom in their dealings with MBS,' said Rezaian, referring to the crown prince by his initials. 'They have failed to publicly criticize the sentencing of a cartoonist without legitimate justification.' Rezaian believes the silence emboldens the Saudi government and exposes a troubling double standard in international diplomacy. 'This hypocritical stance on Saudi Arabia's abysmal record on press freedom only emboldens MBS to further tighten his control over media expression in the kingdom,' she said. In December, Saudi Arabia will host the Internet Governance Forum, an international event that focuses on human rights and inclusion in the digital age. 'It is deeply concerning to see Saudi Arabia hosting such a forum while simultaneously incarcerating journalists who express their ideas online,' Rezaian said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cartoonist-sentencing-shows-saudis-determination-to-silence-any-voice-analysts-say-/7845329.html	2024-10-30T14:13:37-07:00	
US detects H5N1 bird flu in pig for first time	CHICAGO, ILLINOIS — H5N1 bird flu had been confirmed in a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon, the first detection of the virus in swine in the country, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday. Pigs represent a particular concern for the spread of bird flu because they can become co-infected with bird and human viruses, which could swap genes to form a new, more dangerous virus that can more easily infect humans. The USDA said there is no risk to the nation's pork supply from the Oregon case and that the risk to the public from bird flu remains low. Pigs were the source of the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009-2010, and have been implicated as the source of others, said Richard Webby, a St. Jude Children's Research Hospital virologist who studies flu in animals and birds for the World Health Organization. The finding of the virus in a small farm makes the pig infection less of a concern than if it had been detected in a commercial pig farm, he said. 'I think it probably doesn't increase the risk much, but surely, if this virus starts transmitting in pigs, that absolutely increases the risk,' he said. The Oregon farm has been quarantined, and other animals there, including sheep and goats, are under surveillance, the USDA said. Pigs and poultry on the farm were culled to prevent the spread of the virus and enable additional testing of the swine, the USDA said. Tests are still pending for two of the pigs, the agency said. The swine case originated with wild birds and not from a poultry or dairy farm, a USDA spokesperson said. Wild bird migration has carried bird flu to poultry flocks and cattle herds. The case was one factor that prompted the USDA to broaden its bird flu surveillance to include nationwide bulk milk testing, which the agency announced on Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told Reuters in an interview. 'While it’s a different variation of the virus and it is tied to wild birds, it is a factor to make sure that we understand and appreciate exactly where the virus is in dairy and in bovine,' he said. The pigs on the Oregon farm were not intended for the commercial food supply, the USDA said. The agency said that poultry and swine on the backyard farm shared water sources, housing and equipment, which have all served as pathways for transmitting the virus between animals in other states. The detection is a warning for pig farmers to be on the lookout for further infections, said Marie Culhane, a professor of veterinary population medicine at the University of Minnesota who has researched flu viruses in swine. 'People need to start increasing their plans to deal with it if it should happen in another herd and another herd,' Culhane said. 'Pigs are just really good at picking up influenza viruses.' This year, 36 people have tested positive for bird flu as the virus has spread to nearly 400 dairy herds. All but one of the people were farm workers who had known contact with infected animals. Since 2022, the virus has wiped out more than 100 million poultry birds in the nation's worst-ever bird flu outbreak.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-detects-h5n1-bird-flu-in-pig-for-first-time/7845250.html	2024-10-30T12:44:39-07:00	
Chinese steel plant: Zimbabwe's economic boon or environmental nightmare?	harare, zimbabwe — Zimbabwe is aiming to be home to Africa’s largest steel plant, but disputes over the project continue even as it ramps up production. Over the past few months, villagers have been accusing the Chinese steel plant’s subsidiary Dinson Iron and Steel Company, or DISCO, of taking over their land without compensation, damaging the environment and not helping them relocate. There are also concerns that the project, along with the impact of the climate crisis, is impacting food security for villagers who live in areas near the plant. Chokutaura Chananda, 81, head of Mushenjere, a village in central Zimbabwe, told VOA that villagers are asking all stakeholders for help. They are also urging the Chinese steel company to honor its promises of compensation and relocation. 'We are appealing to all parties involved to intervene, to come together and support our cause,' Chananda said. 'As the rightful owners of the land, we deserve to be treated fairly by DISCO. We seek development, not destruction.' DISCO, which is a subsidiary of Tsingshan Holding Group of China, touted as one of the world’s largest producers of stainless steel, denies any wrongdoing. In June, some local villagers staged a protest and attempted to block DISCO’s trucks from entering the plant. The villagers accused the company of forcing residents off their farmland with no compensation, resulting in food shortages and severe dust pollution. Chananda told VOA that while the company welcomes investments and business development, residents felt the company’s behavior had been disrespectful and insensitive. The giant steel and mining company is erecting a wall around farmland and pastures in the area, further isolating families in Mushenjere Village from the traditional sources of livelihood. Before 2021, when the steel mine came to Manhize, residents in the area relied primarily on subsistence farming for their livelihood. Villagers said the plant has displaced more than 100 families, leaving them impoverished and food insecure according to villagers. A September report released by Centre for Natural Resource Governance concluded that Chinese mining operations in Zimbabwe are not necessarily mutually beneficial. 'Evidence on the ground shows a widening rift between Chinese nationals and their Zimbabwean employees and host communities. Increasingly, ordinary Zimbabweans are accusing China of exhibiting colonial traits,' the report said. The villages near the DISCO 'plant have been conspicuously excluded from engagement platforms' by the Chinese company, the report found. The report adds that 'this lack of meaningful engagement and consultation has led to feelings of disenfranchisement and marginalization among the affected communities.' Promises of economic benefits The $1.5 billion plant started production in July and is expected to create 10,000 new jobs when it reaches the final phase of production. It is currently operating at 60% of its capacity and aims to be at 75% sometime early next year. Anticipated to be an economic boon to Zimbabwe, the country hopes to reap financial benefits from the project when steel can be exported from the plant in the future. The steel industry could contribute approximately $5 billion to the national economy, said Winston Chitando, Zimbabwe’s Minister of Mines and Mining Development, after touring the plant in June. Wilfred Motsi, project director for the Dinson Group, said the development marks a huge milestone in Zimbabwe's manufacturing industry. 'We are going back to our glory days when Zimbabwe was known as one of the industrial hubs in southern Africa because of the opening of the steel industry,' said Dinson Group project director, Wilfred Motsi, told Chinese state news agency, Xinhua in June. Food insecurity and the environment Despite promises of infrastructure development, including roads and housing, residents said there has been a lack of progress. There is fear that the displacement is exacerbating an already fragile existence among the villagers. In August, the UN described levels of food insecurity in Zimbabwe as 'rapidly deteriorating after it was hit with historic droughts.' Chenjerai Mushore, chairman of three affected villages, echoed these concerns, highlighting the ongoing environmental challenges and a slow compensation process. Mushore claimed that the mine’s road resurfacing project has led to dust pollution. He emphasized the urgent need to complete the road project to mitigate these risks. Response to concerns DISCO’s spokesperson, Joseph Shoko has denied any wrongdoing and told VOA the company is committed to environmental compliance and is investing in state-of-the-art sewage ponds and chimneys. Since the villagers' farmlands are now within the perimeter of the steel plant, Shoko said DISCO has also been supporting 22 seniors who are considered the head of households with US $200 a month for food since February until they are relocated to a new place to live. Shoko told VOA there are also plans to support six additional heads of households. Shoko added that younger residents are offered job opportunities instead of monetary assistance. Additionally, the company is prioritizing these residents for employment opportunities as they await relocation, he said. According to Mushore and Shoko the mine is building new homes in a designated relocation area to accommodate the displaced community. Shoko further explained that compensation evaluations involving government ministries are currently underway. 'The final compensation amount will be determined by these ministries following a thorough assessment,' Shoko concluded. Chitando, Zimbabwe’s minister of mines, has not responded to VOA’s request for comment. Zimbabwe-Sino relationship Zimbabwe and China have maintained a strong alliance over the years. The relationship deepened significantly when Western nations imposed economic sanctions on Zimbabwe during Robert Mugabe's presidency. As international funding and investment declined, China emerged as a major supporter. Under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe and China elevated their partnership to a strategic level in 2018. This move facilitated increased Chinese investment, particularly in the extractive industries. However, the DISCO steel plant has been criticized by environmental and human rights activists for its potential negative impact on the environment. Zimbabwe’s environmental standards agency, the Environmental Management Authority, or EMA, is working with the Steel Mine in addressing the issues which were raised by activists and villagers said the agency’s Environmental Education and Publicity manager, Amkela Sidange. She said EMA is closely overseeing the implementation of abatement measures outlined in a previous environmental audit. In response to VOA's request for comment, the EMA said that there are currently no environmental violations at the Dinson-Manhize plant; however, 'monitoring the progression on implementation of abatement measures proposed on environmental compliance during a previous Environmental Audit by the Agency at the same plant' was conducted a few months ago. The EMA said the steel company has been addressing issues identified in the audit, including upgrades to the access road from Dinson to Mavise into a tarred road to further reduce dust. The company is applying for necessary environmental licenses, including for effluent disposal and air emissions, the EMA said, adding that it will continue to monitor the plant 'to ensure they are completed within set time frames and ensure the project development is done in a manner that does not harm the environment or health of the public.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-steel-plant-zimbabwe-s-economic-boon-or-environmental-nightmare-/7845150.html	2024-10-30T11:45:21-07:00	
Concerns about Musk, Putin conversations still cause concern	WASHINGTON — Reports that billionaire Elon Musk has been talking on a consistent basis with Russian President Vladimir Putin are still reverberating among current and former U.S. officials, almost a week after news of the conversations first surfaced. Musk, who owns electric car maker Tesla and the X social media platform, also owns SpaceX, a commercial spaceflight company that has numerous contracts with the U.S. government, doing work for the Department of Defense and U.S. space agency NASA. Some of that work is so sensitive that the United States has given Musk high-level security clearances due to his knowledge of the programs, raising concerns among some that top secret U.S. information and capabilities could be at risk. According to current and former U.S., European and Russian officials who spoke to The Wall Street Journal, such concerns may be warranted. During one conversation, those officials said, Putin allegedly asked Musk not to activate Starlink, a SpaceX subsidiary that provides satellite internet services, over Taiwan as a favor to China. 'I think it should be investigated,' NASA administrator Bill Nelson told the Semafor World Economy Summit on Friday, a day after The Journal published its report. 'I don’t know that that story is true,' Nelson said, adding, if it is, 'I think that would be concerning, particularly for NASA, for the Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies.' Russia and Musk deny frequent calls Musk has previously denied frequent calls with Putin. In 2022, Musk said he had spoken to the Russian leader just once, but The Journal said there have been repeated conversations since then. Musk has not commented or responded to the Journal article on X. Russia has also denied there have been frequent conversations between Putin and Musk. The Pentagon has so far declined to refute or confirm the allegations. 'We have seen the reporting from The Wall Street Journal but cannot corroborate the veracity of those reports,' Defense Department spokesperson Sue Gough told VOA in an email late Friday. '[We] would refer you to Mr. Musk to speak to his private communications,' Gough said, adding that, by law, the department does not comment on the details or status of anyone’s security clearance. 'We expect everyone who has been granted a security clearance, including contractors, to follow the prescribed procedures for reporting foreign contacts,' she said. Former U.S. intelligence officials who spoke to VOA said the reported conversations, since confirmed by other U.S. news organizations citing their own confidential sources, raise significant questions. 'There is no doubt that Russia is cultivating many possible channels of influence in the United States and other Western countries,' said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA officer who now teaches at Georgetown University. 'Russia would regard a wealthy and influential business mogul such as Musk as potentially a highly useful channel and thus a relationship worth nurturing,' he said. Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and former senior director of the White House Situation Room, is also wary. 'It does get the spider-sense tingling,' he told VOA. 'If the reports of Musk’s repeated conversations with Vladimir Putin are true, I would definitely have some concerns,' Pfeiffer said. 'Russia under Putin will cultivate support wherever it can be bought, cajoled or coerced. 'Putin has equal opportunity security services that will take advantage of any opportunity to get foreign business leaders to influence their governments to align with Russian interests,' he said. Concerns don't equal wrongdoing Former officials like Pillar and Pfeiffer, though, caution there is a difference between concerns and actual wrongdoing. Other former officials note that even if Musk engaged in conversations that could make some in government uncomfortable, just having those conversations is not necessarily illegal. 'Americans are allowed to talk to essentially whomever they want,' said a former national security prosecutor, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity. 'There's no inherent limitation.' And in the case of a high-profile individual who oversees companies with global reach, conversations with foreign officials could be unavoidable. 'For a businessman, there may be commercially legitimate reasons to have those communications,' the former prosecutor said. 'It's when a businessman is having those communications, perhaps for political reasons or even proto-diplomatic reasons, that it gets probably more concerning from a counterintelligence perspective.' There also may not be any legal issues with a potential failure by someone like Musk to voluntarily disclose conversations with foreign leaders. Hiding such conversations when asked about them, however, could wade into criminal territory. Still, given the value the U.S. gets from Musk’s companies, U.S. officials may feel like they have little recourse. 'It is one of those unfair things in life that if the government has a unique need for you, you can get away with more and still get a security clearance,' the former prosecutor said. 'Someone who has unique value is going to get more accommodation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/concerns-about-musk-putin-conversations-still-cause-concern/7845082.html	2024-10-30T10:56:11-07:00	
Rival campaign merchandise sellers try lowering political temperature	In the U.S. presidential campaign, there is little to agree on between supporters of Kamala Harris and supporters of Donald Trump. From California, Genia Dulot brings us the story of two people selling rival campaign merchandise who are trying to lower the political temperature of their customers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rival-campaign-merchandise-sellers-try-lowering-political-temperature/7845052.html	2024-10-30T10:44:03-07:00	
Botswana's president defends electoral body as nation votes	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswanan President Mokgweetsi Masisi is defending the country’s electoral body amid criticism of its preparedness as voting began Wednesday. Critics said some polling stations opened late, there weren’t enough stations to handle the number of voters, and lines were long. Masisi, who is seeking a second and final term, told journalists after casting his vote in his home village of Moshupa, southwest of Gaborone, that he is confident of victory. The election will determine the makeup of parliament, and lawmakers will later elect the president. Masisi also said he was content with the conduct of the Independent Electoral Commission, which has faced criticism from opposition parties on how it has handled the pre-election period. He said any appearance that the IEC is not independent of his executive branch is 'really almost cosmetic,' explaining that the government budget process requires the executive branch to present a budget on behalf of all other areas of the government, including the judiciary. 'Some are suggesting for the IEC to be independent,' Masisi said, '[that] they must go to parliament to present [their own] budget. But they are not members of parliament. How do you get an independent body to account to politicians?' Voting began with some polling stations opening late. IEC spokesperson Osupile Maroba acknowledged the difficulties but said they were resolved early enough to allow voters to cast their ballots. On the eve of the election, opposition parties took the IEC to court, questioning the electoral commission’s readiness. Maroba said the parties were within their rights to seek the intervention of the courts. 'We are dealing with a sensitive emotive process that will always bring about complaints,' Maroba said. 'It will bring about challenges that will lead to going to the courts. As the laws of Botswana allow, anybody who is not happy with a process has a way to try and seek redress.' Meanwhile, Masisi said the time spent at the polling stations could be improved through a digital voting system. Some voters were at the polling stations as early as 4 a.m. One voter, Mosedi Kenosi, said he ran out of patience due to the slow process. 'Maybe I will go back later,' he said. 'The process has been slow. I waited for more than three hours to vote. The verification process takes forever, which discourages voters.' The elections come as the country faces an economic downturn due to weak global diamond sales. The opposition has criticized Masisi’s party, the Botswana Democratic Party, for failing to provide solutions. Polling stations were expected to close at 7 p.m., with early results expected Thursday morning. This story includes information from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-president-defends-electoral-body-as-nation-votes/7845002.html	2024-10-30T10:12:34-07:00	
Britain identifies its first case of new mpox variant	LONDON — Britain has detected its first case of new mpox variant clade Ib, the country's health security agency (UKHSA) said Wednesday, adding that the risk to the population remained low. The clade Ib variant is a new form of the virus that was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in August after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to neighboring countries in Africa. The case, in a patient who had recently traveled to affected countries in Africa, was detected in London and the individual has been transferred to a specialist hospital, the UKHSA said. Close contacts of the case are being followed up by UKHSA and partner organizations, the UKHSA added. There have been cases of mpox clade Ib reported in Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Sweden, India and Germany, as well as Congo. It is a different form of the virus from clade II, which spread globally in 2022, largely among men who have sex with men. Mpox is a viral infection that typically causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions, and while usually mild it can kill. Clade Ib is thought to cause more severe disease than clade II. Both forms can be transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual contact. The United Kingdom authorities said they would not provide any more details about the patient, but added that the person's contacts were being followed up and would be offered testing and vaccination as needed, as well as further care if they test positive or have symptoms. According to the latest WHO figures, there have been more than 44,000 confirmed and suspected cases of mpox in Africa this year, and more than 1,000 deaths, largely in Congo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-identifies-its-first-case-of-new-mpox-variant/7844927.html	2024-10-30T09:12:21-07:00	
US airstrikes target multiple sites in Syria, killing up to 35 Islamic State militants	The U.S. military has struck a number of Islamic State group camps in Syria this week, killing as many as 35 militants, U.S. Central Command said Wednesday. The airstrikes in the desert of central Syria were done Monday evening and targeted multiple locations and senior leaders of the group. The attacks came on the heels of a number of joint operations with Iraqi forces that targeted IS militants in Iraq. Pentagon officials have said that the Islamic State group remains a threat in the region, but it is no longer as powerful as it was 10 years ago when the militants swept across Iraq and Syria, taking control of large swaths of the two countries. U.S. Central Command said the latest strikes in Syria will disrupt the group's ability to plan, organize and conduct attacks against civilians and U.S. and allied forces in the region. It said there were no indications of civilian casualties in the strikes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-airstrikes-target-multiple-sites-in-syria-killing-up-to-35-islamic-state-militants/7844913.html	2024-10-30T09:09:32-07:00	
Indians mark Diwali by lighting record number of earthen lamps	LUCKNOW, INDIA — Millions of Indians began celebrating the annual Hindu festival of lights, Diwali, by symbolically lighting a record 2.51 million earthen oil lamps at dusk on Wednesday on the banks of the Saryu River in a northern Indian city they believe to be the birthplace of the deity Lord Ram. Diwali is the most important festival of the year in India — for the Hindu majority in particular. It is marked by socializing and exchanging gifts with loved ones. Many light earthen oil lamps and candles, and fireworks are set off. In the evening, a special prayer is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring luck and prosperity. A Guinness World Records team presented a certificate to Uttar Pradesh state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, acknowledging the unprecedented number of oil lamps, exceeding last year's 2.2 million. Drone cameras closely monitored the event. The celebrations took place within the northern city of Ayodhya where Prime Minister Narendra Modi nine months ago opened a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a historic mosque following a Supreme Court decision, seen as a political win for the populist leader. The establishment of the temple dedicated to Lord Ram fulfilled a long-standing demand by millions of Hindus. On Wednesday, thousands of volunteers lit lamps, called 'Diyas,' along riverbanks, lanes, fronts and roofs of homes. 'More than 30,000 volunteers, primarily college students, worked meticulously to maintain the systematic pattern of burning lamps for the prescribed time,' said Dr. Pratibha Goyal, vice chancellor of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University, who coordinated the massive effort. The earthen lamps lit along 55 riverfront steps of the river Saryu created a captivating display throughout 1.5 kilometers (1 mile). As the lamps remained lit for over five minutes, government spokesperson Shishir Singh said Ayodhya achieved its seventh consecutive world record for the largest display. Singh said that around 91,000 liters of mustard oil were used to light the lamps. The event transformed Ayodhya into a city of lights amid devotional bhajan singing. A laser show depicting scenes from the epic Ramayana added to the immersive experience, and an eco-friendly fireworks show lit the skyline. Traditional decorations, including elaborate arches and grand gateways along the main highways, were in abundance, capturing the festive atmosphere as folk cultural performances drew pilgrims to the streets. The festival also featured a massive praying ceremony performed by 1,100 priests along riverbanks. Security was tightened across the city. Paramilitary commandos, bomb detectors, dog squads, face-recognition technology and monitoring drones were deployed throughout the city, police officer Rajkaran Nayyar said. Major Hindu festivals such as Dussehra and Diwali are associated with tales of Lord Ram extolling the virtues of truth, sacrifice and ethical governance. Diwali's main festival celebrations will be held across the country on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indians-mark-diwali-by-lighting-record-number-of-earthen-lamps/7844903.html	2024-10-30T09:07:00-07:00	
Harris promises to 'represent all Americans' after Biden 'garbage' remark	WASHINGTON — Kamala Harris said she disagrees 'with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,' reacting after U.S. President Joe Biden's reference to Donald Trump's supporters and 'garbage.' 'I will represent all Americans, including those who don't vote for me,' the vice president said. Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, made the comment to reporters as she prepared to campaign in three states. Her words were an attempt to blunt the controversy over Biden's rhetoric with less than a week until the end of the campaign. The tumult began Tuesday night around the time that Harris was delivering a unifying message in a speech near the White House. Inside the building, Biden was criticizing Trump's recent Madison Square Garden rally, where a comedian described Puerto Rico as an 'island of garbage.' 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American,' Biden said in a campaign call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino. 'It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been.' Biden and the White House rushed to explain that the president was talking about the rhetoric on stage, not Trump's supporters themselves. But Republicans seized on Biden's comments, claiming they were an echo of the time when Hillary Clinton, as the Democratic nominee against Trump in 2016, said half of Trump's supporters belong to a 'basket of deplorables.' In attacking Biden, and by extension, Harris, Republicans are glossing over Trump's own history of insulting and demonizing rhetoric, such as calling the United States a 'garbage can for the world' or describing political opponents as 'the enemy within.' Trump has also described Harris as a 'stupid person' and 'lazy as hell,' and he's questioned whether she was on drugs. Trump has also refused demands to apologize for the comment about Puerto Rico at his rally, acknowledging 'somebody said some bad things' but 'I can't imagine it's a big deal.' Political attack lines have a history of occasionally boomeranging back on people who use them. For example, Ohio Senantor JD Vance, now Trump's running mate, once described Democrats as beholden to 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made.' Vance's three-year-old comments were resurfaced once he became the vice presidential nominee, energizing Harris supporters who repurposed the label as a point of pride on shirts and bumper stickers — much like Trump's supporters once cheerfully branded themselves as 'deplorables.' On Wednesday morning, Harris' running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, downplayed Biden's comments in television interviews. He told 'CBS Mornings' that Biden 'was very clear that he's speaking about the rhetoric we heard,' not the supporters themselves. Walz made a similar comment on ABC's 'Good Morning America,' where he emphasized that Democrats' inclusive message. 'Let's be very clear, the vice president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this,' he said. 'Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric is what needs to end.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-promises-to-represent-all-americans-after-biden-garbage-remark/7844875.html	2024-10-30T08:42:43-07:00

US cracks down on Russia’s sanctions evasion in fresh action	WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday imposed curbs on hundreds of targets in fresh action against Russia, taking aim at sanctions circumvention in a signal that the U.S. is committed to countering evasion. The action, taken by the U.S. Treasury and State departments, imposed sanctions on nearly 400 entities and people from over a dozen countries, according to statements from the Treasury and State departments. The action was the most concerted push so far against third-country evasion, a State Department official told Reuters. It included sanctions on dozens of Chinese, Hong Kong and Indian companies, the most from those countries to be hit in one package so far, according to the official. Also hit with sanctions were targets in Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Thailand, Malaysia, Switzerland and elsewhere. The action comes as Washington has sought to curb Russia's evasion of the sanctions imposed after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which has killed or wounded thousands and reduced cities to rubble. The U.S. has repeatedly warned against supplying Russia with Common High Priority Items — advanced components that include microelectronics deemed by the U.S. and European Union as likely to be used for Russia's war in Ukraine. 'This should send a serious message to both the governments and the private sectors of these countries that the U.S. government is committed to countering the evasion of our sanctions against Russia and to continue putting pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine,' the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 274 targets, while the State Department designated more than 120. The U.S. Commerce Department added 40 companies and research institutions to a trade restriction list over their alleged support of the Russian military. 'The United States and our allies will continue to take decisive action across the globe to stop the flow of critical tools and technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine,' Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in the statement. A senior administration official said Wednesday's action was designed to signal the U.S. would act against Indian companies if progress were not made through communication. 'With India, we have been very direct and blunt with them about the concerns we have about what we see as sort of emerging trends in that country that we want to stop before they get too far down the road,' the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. India-based Futrevo was among the companies targeted by the State Department, which accused it of being involved in the supply of high-priority items to the Russia-based manufacturer of Orlan drones. The Treasury also targeted Shreya Life Sciences Private Limited, which it said since 2023 has sent hundreds of shipments of U.S.-trademarked technology to Russia, totaling tens of millions of dollars. A second senior State Department official told Reuters on Tuesday that more than 70% of the high-priority goods getting to Russia was from China, more than an estimated $22 billion worth since the start of the war. 'That's over 13 times the next largest supplier,' the official said, which as of the end of 2023 was Turkey. Among those targeted Wednesday were Hong Kong and China-based companies involved in the shipment of tens of millions of dollars’ worth of high-priority items to Russia-based companies or end-users, the State and Treasury departments said. The U.S. also took actions on a variety of entities supporting Russia's Arctic project, which is 60% owned by Russia's Novatek and was to become Russia's largest liquefied natural gas plant. Novatek has been forced to scale back Arctic, which had been planned to reach an eventual output of 19.8 million metric tons per year, following a raft of U.S. sanctions starting in 2023 with additional measures in August and September. But the U.S. held back from using an executive order signed by President Joe Biden last year that threatened penalties for financial institutions that help Russia circumvent sanctions. The senior administration official said banking sectors had taken notice of the authority and sort of moved into compliance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-cracks-down-on-russia-s-sanctions-evasion-in-fresh-action/7844808.html	2024-10-30T08:06:41-07:00	
Supreme Court allows Virginia to resume purge of voter registrations	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Virginia to resume its purge of voter registrations that the state says is aimed at stopping people who are not U.S. citizens from voting. The justices, over the dissents of the three liberal justices, granted an emergency appeal from Virginia's Republican administration led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The court provided no rationale for its action, which is typical in emergency appeals. The justices acted on Virginia's appeal after a federal judge found that the state illegally purged more than 1,600 voter registrations in the past two months. A federal appeals court had previously allowed the judge's order to remain in effect. Such voting is rare in American elections, but the specter of immigrants voting illegally has been a main part of the political messaging this year from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Trump had criticized the earlier ruling, calling it 'a totally unacceptable travesty' on social media. 'Only U.S. Citizens should be allowed to vote,' Trump wrote. The Justice Department and a coalition of private groups sued the state earlier in October, arguing that Virginia election officials, acting on an executive order issued in August by Youngkin were striking names from voter rolls in violation of federal election law. The National Voter Registration Act requires a 90-day 'quiet period' ahead of elections for the maintenance of voter rolls so that legitimate voters are not removed from the rolls by bureaucratic errors or last-minute mistakes that cannot be quickly corrected. Youngkin issued his order on Aug. 7, the 90th day before the election. It required daily checks of data from the state Department of Motor Vehicles against voter rolls to identify people who are not U.S. citizens. U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles said elections officials still could remove names on an individualized basis, but not through a systematic purge. Court records indicated that at least some of those whose registrations were removed are U.S. citizens. Giles had ordered the state to notify affected voters and local registrars by Wednesday that the registrations have been restored. Nearly 6 million Virginians are registered to vote. In a similar lawsuit in Alabama, a federal judge this month ordered the state to restore eligibility for more than 3,200 voters who had been deemed ineligible noncitizens. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the 3,251 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-allows-virginia-to-resume-purge-of-voter-registrations-/7844785.html	2024-10-30T07:45:57-07:00	
RFE/RL journalist marks 5 months jailed in Azerbaijan	An Azerbaijani journalist with VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Wednesday marked five months since he was detained in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, on charges his employer rejects. Farid Mehralizada, an economist and journalist for RFE/RL’s Azerbaijani Service, Radio Azadliq, was abducted in Baku by unidentified men on May 30 and has been in pretrial detention since June 1. 'Today marks five months since RFE/RL journalist and economist Farid Mehralizada was unjustly detained in Azerbaijan. We are deeply concerned by his continued imprisonment on false charges,' RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said in a statement Wednesday. On June 1, a Baku court placed Mehralizada under pretrial detention for 'conspiring to smuggle foreign currency' in connection with a case brought against the independent media outlet Abzas Media. Then in August, authorities brought new charges against Mehralizada, accusing him of 'illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery.' He faces up to 12 years behind bars for all the charges against him. RFE/RL has called for Mehralizada’s release. 'We call for his immediate release so he can return home to his wife and newborn daughter,' Capus said in the statement. On the day of Mehralizada’s initial detention, authorities raided his home and seized a car, a computer and mobile phones, according to RFE/RL. In September, Mehralizada’s pretrial detention was extended until mid-December. The indictment, which doesn’t mention Radio Azadliq, also fails to establish a clear link between Mehralizada and Abzas Media. Meanwhile, Abzas Media has said Mehralizada’s involvement with the outlet was limited to offering expert commentary. Abzas Media is one of the few remaining independent outlets in Azerbaijan. It is known for its coverage of corruption, including allegations linked to the country’s ruling family. More than a dozen journalists are jailed in Azerbaijan on charges viewed as politically motivated, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. Several Abzas Media journalists are among those jailed. Twenty-five civil society groups, including CPJ and Reporters Without Borders, have called for all the defendants in the Abzas Media case to be released. Mehralizada’s jailing underscores the poor state of press freedom in Azerbaijan, where the government has long cracked down on criticism. On the 2024 Global Press Freedom Index, Azerbaijan ranks 164 out of 180 countries in terms of media freedom. Azerbaijan’s Washington Embassy and Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story. Azerbaijan’s government has targeted RFE/RL’s Azerbaijani Service for years. Radio Azadliq was banned from broadcasting on FM frequencies in 2009, and its Baku bureau was raided and shut down in 2014. The service’s website was blocked three years later in 2017. Former Bureau Chief Khadija Ismayilova was arrested and jailed for 18 months in 2014, and in 2021, Azerbaijani authorities used Pegasus spyware to target at least five Radio Azadliq journalists, according to RFE/RL. Mehralizada is one of four RFE/RL journalists currently jailed for their work. The others are Ihar Losik and Andrey Kuznechyk in Belarus, and Vladyslav Yesypenko in Russian-occupied Crimea. RFE/RL rejects the charges against all of them as false.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rfe-rl-journalist-marks-5-months-jailed-in-azerbaijan/7844748.html	2024-10-30T07:45:49-07:00	
US economy grew at a solid 2.8% pace last quarter on strength of consumer spending	Washington — The U.S. economy grew at a healthy 2.8% annual rate from July through September, with consumers helping drive growth despite the weight of still-high interest rates. Wednesday's report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product — the economy's total output of goods and services — did slow slightly from its 3% growth rate in the April-June quarter. But the latest figures still reflect surprising durability just as Americans assess the state of the economy in the final stretch of the presidential race. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.7% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period. Exports also contributed to the third quarter's growth, increasing at an 8.9% rate. On the other hand, growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. But spending on equipment surged. The report is the first of three estimates the government will make of GDP growth for the third quarter of the year. The U.S. economy has continued to expand in the face of the much higher borrowing rates the Federal Reserve imposed in 2022 and 2023 in its drive to curb inflation. Despite widespread predictions that the economy would succumb to a recession, it has kept growing, with employers still hiring and consumers still spending. In a sign that the nation's households, whose purchases drive most of the economy, will continue spending, the Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index posted its biggest monthly gain since March 2021. The proportion of consumers who expect a recession in the next 12 months dropped to its lowest point since the board first posed that question in July 2022. At the same time, the nation's once-sizzling job market has lost some momentum. On Tuesday, the government reported that the number of job openings in the United States fell in September to its lowest level since January 2021. And employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs a month so far this year — a healthy number but down from a record 604,000 in 2021 as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, 377,000 in 2022 and 251,000 in 2023. On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the economy added 120,000 jobs in October. That gain, though, will probably have been significantly held down by the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and by a strike at Boeing, the aviation giant, all of which temporarily knocked thousands of people off payrolls. Wednesday's report contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Fed's favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter and the lowest figure in more than four years. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.2%, down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter. Despite the continued progress on inflation, average prices still far exceed their pre-pandemic levels, which has exasperated many Americans and posed a challenge to Vice President Kamala Harris' prospects in her race against former President Donald Trump. Most mainstream economists have suggested, though, that Trump's policy proposals, unlike Harris', would worsen inflation. At its most recent meeting last month, the Fed was satisfied enough with its progress against inflation — and concerned enough by the slowing job market — to slash its benchmark rate by a hefty half percentage point, its first and largest rate cut in more than four years. When it meets next week, the Fed is expected to announce another rate cut, this one by a more typical quarter-point. The central bank's policymakers have also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate again at their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. The cumulative result of the Fed's rate cuts, over time, will likely be lower borrowing rates for consumers and businesses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7844694.html	2024-10-30T06:50:17-07:00	
Cambodian archaeologists discover centuries-old statues at Angkor	PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA — Archaeologists in Cambodia have unearthed a dozen centuries-old sandstone statues in a 'remarkable discovery' at the Angkor World Heritage Site near the city of Siem Reap, authorities said Wednesday. The statues — depicting 'door guardians' — were discovered last week near the north gate leading to the 11th-century Royal Palace at Angkor Thom, the last capital of the Khmer Empire, said Long Kosal, spokesperson for the Apsara National Authority, the government agency that oversees the archaeological park. Teams were assessing the ancient gate's structure and searching for fallen stones around the portal on the north side of Angkor Thom, one of four entrances to the complex, when the discovery was made. The statues depict guardians standing at attention and vary in size from about 1 meter to 110 centimeters (about 39 to 43 inches). They were found buried at depths of up to 1.4 meters (4.5 feet), and some are in surprisingly good shape, with each featuring unique facial hair ornaments, adding to their distinctiveness, archaeologist Sorn Chanthorn said. 'Experts believe these door guardian statues exemplify the Khneang Style, aligning with the construction period of the 11th-century palace.' the Apsara National Authority said. Angkor Thom is part of the Angkor Archaeological Park, a complex that sprawls over some 400 square kilometers (155 square miles), named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992 and one of Southeast Asia's most popular tourist destinations. It contains the ruins of Khmer Empire capitals from the 9th to 15th centuries, including the temple of Angkor Wat. The site, near Siem Reap, about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of the capital, Phnom Penh, drew more than 500,000 international visitors in the first half of 2024, according to Cambodia's Tourism Ministry. The archaeological dig was a collaborative project between Apsara and the China-Cambodia Government Team for Safeguarding Angkor, Apsara said. Following the discovery of the statues, the archaeological team carefully documented their positions before removing them for cleaning and restoration. They will eventually be returned to their original locations, authorities said. Many Khmer cultural treasures were looted during the long period of civil war and instability when Cambodia was ruled by the brutal communist Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s. Cambodia has benefited from a trend that in recent decades has seen the repatriation of art and archaeological treasures taken from their homelands. In August, it celebrated the return of dozens of artifacts from museums and private collections abroad. It has also come under criticism for efforts to clean up the Angkor site, which has involved relocating thousands of families in what Amnesty International has condemned as a 'gross violation of international human rights law.' At its meeting in July, the U.N.'s World Heritage Committee recommended that Cambodia invite a new team of experts to monitor the situation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodian-archaeologists-discover-centuries-old-statues-at-angkor/7844674.html	2024-10-30T06:37:24-07:00	
Pakistan hires 2 law firms to fight Iran's pipeline delay claim	Islamabad — Pakistan has hired two U.S.-based law firms to represent it at the International Court of Arbitration as it fights Iran’s bid to force the neighbor country to uphold its end of a gas pipeline deal or pay a large penalty. Tehran and Islamabad signed a gas sales and purchase agreement (GSPA) in June 2009 for a cross-border pipeline that would supply as much as a billion cubic feet per day of gas to energy-starved Pakistan from Iran’s South Pars Field. However, Pakistan has not started construction of the pipeline on its territory, primarily to avoid invoking U.S. sanctions. In August, Pakistani media reported Tehran served Islamabad a final notice ahead of approaching the Paris-based arbitration body. The two law firms; Wilkie Farr and Gallagher, and White & Case, will represent Pakistan in arbitration proceedings, a highly placed source in the Office of the Attorney General of Pakistan confirmed to VOA Wednesday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity, because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Islamabad reportedly faces a penalty of up to $18 billion for delaying the project. Background In 2011, Iran announced it had completed construction of 900 kilometers of the pipeline on its side of the border between the two countries. Two years later, Iran’s then-president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Pakistan’s President, Asif Ali Zardari, inaugurated the $7 billion project on Iranian territory. In 2014, Pakistan asked for a 10-year extension on the project to avoid paying a penalty of up to $1 million per day starting in 2015. In March 2024, close to the end of the extension period, Pakistan’s outgoing interim government rushed to approve construction of an 80-kilometer section of the pipeline from its border with Iran into the key southwestern port town of Gwadar in Balochistan province. However, construction is yet to begin. Last month, Pakistan’s minister for petroleum, Musadik Malik, told parliament that international sanctions stood in the way of proceeding with the cross-border pipeline. 'This is a deeply complicated matter and involves international sanctions,' the minister said. He rejected reports that the country could face a penalty of $18 billion but did not give a figure. Hours before the minister’s remarks, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller reiterated Washington’s warning against doing business with Tehran. 'We will continue to enforce our sanctions against Iran. We also advise anyone considering a business deal with Iran to be aware of its possible ramifications,' the spokesperson said at a regular media briefing. Iran is under U.S. sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. At times, Pakistan has signaled it will defy U.S. warnings but apparently has not done so operationally or publicly. Although Pakistan can construct a pipeline within its border, it requires a sanctions waiver from Washington to purchase gas from Iran. Islamabad has not acquired the waiver.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hires-two-law-firms-to-fight-iran-s-pipeline-delay-claim-/7844624.html	2024-10-30T06:23:04-07:00	
US experts see Pyongyang's Russia gambit as no-win situation for China	China's response to Russia's growing influence over North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Un, likely combines 'exasperation' and 'panic' as Beijing appears to be losing control over its client state, according to former U.S. policy and intelligence officials. They noted that the explicit security partnership between China's two neighbors —Russia and North Korea — could undermine China's strategic position in East Asia and has long-term implications that are not beneficial for China. On Wednesday, Russia's Foreign Ministry announced that North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui will hold 'strategic consultations' in Moscow with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, as the United States, South Korea, and NATO express alarm that Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to train in Russia. U.S. officials believe Russia intends to use North Korean soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. South Korea has condemned that as a significant security threat to the international community. In Beijing, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, and Russian deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko held talks Wednesday, with Wang reaffirming the strong ties between the two nations. The officials exchanged views on Ukraine but did not disclose details of their discussion. But Chinese officials have avoided direct comments on North Korea dispatching thousands of troops to Russia. 'China calls for all parties to deescalate the situation and strive for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. This position remains unchanged,' Lin Jian, a spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, repeated Beijing's stance during a briefing on Tuesday. China's panic 'The radio silence in Beijing on this subject is staggering,' said Dennis Wilder, a former senior intelligence official with the CIA. Wilder said Chinese President Xi Jinping is unlikely to say anything publicly as he faces an unpredictable Kim Jong Un. 'The Chinese have been very careful about nuclear assistance to the North Koreans, keeping them on IV drip of economic support so North Korea remains stable. But if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin goes down the road of nuclear assistance, this will bolster the American alliances in East Asia, maybe creating a true NATO.' 'And so [Chinese President Xi Jinping is] in a very, very difficult spot,' said Wilder during a seminar hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, on Tuesday. Wilder suggested that the U.S. could leverage its intelligence channels with China for joint data collection and analysis. Former White House national security council senior official Victor Cha said that by sending troops, North Korea is making a 'downpayment' to Russia on a mutual security partnership — something Pyongyang could never secure from Beijing. In China, he said, 'There's probably a combination of a little bit of exasperation, a little bit of panic and a little bit of they don't know what to do with regard to the current situation. 'The panic is that Russia now has arguably much more influence over North Korea than China does,' added Cha, who is currently president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department at CSIS. Both Wilder and Cha served on former U.S. president George W. Bush's National Security Council. Language barrier Other military analysts noted that while North Korean soldiers could gain real-world experience in combat operations simply by deploying to another country, they would also encounter significant challenges. 'You also have an immense language problem,' said Colonel Mark Cancian, who spent over three decades in the U.S. Marine Corps and is now a senior adviser with the CSIS International Security Program. He questioned how a group of North Koreans could effectively integrate with a Russian military unit and communicate and operate together. The possibility of Russia transferring technology related to ballistic missiles, air defenses and nuclear weapons to North Korea is 'probably the most dangerous' scenario from the U.S. point of view, according to Cancian. Violation of UNSC resolutions On Tuesday, U.S. officials disputed Russian foreign minister Lavrov's assertion that military assistance between Russia and North Korea does not violate international law. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday that 'Russia's training of DPRK soldiers involving arms or related material,' as well as 'any training or assistance involving DPRK soldiers in the use of ballistic missiles or other arms,' constitutes a direct violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. He was referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol announced plans to exchange delegations to coordinate actions and share intelligence regarding North Korean troop deployments to Russia. This week, Kyiv's special envoy to South Korea will begin talks with South Korean officials. In Washington, U.S. officials said they would welcome increased South Korean support for Ukraine. The South Korean government indicated that it would consider sending 'weapons for defense and attack' and may also dispatch military and intelligence personnel to Ukraine to analyze North Korean battlefield tactics and assist in interrogations of captured North Koreans. 'We, of course, welcome any country supporting our Ukrainian partners as they continue to defend their territorial integrity and sovereignty,' State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told VOA during a recent briefing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7844644.html	2024-10-30T06:06:21-07:00	
France allows six Russian army deserters, and partners, to enter country, apply for asylum	London — Thousands of Russians, including soldiers, have fled their country to seek asylum in the West since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, although only a fraction of asylum applications has been approved. However, in a landmark case, France has allowed several Russian army deserters to enter the country to seek refugee status. Anti-war activists hope it will prompt more Russian soldiers to flee. Alexander, who does not want to give his family name for fear of political retaliation, is among the six Russian men and four of their partners permitted to enter France in recent months. He and his wife, Irina, are now living in the French city of Caen as they await a court decision on their asylum applications. In January 2022, as Russia was preparing its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Alexander recounted that he was told to go to Russian-occupied Crimea for military exercises. He did not want to go — but was told he had no choice. Instead, his unit crossed the border into Ukraine as part of the invasion force. 'I was personally in shock; I didn't understand what was happening,' Alexander told Agence France-Presse in an interview. 'We had just crossed the border into Ukraine. I went to see my commander and asked him: 'What's going on? Why are we here? Why have we crossed the border? Why are we on the territory of another country?' ... I didn't get any answers to my questions.' Alexander eventually managed to flee the army. 'I realized then that I only had two choices: either leave Russia or go to prison. Because going back to the front — I didn't have the slightest desire, nor the moral possibility,' he said. 'Maybe, thanks to my example, someone will be inspired and want to quit the army. The weaker the army at the front is, the fewer people there are, the quicker the war will end and Ukraine will win,' the 26-year-old told AFP. Alexander and Irina initially fled to Kazakhstan, where they connected with other Russians escaping the war. However, many Russian exiles say they don't feel safe in former Soviet countries. Army deserters face 10 years or more in prison if caught and returned to Russia. A French court ruled in 2023 that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status, but most are not able to travel abroad to lodge an asylum application, said Ian Bond, a Russia expert and deputy director of the Centre for European Reform. 'It's relatively easy for Russians still to get to countries in the former Soviet Union. Russians have two passports — they have an internal passport and some have a foreign passport. Particularly for people of military age or active servicemen, even getting their hands on a foreign passport is extremely difficult,' Bond told VOA. But France granted permission for Alexander and Irina, along with eight other Russians, to enter the country and apply for asylum. It's believed they arrived in Paris on separate flights from Kazakhstan without passports or travel documents, although the exact details of their journeys have not been released. 'There are a number of ways in which they could have gotten to France, and I think they're not the first Russian deserters to get asylum in the West. But this seems to be a larger group — rather than in the past [when] I think there have just been some scattered individuals,' said analyst Bond. The decision followed months of advocacy and campaigning by organizations like Paris-based Russie-Libertes, which encourage Russians to desert the army. The groups say the deserters were meticulously vetted for their anti-war stance. Olga Prokopieva, the head of Russie-Libertes, said France's decision to allow the group of army deserters into the country was 'unprecedented' and urged other European countries to follow suit. 'It has taken us a year of talks. We have tried so many things,' she told Agence France-Presse. However, Prokopieva told VOA via email on October 29 that Russie-Libertes would no longer be commenting on or publicizing the case, an indication of the sensitivity of the asylum applications. Get Lost, a Georgia-based organization that helps Russians flee their country, claims to have aided more than 38,000 people, including thousands of soldiers. It also helped Alexander and Irina, along with the eight other Russians allowed to enter France. Many European nations will have security concerns, said Ian Bond of the Centre for European Reform. 'There will be some, maybe in eastern Europe, who will say Russians are always a security risk; we should not be encouraging this. There will be others, and I would be among them, who would say the more people that we can encourage to leave Russia, the more acute [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's shortage of manpower will be — not just for the armed forces, but also for the military industrial complex.' 'I think the fact that Russia has brought some thousands of North Korean troops to the battlefield is an indication that the manpower shortage is really starting to bite. But certainly, you'll have to scrutinize these people quite closely to make sure that you aren't importing Russian special forces disguised as deserters,' Bond told VOA. It's not clear if France intends to allow more Russian deserters to enter the country and claim asylum. The French foreign ministry did not respond to VOA requests for comment. Since fleeing Russia, deserter Alexander and Irina have created a YouTube channel aimed at other Russian soldiers. 'Maybe with the help of this YouTube channel, the soldiers who have already taken this step, who have left their unit, Russia, the conflict zone, will be able to pass on these ideas to those who are still there, who are at a crossroads, who decide to flee or stay,' Irina said. Sergei, another of the Russian deserters permitted to enter France, said Russian soldiers always have a choice. 'There is always a possibility to lay down your arms, not to kill other people and to end your participation in this war,' the 27-year-old told AFP.

New York media outlet connects immigrants with news and resources	On a drizzly day in New York's Chinatown, journalist April Xu suggested stopping at a bakery for a snack. 'But not Fay Da,' she said, referring to a bakery on the nearby corner. Xu doesn't go to Fay Da Bakery anymore. Not since she reported on how New York's largest Chinese bakery chain had allegedly stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages from its employees. Many people feel connected to the famous bakery, Xu told VOA. 'When they saw the news, they were shocked,' she said. In April, the bakery agreed to a $940,000 settlement to resolve claims by former and current employees. It was a big story — the kind that the nonprofit media outlet Documented, where she works, likes to tell. Under-covered stories on issues such as wage theft and housing are the focus of this immigrant-focused news outlet. With immigration a polarizing issue in the U.S. presidential election, the news outlet finds itself balancing its typical coverage with debunking false claims. As racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric is pushed by the far-right, Documented's team sees their local coverage of immigration as crucial. The inspiration for Documented came from dissatisfaction with how mainstream media often covered immigration, said co-founder Mazin Sidahmed. Born in Sudan, Sidahmed worked for The Guardian in New York and other media before helping set up his own outlet in 2018. 'No one was really covering how those big federal policy shifts were playing out at the local level in big cities like New York, where most immigrants actually live,' Sidahmed told VOA at the outlet's office in the Financial District. 'There was a real hole and a need for a site that was covering how federal immigration policy was playing out locally,' he said. A commitment to meeting the audience's needs has been central to Documented's success, Sidahmed said. Early on, the outlet launched a needs assessment focused on Spanish-speaking audiences. It was hugely successful in figuring out how to best serve that community, according to Sidahmed. They found that respondents felt that they were typically portrayed in the media as either criminals or victims, and they wanted news that would help them navigate government resources. When Documented learned that the community got most of its news from WhatsApp groups, it started a Spanish-language news service on the app. 'Over the past five years, it has really grown into an engine that's driving a lot of our most powerful journalism,' Sidahmed said. 'But getting it to that point was incredibly hard and challenging, and it involved building a lot of trust.' In addition to English and Spanish, Documented publishes in Mandarin and Haitian Creole. To better serve the Chinese community, Documented operates a news account on WeChat. For the Caribbean community, it uses the platform NextDoor. 'We feel that we can't ask people to go to our website to consume news every day. We should deliver the news to them,' Xu said. Platforms like WhatsApp and WeChat are two-way streets. Documented delivers news, and audiences can directly contact reporters with story tips or questions. That way, said Sidahmed, Documented can produce content that is in service of their needs. It also publishes content that helps audiences navigate government bureaucracy or access resources. 'I don't think there's any mainstream news outlet that is really working with immigrants directly in that way, to serve them, as opposed to just covering them,' said Fisayo Okare. Originally from Nigeria, she writes the outlet's newsletter. In 2022, New York City was home to about 3.1 million immigrants — accounting for 38% of the city's total population — according to a report from the mayor's office. Many of Documented's staffers count themselves among that population. Okare thinks their work is enhanced by the team's background. 'As an immigrant myself, I tend to understand what other immigrants are going through,' she said. 'We pride ourselves on not just writing about immigrants but writing for them.' More recently, that has included correcting baseless claims about illegal immigration, including conspiracy theories that candidate Donald Trump repeated about Haitians in Ohio. 'Our role during this time has been to put out the right information whenever just completely wrong or inaccurate information is shared,' Okare said. Documented has also bucked trends in the U.S., where the local news industry has been struggling for years. Over the past two decades, the U.S. has lost more than one-third of its newspapers, according to a 2024 report by Northwestern University's Local News Initiative. Almost 55 million people across the country have limited to no access to local news, the report found. 'When a city loses a local news institution, it has all of these other catastrophic effects on the city.

Beijing files WTO complaint over EU's new taxes on Chinese EVs	Beijing — Beijing said Wednesday it had lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the European Union's decision to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars. The extra taxes of up to 35% were announced Tuesday after an EU probe found Chinese state subsidies were undercutting European automakers, but the move has faced opposition from Germany and Hungary, which fear provoking Beijing's ire and setting off a bitter trade war. China slammed Brussels's decision on Wednesday morning, saying it did not 'agree with or accept' the tariffs and had filed a complaint under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism. 'China will... take all necessary measures to firmly protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,' Beijing's commerce ministry said. EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said Tuesday that 'by adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base.' 'We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field,' he said. But Germany's main auto industry association warned the tariffs heightened the risk of 'a far-reaching trade conflict,' while a Chinese trade group slammed the 'politically motivated' decision even as it urged dialogue between the two sides. The duties will come on top of the current 10 percent on imports of electric vehicles from China. The decision became law following its publication in the EU's official journal on Tuesday, and the duties will enter into force from Wednesday. Once they do, the tariffs will be definitive and last for five years. The extra duties also apply, at various rates, to vehicles made in China by foreign groups such as Tesla, which faces a tariff of 7.85%. Chinese car giant Geely — one of the country's largest sellers of EVs — faces an extra duty of 18.8%, while SAIC will be hit with the highest at 35.3 percent. Ailing companies The tariffs do not have the support of the majority of the EU's 27 member states but in a vote early this month, the opposition was not enough to block them, which would have required at least 15 states representing 65% of the bloc's population. The EU launched the probe in a bid to protect its automobile industry, which employs around 14 million people. France, which pushed for the investigation, welcomed the decision. 'The European Union is taking a crucial decision to protect and defend our trade interests, at a time when our car industry needs our support more than ever,' French Finance Minister Antoine Armand said in a statement. But Europe's bigger carmakers, including German auto titan Volkswagen, have criticized the EU's approach and have urged Brussels to resolve the issue through talks. The extra tariffs are 'a step backwards for free global trade and thus for prosperity, job preservation and growth in Europe,' the German Association of the Automotive Industry's president Hildegard Mueller said on Tuesday after the announcement. Volkswagen, which has been hit hard by rising competition in China, has previously said the tariffs would not improve the competitiveness of the European automotive industry. That warning came weeks before the ailing giant announced plans on Monday to close at least three factories in Germany and cull tens of thousands of jobs. Retaliatory moves Talks continue between the EU and China, and the duties can be lifted if they reach a satisfactory agreement, but officials on both sides have pointed to differences. Discussions have been focused on minimum prices that would replace the duties and force carmakers in China to sell vehicles at a certain cost to offset subsidies. 'We remain open to a possible alternative solution that would be effective in addressing the problems identified and WTO-compatible,' Dombrovskis said. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU urged Brussels and Beijing 'to accelerate talks on establishing minimum prices and, ultimately, to eliminate these tariffs.' The EU could now face Chinese retaliation, with Beijing already saying on October 8 it would impose provisional tariffs on European brandy. Beijing has also launched probes into EU subsidies of some dairy and pork products imported into China. Trade tensions between China and the EU are not limited to electric cars, with Brussels also investigating Chinese subsidies for solar panels and wind turbines. The EU is not alone in levying heavy tariffs on Chinese electric cars. Canada and the United States have in recent months imposed much higher tariffs of 100 percent on Chinese electric car imports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-files-wto-complaint-over-eu-s-new-taxes-on-chinese-evs-/7844561.html	2024-10-30T04:43:48-07:00	
Senegal's president fights for mandate in parliamentary race	Dakar — With fireworks displays, packed rallies, and town-to-town caravans, Senegalese political parties are wooing voters in a parliamentary race that will decide the extent to which the new president will be able to implement his agenda. President Bassirou Diomaye Faye has been under pressure to make good on promises to crack down on corruption and improve livelihoods that helped sweep him to power in April following a landslide election victory the previous month. Faye has accused lawmakers in the opposition-led national assembly of refusing to engage in meaningful talks on the budget and other proposals and dissolved parliament last month, paving the way for the legislative election on Nov. 17. Campaigning officially kicked off on Sunday. Faye's Pastef party is competing for a majority that would secure his mandate, but former ruling parties have formed a rival coalition that unites the country's influential ex-presidents Macky Sall and Abdoulaye Wade. 'This election has symbolic significance,' said political analyst Mamadou Seck. 'The critical challenge today is for Diomaye Faye to understand whether the people who elected him with 54% still support his program.' Earlier in October, the government unveiled an ambitious 25-year development plan that Faye promised would boost local industry, diversify the economy, and create much-needed jobs for the West African country's fast-growing population. The main threat to Pastef's ambitions is the unexpected alliance of Sall's Alliance for the Republic party (APR) and Wade's Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS), who together accounted for 106 of 165 seats in the outgoing national assembly. 'This is the first time Pastef has decided to run alone, without a coalition. It appears that they are testing their strength and influence,' said analyst Seck, cautioning that the party had also recruited one-time allies of Sall in an effort to shore up support. The race also includes two smaller opposition coalitions represented by former Prime Minister Amadou Ba and mayor of the capital Dakar Barthelemy Dias. 'I wish all Senegalese and all political actors a peaceful and dignified electoral campaign, and I guarantee that ... the best will win,' Faye said on national TV on Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-s-president-fights-for-mandate-in-parliamentary-race-/7844509.html	2024-10-30T04:04:21-07:00	
China stimulus should go hand in hand with reforms, ex central bank adviser says	BEIJING — China's stimulus efforts could come with a cost and they must be carried out alongside reforms to ensure sustainable economic growth, Liu Shijin, a former central bank adviser, said in remarks published Wednesday. 'Stimulus could come with a cost and we should combine stimulus with reforms,' Chinese media outlet Yicai quoted Liu as saying at a forum on Tuesday. Liu said funds should be used for enhancing areas that are critical for long-term economic development. China should prioritize improving basic healthcare services for the country's 300 million internal migrant workers as it faces a significant public healthcare shortfall, Liu said. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that China is considering approving next week new debt issuance of more than 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) to help tackle hidden local debt and fund buybacks of idle land and reduce a giant inventory of unsold flats, in coming years. Analysts expect such efforts to be a stabilizer for the economy rather than the instant growth booster that markets have craved. China is struggling to tackle a debt overhang from previous stimulus. In 2008-2009, a 4 trillion yuan ($575 billion) spending package largely shielded China's economy from the global financial crisis but saddled local governments with mountains of debt. Liu said last month that China could issue ultra-long-term treasury bonds within two years to generate at least 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) worth of stimulus to the economy, according to state media. At a key meeting in July, Chinese leaders outlined reform steps ranging from developing advanced industries to improving local government finances, but it remains unclear on how quickly such steps will be implemented. China needs to expand its middle class group from around 400 million, currently about a third of the population - to 800-900 million in the next decade by speeding up urbanization and addressing disparities in urban-rural public services, Liu said. But Liu cautioned against stimulus through 'helicopter money,' or direct cash handouts for residents, arguing this would primarily benefit wealthier residents, while low-income groups would see minimal relief given their basic needs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-stimulus-should-go-hand-in-hand-with-reforms-ex-central-bank-adviser-says-/7844487.html	2024-10-30T03:36:57-07:00	
Israel orders evacuations in eastern Lebanon	Israel’s military issued new evacuation warnings Wednesday for people in parts of eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, warning of military actions against Hezbollah targets in the area. An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said people in Baalbek, Ain Bourday and Douris should leave their homes. Israeli forces have frequently followed such warnings with airstrikes as they carry out a campaign Israeli officials say is meant to push Hezbollah back from the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel has used the same methods in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, while U.N. officials and humanitarian organizations have criticized the evacuation orders saying civilians have little chance to prepare and often nowhere safe to go amid the war. UNRWA ban U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has written to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressing his concern over new Israeli legislation that would ban the main U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees. 'The Secretary-General is writing and has dispatched a letter not too long ago, a few hours ago to the Prime Minister of Israel, outlining his concerns, the issues of international law that has been raised by this law,' spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Tuesday of the two bills adopted Monday by the Israeli Knesset. 'Obviously, if it is implemented, it is clear that it will have a devastating impact on the humanitarian situation of Palestinians in the occupied territory,' Dujarric added. He said Guterres has also written to the president of the U.N. General Assembly, which created UNRWA in December 1949. Guterres had previously criticized the two laws, set to go into effect in 90 days, which he said 'could have devastating consequences' for Palestinian refugees. Guterres also called on Israel to uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law and said national legislation 'cannot alter those obligations.' Israel's U.N. envoy, Danny Danon, said 'UNRWA Gaza has become a front for Hamas' and accused Guterres of ignoring that 'indisputable fact.' Also Tuesday, Palestinian health officials said an Israeli airstrike hit a five-story residential building in northern Gaza, killing at least 70 people. An additional 23 people were missing after the attack in Beit Lahiya. A second strike later Tuesday killed at least 18 people, the health officials said. Israel’s military said it is investigating the first strike but did not comment on the second. It did report that four of its soldiers were killed in the fighting, bringing the toll since the start of the operation to 16. The United Nations expressed deep concern about the high number of casualties, saying it could not access Beit Lahiya. The new Israeli legislation bans the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, and forbids Israeli officials from having any contact with UNRWA representatives. Norway's prime minister said Tuesday his government will submit a resolution to the U.N. General Assembly for it to request a ruling from the International Court of Justice on whether Israel will be violating international law. 'This undermines the right of Palestinians to receive humanitarian aid and lifesaving assistance,' Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said in a statement. 'We have a collective obligation to respond to this.' At the U.N. Security Council, the 15 member states individually expressed concern about the legislation, many of them referring to UNRWA as a 'lifeline' for Palestinians in the occupied territories and acknowledging it is the 'backbone' of the U.N. aid operation in Gaza. The U.S. envoy urged U.N. chief Guterres to create a mechanism to review and address allegations that UNRWA personnel have ties to Hamas. 'At the same time, we know that right now, there is no alternative to UNRWA when it comes to delivering food and other life-saving aid in Gaza,' Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. 'Therefore, we have concerns about this legislation being implemented.' UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement Monday that the bill 'sets a dangerous precedent.' 'This is the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role towards providing human-development assistance and services to Palestine Refugees,' he wrote on social media platform X. Israel has accused dozens of UNRWA staffers of being members of Hamas and some of participating in the October 7, 2023, terror attacks. UNRWA says it has taken action against about a dozen employees that Israel provided evidence about regarding their involvement with the terror group. However, in dozens of other cases, UNRWA has received either insufficient or no evidence from Israeli authorities. The legislation comes at a time when the World Food Program warns that famine threatens parts of Gaza, health care lies in shambles, and humanitarians say they face numerous obstacles in getting aid to the most needy, including Israeli denials and obstruction and Gazans looting convoys. The U.N. said Tuesday that 80% of Gazans – about 1.7 million people – have not received their October food rations. On October 15, the Biden administration gave Israel 30 days to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face consequences under U.S. law that could include curtailing military financing. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield reiterated Washington's concerns about the humanitarian situation Tuesday at the Security Council. 'That the United States rejects any Israeli efforts to starve Palestinians in Jabalya, or anywhere else,' she said referring to the besieged Palestinian camp in northern Gaza. 'And that Israel's words must be matched by action on the ground. Right now, that is not happening. This must change immediately.' The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, while the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people. Hamas and Hezbollah are U.S.-designated terror groups. VOA U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

KDP wins Iraqi Kurdish parliamentary election	BAGHDAD — The ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) came first in a parliamentary election in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, winning 39 seats, the election commission said on Wednesday, positioning it to lead the next regional government. The KDP's historic rival and junior coalition partner in government, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), was second with 23 seats, the commission told a news conference. It said turnout among registered voters was reported at 72%. The Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament has 100 seats with five reserved for minority groups. With opposition parties weak, the KDP and PUK, which have been sharing power since 1992, are likely to continue governing together, but the results suggest that Masoud Barzani's KDP will take a dominant position. Originally planned for 2022, the elections were repeatedly delayed by disputes between the KDP and PUK. Unresolved disagreements between the two major political parties are expected to complicate the formation of a new government, analysts and regional officials expect. The largest Kurdish opposition party, New Generation, was a distant third with 15 seats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kdp-wins-iraqi-kurdish-parliamentary-election/7844453.html	2024-10-30T02:24:45-07:00	
Journalist shot dead in western Mexico	Morelia, Mexico — A journalist was shot dead Tuesday night in western Mexico, a local prosecutor's office said, in a part of the country hit hard by organized crime. Mauricio Cruz Solis, a host on local radio station La Poderosa Uruapan, who also published news on the Minuto x Minuto outlet, was killed in the city of Uruapan. One other person was wounded in the attack, the prosecutor's office said. The radio station where Cruz Solis worked mourned his killing in a statement published on social media. 'Mauricio was more than a colleague, he was an unconditional friend, a source of inspiration and a tireless voice in the service of our community,' the station said. Wracked by violence related to drug trafficking, Mexico is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists, news advocacy groups say. Reporters Without Borders says more than 150 newspeople have been killed in Mexico since 1994. Cruz Solis's murder is the first killing of a journalist under the government of Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office on October 1, although there have been other attacks on media this month. On October 18, gunmen shot at the front of the El Debate newspaper's office in Culiacan, the state capital of cartel stronghold Sinaloa, which has been shaken by weeks of gang infighting. A day later, a delivery worker with the outlet was abducted by presumed criminal groups and there has been no news about his whereabouts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalist-shot-dead-in-western-mexico/7844436.html	2024-10-30T01:25:54-07:00	
Bodies found as torrential rains slam Spain	MADRID — Several bodies have been recovered by emergency service workers in Spain's eastern region of Valencia after torrential rains triggered flash floods, the head of the regional government said Wednesday. 'We can confirm that some bodies have already been found,' Carlos Mazon told reporters, without saying how many. Authorities could not give further details until relatives had been informed, he added. Heavy rain lashed much of eastern and southern Spain on Tuesday, flooding streets with muddy water and disrupting rail and air travel. Images shot by residents with smartphones and broadcast on Spanish TV showed raging waters washing away cars and flooding buildings. In some areas, more than a month's rain fell in a single day, Spanish media reported. 'We are facing an unprecedented situation, which nobody remembers,' Mazon said. Officials said on Tuesday that at least seven people were missing — a truck driver in the Valencia region and six people in the town of Letur in the eastern province of Albacete. Emergency services workers backed by drones would work through the night to look for the missing in Letur, the central government's representative in Castilla-La Mancha, Milagros Tolon, told Spanish public television station TVE. 'The priority is to find these people,' she added. Crisis committee Spain central government set up a crisis committee which met for the first time late Tuesday to oversee the response to the storm. 'I am closely following with concern the reports on missing persons and the damage caused by the storm in recent hours,' Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on X, urging people to follow the advice of the authorities. The government has deployed the UME, a military unit specialized in rescue operations, to Valencia to help local emergency services. Valencia city hall said all school classes and sports events were suspended on Wednesday, and parks would remain closed. Twelve flights that were due to land at Valencia airport were diverted to other cities in Spain due to the heavy rain and strong winds, Spanish airport operator Aena said. Another 10 flights that were due to depart or arrive at the airport were canceled. National rail infrastructure operator ADIF said it had suspended all rail services in the Valencia region 'until the situation returns to normal for the safety of passengers.' High-speed trains between Madrid and the city of Valencia will be suspended until 'at least' 10 am on Wednesday, it added. A high-speed train with 276 passengers derailed in the southern region of Andalusia, although no one was injured, the regional government said in a statement. Emergency services used helicopters to lift people from homes and cars in Alora in Andalusia after a river overflowed. State weather agency AEMET declared a red alert in the Valencia region and the second-highest level of alert in parts of Andalusia. Several roads were cut in both regions due to flooding. Meteorologists said the storm was caused by cold air moving over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea, which produced intense rain clouds. The rains are expected to continue until at least Thursday. Scientists warn that extreme weather such as heatwaves and storms is becoming more intense as a result of climate change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bodies-found-as-torrential-rains-slam-spain/7844434.html	2024-10-30T01:19:27-07:00	
Botswana votes with ruling party seeking to extend six decades of power	Gaborone, Botswana — Southern Africa's diamond-rich nation of Botswana voted in general elections Wednesday with the ruling party seeking to extend its nearly six-decade rule and hand a second term to President Mokgweetsi Masisi. Polls opened at 6:30 a.m. for more than a million people registered to vote, with four presidential candidates in the race to head the region's oldest democracy, installed on independence from Britain in 1966 when the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) took office. 'It is my time to voice my opinion. I can't wait,' said Lone Kobe, 38, who had been queueing since 3:15 a.m. at a school in Gaborone hosting a polling station. 'I would like to experience a new Botswana. We are seeing a percentage of the population enjoying the benefits. We are just the spectators, like we are watching a movie,' said the self-employed woman, a light blanket around her shoulders. 'We want to see true democracy, transparency and a free and fair election,' said Muthisi Kemo, a 56-year-old unemployed man who arrived three hours before the polling station opened. There were irregularities in the functioning of the Independent Electoral Authority (IEC) in favor of the ruling party, he said, echoing opposition claims in the lead-up to the polls. 'It's an open secret.' Opposition groups have been critical of the IEC including for failing to share a digital version of the voters roll and a shortage of ballot papers in early voting for public officers. An unemployment rate that has reached 27% amid a weakening economy has been one of the key concerns of voters ahead of the elections, alongside claims of government corruption and mismanagement. But the ruling party points to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, with weakened demand for diamonds also chipping away at revenues. An energetic Masisi, 63, held a final campaign rally with about 400 cheering supporters in the capital late Tuesday, saying that he wanted to use his second term 'to polish' what he started in his first five years. Queen Mosiane, 34, said at the rally she was loyal to the party because its government had supported her when she became an orphan, including with education and healthcare covered by the state. 'We live peacefully in this country because of BDP,' she said. 'It's not time to change because we don't know what are we inviting.' 'The opportunities that we find, and our kids are going to find in the future, are because of the BDP,' said civil servant Refile Kutlwano, 34, at the same rally. 'The opposition is not ready to rule.' Fractured opposition Masisi was elected in 2019 with around 52% of the vote. While the party is not expected to fare much better this time, the opposition is fractured. The main opposition alliance is the left-leaning Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), led by youthful human rights lawyer, Duma Boko, 54. It lost two key members in the run-up to voting day with the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and Botswana Congress Party (BCP) quitting and each fielding their own presidential candidates. It was a blow to voters like Ookeditse Letshwenyo, 23, who saw the UDC offering opportunities to young people struggling to find work. 'Since our independence we've been ruled by the same people, with the same mindset, with the same goals,' said Letshwenyo, who has launched an IT start-up. 'You can't win against the BDP while you are divided,' he said. While the surprise return six weeks ago from three years of self-exile of the previous president Ian Khama to campaign against Masisi added some energy to the opposition, analysts said his influence was limited to a few districts. With 61 seats up for grabs in parliament, Botswana's first-past-the-post system means that the first party to take 31 seats will be declared the winner and install its candidate as president. Counting will start in the hours after polling stations close at 7 p.m. Wednesday with results due late Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-votes-with-ruling-party-seeking-to-extend-six-decades-of-power/7844430.html	2024-10-30T01:10:37-07:00	
In Georgia, some voters balanced EU hopes with the fear of war with Russia	TBILISI, Georgia — For some Georgians who supported the ruling Georgian Dream party in Saturday's disputed parliamentary election, the aspiration to go West toward the European Union had to be balanced by the brutal reality of the need to keep the peace with Russia. The opposition and foreign observers had cast the election as a watershed moment that would decide if Georgia moves closer to Europe or leans back towards Russia amid the war in Ukraine. The ruling party, which is seen as loyal to its billionaire founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, says it wants to one day join the EU but that it must also avoid confrontation with President Vladimir Putin's Russia that could leave the South Caucasus republic devastated like Ukraine. 'We've had peace these 12 years in Georgia,' said Sergo, a resident of the capital Tbilisi who has voted for Georgian Dream in every election since the party rose to power in 2012. Georgian Dream clinched 54% of the vote on Saturday, the electoral commission said, while opposition parties and the president claimed the election had been stolen and the West called for investigations into reports of voting irregularities. Observer groups, including the 57-nation Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said alleged violations, including ballot-stuffing, bribery, voter intimidation and violence, could have affected the election's outcome. The EU and the United States said there was not a level playing field but stopped short of saying the result was stolen by Georgian Dream. Russia accused the West of meddling. Beyond the rhetoric, though, the result poses a challenge to Tbilisi's ambitions to join the European Union, which polls show the overwhelming majority of Georgians support. Brussels has effectively frozen Georgia's EU accession application over concerns of democratic backsliding under Georgian Dream and what it casts is its pro-Russian rhetoric. Georgian Dream backers say that while they want to join Europe, they don't want to sacrifice Georgia's traditional values of family and church. EU aspirations? For them, Georgian Dream's party slogan, 'Only with peace, dignity, and prosperity to Europe,' appeals. Official results, which the opposition says are fraudulent, showed the party securing huge margins of up to 90% in rural areas, even as it underperformed in Tbilisi and other cities. Ghia Abashidze, a political analyst close to Georgian Dream, attributed the party's showing to its emphasis on keeping the peace and preserving traditional values. The Georgian parliament passed a law this year curbing LGBT rights and Pride events have been attacked by violent mobs in years past. The topic remains sensitive in conservative Georgia, which is devoutly Orthodox Christian. Abashidze said that Georgian Dream was still committed to EU integration, but found more to like in some of the bloc's Eastern European members such as Hungary, whose premier Viktor Orban flew to Tbilisi on Monday and hailed the election as free. He said Orban's Hungary, which has also been accused of democratic backsliding, shared the Georgian ruling party's core values of 'family, traditions, statehood, sovereignty, peace.' In Isani, a working-class Tbilisi neighborhood and one of the few in the capital where Georgian Dream received more votes than the four main opposition parties combined, Sergo, who did not want to give his last name, echoed the sentiment. 'We want to go to the European Union with our customs, our traditions, our mentality,' the 56-year-old said, passing freshly-baked bread to customers from his shop window. He said he believed LGBT people should receive medical treatment and go to church to become 'normal people.' Russia or EU? By contrast, opposition supporters say the ruling party's positions on foreign policy and social issues are incompatible with Europe's, and keeping the peace with Russia depends on Georgia aligning with the West. At a thousands-strong protest against the election results on Monday, Salome Gasviani said the opposition was fighting to preserve Georgia's freedom and independence. 'We're here to say out loud that Georgia is a very European country and our future is in the EU, in the West,' she said. Russia, which ruled Georgia for about 200 years, won a brief war against the country in 2008, and memories of Russian tanks rolling towards Tbilisi are still fresh for many. During the campaign, Georgian Dream played on fears of war, with posters showing devastated Ukrainian cities beside picturesque Georgian ones to illustrate the threat. 'The main thing is that we don't have a war,' 69-year-old Otar Shaverdashvili, another Isani resident, said before the vote. 'I remember the last war very well. No one wants another one.' Kornely Kakachia, head of Georgian Institute of Politics think tank, said the opposition had struggled to allay fears that a change of government could risk Georgia being sucked into the Ukraine war. 'If someone asks you to choose between war and the European Union and you have this kind of choice, then of course people will choose the status quo,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-georgia-some-voters-balanced-eu-hopes-with-the-fear-of-war-with-russia/7844417.html	2024-10-30T00:21:48-07:00	
Jailed Malaysian ex-PM Najib to take the stand in corruption case	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — A Malaysian court ruled on Wednesday jailed former Prime Minister Najib Razak will have to defend himself against more abuse of power and money laundering charges in another trial over the multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB. Najib faces four charges of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering for allegedly receiving $526 million from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). He has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Najib faces up to 20 years in prison and fines up to five times the amount of funds involved in the offence. Najib, 71, was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2022 after being found guilty of graft in a separate 1MDB-linked case. The sentence was later halved by a pardons board chaired by Malaysia's king, with Najib set to be released in August 2028. Malaysian and U.S. investigators say at least $4.5 billion was allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB, a state fund founded by Najib in 2009 while he was premier. The Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled on Wednesday that prosecutors had established a case against Najib on 25 charges. Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah said the charges filed against Najib were valid and correct in law and found all prosecution witnesses to be credible. Prosecutors had called on 50 witnesses to give evidence, including former central bank governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz, media reported. Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, who leads Najib's defense team, said the ex-premier was 'extremely disappointed' by the ruling but was prepared to take the stand in his own defense. 'My client wants to be cross-examined because he has nothing to fear,' Muhammad Shafee told reporters after the court ruling. The defense plans to call on 11 witnesses, he said, adding that the trial will resume on Dec. 2. Najib, who was voted out in 2018 after nine years in power, issued a rare apology last week for his role in mishandling the 1MDB scandal. Najib maintains he had no knowledge of any illegal transfers from the state fund, saying he was misled by others and believed that monies transferred into his personal bank accounts were political donations from the Saudi royal family. Investigators say more than $1 billion of 1MDB funds made its way into Najib's personal accounts, in a globe-spanning scheme that former U.S. attorney-general Jeff Sessions has described as 'kleptocracy at its worst.' Najib's apology came just days after Malaysia said it would introduce a law allowing house arrest for some offences. Najib has been pushing to serve the remainder of his jail sentence at home, and is seeking a court ruling to compel the government to confirm the existence of a royal order that he said accompanied the pardons board's decision and recommended house arrest for him. The government later denied the proposed law was targeted towards Najib or to help other politicians accused of corruption to escape jail.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jailed-malaysian-ex-pm-najib-to-take-the-stand-in-corruption-case/7844414.html	2024-10-30T00:13:25-07:00	
US forest managers finalize land exchange with Native American tribe in Arizona	CAMP VERDE, Ariz. — U.S. forest managers have finalized a land exchange with the Yavapai-Apache Nation that has been decades in the making and will significantly expand the size of the tribe's reservation in Arizona's Verde Valley, tribal leaders announced Tuesday. As part of the arrangement, six parcels of private land acquired over the years by the tribe will be traded to the U.S. Forest Service in exchange for the tribe gaining ownership of 12.95 square kilometers of national forest land that is part of the tribe’s ancestral homelands. The tribe will host a signing ceremony next week to celebrate the exchange, which was first proposed in 1996. 'This is a critical step in our history and vital to the nation’s cultural and economic recovery and future prosperity,' Yavapai-Apache Chairwoman Tanya Lewis said in a post on the tribe's website. Prescott National Forest Supervisor Sarah Clawson said in a statement that there had been many delays and changes to the proposal over the years, but the tribe and the Forest Service never lost sight of developing an agreement that would benefit both public and tribal lands. The federal government has made strides over recent years to protect more lands held sacred by Native American tribes, to develop more arrangements for incorporating Indigenous knowledge into management of public lands and to streamline regulations for putting land into trust for tribes. The Yavapai-Apache Nation is made up of two distinct groups of people — the Wipuhk’a’bah and the Dil’zhe’e. Their homelands spanned more than 41,440 square kilometers of what is now central Arizona. After the discovery of gold in the 1860s near Prescott, the federal government carved out only a fraction to establish a reservation. The inhabitants eventually were forced from the land, and it wasn't until the early 1900s that they were able to resettle a tiny portion of the area. In the Verde Valley, the Yavapai-Apache Nation's reservation lands are currently comprised of less than 7.77 square kilometers near Camp Verde. The small land base hasn't been enough to develop economic opportunities or to meet housing needs, Lewis said, pointing to dozens of families who are on a waiting list for new homes. Lewis said that in acknowledgment of the past removal of the Yavapai-Apache people from their homelands, the preamble to the tribal constitution recognizes that land acquisition is among the Yavapai-Apache Nation's responsibilities. Aside from growing the reservation, the exchange will bolster efforts by federal land managers to protect the headwaters of the Verde River and ensure the historic Yavapai Ranch is not sold for development. The agreement also will improve recreational access to portions of four national forests in Arizona.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-forest-managers-finalize-land-exchange-with-native-american-tribe-in-arizona-/7844408.html	2024-10-29T23:44:03-07:00	
China launches new crew to its space station as it seeks to expand exploration	JIUQUAN, China — China declared a 'complete success' after it launched a new three-person crew to its orbiting space station early Wednesday as the country seeks to expand its exploration of outer space with missions to the moon and beyond. The Shenzhou-19 spaceship carrying the trio blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China at 4:27 a.m. local time atop a Long March-2F rocket, the backbone of China’s crewed space missions. 'The crew condition is good and the launch has been successful,' the state broadcaster China Central Television announced. China built its own space station after being excluded from the International Space Station, mainly because of U.S. concerns over the People’s Liberation Army, the Chinese Communist Party’s military arm’s overall control over the space program. China’s moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S. and others, including Japan and India. The team of two men and one woman will replace the astronauts who have lived on the Tiangong space station for the last six months. They are expected to stay until April or May of next year. The new mission commander, Cai Xuzhe, went to space in the Shenzhou-14 mission in 2022, while the other two, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, are first-time space travelers, born in the 1990s. Song was an air force pilot and Wang an engineer with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. Wang will be the crew’s payload specialist and the third Chinese woman aboard a crewed mission. Besides putting a space station into orbit, the Chinese space agency has landed an explorer on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make China the second nation after the United States to do so. It also plans to build a research station on the moon and has already transferred rock and soil samples from the little-explored far side of the moon in a global first. The U.S. still leads in space exploration and plans to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years, though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year. The new crew will perform spacewalks and install new equipment to protect the station from space debris, some of which was created by China. According to NASA, large pieces of debris have been created by 'satellite explosions and collisions.' China’s firing of a rocket to destroy a redundant weather satellite in 2007 and the 'accidental collision of American and Russian communications satellites in 2009 greatly increased the amount of large debris in orbit,' it said. China’s space authorities say they have measures in place in case their astronauts have to return to Earth earlier. China launched its first crewed mission in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the former Soviet Union and the United States. The space program is a source of enormous national pride and a hallmark of China’s technological advances over the past two decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-launches-new-crew-to-its-space-station-as-it-seeks-to-expand-exploration/7844404.html	2024-10-29T23:30:29-07:00	
Russian drones target Kyiv	Officials in Ukraine’s capital said Wednesday a Russian drone attack left at least nine people injured. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram an 11-year-old girl was among those hurt when debris from a downed drone hit an apartment building. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said air defenses destroyed Russian drones that attacked the city from multiple directions. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed 23 Ukrainian drones deployed in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Rostov, Kursk, Smolensk, Oryol, Bryansk and Belgorod regions, the ministry said. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram there was damage to electrical lines, while officials in Kursk reported a fire at an administrative building. North Korea The Pentagon said Tuesday a 'small number' of North Korean troops have deployed to Russia’s Kursk region, where they are likely to be used in combat against Ukrainian troops. '[There are] indications that there's already a small number that are actually in the Kursk Oblast, with a couple thousand more that are either almost there or due to arrive imminently,' Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters. 'We remain concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Kursk,' he added. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Defense said that North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to train in Russia, more than tripling the previous estimate, and warned that those forces would likely augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks. The Pentagon has 'no information' to corroborate reports that North Korean troops are also inside Ukraine, according to Ryder. Asked by VOA whether Ukraine should strike back against North Korean forces, President Joe Biden replied, 'If they cross into Ukraine, yes.' South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Tuesday that military cooperation between North Korea and Russia 'poses a significant security threat to the international community.' The comments at a Cabinet meeting in Seoul followed Yoon saying Monday that the deployment of North Korean troops to the battlefield in Ukraine could happen 'more quickly than anticipated,' according to South Korean intelligence assessments. NATO on Monday had confirmed that 3,000 North Korean troops had been sent to Russia with some deployed to Russia’s Kursk region. Ukrainian troops invaded the border region in a surprise attack in August and still hold territory there. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the deployment of North Korean troops was a sign of 'growing desperation' on the part of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rutte added that more than 600,000 Russian forces have been killed or wounded since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Pentagon did not provide further details on the type of troops or equipment that North Korea had sent with them. When pressed by VOA Monday on what capabilities these troops could bring, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said, 'It’s additional bodies on the battlefield.' 'If we see DPRK troops moving in and towards the front lines, they are co-belligerents in the war,' she warned. Russia and North Korea have boosted their political and military alliance since Moscow’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin initially dismissed reports about a North Korean troop deployment as 'fake news,' but Putin last week did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia, adding that it was up to Moscow to decide how to deploy them as part of a mutual defense security pact that he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. At odds with Putin’s comments, a North Korean representative to the United Nations in New York last week characterized the reports of Pyongyang’s deployment of troops in Russia as 'groundless rumors.' U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will host his South Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-Hyun, on Wednesday at the Pentagon, where the two are expected to discuss the North Korean troops who are now in Russia. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drones-target-kyiv/7844400.html	2024-10-29T23:15:08-07:00	
US economy is believed to have grown at a solid pace again last quarter	WASHINGTON — Powered by consumer spending, the U.S. economy likely kept expanding at a healthy pace from July through September despite the pressure of still-high interest rates. The Commerce Department is expected to report Wednesday that the gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — grew at a 2.6% annual pace last quarter, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. That would be down from a 3% annual rate in the April-June period. But it would still amount to a solid pace as Americans ponder the state of the economy in the final stretch of the presidential race. Wednesday's report is the first of three estimates the government will make of GDP growth for the third quarter of the year. The U.S. economy, the world's biggest, has shown surprising resilience in the face of the much higher borrowing rates the Federal Reserve imposed in 2022 and 2023 in its drive to curb inflation. Despite widespread predictions that the economy would succumb to a recession, it has kept growing, with employers still hiring and consumers still spending. In a sign that the nation's households, whose purchases drive most of the economy, will continue spending, the Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index posted its biggest monthly gain since March 2021. The proportion of consumers who expect a recession in the next 12 months dropped to its lowest point since the board first posed that question in July 2022. At the same time, the nation's once-sizzling job market has lost some momentum. On Tuesday, the government reported that the number of job openings in the United States fell in September to its lowest level since January 2021. And employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs a month so far this year — a healthy number but down from a record 604,000 in 2021 as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, 377,000 in 2022 and 251,000 in 2023. On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the economy added 120,000 jobs in October. That gain, though, will probably have been significantly held down by the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and by a strike at Boeing, the aviation giant, all of which temporarily knocked thousands of people off payrolls. At its most recent meeting last month, the Fed was satisfied enough with its progress against inflation — and concerned enough by the slowing job market — to slash its benchmark rate by a hefty half percentage point, its first and largest rate cut in more than four years. When it meets next week, the Fed is expected to announce another rate cut, this one by a more typical quarter-point. The policymakers have also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate again at their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. The cumulative result of the Fed's rate cuts, over time, will likely be lower borrowing rates for consumers and businesses. Inflation, which reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, has tumbled to 2.4%, barely above the Fed’s 2% target. But average prices still far exceed their pre-pandemic levels, which has exasperated many Americans and posed a challenge to Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential prospects in her race against former President Donald Trump. Most mainstream economists have suggested, though, that Trump’s policy proposals, unlike Harris', would worsen inflation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-economy-is-believed-to-have-grown-at-a-solid-pace-again-last-quarter/7844396.html	2024-10-29T22:58:26-07:00	
No nuclear risk from fire at submarine yard in northwest England, police say	A significant fire remains ongoing at BAE Systems' shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, northwest England, that builds Britain's new generation of nuclear submarines, but there was no nuclear risk from the incident, police said on Wednesday. UK's Cumbria police said in a statement that two people had been taken to a hospital after suffering from suspected smoke inhalation and that there were no other casualties. The police said that everyone else had been evacuated from the Devonshire Dock Hall facility and accounted for. BAE's site in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, manufactures Royal Navy's Astute and Dreadnought submarines, according to BAE's website. The incident was reported at 12:44 am local time, police said. BAE did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Police have advised residents nearby to remain indoors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-nuclear-risk-from-fire-at-submarine-yard-in-northwest-england-police-say/7844391.html	2024-10-29T22:38:48-07:00	
Indonesia arrests former trade minister in sugar import graft case	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesian authorities investigating graft have arrested a former trade minister turned government critic on suspicion of improperly granting a sugar import permit in 2015 that led to losses of $25 million. Thomas Trikasih Lembong was named a suspect and arrested late on Tuesday by prosecutors from the attorney general's office, accused of giving the permit to a private company at a time when Indonesia had a surplus of sugar, the office said. 'At that time, Indonesia did not need to import sugar but (Lembong) granted a permit to import 105,000 metric tons of raw crystal sugar,' prosecutor Abdul Qohar told a press conference. There was no consultation with other state bodies or a recommendation from the industry ministry, he said, adding that the decision had led to losses of $25.42 million. Qohar did not say what Lembong is accused of having received in return for the permit to the company, which authorities identified only by its initials, PT AP. The attorney general's office denied that its investigation had a political motive. 'I surrender everything to God Almighty,' media reported Lembong, handcuffed and wearing a pink detainee vest, as saying after the press conference. Reuters could not reach Lembong or his lawyer to seek comment. A former investment banker, Lembong was Indonesia's trade minister between 2015 and 2016 and a close aide of former president Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, for whom he often wrote international speeches. But after leaving office in 2019, he became one of the staunchest critics of Jokowi's government. Lembong was a campaign manager in February's presidential election for Anies Baswedan, who ran against the winner, defense minister Prabowo Subianto, widely seen as Jokowi's preferred successor, who took office on Oct. 20 Indonesia's sugar output in 2015 was 2.49 million metric tons, while consumption was 2.12 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-arrests-former-trade-minister-in-sugar-import-graft-case/7844386.html	2024-10-29T22:29:21-07:00

Taiwan expects super typhoon to make landfall on Thursday	taipei/taiwan — Taiwan expects Super Typhoon Kong-rey to make landfall on Thursday along the sparsely populated east coast, issuing a warning on Wednesday ahead of the powerful storm which will bring heavy rain and strong winds across a swath of the island. Packing gusts of nearly 300 kph, the storm has strengthened into a super typhoon and is expected to further intensify before hitting land in Taitung county, according to U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The storm is then forecast to cross Taiwan's south, enter the Taiwan Strait and head towards China, Taiwan's Central Weather Administration said, which labeled the storm as a 'strong typhoon,' the most powerful storm level for Taiwan. Up to 1.2 meters of rainfall is expected in mountainous eastern Taiwan and destructive winds are likely to hit coastal areas on Thursday, according to the administration. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te urged people to stay away from the mountains and coast. 'I would like to urge my friends in the eastern, southern and northern parts of the country to be on alert,' he wrote on his Facebook page. Taiwan's defense ministry said it had put about 36,000 troops on standby across the island. Central Weather Administration forecaster Stan Chang said it was relatively rare for a strong typhoon to directly hit Taiwan this late in the year, pointing to the still favorable environment for typhoons, including warmer sea temperatures in the Pacific and later-than-normal cold fronts from the north. 'We must urge people to make preparations. It's a strong typhoon with a large size,' Chang added. Heavy rain is also expected in the north around the capital Taipei throughout the day on Thursday, the administration said. Subtropical Taiwan is frequently hit by typhoons. The last one, Typhoon Krathon, killed four people earlier this month as it passed through the south of the island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-expects-super-typhoon-to-make-landfall-on-thursday/7844356.html	2024-10-29T21:12:42-07:00	
Australia to ramp up missile production as Indo-Pacific enters new missile age	SYDNEY — Australia said it was boosting its missile defense capability amid 'significant concerns' about China's test of an ICBM in the South Pacific, and will bolster weapons stockpiles and exports to security partners as the region enters a new 'missile age.' Minister for Defense Industry Pat Conroy said in a speech on Wednesday that Australia was increasing its missile defense and long-range strike capability, and would cooperate with security partners the United States, Japan and South Korea, to contribute to regional stability. 'Why do we need more missiles? Strategic competition between the United States and China is a primary feature of Australia's security environment,' he told the National Press Club in Canberra. China test-fired an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile in September that traveled over 11,000 km to land in the Pacific Ocean to Australia's northeast. Conroy said the Indo Pacific was on the cusp of a new missile age, where missiles are also 'tools of coercion.' 'We expressed significant concern about that ballistic missile test, especially its entry into the South Pacific given the Treaty of Rarotonga that says the Pacific should be a nuclear weapons free zone,' he told reporters in response to a question. Australia was deploying SM-6 missiles on its navy destroyer fleet to provide ballistic missile defense, he added. Earlier this month, Australia announced a $4.75 billion deal with the United States to acquire SM-2 IIIC and Raytheon SM-6 long-range missiles for its navy. Australia has previously said it would spend $49 billion on missile acquisition and missile defense over the next decade, including $14 billion to fund the Australian Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise, a new domestic manufacturing capability. 'We must show potential adversaries that hostile acts against Australia would not succeed and could not be sustained if conflict were protracted,' Conroy said in the speech. Australia will spend $212 million to establish local manufacture of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), in partnership with Lockheed Martin, to produce the rapidly deployable, surface-to-surface weapons for export, from 2029. The factory will be capable of producing 4,000 GMLRS a year, or a quarter of current global production, Conroy said. France's Thales will establish Australian manufacturing of 155mm M795 artillery ammunition, used in howitzers, at an Australian government-owned munitions facility in the small Victorian city of Benalla. It will be the first dedicated forge outside of the U.S., with production starting in 2028, and the capacity to scale up to produce 100,000 rounds a year. The war in Ukraine was using 10,000 rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells a day last year, outstripping European production, he said. 'In a world marked by supply chain disruption and strategic fragility, Australia needs not only to acquire more missiles, but to make more here at home,' he said. In August, Australia said it would jointly manufacture long-range Naval Strike Missiles and Joint Strike Missiles with Norway's Kongsberg Defence in the city of Newcastle on Australia's eastern coast, the only site outside of Norway. Australia's navy will also have Tomahawk missiles, with a range of 2,500 km (1,550 miles), by the end of the year, increasing the fleet's weapons range 10-fold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-to-ramp-up-missile-production-as-indo-pacific-enters-new-missile-age/7844334.html	2024-10-29T20:36:56-07:00

North Korea's troop deployment to Ukraine could test Beijing-Pyongyang ties	WASHINGTON — As Ukraine braces to face North Korean troops who are believed to be in the Russian border region of Kursk, analysts say China should be concerned about stronger pressure and responses from NATO, which sees Beijing as an enabler of Pyongyang and a supporter of Russia's war against Ukraine. South Korea's National Intelligence Agency said on Tuesday it has obtained information that North Korean troops are moving to the front lines of the war in Russia near Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Monday that North Korean military units have been deployed to Russia's western border region of Kursk. He made the remark after a South Korean delegation briefed NATO, Australia, Japan and New Zealand on North Korea's involvement in Russia's war against Ukraine. Rutte continued that North Korea's troop dispatch, in addition to shipments of ammunition and ballistic missiles, represents 'a dangerous expansion of Russia's war' that threatens both Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security. In return for North Korean troops and weapons, Moscow is providing Pyongyang with 'military technology and other support to circumvent international sanctions,' Rutte added. The U.S. estimates that North Korea sent about 10,000 soldiers to train in eastern Russia. North Korea said on Friday that 'if there is such a thing' as North Korea troops in Russia, 'it will be an act conforming with the regulation of international law.' Growing signs of strain Analysts say North Korea's commitment of troops to help Russia would further strain its relations with China, which undoubtedly will dislike the development that would lead to the strengthening of NATO's ties with South Korea. 'China should be concerned about NATO paying more attention to North Korea, especially since many NATO member countries see Beijing as Pyongyang's enabler,' Ramon Pacheco Pardo, who was part of European Union delegations to previous talks with North Korea, South Korea, China and Japan, told VOA on Friday. North Korea's troop dispatch will lead NATO to focus further on Pyongyang's cyber activities and nuclear and missile programs and proliferation, and this can have 'a knock-on effect on China,' continued Pacheco Pardo, a professor of international relations at King's College London. 'China can't afford to sever ties with North Korea, due to its own security interests. So, Beijing has to endure North Korea siding with Russia and being labeled as part of an axis of authoritarian revisionist states, even if it doesn't like this label,' he added. Earlier in October, NATO held talks with its Asian partners to enhance the security link between Europe and the Indo-Pacific, expressing concern over countries such as China and North Korea that can become 'security spoilers' in their 'backyard.' Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, told VOA on Friday that Beijing is uneasy about Moscow's growing influence in the region through military cooperation with Pyongyang. He said China tolerated North Korea's sending munitions to Russia because it viewed that as having 'a limited time frame,' but after North Korea's troop deployment, Beijing is concerned about their long-term ties contributing to Moscow's growth as a dominant power in East Asia, which threatens Beijing's view of itself as playing that role. Responding to VOA's inquiry on the development of North Korea-Russia military cooperation, the Chinese Embassy in Washington on Tuesday sent a statement saying Beijing hopes 'all parties will promote the de-escalation of the situation and strive for a political settlement.' Keeping the status quo Chinese President Xi Jinping, while attending the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, on October 23, said there is a need to stop 'adding fuel to the fire' in the Ukraine crisis without mentioning specific countries. Beijing, seeing North Korea as a buffer zone between its mainland and U.S. forces stationed in South Korea, has long been Pyongyang's main ally as the biggest trading partner. To prevent it from becoming unstable, China has maintained the economic lifeline of the regime that is heavily sanctioned and closed off from the global economy. But trouble in their bilateral ties seemed to begin when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited Russia last year and were exacerbated when Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a mutual defense treaty in Pyongyang this summer. The latest development in the deepening military relations between Pyongyang and Moscow could 'complicate Beijing's own plans to have it both ways in the Russia-Ukraine war,' according to Roy Kamphausen, a senior fellow for Chinese security at the National Bureau of Asian Research. Kamphausen said on Friday that China wants to 'support Russia enough' so Moscow 'can win slowly' but 'avoid too much blowback, especially economic sanctions on China itself.' He added, 'Escalation in the current conflict which comes from Asia itself might have the negative impact of putting more pressure on Beijing itself, just what it wants to avoid.' The U.S. earlier this month sanctioned China-based companies for collaborating with Russia to produce drones for use against Ukraine. Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA on Friday that 'Beijing would see little benefit to establish a more formal trilateral alliance because being too closely linked to Russian and North Korean provocative behavior could trigger secondary sanctions against China.' China in 2023 was the largest trading partner for EU imports and third largest for EU exports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-troop-deployment-to-ukraine-could-test-beijing-pyongyang-ties/7844318.html	2024-10-29T19:25:06-07:00	
Prosecutor tells jury of 9/11-style plot thwarted in the Philippines	NEW YORK — A Kenyan man who plotted a 9/11-style attack on a U.S. building was training as a commercial pilot in the Philippines when his plans were interrupted, a federal prosecutor told a New York jury Tuesday. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon Bodansky told a federal jury in Manhattan that Cholo Abdi Abdullah plotted an attack for four years that he hoped to carry out on behalf of the terrorist organization al-Shabab. He said Abdullah was almost finished with his two-year pilot training when he was arrested in July 2019 in the Philippines on local charges. He was transferred in December 2020 to U.S. law enforcement authorities, who charged him with terrorism-related crimes. Abdullah underwent training in explosives and how to operate in secret and avoid detection before moving to the Philippines in 2017 to begin intensive training for a commercial pilot's license, the prosecutor said. Abdullah posed as an aspiring commercial pilot even though his true intention was to locate a building in the United States where he could carry out a suicide attack from the cockpit by slamming his plane into a building, Bodansky told the jury. He said Abdullah was 'planning for four years a 9/11-style attack' only to have it thwarted with his arrest. The defendant, operating from a Nairobi hotel, used the internet to research how to breach a cockpit door and looked up a 2019 terrorist attack that killed some 21 people, Bodansky said. Among those killed in that attack was an American businessman who survived the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. Prosecutors have said Abdullah also researched information 'about the tallest building in a major U.S. city' before he was caught. Abdullah, who is representing himself and once pleaded not guilty, declined to give an opening statement and did not actively participate in questioning witnesses Tuesday. In court papers filed before the trial, prosecutors told the judge that they understood 'through standby counsel that the defendant maintains his position that he 'wants to merely sit passively during the trial, not oppose the prosecution and whatever the outcome, he would accept the outcome because he does not believe that this is a legitimate system.'' The State Department in 2008 designated al-Shabab, which means 'the youth' in Arabic, as a foreign terrorist organization. The militant group is an al-Qaida affiliate that has fought to establish an Islamic state in Somalia based on Shariah law. If convicted, Abdullah faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison. His trial is expected to last three weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutor-tells-jury-of-9-11-style-plot-thwarted-in-the-philippines/7844307.html	2024-10-29T18:43:00-07:00

In a first since 1938, Des Moines, Iowa, kids will trick-or-treat on Halloween	DES MOINES, Iowa — For the first time since 1938, children in Des Moines, Iowa, will go trick-or-treating on Halloween. Going door-to-door for candy on All Hallows' Eve has long been commonplace throughout the country. But not in Des Moines, where Iowa's capital city took a different approach more than seven decades ago in hopes of tamping down on hooliganism. Instead, Des Moines children don their costumes on Beggars' Night, typically the day before Halloween. And besides screaming, 'Trick-or-Treat,' children are expected to tell a joke before receiving a treat. This year, Beggars' Night was set for Wednesday, but because of expected heavy rain and thunderstorms, officials delayed trick-or-treating until Thursday, which to the rest of the country is the normal Halloween. 'To my knowledge, it has never been moved or canceled since it was established after Halloween in 1938,' Assistant City Manager Jen Schulte said. 'However, the safety of our residents, families and children is always our top priority and led to the change in this year's scheduled Beggars' Night.' The city began its unusual custom at the suggestion of a former city parks director as a way to reduce vandalism and promote more wholesome fun for kids. Initially, children were encouraged to sing a song, recite poetry and offer some other kind of entertainment, but over time a joke became the most common offering. Beggar's Night also has limited hours, typically running from 6 to 8 p.m. Many of Des Moines' suburbs also adopted the Beggars' Night tradition and chose to shift the celebration to Halloween this year. 'I didn't realize we were that much of an anomaly because for us, this is normal,' said Debbie Westphal Swander, who owns a costume shop in West Des Moines. 'We're going to be in sync at least for this year with the way the event is celebrated everywhere else. 'The big picture for me is, it's absolutely about the kids. That's the most important thing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-a-first-since-1938-des-moines-iowa-kids-will-trick-or-treat-on-halloween/7844271.html	2024-10-29T17:33:26-07:00	
US finalizes rule restricting investment in Chinese tech firms	The Treasury Department on Monday finalized a new rule meant to prevent U.S.-based people and companies from investing in the development of a range of advanced technologies in China, thereby preventing Beijing from accessing cutting-edge expertise and equipment. The rule, which implements an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in 2023, focuses particularly on advanced semiconductors and microelectronics and the equipment used to make them, technology used in quantum computing, and artificial intelligence systems. When it takes effect on January 2, the rule will prohibit certain transactions in semiconductors, microelectronics and artificial intelligence. It also establishes mandatory reporting requirements for transactions that are not banned outright. In the field of quantum computing, the rule is more far-reaching, banning all transactions 'related to the development of quantum computers or production of any critical components required to produce a quantum computer,' as well as the development of other quantum systems. Unlike the fields of AI and semiconductors, the rule does not allow for transactions that can be completed so long as they are reported to the government. The rule also announced the creation of the Office of Global Transactions within Treasury’s Office of Investment Security, which will administer the Outbound Investment Security Program. Justification and opposition 'Artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and quantum technologies are fundamental to the development of the next generation of military, surveillance, intelligence and certain cybersecurity applications like cutting-edge code-breaking computer systems or next generation fighter jets,' Paul Rosen, assistant secretary for investment security, said in a statement. 'This Final Rule takes targeted and concrete measures to ensure that U.S. investment is not exploited to advance the development of key technologies by those who may use them to threaten our national security,' Rosen said. Beijing has repeatedly complained about U.S. technology policy, arguing that the U.S. is dedicated to preventing China’s rise as a global power. In a press conference on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian reiterated China’s longstanding objections to U.S. efforts to withhold advanced technology from Chinese companies. 'China deplores and rejects the U.S.’s Final Rule to curb investment in China,' Lin said. 'China has protested to the U.S. and will take all measures necessary to firmly defend its lawful rights and interests.' Not just equipment The language of the rule frequently notes that it applies to transactions with 'countries of concern,' but the specific language in the text makes it plain that the targets of the rule are companies and individuals doing business in mainland China as well as the 'special administrative districts' of Hong Kong and Macao. The Final Rule’s ban on transactions is not limited to the physical transfer of finished goods and machinery in the specified fields. Explanatory documents released on Monday make it clear that several intangible benefits are also covered. Countries of concern 'are exploiting or have the ability to exploit certain United States outbound investments, including certain intangible benefits that often accompany United States investments and that help companies succeed,' an informational statement accompanying the rule said. 'These intangible benefits include enhanced standing and prominence, managerial assistance, investment and talent networks, market access, and enhanced access to additional financing.' Signaling to US companies The onus will be on U.S. companies to comply with the new rule, Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, told VOA. 'This is the U.S. government signaling to U.S. entities and investors that they need to think twice about making investments on the prohibited transaction side of the equation that would advance China's capabilities in these areas,' Ezell said. He added that the impact of the rule on investment in Chinese technology companies would have effects far beyond any reduction in funding. 'It's not just the dollars,' he said. 'A key target here is getting at the intangible benefits that come with those investments, such as managerial capability, talent networks.' He described that loss as 'very significant.' Closing loopholes In an email exchange with VOA, Daniel Gonzales, a senior scientist at the RAND Corporation, explained that the purpose of the rule was, in part, to prevent U.S. investment firms from supporting Chinese firms in the development of certain kinds of technology. 'These rules were put in place after many episodes where U.S. [venture capital] companies helped to transfer or nurture advanced technologies that have relevant military capabilities,' Gonzales wrote. 'One particular case was that of TikTok and its AI algorithms, which were developed with the help of Sequoia Capital of California.' Sequoia did not break any laws in assisting TikTok, Gonzales said. But 'it has since become known to U.S. authorities that TikTok does possess an AI algorithm that has a variety of applications, some of which have military implications. This new rule is intended to close this loophole.' Gonzales said the U.S. government’s concern with quantum computing is also born of worries about Chinese offensive capabilities. 'Chinese researchers are working on developing quantum computer algorithms that can break encryption codes used by the U.S. government and the U.S. financial sector to protect private and confidential information,' he wrote. 'China has several startup companies working to develop more powerful quantum computers. This new rule is intended to prevent the leakage of U.S. quantum technology to China through U.S. VCs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-finalizes-rule-restricting-investment-in-chinese-tech-firms/7844263.html	2024-10-29T17:10:20-07:00	
Russian army deserters hope French asylum decision will encourage others to flee	Thousands of Russians, including soldiers, have sought asylum in the West since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 — though only a fraction of their applications have been approved.

US court declines RFK Jr's request to order 2 states to drop him from ballot	The U.S. Supreme Court denied a bid Tuesday by former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be removed from the ballot in Wisconsin and Michigan for the Nov. 5 election. Kennedy has said he wants voters who would have backed him to cast ballots for the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. The court declined Kennedy's emergency requests to order the Wisconsin Elections Commission and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to take him off the ballot in those states. Michigan and Wisconsin are among a handful of closely contested states expected to decide the outcome of the race between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented from the decision concerning the Michigan ballot only. No other justice publicly dissented. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist known by his initials RFK Jr., has sought the Supreme Court's intervention in his attempts to stay on the ballot in some states while dropping off others. In September, the Supreme Court rejected his bid to be restored to the ballot in New York. Kennedy suspended his campaign in August and endorsed the former president's candidacy. Kennedy has urged his supporters everywhere to back Trump and has withdrawn from the ballot in a number of Republican-leaning states.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-declines-to-let-rfk-jr-drop-off-ballot-in-wisconsin-michigan-/7843953.html	2024-10-29T16:37:26-07:00	
Judge dismisses Republican lawsuit targeting Pennsylvania overseas ballots	A U.S. judge on Tuesday dismissed a Republican lawsuit seeking to force election battleground state Pennsylvania to strengthen its procedures for verifying ballots submitted by military and overseas voters. Six Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives seeking reelection on November 5 had sued Pennsylvania's top election officials on September 30. The Republicans had argued that the state was improperly exempting overseas voters from a requirement that their identity documents be verified, creating a vulnerability for fraudulent votes to be submitted. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of closely contested states that are expected to decide the outcome of the U.S. presidential race pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner dismissed the case in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, deciding that the plaintiffs had waited too long to file their complaint given that Pennsylvania's procedures had been in place for years. The suit was one of dozens around the country in which Republicans have challenged voting procedures or sought to purge voter rolls in what they call a push to ensure that people do not vote illegally. That legal blitz has been faltering. In the past three weeks, Trump allies have been dealt at least 11 court losses. Conner also said Erick Kaardal, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, had not provided evidence that there had been foreign influence over Pennsylvania's overseas ballots. The judge wrote that when he pressed Kaardal for such evidence during an October 18 hearing, the lawyer 'effectively conceded that all he had was 'concerns.'' 'Plaintiffs cannot rely on phantom fears of foreign malfeasance to excuse their lack of diligence,' Conner wrote. 'We don't want votes from Iran or Russia or invalid votes counting,' Kaardal had told the hearing in Harrisburg federal court over a motion to dismiss the case filed by the Democratic National Committee and Pennsylvania's top elections official. The Election Research Institute, a conservative group whose lawyer Karen DiSalvo brought the case alongside Kaardal, said the plaintiffs were disappointed by the dismissal and were considering options for appeal. Judges in the election battleground states of Michigan and North Carolina this month also rejected lawsuits filed by the Republican National Committee seeking to block votes from some Americans living overseas. In those cases, the Republicans argued the states improperly allowed U.S. citizens living abroad who had never lived in those states to vote there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-dismisses-republican-lawsuit-targeting-pennsylvania-overseas-ballots-/7843920.html	2024-10-29T16:29:57-07:00	
Russia's refusal to return body of Ukrainian journalist slows death investigation	washington — Investigations into the death in Russian custody of Viktoria Roshchyna are being hampered by Moscow’s refusal to return the body of the 27-year-old Ukrainian journalist. Ukraine earlier this month announced that Roshchyna had died in Russian custody on September 19. She had been due to be returned as part of a prisoner release. Petro Yatsenko, from the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, said that Roshchyna’s body was supposed to be repatriated on October 18, according to a letter that Roshchyna’s father received from Russia’s Defense Ministry. It remains unclear why her body was not included in that exchange. Roshchyna’s death is 'something that happened to a Ukrainian journalist in Russia, by Russian authorities. So all the keys to understanding what happened are in Russia’s hands. And there’s obviously very little hope that Russia will even wish to show even a little bit of the truth,' Karol Luczka told VOA. Luczka, who monitors Eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna, said it is 'inexplicable and just appalling' that Russian authorities have not released the body. Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 during a reporting trip to a Russian-occupied part of Ukraine. Moscow did not acknowledge that she was detained until about eight months after her disappearance. Andriy Yusov, from Ukraine’s Military Intelligence, confirmed earlier this month that Roshchyna had been slated for a prisoner release. Some reports indicate that Roshchyna died while being transferred from a detention center in Taganrog, a Russian city near the Ukrainian border, to Moscow in preparation for her return home. Russia’s Washington embassy, Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry did not reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story. A freelance journalist, Roshchyna contributed to Ukrainian outlets including Ukrainska Pravda. She also freelanced for the Ukrainian Service of VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Colleagues remembered her as a journalist committed to reporting on war crimes in Russia’s war against Ukraine, even in dangerous regions. In 2022, Roshchyna was briefly detained by Russian forces while reporting in Berdiansk, in occupied southeastern Ukraine. That experience didn’t deter her from continuing to report in Russian-occupied regions. When Moscow confirmed that Roshchyna was in Russian custody, it was a relief for her supporters, including Elisa Lees Munoz. The executive director of the International Women’s Media Foundation, or IWMF, said the news confirmed that Roshchyna was at least still alive and that there was hope that she would be released. 'Unfortunately, that hope vanished when we learned of her passing,' Munoz told VOA. The IWMF awarded Roshchyna its 2022 courage award. When the IWMF invited Roshchyna to the U.S. to accept the award in person, Roshchyna declined, saying she needed to stay in Ukraine to keep reporting, Munoz said. Press freedom groups are calling for Moscow to make public the circumstances of Roshchyna’s death. Figuring out how Roshchyna died will be difficult without her body, according to Arnaud Froger, the head of investigations at Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, in Paris. 'Without the body, there are only assumptions that we can make,' Froger told VOA. He added that he wouldn’t trust any Russian medical records or autopsy reports without an independent examination of the body. RSF is investigating Roshchyna’s death to figure out what happened and who was involved. With travel to Russia not possible due to security concerns, RSF is left to push Moscow to release Roshchyna’s body and search for witnesses, Froger said. United Nations experts are calling for accountability in Roshchyna’s case, as well as the release of her body. Munoz says she isn’t very hopeful about long-term accountability in Roshchyna’s case. Without an autopsy, Munoz said it will be difficult to determine whether Roshchyna was killed, or whether she died as a result of poor prison conditions. 'Regardless of whether she died of so-called ‘natural causes,’ it was obviously a result of her captivity,' Munoz said. 'I would say that she was killed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-refusal-to-return-body-of-ukrainian-journalist-slows-death-investigation-/7843951.html	2024-10-29T15:51:44-07:00	
Somalia expels Ethiopian diplomat	Somalia has declared an Ethiopian diplomat working in Mogadishu a persona non grata. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Somalia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the diplomat of engaging in 'activities incompatible with his diplomatic role.' The diplomat, Ali Mohamed Adan, who is a counselor at Ethiopia's embassy in Mogadishu, was ordered to leave Somalia within 72 hours of receiving the notice. Somalia did not specify the actions allegedly committed by Ali, but the statement said they 'constitute a breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.' VOA's Horn of Africa Service sought comments from the spokesperson for Ethiopia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nebiat Getachew, but did not receive any. Somalia and Ethiopia have been involved in a heated diplomatic dispute since Addis Ababa signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Somaliland, a move Somalia sees as infringement on its sovereignty. Ethiopia and Somaliland defended the MOU. If implemented, it would give Somaliland recognition from landlocked Ethiopia in return for the leasing of 20 kilometers of seafront, according to Somaliland officials. In April, Somalia expelled Ethiopian Ambassador Muktar Mohamed Ware, alleging 'internal interference' by Ethiopia. Somalia also ordered the closure of Ethiopia's consulates in Somaliland and Puntland, though they remained open. Last month, Somali Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre, speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, urged the international community to stand with Somalia in condemning Ethiopia's violations. Barre alleged that Ethiopia was attempting to 'annex parts of Somalia under the guise of securing sea access.' Taye Atske Selassie was the foreign minister at the time and rejected the Somalian prime minister's comments, insisting that Ethiopia's MOU with Somaliland is 'based on existing political dispensation in Somalia.' 'Ethiopia's name can never be associated with any one of the allegations,' said Taye, who has now become Ethiopia's ceremonial president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-expels-ethiopian-diplomat-/7843888.html	2024-10-29T14:34:18-07:00	
Companies find solutions to power EVs in energy-challenged Africa	NAIROBI, KENYA — Some companies are coming up with creative ways of making electric vehicles a more realistic option in power-challenged areas of Africa. Countries in Africa have been slow adopters of battery-powered vehicles because finding reliable sources of electricity is a challenge in many places. The Center for Strategic and International Studies described Africa as 'the most energy-deficient continent in the world' and said that any progress made in electricity access in the last five years has been reversed by the pandemic and population growth. Onesmus Otieno, for one, regrets trading in his diesel-powered motor bike for an electric one. He earns his living making deliveries and ferrying passengers around Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, with his bike. The two-wheeled taxis popularly known as 'boda boda' in Swahili are commonly used in Kenya and throughout Africa. Kenyan authorities recently introduced the electric bikes to phase out diesel ones. Otieno is among the few riders who adopted them, but he said finding a place to charge his bike has been a headache. Sometimes the battery dies while he is carrying a customer, he said, while a charging station is far away. So, he has to end that trip and cancel other requests. To address the problem, Chinese company Beijing Sebo created a mobile application that allows users of EVs to request a charge through the app. Then, charging equipment is brought to the user’s location. Lin Lin, general manager for overseas business of Beijing Sebo, said because the company produces the equipment, it can control costs. 'We can deploy the product ... in any country they need, and they don’t need to build or fix charging stations,' Lin said. 'We can move to the location of the user, and we can bring electricity to electric vehicles.' Lin said the mobile charging vans use electricity generated from solid waste and can charge up to five cars at one time for about $7 per vehicle — less for a motorbike. Countries in Africa have been slow to adopt electric vehicles because there is a lack of infrastructure to support the technology, analysts say. The cost of EVs is another barrier, said clean energy expert Ajay Mathur. ''Yes, the capital cost is more,' Mathur said. 'The first cost is more, but you recover it in about six years or so. We are at the beginning of the revolution.' Electric motor bike maker Spiro offers a battery-swapping service in several countries to address the lack of EV infrastructure. But studies show that for many African countries, access to reliable and affordable electricity remains a challenge. There are frequent power cuts, outages and voltage fluctuations in several regions. Companies such as Beijing Sebo and Spiro are finding ways around the lack of power in Africa. ''We want to solve the problem of charging anxiety anywhere you are,' Lin said.

Heavy rains cause flash floods in Spain's south, east	Madrid — Torrential rains caused by a cold front moving across southeastern Spain flooded roads and towns on Tuesday, prompting authorities in the worst-hit areas to advise citizens to stay at home and avoid all non-essential travel. Spain's state weather agency AEMET declared a red alert in the eastern Valencia region and the second-highest level of alert in parts of Andalusia in the south, where a train derailed due to the heavy rainfall, although no one was injured. Footage showed firefighters rescuing trapped drivers amid heavy rain in the Valencian town of Alzira and flooded streets with stuck cars. Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Meteorologists believe the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. AEMET expected Valencia to take the brunt of the storm, with forecasts of more than 90 mm of rain in less than one hour, or 180 mm in under 12 hours. Schools, courthouses and other essential services were suspended in Carlet and some other nearby towns in the Valencia region. Local emergency services requested the help of UME, a military unit specialized in rescue operations, in the area of Utiel-Requena, where farmers' association ASAJA said the storm was causing significant damage to crops. The storm first struck Andalusia. In El Ejido, a Mediterranean city known for its sprawling greenhouses, a hailstorm broke hundreds of car windscreens, flooded the streets and damaged the mostly plastic greenhouse infrastructure. In Alora, also in Andalusia, the Guadalorce river overflowed and 14 people there had to be rescued by firefighters, authorities said. Alora topped AEMET's ranking on Tuesday with 160 mm of rainfall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-rains-cause-flash-floods-in-spain-south-east/7843825.html	2024-10-29T13:13:54-07:00	
Workers launch strikes as Germany frets over industrial future	BERLIN — Thousands of German workers launched nationwide strikes to press for higher wages on Tuesday, compounding problems for companies worried about staying globally competitive as high costs, weak exports and foreign rivals chip away at their strengths. The strikes by unionized workers in the nearly 4-million strong electrical engineering and metal industries hit companies such as Porsche, BMW and Mercedes. Also this week, car giant Volkswagen could announce plans to shut three plants on home soil for the first time in its 87-year history, as well as mass layoffs and 10% wage cuts for workers who keep their jobs. A worsening business outlook in Europe's largest economy has piled pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's rickety coalition government, which could be on the verge of collapse ahead of federal elections next year as policy cracks widen. Scholz hosted a meeting with business leaders on Tuesday, including Volkswagen boss Oliver Blume, to discuss strategies for bolstering Germany's industrial sector. The three-hour closed-door meeting in Berlin was aimed at exploring policy measures to drive growth, protect industrial jobs, and reinforce Germany’s position as a global industrial hub, government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said in a statement. The talks mark the beginning of a broader initiative by the German government, with follow-up discussions planned for Nov. 15, Hebestreit added. In a sign of government dysfunction, his finance minister has also announced a separate summit on the same day. Germany has a long history of so-called 'warning strikes' during wage negotiations, but they come at a time of employers' deepening concerns about the future. A leading business group said a survey of companies pointed to Germany experiencing another year of economic contraction in 2024 and no prospect of growth next year. 'We are not just dealing with a cyclical, but a stubborn structural crisis in Germany,' said Martin Wansleben, managing director of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry that conducted the survey. 'We are greatly concerned about how much Germany is becoming an economic burden for Europe and can no longer fulfill its role as an economic workhorse,' he said. A separate survey by the VDA auto industry association suggested the transformation of the German car industry could lead to 186,000 job losses by 2035, of which roughly a quarter have already occurred. 'Europe — especially Germany — is losing more and more international competitiveness,' said the VDA report, which also stated that German companies paid up to three times more for electricity than their U.S. or Chinese rivals, while facing higher taxes and increasing bureaucratic burdens. Workers want share The International Monetary Fund joined those calling for reforms in Germany, suggesting the government ditch a constitutionally enshrined borrowing cap known as the debt brake so it can boost investment. While the debt brake is supported by Finance Minister Christian Lindner, he is at odds with Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who has called for a multibillion-euro fund to stimulate growth. 'The economic policy debate is where it belongs: right at the top of the agenda,' Lindner said on X. 'We have no time to lose.' The meetings with Lindner and Scholz have prompted companies and industry associations to air their gripes. The chemicals lobby VCI lamented 'poor framework conditions' and high energy costs faced by its members, and called on Scholz to make 'groundbreaking decisions' to unleash competitiveness. Reinhold von Eben-Worlee, from the association of family-run companies, compared the plight of Germany's Mittelstand firms to a marathon runner weighed down by a heavy rucksack of high taxes and social security contributions, and red tape. Tuesday's strikes were orchestrated by the powerful IG Metall union, which also staged a walkout during the night shift at Volkswagen's plant in the city of Osnabrueck, where workers worry the site may be shutting down. Approximately 71,000 workers participated in Tuesday's strike, impacting around 370 companies across Germany, according to a spokesperson for IG Metall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/workers-launch-strikes-as-germany-frets-over-industrial-future-/7843812.html	2024-10-29T12:58:44-07:00	
Thailand gambling on casinos to boost economy, but risks remain	Bangkok — Thailand is hoping that a new draft bill that aims to introduce entertainment complexes and casinos throughout the country will give its economy and tourism a much-needed boost. Experts say the prospect of building casinos brings both benefits and risks to the Southeast Asian country. Thai officials announced last week that they expect a draft of the Entertainment Complex Act will be submitted to the Cabinet later this year and deliberated in parliament in the early part of 2025. Officials are hopeful casinos will boost tourism and increase jobs for Thai citizens, contributing to economic growth. But critics say casino gambling goes against traditional Buddhist values and could feed into organized crime. Last week, Julapun Amornwiwat, deputy finance minister, said the Finance Ministry completed a public study about the prospect of opening entertainment complexes. He also said that 'the draft has recently undergone public hearings as required by the Constitution, with 82% of participants expressing support.' Building casinos has long been a goal for the government, said James Warren, a lecturer in the social science division at Mahidol University International College in Thailand. 'The idea of opening casinos has been proposed a number of times in the past, in particular during Thaksin’s [Shinawatra] stint as PM,' he told VOA via email. 'Some of the mooted benefits of opening casinos are that this would reduce corruption and the underground economy, while also creating jobs, encouraging investment and raising tax revenues,' he said. 'The most recent proposal can be seen as part of the Pheu Thai government's stated aim of bringing the underground economy overground.' Illegal, but common As it stands, most forms of gambling in Thailand are illegal. But illicit gambling dens have long been common, with authorities frequently cracking down on them. Police have busted dens in a variety of locations over the years, including zoos and football stadiums. Despite this, Thai governments over the past two decades have been eager to introduce legal casinos in the country. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the father of current Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the ruling Pheu Thai party, laid out in an August speech a 14-point plan to improve the Thai economy, which included investing in entertainment complexes. 'The main purpose of the proposed casinos is to boost tourism and, in particular, lure back the Chinese tourists that were instrumental in Thailand attracting 40-million tourists in 2019,' Warren told VOA. Of the tourists who visited Thailand in 2019, 11 million were from China. So far this year – between January and September – there have been more than 5.2 million Chinese visitors to Thailand, with 8 million forecast by the end of 2024, according to the Thai government. Gary Bowerman, a tourism analyst in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, says Thailand’s casino push contributes to its wide-scale tourism effort. 'Thailand sees integrated resorts as a missing piece of its tourism jigsaw,' he told VOA. 'Singapore and Macau have proved that upscale casino resorts can help diversify the visitor mix by combining cutting-edge hotels, entertainment, dining, shopping and lifestyle elements ultimately all funded by the casinos. 'Being a much larger country, Thailand will want these resorts to diversify the tourism offerings in different destinations.' Thailand officials hope that building several casinos across the country — including in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket — will boost the kingdom's gross domestic product by at least 5%. Tourism crucial to economy That’s because tourism is vital to Thailand’s economy, which overall is performing sluggishly, with a forecast GDP growth of only 2.4% for 2024, according to the World Bank. The Thai government expects 36 million visitors by the end of the year and has an ambitious target to welcome 40 million visitors in 2025. But the prospect of visitors entering Thailand for gambling purposes has some worried that casinos could lead to an increase in criminal activity. Casinos are common in Southeast Asia, including in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and the Philippines. But according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, casinos expand cyber fraud in the region, which is already rife with online scam centers that swindle billions of dollars a year from victims. And there are concerns that could happen in Thailand, too. 'Academics and senators criticized the casino proposal during the 2001-2006 Thaksin administration on the grounds that gambling contravenes Buddhist precepts,' Warren said. Other criticisms are that casinos will encourage problem gambling, debt and related crimes. On encouraging criminals to come to Thailand, I would say that this would largely depend on how well regulated the casinos are.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-gambling-on-casinos-to-boost-economy-but-risks-remain/7843800.html	2024-10-29T12:55:25-07:00	
EU slaps tariffs on Chinese EVs, risking Beijing backlash	brussels — The European Union has decided to increase tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles to as much as 45.3% at the end of its highest profile investigation that has divided Europe and prompted retaliation from Beijing. Just over a year after launching its anti-subsidy probe, the European Commission will set out extra tariffs ranging from 7.8% for Tesla to 35.3% for China's SAIC, on top of the EU's standard 10% car import duty. The extra tariffs were formally approved and published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday, meaning they will take effect on Wednesday. The Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, has said tariffs are required to counter what it says are unfair subsidies including preferential financing and grants as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices. It says China's spare production capacity of 3 million EVs per year is twice the size of the EU market. Given 100% tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe. Beijing has called the EU tariffs protectionist and damaging to EU-China relations and automotive supply chains and has launched its own probes this year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products in apparent retaliation. It has also challenged the EU's provisional measures at the World Trade Organization. European automakers are grappling with an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. The Commission estimates Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8% from below 1% in 2019 and could reach 15% in 2025. It says prices are typically 20% below those of EU-made models. The EU's stance toward Beijing has hardened in the last five years. It views China as a potential partner in some areas, but also as a competitor and a systemic rival, but EU members are not united on EV tariffs. Germany, the EU's biggest economy and major car producer, opposed tariffs in a vote earlier this month in which 10 EU members backed them, five voted against and 12 abstained. Germany's economy ministry said on Tuesday Berlin supported ongoing EU negotiations with China and hoped for a diplomatic resolution to mitigate trade tensions while protecting EU industry. 'The Federal Government stands for open markets. Because Germany in particular, as a globally interconnected economy, is dependent on this,' the spokesperson added. German carmakers have heavily criticized the EU measures, aware that possible higher Chinese import duties on large-engine gasoline vehicles would hit them hardest. The measures come as thousands of German industrial workers, including at the carmakers, strike for higher wages, with Volkswagen possibly about to announce shutting plants on home soil for the first time in its 87-year history. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the EU was headed for an 'economic cold war' with China. However, France's PFA car association has welcomed duties, adding it backed free trade as long as it was fair. The Commission has held eight rounds of technical negotiations with China to find an alternative to tariffs and said talks can continue after tariffs are imposed. The two sides are looking at possible minimum price commitments for imported cars and agreed on Friday to hold a further round, although the Commission said there were 'significant remaining gaps.' It remains to be seen what impact tariffs will have on consumer prices. Some producers may be able to absorb them at least partially. In the first nine months of 2024, China's EV exports to the EU were down 7% from a year earlier, but they have surged by more than a third in August and September, ahead of the tariffs, data from the China Passenger Car Association, or CPCA, show.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-slaps-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-risking-beijing-backlash-/7843786.html	2024-10-29T12:42:13-07:00	
Sudan displacement crisis worsens as fighting, hunger, sexual violence escalate	GENEVA — The International Organization for Migration warned Tuesday that Sudan’s displacement crisis is worsening as increasing numbers of people flee fighting, hunger and sexual violence, thereby threatening 'regional instability. 'The scale of this displacement and the corresponding humanitarian needs grows every day,' Amy Pope, IOM director general, told journalists in Geneva on a video link from Port Sudan. 'Throughout this year, Sudan has been the world’s largest displacement crisis. Today I can share that we will release new figures this week showing the displacement number has hit 11 million. That is up 200,000 just since September,' she said, adding that an additional 3.1 million people have fled across borders as refugees. 'Nearly 30% of Sudan’s population has been displaced. ... That is actually over 14 million people who are on the move right now,' she said, noting that more than half of those displaced are women and more than a quarter are children under the age of 5. 'Unfortunately, many have been forced to flee repeatedly. They have little access to shelter; they have little access to livelihoods, and getting their basic needs met has been very, very difficult. The scale of displacement and humanitarian needs are growing every day,' she said. Since war between the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, erupted 18 months ago, more than 24,000 people have been killed, the United Nations reports. The World Food Program reports 26 million people face acute hunger, and famine has broken out in Zamzam camp in North Darfur, home to half a million internally displaced people. 'The suffering is growing by the day,' said Pope. 'Frankly, half of the population now needs help. People do not have access to shelter. They do not have access to clean drinking water. They do not have health care. Disease is spreading fast. One in every two Sudanese is struggling to get even the minimal amount of food to survive.' Pope arrived in Port Sudan Monday on a four-day mission to 'raise awareness of the needs and the cost of displacement' and to raise the profile of Sudan, which she called 'the most neglected crisis in the world today.' She said more attention must be paid to Sudan’s underreported conflict situation. 'Millions are suffering, and there is now the serious possibility of the conflict igniting regional instability from the Sahel to the Horn of Africa to the Red Sea.' 'The collective failure to act means the devastation risks spilling over into neighboring countries,' she warned, a warning shared by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk, who expressed concern about the escalating hostilities and violence in Sudan’s al-Jazirah state. His spokesperson, Seif Magango, told journalists the high commissioner feared the fighting in al-Jazirah risked exacerbating further 'attacks against civilians, ethnically motivated violence and atrocity crimes.' He added that RSF ground forces reportedly have killed hundreds of people 'amid widespread looting' in recent attacks on villages targeted in the region. 'Reports also indicate at least 25 cases of sexual violence in several villages in Sharq al-Jazira locality, including three medical personnel and an 11-year-old girl, who died as a result. Women and girls were also reportedly abducted,' he said. A report released Tuesday by the U.N. Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan accused the RSF of committing sexual violence 'on a large scale' in areas under their control, including gang rapes and abducting and detaining victims in conditions that amount to sexual slavery. 'There are reasonable grounds to believe that these acts amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including of torture, rape, sexual slavery and persecution on intersecting ethnic and gender grounds,' it said. The report also documents cases involving the SAF but concludes that 'the majority of rape and sexual and gender-based violence was committed by the RSF.' Besides the ongoing horrors, Turk’s spokesperson observed that RSF forces were committing other violations that threatened the welfare of the Sudanese people. 'There are reports of burning of crops,' said Magango. 'At a time when over 25 million Sudanese are facing acute food insecurity because of the ongoing conflict, destruction of crops in a region considered the country’s breadbasket can only exacerbate an already catastrophic situation.' Because of the ongoing violence, he said, thousands of families reportedly have been displaced from Al-Jazirah state into the neighboring state of Gedaref and nearby Kassala, 'adding to the already dire displacement crisis in the country.' High Commissioner Türk reiterated his call on leaders of both warring parties to promptly take measures to de-escalate the situation and 'to put a stop to violations by their forces.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-displacement-crisis-worsens-as-fighting-hunger-sexual-violence-escalate/7843740.html	2024-10-29T12:26:08-07:00	
Teri Garr, comic actor of 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Tootsie,' has died	LOS ANGELES — Teri Garr, the quirky comedy actor who rose from background dancer in Elvis Presley movies to co-star of such favorites as Young Frankenstein and Tootsie, has died. She was 79. Garr died Tuesday of multiple sclerosis 'surrounded by family and friends,' publicist Heidi Schaeffer said. Garr battled other health problems in recent years and underwent an operation in January 2007 to repair an aneurysm. Admirers took to social media in her honor, with writer-director Paul Feig calling her 'truly one of my comedy heroes. I couldn't have loved her more' and screenwriter Cinco Paul saying: 'Never the star, but always shining. She made everything she was in better.' The actor, who was sometimes credited as Terri, Terry or Terry Ann during her long career, seemed destined for show business from her childhood. Her father was Eddie Garr, a well-known vaudeville comedian; her mother was Phyllis Lind, one of the original high-kicking Rockettes at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Their daughter began dance lessons at 6 and by 14 was dancing with the San Francisco and Los Angeles ballet companies. She was 16 when she joined the road company of West Side Story in Los Angeles, and as early as 1963 she began appearing in bit parts in films. She recalled in a 1988 interview how she won the West Side Story role. After being dropped from her first audition, she returned a day later in different clothes and was accepted. From there, the blonde, statuesque Garr found steady work dancing in movies, and she appeared in the chorus of nine Presley films, including Viva Las Vegas, Roustabout and Clambake. She also appeared on numerous television shows, including Star Trek, Dr. Kildare and Batman, and was a featured dancer on the rock 'n' roll music show Shindig, the rock concert performance T.A.M.I. and a cast member of The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. Her big film break came as Gene Hackman's girlfriend in 1974's Francis Ford Coppola thriller The Conversation. That led to an interview with Mel Brooks, who said he would hire her for the role of Gene Wilder's German lab assistant in 1974's Young Frankenstein — if she could speak with a German accent. 'Cher had this German woman, Renata, making wigs, so I got the accent from her,' Garr once recalled. The film established her as a talented comedy performer, with New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael proclaiming her 'the funniest neurotic dizzy dame on the screen.' Her big smile and off-center appeal helped land her roles in Oh God! opposite George Burns and John Denver, Mr. Mom (as Michael Keaton's wife) and Tootsie in which she played the girlfriend who loses Dustin Hoffman to Jessica Lange. Although best known for comedy, Garr showed in such films as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Black Stallion and The Escape Artist that she could handle drama equally well. She had a flair for spontaneous humor, often playing David Letterman's foil during guest appearances on NBC's Late Night With David Letterman early in its run. Her appearances became so frequent, and the pair's good-natured bickering so convincing, that for a time rumors cropped up that they were romantically involved. Years later, Letterman credited those early appearances with helping make the show a hit. It was also during those years that Garr began to feel something in her right leg. It began in 1983 and eventually spread to her right arm. By 1999 the symptoms had become so severe that she consulted a doctor. The diagnosis: multiple sclerosis. For three years Garr didn't reveal her illness. 'I was afraid that I wouldn't get work,' she explained in a 2003 interview. 'People hear MS and think, 'Oh, my God, the person has two days to live.'' After going public, she became a spokeswoman for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, making humorous speeches to gatherings in the U.S. and Canada. 'You have to find your center and roll with the punches because that's a hard thing to do: to have people pity you,' she said in 2005. 'Just trying to explain to people that I'm OK is tiresome.' She also continued to act, appearing on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Greetings From Tucson, Life With Bonnie and other TV shows. She also had a brief recurring role on Friends in the 1990s as Lisa Kudrow's mother. After several failed romances, Garr married contractor John O'Neill in 1993. They adopted a daughter, Molly, before divorcing in 1996.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teri-garr-comic-actor-of-young-frankenstein-and-tootsie-has-died-/7843751.html	2024-10-29T12:25:57-07:00	
US reiterates 'one China' policy amid reports of Xi's request on Taiwan	Washington — Resisting pressure from Beijing to publicly reject independence for Taiwan, the Biden administration underscores there is no change in its 'one China' policy which takes no stand on the issue. 'We do not support Taiwan independence. We expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion,' a senior administration official told VOA Tuesday, underscoring long-standing U.S. policy on the thorny issue. 'We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by either side.' The confirmation followed reports that during their last in-person meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S. President Joe Biden to change the language the administration uses when discussing its position on Taiwan independence. On the sidelines of the APEC meeting near San Francisco last November, Xi reportedly told Biden he wants the U.S. to use language stating it 'opposes' instead of 'does not support' independence for Taiwan, the current phrase used in U.S. official statements. The administration has been 'consistent on our long-standing one China policy,' the official said. Under the policy, the U.S. acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s view that it has sovereignty over Taiwan. It considers Taiwan's status as unsettled. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. Beijing’s push for stronger language is not new. Ahead of the Biden-Xi meeting last year, VOA reported that Foreign Minister Wang Yi also made the request in his meetings with U.S. counterparts. The Chinese have been asking for this shift, and in some instances falsely asserting that the U.S. position is to oppose Taiwanese independence, said Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 'I find it unlikely that the United States will take this advice without some substantial concession from China on its own position about Taiwan,' Cooper told VOA. 'I doubt this will get any traction in Washington unless it is part of a longer-term conversation about de-escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait.' Biden and Xi likely to meet again in person next month in South America, where both are expected to attend an APEC meeting in Lima, Peru, and a G-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It will likely be Biden’s last meeting with the Chinese leader before leaving office in January. 'It will probably be an opportunity for the two leaders to say goodbye and for their teams to wrap up a couple of loose ends, perhaps including an announcement or two on people-to-people issues,' said Cooper. Beijing is no doubt gearing up for a change in U.S. administration ahead of the election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Both have vowed to be tough on China, with Trump saying he would impose '150% to 200%' tariffs on China if it sought to blockade Taiwan. Flared tensions Cross-strait tensions have flared many times in recent years. On Sunday, Taiwan's defense ministry said Chinese warplanes and warships carried out another 'combat patrol' near the island, following Beijing’s threat to respond with countermeasures to a $2 billion arms sale by the United States. The administration announced it approved the package last week, which includes its first delivery of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, advanced weapons that have been battle-tested in Ukraine. Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, the U.S. is Taiwan’s strongest unofficial ally and Washington is legally bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taipei with the means to defend itself. China 'strongly condemns' the sale. 'We will take resolute countermeasures and take all measures necessary to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,' said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson. VOA's Nike Ching contributed to this story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-reiterates-one-china-policy-amid-reports-of-xi-s-request-on-taiwan/7843735.html	2024-10-29T12:16:33-07:00	
Georgian opposition takes to streets to challenge election results	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Georgians flooded the streets of the capital, Tbilisi, late Monday, protesting what they see as a fraudulent election that secured another term for the ruling Georgian Dream party. Tens of thousands gathered outside the parliament building on Rustaveli Avenue, with Georgian, U.S. and European flags waving and voices calling for new elections. The rally, which opposition leaders called a show of defiance, came just two days after the release of preliminary results, which reported Georgian Dream leading with 53.9% of the vote, while the Coalition for Change, Unity-National Movement and other opposition groups significantly trailed. Speaking to the crowd, President Salome Zourabichvili, who has been critical of the government, took a bold stance. 'You, who are here, did not lose the election. Your vote was stolen, and they tried to steal your future,' she said. 'I can swear that I will be with you until the end, on this European road, and until we reach the door of Europe, which is not our dream but a reality. We have no other future and alternative.' The government denies the accusations. Shalva Papuashvili, the chair of the parliament, said, 'The elections were held in full compliance with democratic standards. The results reflect the will of the Georgian people, and any claims of widespread fraud are baseless.' The opposition alleges the election was rigged, while concerns have also been raised by Western countries and international observers. Larisa, one of the protesters wrapped in the European Union flag, expressed hope: 'We have faith in our European and American allies. There's always a reason to fight, and the truth must prevail.' She added, 'The elections were obviously rigged, and on such a massive scale that it's unimaginable. Until this government changes, I will continue to be here. This is the only path we have left.' Ana, a 20-year-old first-time voter, shared her dismay. 'I've never been this disappointed before. I can't believe this is happening. I truly hoped for change.' Another protester, Giga, stated, 'The people of Georgia are ready to fight until the end to bring our country back to the Euro-Atlantic path. We cannot and will not accept Russian occupation in any form.' Giga added, 'In many rural areas, 60 to 70% of the population relies entirely on state assistance. The pressure there is immense, especially in regions where young people have left, and there's no foundation of youth support. The government exploits this vulnerability, putting immense pressure on our parents' generation.' Large gains raise suspicions The results show that Georgian Dream enjoyed major vote gains in the regions, raising suspicions of fraud. In one municipality of Abasha, the ruling party increased its vote total by 19.98% over its showing in 2021 local elections. In another municipality, Dmanisi, the party’s vote total increased by 25%. The party, which is about to begin its fourth term, gathered more than 639,000 votes in the rural areas, reaching above 80% support in ethnic minority regions where fraud over decades remains an issue. In a significant move, all four major opposition parties have declared they will not take their seats in parliament, refusing to legitimize what they describe as a stolen election. Opposition leaders have called for a new vote, arguing that only fresh elections can restore public trust and legitimacy. 'We demand elections that genuinely reflect the will of the Georgian people, free from manipulation and fraud,' Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity-National Movement coalition said. Observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's election watchdog, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, highlighted 'numerous irregularities' in the voting process and pointed to the controversial 'foreign agent' law adopted in June, which restricted freedoms and influenced the election environment. Nika, another protester, voiced his frustration: 'This government operates like a Russian regime, no matter how you look at it. In recent years, their governance has mirrored Russian tactics. The opposition may not be popular, but at least they are not serving Russian interests.' Hungary’s Orban booed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Georgia two days after the elections to show support for the Georgian government. As he was leaving his hotel on the main avenue where the protest was taking place, the demonstrators booed him. The next morning, at a joint press conference with Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, Orban said, 'I am convinced that nobody can question the legitimacy of the elections held in Georgia. 'No one should be dragged into a war unnecessarily, and the Georgian people have made their decision very clearly,' he said, echoing the Georgian government's position that voting for the opposition would mean a war with Russia. While Orban stood side-by-side with the Georgian prime minister, other EU foreign ministers in a joint statement voiced concerns about the conduct of the critical vote in the country of 3.7 million. 'The elections in Georgia were held under difficult conditions, and there are serious concerns about how the process was conducted,' the statement read. 'Upholding the rule of law and free and fair elections is integral to any progress on Georgia’s EU path. We criticize Prime Minister Orban’s premature visit to Georgia. He does not speak on behalf of the EU,' it read. A country at a crossroads The election took place in an atmosphere of tension and fear. Georgian Dream, led by Russian-backed businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili, has long relied on an extensive network of state resources and alliances to maintain power. The party's control over public sector jobs and social benefits, especially in rural areas where economic opportunities are scarce, has been key to its grip on power. Over the years, Georgian Dream has also perfected the practice of 'managing' elections long before voters head to the polls, observers say. Local nongovernmental organizations and analysts maintain that the ruling party has relied on bribery, intimidation and fearmongering to ensure its continued success. 'Since the 2018 presidential election, Georgian Dream has relied heavily on coercion and fear of war,' said Levan Ramishvili, a political science professor at Tbilisi's Free University. The opposition claimed victory but struggled to make significant headway in Tbilisi, where electoral manipulations are reportedly less severe compared to rural areas. Aka Zakrua, executive editor of Realpolitik, an online publication, highlighted the uphill battle faced by the opposition. 'In order to change the government, the Georgian opposition must secure a large margin of victory, around 10 to 15%. Given the limited financial resources, compared to Ivanishvili's vast personal wealth, which is nearly a quarter of Georgia's economy, it becomes nearly impossible. 'This election has demonstrated that challenge, and now Georgian society and the political elite must decide whether such elections are acceptable or if changes are needed.' Zakrua noted that the opposition tried to win against Ivanishvili on his field, relying heavily on voters who were not ideologically committed but rather transactional. 'The opposition sought out people on local levels to gauge support and communicate with potential voters. Since people didn't have strong alliances or convictions to the cause, they switched sides when Ivanishvili's people approached offering more money,' he said. Ahead of the elections, the Georgian Dream campaign leaned heavily on the narrative of stability versus conflict, painting the opposition and their Western allies as part of a 'global war party.' The main message from Georgian Dream was that if the opposition won, it would mean war with Russia. In response, the opposition remained strategically silent. The fear of renewed conflict resonated with many Georgians, especially in light of the war in Ukraine and their own two wars with Moscow. 'That was the main contributing factor. People voted for status quo, not for a change,' Zakrua said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-opposition-takes-to-streets-to-challenge-election-results/7843647.html	2024-10-29T11:25:10-07:00	
As China sentences prominent dissidents, others protest behind bars	taipei, taiwan — A court in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou on Tuesday sentenced Chinese human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng and his wife, Xu Yan, to prison. Yu and Xu were detained by police in April 2023 while on the way to meet with high-level European officials visiting China. They were later charged with 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' and 'inciting subversion of state power,' two crimes that Chinese authorities often use against dissidents. Yu was sentenced to three years in prison, while Xu, who had already been detained for more than 18 months, could be released in January. Their sentencing comes despite repeated efforts by the European Union and the U.N. Human Rights Council to draw attention to the case and call for their immediate and unconditional release. Tuesday’s sentences will have a chilling effect within the community of rights advocates in China, analysts said. 'This case will likely deter other human rights activists from trying to meet with foreign diplomats because Yu and Xu were accused of colluding with foreign forces even though they didn’t make it to the scheduled meeting,' Patrick Poon, a visiting researcher at the University of Tokyo, told VOA by phone. Prison hunger strike Meanwhile, two jailed Chinese dissidents are protesting mistreatment, including around-the-clock monitoring and denial of contact with family. Prominent Chinese dissident Xu Zhiyong, who was sentenced to 14 years in jail on the charge of 'subversion of state power' last April, began a hunger strike after prison authorities instructed three other inmates in Xu’s cell to conduct around-the-clock monitoring, according to U.S.-based Chinese human rights lawyer Teng Biao. 'Since July, Xu has been required to get permission if he wants to go to the bathroom or leave his cell and whenever he leaves his cell, he will be closely followed by other inmates,' Teng told VOA by phone. 'Additionally, he has been forced to work in prison and deprived of phone calls as well as communicating with his family members through letters,' he said, calling the situation devastating for Xu’s mental health. Rights advocates say police have harassed Xu’s family. 'Chinese authorities have repeatedly threatened Xu’s family members not to disclose details of his case and not to contact anyone abroad or else they would be detained,' said Sophie Luo, the wife of detained Chinese human rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi. Teng worries the prolonged hunger strike, which started October 4, imperils Xu’s long-term well-being. 'I worry his physical and mental health will suffer irreversible damage,' Teng told VOA, adding that Xu has reportedly lost a lot of weight since beginning the hunger strike. In response to Xu’s hunger strike, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said it is concerned about reports of the deterioration of his health. 'Our office has engaged with the Chinese authorities about his situation and urged for his immediate and unconditional release,' Thameen Al-Kheetan, public information officer at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, told VOA in a written response. Pushing back In addition to Xu, Chinese human rights lawyer Xie Yang, who has been in detention for more than 1,000 days, announced earlier this month that he won’t attend any court proceedings until his lawyer can access and copy his case files. Some analysts say Xu and Xie hope to attract more attention to their cases through their protests to put more pressure on the Chinese government. 'The fierce resistance put forward by these dissidents may push the Chinese government to restore some of their basic rights, such as access to medical care, which would be an improvement from the original treatment that they were receiving,' Yaqiu Wang, research director for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at Freedom House, told VOA by phone. In a post on the social media platform X, which is banned in China, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said Washington is 'disturbed by reports that civil rights activist Xu Zhiyong is on a hunger strike in protest of inhumane treatment in prison.' 'We urge the PRC to release Mr. Xu and, in the interim, to treat him, and all prisoners, with dignity in accordance with UN member state obligations,' he wrote. VOA requested comment from the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Washington but has yet to hear back. Beijing routinely dismisses criticism of its treatment of dissidents and human rights lawyers. In a previous response to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said China is 'a country ruled by law and liberty is protected and respected' in the country. Fear of further persecution In addition to Tuesday’s sentence and Xu’s hunger strike, Chinese human rights lawyer Lu Siwei was arrested earlier this month and charged with 'illegally crossing the border' in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Lu was repatriated back to China from Laos last year after trying to flee the country to reunite with his family in the United States. His wife, Zhang Chunxiao, who lives in the U.S., told VOA that prison authorities have prevented family members from sending medications to Lu and some of his health problems may not be properly addressed. 'He told the lawyer that the quality of the meals is bad so I’m worried about his health condition and since he broke his right arm earlier this year, I also wonder whether the daily work in prison would affect his injury or not,' she said in a phone interview. Based on the treatment that other Chinese dissidents in prison receive, Zhang worries that Lu may also experience torture or mistreatment while he waits for the final verdict. 'I’m very anxious and concerned because I don’t know what the Chinese authorities would do to my husband,' she said, adding that the international community should understand the charges or treatment against many Chinese human rights defenders like Lu are 'unreasonable.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-china-sentences-prominent-dissidents-others-protest-behind-bars-/7843631.html	2024-10-29T10:49:20-07:00

Vatican panel: Church must do better compensating sexual abuse victims	Vatican City — The Catholic Church must do a better job of handling compensation for the victims of clergy sexual abuse, the Vatican's child protection commission said in its first annual report on Tuesday. For decades, the Church has been shaken by scandals across the world involving pedophile priests and the cover-up of their crimes, damaging its credibility and costing it hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements. The commission said compensation went beyond money, including 'a much broader spectrum of actions ... such as acknowledging mistakes, public apologies, and other forms of true fraternal closeness to victims/survivors.' Pledging to work for the introduction of 'standardized and known procedures ... in a more comprehensive way,' it said it would delve deeper into the issue of reparations in its report next year. Pope Francis, who set up the anti-abuse commission in 2013, faced some of the strongest criticism over clergy abuse during a September visit to Belgium, where the king and prime minister called for more help for victims. This month, a Vatican summit of world bishops ended with a final text apologizing several times for the 'untold and ongoing' pain suffered by Catholics abused by clergy. Tuesday's report called for greater transparency, with victims given more access to documents relating to them, and said investigations and trials by the Vatican's doctrine office (DDF) were too slow and secretive. During meetings with victims, 'the lack of communication was a permanent, constant complaint,' Colombian Bishop and commission secretary Luis Manuel Ali Herrera told a press conference. Chilean abuse survivor and commission member Juan Carlos Cruz said the lack of information was 'a form of re-trauma for many survivors, who have no idea where their case of abuse is.' Other recommendations included creating a Vatican Ombudsman for victims, ensuring more effective punishment of offending clergy, and an invitation for Francis to write an encyclical - the highest form of papal teaching - on child protection. Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the Bishop Accountability abuse tracking group, said Tuesday's report amounted to window dressing. 'It doesn't focus on the central and devastating realities: that children in the Catholic Church are still being sexually assaulted by clergy, and that universal church law still allows these priests to be reinstated if certain conditions are met,' she told Reuters. The anti-abuse commission is the first of its kind in the Catholic Church, but abuse survivors have accused it of being toothless and several of its past members have left acrimoniously. The commission, which includes priests, nuns but also lay people and non-Catholics, was incorporated into the DDF in 2022 in an effort to increase its clout, but the report highlighted how it still struggles to make itself heard. As part of its dealings with national churches, it said it had sent a list of 10 detailed questions on child protection issues to all Mexican bishops, but only about 20% of them had replied. U.S. Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who leads the commission but is due to retire soon, acknowledged past 'frustration at the slowness of change,' but said things were getting better.	https://www.voanews.com/a/catholic-church-must-do-better-job-on-compensating-sexual-abuse-victims-says-vatican-panel/7843506.html	2024-10-29T09:42:29-07:00	
Authorities in Shanghai crack down on Halloween celebrations	In Shanghai, police, not trick-or-treaters and partygoers, are taking to the streets this week as the city approaches Halloween. The strengthened police force accompanies official notices prohibiting citizens from 'role-playing' on Halloween, signaling the government’s paranoia over the social instability the holiday’s festivities could bring. Videos online show police cars lining the streets of Shanghai, with some officers approaching crowds and instructing them to disperse from fenced-off areas. A leaked notice from the Huangpu subdistrict office identified any form of Halloween costumes, but especially role-playing costumes and makeup with gore, to be prohibited in public. Police have been instructed to persuade those in costume to leave or take off offensive garments and employ more coercive measures in the event of noncompliance. The police garrisons, protocols and general air of malaise in Shanghai find their roots in the local government’s fear of mass protest, according to Shanghai resident Ma, who declined to provide her first name out of fear of reprisal for talking to VOA. 'The Communist Party knows that 'a spark can start a prairie fire' and that many young people are now unemployed and unable to find jobs,' Ma siad. 'So they have deployed a large number of police forces on Changle Road and Julu Road, probably because they are worried that some of the freethinking young people will protest against the government in a strange way on Halloween.' Ma told VOA. Costumed people taken by police Some youth in Shanghai have appeared to ignore the warnings, gathering in Zhongshan park and the nearby streets to celebrate the holiday early. Online videos of the scene show some people in costume being taken away by the police, while others argue with law enforcement. At another celebration Friday night, in the Jing An district, Reuters reported that an attendee in a skeleton costume was detained by the police and escorted to an administrative building where he was asked to remove his makeup. Wang, a Shanghai resident who declined to provide his first name for his personal security, disagreed with the sudden tightening of restrictions on Halloween celebrations in his city. 'What can wearing a unique dress do?' Wang asked. 'As a normal, civilized society, this should not be a matter of concern at all. It is normal to ‘let the arts blossom’ and allow everyone to release their inner yearning for freedom. In a normal, civilized society, the police maintain the safety of the people. In our case, it's the opposite,' Wang said. Originating in the West, Halloween has found popularity in China in recent years. This is especially the case in Shanghai, known as China’s most international city and for its relative open-mindedness. In 2023, the city resumed the celebration of Halloween for the first time after the COVID-19 lockdowns, and some residents used this opportunity for self-expression to critique the Chinese government and political phenomena through costume. Some people dressed as Winnie the Pooh, a character that is often censored online in China given his likeness to Chinese President Xi Jinping, and others referenced past protests through covering their bodies in white paper. Ma believes that tensions this week between Halloween celebrants and local authorities are unlikely to escalate. 'Young people are indeed rebellious, but because of the education we have received since childhood, most Chinese young people dare not, and are unlikely, to rebel,' Ma said. 'Will the authorities completely control and prohibit Halloween? I don't think they will, but they will strictly control it. There will definitely be a lot of police in more important places. If any little thing happens, they will immediately send a police car to prevent the matter from escalating,' she said. Unique opportunity for free expression Chen Daoyin, an independent political analyst in China, told VOA that he believes that Halloween provides Chinese people with a unique opportunity for Western-style free expression. 'Most people, especially young people who dress up as characters on festivals like Halloween, have usually adopted Western culture, or at the very least know that people in Western systems have the freedom of expression,' Chen said. 'We have opinions about the current situation and the government, and can make our voices heard, but we also know that this is not allowed in the current political environment in China. Everyone knows what is going on. So they express their dissatisfaction with the authorities through dressing up as characters,' he said. Li Rongwei, executive director of the Taiwan Inspirational Association, however, told VOA that the holiday’s Western origins make it more susceptible to suppression. 'For China, Halloween is a product of the West, a typical capitalist bourgeois thing,' Li said. 'Since Halloween is a foreign thing and not a product of the so-called Chinese nation or China as the CCP believes, it is, of course, a class struggle and should be slandered,' Li said. October 27 marked the first anniversary of the death of former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, whose unexpected passing less than a year after he left the powerful premier position, sparked online conspiracy theories about the Chinese government. The Chinese government also might fear a social disruption akin to the 2022 White Paper Movement in protest of strict pandemic regulations that was referenced at Halloween celebrations in Shanghai last year. 'Social movements always have to have a reason, and it is conceivable to use Li Keqiang as the reason,' Lai said. 'This is also what the CCP fears the most. A tandem movement always has a theme. According to the perception of the CCP's top officials, it may be believed that this is a social movement planned by foreign forces.' But Chen believes that it is an over-speculation and inaccurate to link this year’s crackdown on Halloween with Li Keqiang and the White Paper Movement and says that there will not be any kind of uprising in China without an acute inciting incident. 'It is impossible for the youth of today ... to start a movement of any kind without the impact of a big event,' he said. 'So far this year, there has been no major event that can arouse empathy and emotional expression,' Chen said.

Putin launches drills of Russia's nuclear forces simulating retaliatory strikes	MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday launched a massive exercise of the country's nuclear forces featuring missile launches in a simulation of a retaliatory strike, as he continued to flex the country's nuclear muscle amid spiraling tensions with the West over Ukraine. Speaking in a video call with military leaders, Putin said that the drills will simulate top officials' action in using nuclear weapons and include launches of nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. Defense Minister Andrei Belousov reported that the exercise is intended to practice 'strategic offensive forces launching a massive nuclear strike in response to a nuclear strike by the enemy.' Putin, who has repeatedly brandished the nuclear sword as he seeks to deter the West from ramping up support for Ukraine, emphasized on Tuesday that Russia's nuclear arsenal remains a 'reliable guarantor of the country's sovereignty and security.' 'Taking into account growing geopolitical tensions and emerging new threats and risks, it's important for us to have modern strategic forces that are always ready for combat,' he said, reaffirming that Russia sees nuclear weapons use as 'the ultimate, extreme measure of ensuring its security.' Putin noted that Moscow will continue to modernize its nuclear forces, deploying new missiles that have a higher precision, quicker launch times and increased capabilities to overcome missile defenses. As part of Tuesday's drills, the military test-fired a Yars intercontinental ballistic missile from the Plesetsk launch pad at the Kura testing range on the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Defense Ministry said. The Novomoskovsk and Knyaz Oleg nuclear submarines test-fired ICBMs from the Barents Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, while nuclear-capable Tu-95 strategic bombers carried out practice launches of long-range cruise missiles. The ministry said that all the missiles reached their designated targets. Last month, the Russian leader warned the U.S. and NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons for strikes deep inside Russia would put NATO at war with his country. He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv. Putin also declared that the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, holding the door open to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West. Tuesday's maneuvers follow a series of other drills of Russia's nuclear forces. Earlier this year, the Russian military held a joint nuclear exercise with Moscow's ally Belarus, which has hosted some of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-launches-drills-of-russia-s-nuclear-forces-simulating-retaliatory-strikes-/7843429.html	2024-10-29T08:50:23-07:00	
UK, EU, Canada unveil new sanctions on Myanmar military	London — The European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada on Tuesday announced fresh sanctions targeting the Myanmar junta's access to 'military materiel, equipment and funds.' The new curbs, against entities supplying aviation fuel and equipment to Myanmar's military, were aimed at constraining its 'ability to conduct airstrikes on civilians,' according to Britain. It said the month of August saw the highest number of airstrikes on record by the Myanmar military, killing dozens of civilians and amounting to 'gross human rights violations.' The sanctions — the latest by Western countries since a February 2021 military coup ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's government — target six entities involved in providing aviation fuel or restricted goods to the junta. They bolster several previous rounds of curbs against suppliers of aviation fuel to the military and arms dealers in 2023. 'The human rights violations taking place across Myanmar, including airstrikes on civilian infrastructure, by the Myanmar military is unacceptable and the impact on innocent civilians is intolerable,' junior U.K. foreign minister Catherine West said. 'That is why today the U.K. is announcing fresh sanctions targeting the suppliers of equipment and aviation fuel to the Myanmar military. 'Alongside the EU and Canada, we are today further constraining the military's access to funds, equipment and resources.' West added the U.K. remained 'steadfast in our support for the Myanmar people and their aspirations for a peaceful and democratic future.' The U.K.'s Foreign Office in London said Britain had provided more than $195 million in humanitarian assistance, health care, education and support for civil society and local communities in Myanmar since the 2021 coup. Over 3.4 million people have been displaced by the fighting, over 18 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, and Myanmar is now seeing 'a proliferation in serious and organized crime,' it added. The latest sanctions come as ethnic minority rebels and People's Defense Forces battling to overturn the junta's coup are riding the wave of a huge yearlong offensive. It has ejected the junta from around 50,000 square kilometers — an area roughly the size of Bosnia — according to analysts and an AFP tally, putting the rebels in sight of the former royal capital, Mandalay.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-eu-canada-unveil-new-sanctions-on-myanmar-military-/7843387.html	2024-10-29T08:26:24-07:00	
Singapore looks to Australian outback to power shift to sustainable energy	Singapore — Singapore is a step closer to importing solar energy from Australia via a huge undersea cable, after giving the green light to an ambitious project that could provide a solution to other countries that are trying to make the shift to renewables. Australian company Sun Cable plans to build a 4,300-kilometer subsea cable which will supply the Southeast Asian city-state with just under 10 percent of its energy needs. Solar energy will be sourced from a 12,400-hectare solar farm in Australia’s Northern Territory, with some of the electricity generated also supplying the state’s capital, Darwin. Singapore’s Energy Market Authority has granted conditional approval to Sun Cable, stating that the project is 'technically and commercially viable.' The current timeline for the Australia-Asia PowerLink sees the cable being fully operational by 2035. Singapore has been forced to look further afield for more environmentally friendly ways to meet its energy needs, largely due to a scarcity of available land. Philip Andrews-Speed, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said researchers in Singapore had investigated how much energy could be produced from solar panels in the country. 'It was building on reservoirs, it was building over car parks and building over motorways. They came up with a number, but it was nowhere near what is needed. 'It’s also difficult to do much with marine energy because the seas are so busy,' Andrews-Speed told VOA. The Southeast Asian financial hub plans to import around 6 gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035 and has conditional approvals in place with projects in Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam. It currently imports 100 megawatts of hydropower from Laos through a cross-border project that includes Malaysia and Thailand. Whilst Singapore has looked to its neighbors to import renewable energy, the Sun Cable project would be a significant step up in terms of scale and logistics. 'A grid connection for 4,200-kilometers subsea has never been done before and has never been remotely delivered on. It is a very aspirational, game-changing proposal,' said Tim Buckley, founder of the independent research group Climate Energy Finance. 'There are significant geopolitical, financial and technical obstacles to this project and any project that goes subsea,' Buckley told VOA. One of the major challenges facing Sun Cable is the depth and diversity of the waters that the cable will be running through. 'They need to figure out whether they will be passing through tectonically unstable undersea terrain,' said Victor Nian, co-founder and chief executive officer at the Centre for Strategic Energy and Resources. 'We know that Indonesia is sitting across the Pacific ring of fire, so if there are earthquakes or volcanic activity undersea, how would that impact the cable?' Nian told VOA. The sheer cost of the project has also proven problematic, with estimates coming in at $13.5 billion. Sun Cable ran into financial difficulties in January 2023, but was rescued by Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes. Even if the project does get off the ground, Singapore may be forced to pay a premium for the delivery of green energy, warns Buckley. 'Solar from the Northern Territory is very, very cheap, but by the time you deliver that to Singapore, it's exceptionally expensive because of the transmission costs.' Whilst there is still plenty of work to be done to make the Sun Cable vision a reality, similar projects have been completed elsewhere, although on a significantly smaller scale. The current largest subsea power cable runs 760 kilometers below the North Sea, servicing the United Kingdom with clean energy from wind turbines and solar panels in Denmark. It’s one of a number of cables linking the UK with Europe. 'They play a huge role in underpinning grid reliability and diversity and security of supply, and have played an absolutely central role in the UK shutting its last coal fired power plant,' said Buckley. Britain’s shift to renewables could further benefit from another ambitious subsea cable plan, with green energy sourced from a North African desert. 'The Xlinks project seeks to link renewable energy produced in Morocco with the United Kingdom via a 4000km subsea HVDC cable,' said Mutya Yustika, an energy finance specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, via email. The project is 'similar in scope and nature to Sun Cable' and would allow the UK to tap into 'abundant natural resources,' Yustika told VOA. Like Sun Cable, the Xlinks project faces numerous regulatory hurdles before work can begin, with a final decision to be made by the British government. Whilst these projects require cooperation among a small handful of countries, Buckley has voiced confidence that a global green energy power grid will one day be in operation. 'International grid connectivity will play a major role in helping to drive grid reliability, decarbonization and the optimization of matching energy generation to energy use.' Buckley sees Southeast Asia as one of the key starting points for a global grid, pointing to China’s involvement in the region. 'China Southern State Grid operates the Laos grid and they're underwriting the development of low-cost renewable energy.' This green energy can then be exported across the region, generating revenue for Laos where there is minimal domestic energy demand, says Buckley.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-looks-to-australian-outback-to-power-shift-to-sustainable-energy/7843331.html	2024-10-29T08:11:50-07:00	
Taliban publicly flog Afghan woman, 3 men amid UN outcry	ISLAMABAD — Taliban judicial officials said Tuesday that four people, including a woman, were publicly flogged in eastern Afghanistan for allegedly committing offenses such as 'illicit relations' and 'running away from home.' The United Nations has condemned such punishment being increasingly inflicted on Afghans under Taliban rule. The Supreme Court of the de facto radical Afghan rulers announced the latest punishments Tuesday, saying they were done in Nangarhar province after a local court sentenced the four 'criminals' to 39 lashes each. The Taliban’s top court reported earlier this week that five Afghans, including a woman, were flogged in public 39 times each in Parwan and Faryab provinces for committing acts that are considered crimes in Afghanistan, including adultery and homosexuality. It stated that the individuals were also sentenced to jail terms ranging from six months to one year. Since regaining power in 2021, Taliban leaders have imposed a criminal justice system in line with their strict interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia, leading to the public flogging of hundreds of Afghan men and women. This has drawn persistent outrage and calls from the U.N. to halt the practice for being in breach of international laws and human rights. Richard Bennett, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, has stated in his latest report, released Tuesday, that the use of corporal punishment by the Taliban amounts to 'torture and other ill-treatment.' Bennett documented an 'alarming increase' in such punishment since the beginning of 2024. He quoted the Taliban’s Supreme Court as reporting that 276 Afghans, including 46 women, were publicly punished between January and August. 'While the vast majority reported in the 80 official announcements were for crimes such as theft and adultery, individuals were also punished for ‘crimes’ such as sodomy, homosexuality, running away from home, and aiding a woman’s escape from home — underscoring the specific risks faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and other gender-diverse persons and cisgender women,' the U.N. envoy reported. Bennet said that the Taliban publicly flogged 63 people, including 15 women, in a single day in June, saying each person was lashed 15 to 39 times. He questioned the enforcement of the criminal justice system by the Taliban, saying that the situation is worsened by the absence of legal protections, including access to lawyers and denying other due process rights. 'There are credible reports of courts in several provinces denying defendants, including children, access to their lawyers,' Bennett said. The report also detailed an alarming rise in cases of sexual violence against Afghan women in Taliban custody. The Taliban defend their policies, including restrictions on Afghan women’s access to employment and work, saying their governance is in line with the Sharia. They reject international criticism of the Taliban government as an interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate ruler of the war-torn, impoverished South Asian nation, citing human rights concerns and the treatment of Afghan women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-publicly-flog-afghan-woman-3-men-amid-un-outcry/7843308.html	2024-10-29T07:38:35-07:00	
Japanese nuclear reactor which survived earthquake restarts	Tokyo — A Japanese nuclear reactor which survived a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear power plant was restarted Tuesday for the first time since the disaster after a safety upgrade, as the government pursues a renewed expansion of nuclear energy to provide stable power and reduce carbon emissions. The No. 2 reactor at the Onagawa nuclear power plant on Japan's northern coast was put back online and is expected to start generating power in early November, operator Tohoku Electric Power Co. said. The reactor is one of the three at the Onagawa plant, which is 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of the Fukushima Daiichi plant where three reactors melted following a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, releasing large amounts of radiation. The Onagawa plant was hit by a 13-meter (42-foot) tsunami but was able to keep its crucial cooling systems functioning in all three reactors and achieve their safe shutdowns. All of Japan's 54 commercial nuclear power plants were shut down after the Fukushima disaster for safety checks and upgrades. Onagawa No. 2 is the 13th of the 33 still useable reactors to return to operation. It is also the first restart in Japan of the same type of reactor damaged in Fukushima. Tohoku Electric President Kojiro Higuchi said the reactor's restart highlights the area's recovery from the disaster. Last year, Japan's government adopted a plan to maximize use of nuclear energy, including accelerating restarts of closed reactors, extending the operational life of aging plants, and developing next-generation reactors, as the country struggles to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. 'Nuclear energy, along with renewables, is an important power source for decarbonization,' Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said Tuesday. 'We will maximize its use while ensuring safety.' Restarting nuclear reactors is also increasingly important for Japan's economic growth, Hayashi said. Concern about the government's revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan's Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. Minor damage was reported at two nuclear facilities and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate. For the Onagawa No. 2 reactor, Tohoku Electric in 2013 began upgrading its safety, including tsunami risk estimates and anti-quake measures. It also built an anti-tsunami wall extending up to 29 meters (95 feet) above sea level, and obtained safety approval from regulators in 2020. Twenty-one of Japan's nuclear reactors, including six at Fukushima Daiichi and one at Onagawa, are currently being decommissioned because their operators chose to scrap them instead of investing large amounts for additional safety equipment required under the much-stricter post-Fukushima safety standards.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japanese-nuclear-reactor-which-survived-earthquake-restarts-/7843281.html	2024-10-29T06:57:30-07:00	
Cryptocurrency promoters on X amplify China-aligned disinformation	Washington — A China-linked disinformation operation is using so-called 'Spamouflage' networks to ramp up Beijing’s propaganda aimed at social media users in the West who regularly promote cryptocurrency-related content on X. Spamouflage accounts are bots pretending to be authentic users that promote narratives that align with Beijing’s talking points issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s human rights record, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza. The cryptocurrency accounts were discovered by a joint investigation between VOA Mandarin and DoubleThink Lab, a Taiwan-based social media analytics firm. DoubleThink Lab’s analysis uncovered 1,153 accounts that primarily repost news and promotions about cryptocurrency and are likely bots deployed by engagement boosting services to raise their clients’ visibility on social media. The findings suggest that some official Chinese X accounts and the Spamouflage operation have been using the same amplification services, which further indicate the link between the Chinese state and Spamouflage. Beijing has repeatedly denied any attempts to spread disinformation in the United States and other countries. From cryptocurrency to Spamouflage A review of the accounts in the VOA-DTL investigation shows that the majority of the posts were about cryptocurrency. Users regularly repost content from some of the biggest cryptocurrency accounts on X, such as ChainGPT and LondonRealTV, which belongs to British podcaster Brian Rose. But these accounts have also shared content from at least 17 Spamouflage accounts that VOA and DTL have been tracking. VOA recently reported on Spamouflage networks’ adoption of antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories. Spamouflage was first detected by the U.S.-based social media analytic firm Graphika, who coined the name because the operation’s political posts were interspersed with innocuous but spam-like content such as TikTok videos and scenery photographs that camouflage the operation’s goal of influencing public opinions. All cryptocurrency accounts have reposted content from a Spamouflage account named 'Watermelon cloth' at least once. A review of the account revealed that 'Watermelon cloth' regularly posted content critical of social inequalities in the United States, the Ukrainian and Israeli governments, and praised China’s economic achievements and leadership role in solving international issues. In one post, the account peddled the conspiracy theory that Washington was developing biological weapons in Ukraine. 'The outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian war brought out an ‘unspeakable secret’ in the United States. US biological laboratory in Ukraine exposed,' the post said. X recently suspended Watermelon cloth’s account. Since Watermelon cloth’s first posting in March 2023, its content has been reposted nearly 2,600 times, half of which were by the cryptocurrency accounts. Most of the remaining reposts were either by Spamouflage or other botlike accounts, according to data collected by DoubleThink Lab. The investigation also found that the cryptocurrency accounts’ amplification on average almost tripled the view number of a post. Robotic behavior All 1,153 cryptocurrency accounts have demonstrated patterns that strongly suggest they are bots instead of human users. They were created in batches on specific dates. On April 6 alone, 152 of them were registered on X. Over 99% of their content were reposts. A study of their repost behaviors on September 24 shows that all the reposts took place within the first hour after the original content was posted. Within each wave of reposts, all took place within six seconds, an indication of coordinated action. At least one such account offered engagement boosting services in its bio with two Telegram links for interested customers. VOA Mandarin contacted the service seller through the links but did not receive a response. Chinese official accounts amplified The cryptocurrency group has also promoted posts from Chinese official accounts, including several that belong to Chinese local governments, state media and at least one Chinese diplomat. The Jinan International Communication Center was the third most amplified account whose posts the cryptocurrency groups have shared. Its content was reposted over 2,200 times. The Jinan International Communication Center was established in 2022 to promote the history and culture of Jinan, capital of the Shandong province in Eastern China, to the rest of the world as part of Beijing’s 'Tell China’s Story Well' propaganda initiative. A local state media account boasted in an article last year that Jinan was the third most influential Chinese city on X, which was then called Twitter. Other Chinese cities, including Xiamen and Ningbo, and provinces, such as Anhui and Jilin, had their official accounts amplified by the cryptocurrency group. Other amplified accounts include Xi’s Moments, a state media project propagating Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s speeches and official activities; China Retold, a media group organized by pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong; and the English-language state-owned newspaper China Daily. Zhang Heqing, a cultural counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, was the sole Chinese diplomat whose posts were promoted by the cryptocurrency group. DoubleThink Lab wrote in an analysis of the data and findings that Chinese official accounts and the Spamouflage operation have 'likely' used the same content boosting services, which explains why they were amplified by the same group of cryptocurrency accounts. The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., declined to answer specific questions about what appears to be a connection between the cryptocurrency group, Chinese official accounts and Spamouflage. But in a written statement, spokesperson Liu Pengyu rejected the notion that China has used disinformation campaigns to influence social media users in the U.S. 'Such allegations are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes,' the statement said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cryptocurrency-promoters-on-x-amplify-china-aligned-disinformation/7843243.html	2024-10-29T06:56:07-07:00	
Nigeria praises CAF decision in controversy over Libya's treatment of Nigerian footballers	Abuja, Nigeria — Africa's football governing body has sided with Nigeria in that country's dispute with Libya over a canceled qualifying game. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) awarded Nigeria a 3-0 victory over Libya following accusations Libya deliberately breached competition guidelines. Libya's football federation is appealing. The decision by the CAF puts Nigeria at the top of their division, Group D, and in contention for a spot at next year's Africa Cup of Nations, or AFCON, finals, in Morocco. The CAF on Saturday said Libya violated a rule that mandates that host nations receive and manage the logistics of visiting teams. The body also ordered Libya to pay a fine of $50,000 within 60 days. On October 15, Nigerian players returned home rather than play what would have been a qualifying match in Libya. They were protesting long delays at an airport about 250 kilometers away from the venue after their charter flight was unexpectedly diverted. Some news reports say the players were delayed by about 16 hours. Nigerian football fan Elvis Ume welcomed the CAF's decision. 'I think justice was served because the truth of the matter is that they genuinely put our players' lives in danger,' he said 'It was extremely malicious on their part. In my opinion they got off lightly. I think CAF could still have been a bit more firm in their decision for it to serve a sort of a deterrent to other countries.' But the Libya Football Federation, or LFF, denies deliberately trying to dampen the morale of the Nigerian Super Eagles players and has appealed the decision. Libya called the CAF's decision unjust and malicious. The federation accused the Nigerian team of using the reputation of its players - who are team members of various European leagues - to win global support on the matter. The LFF said its players faced similar challenges in Nigeria days earlier and that the situation is not unique to African football leagues. Sports analysts say common tricks may include immigration delays, lengthy trips or allocation of poor training facilities. 'When you look at antecedents, the North Africans especially Libya, Morocco, Egypt, they're known for this 'gamesmanship,'' said Nigerian sports analyst Bunmi Haruna. 'I think in Europe they call it the 'dark act.' This is the chance for CAF to let the whole world know ... it's not good for our football in any way.' Haruna said the CAF must continue to uphold this standard. 'I think it's a very good step from CAF and I hope it's not just going to be a one-off because these things happen even in club football. They want to go and appeal, which is good in terms of testing the laws.' It is very unlikely that the CAF will reverse its decision, but many will be watching to see the outcome of Libya's appeal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-praises-caf-decision-in-controversy-over-libya-s-treatment-of-nigerian-footballers/7843283.html	2024-10-29T06:55:56-07:00	
Chad president launches operation to fight Boko Haram after attack kills over 40 troops	Yaounde — Chad's President Mahama Idriss Deby has launched a security operation to track and neutralize several hundred Boko Haram fighters who attacked and killed on Sunday more than 40 Chad government troops in the Lake Chad Basin, shared by Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger and Chad. Deby visited the area on Monday and assisted in the burial of his soldiers. Chad state TV reports that President Mhamat Idriss Deby has ordered that flags be flown at half-mast and that all radio and tv stations in the central African states should play only religious music for three days from October 28 at midnight. Deby announced on Monday the three days of national mourning after visiting Ngouboua, a western village in Lake Chad, on the island of Bakaram, near the border with Nigeria where Boko Haram fighters killed at least 40 Chad government troops on Sunday night, according to Chad state TV. Videos of Deby dressed in a military uniform and present at the burial of soldiers killed have been broadcast several times since Monday by local TV stations, including Chad state TV. After the burials, Deby announced the launch of 'Haskanite,' a military operation with fresh troops deployed to Lake Chad, to search out and eliminate members of the terror group hiding in the large area. Deby spoke on Chad state TV. He said as president of Chad, he is the supreme commander of government troops and guarantor of the security and safety of civilians, and that he has ordered Chad's military to protect civilians and their property by tracking and eliminating Boko Haram terrorists who committed atrocious acts on government troops and are hiding in the vast Lake Chad. Chad officials note that Haskanite is a strong and resilient plant that grows in deserts and in the Lake Chad area. The deployed government troops are experienced and have the equipment necessary to defeat the jihadists, Deby said. Chad military officials say they estimate the number of soldiers in the jihadist attacking force was 300 and that the surprise assault came Sunday at around 10 pm. In addition to the 40 deaths, several dozen government soldiers were injured, they said. Scores of the attackers were killed and the fighters succeeded to escape with some dead bodies and seized weapons according to Chad's military. Many civilians either died or were injured in the attack, Chad military says. Deby ordered that all civilians and troops receive medical care free of charge. Chad's military says the heavily armed jihadist fighters took control of the garrison before torching vehicles, motorcycles and buildings equipped with heavy arms. The attackers disappeared in the waters of lake Chad and surrounding villages. Saibou Issa, a conflict resolution specialist at Cameroon’s University of Maroua, says it will be difficult for Chad to singlehandedly fight the jihadists in Lake Chad. Issa says it is obvious that poverty and hardship push Boko Haram fighters who either surrendered or were weakened by the firepower of forces from Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger to rejoin smaller jihadist groups in Lake Chad. He says Lake Chad, which serves as a hideout for jihadist groups, is vast and only joint efforts from states that share the lake can stop militants, who are becoming more active. Issa spoke on Cameroon state Radio on Tuesday. He said the militants attack mainly for supplies and seize weapons from both armed groups and government troops in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. Chad's government says it has informed the Multinational Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, or MNJTF — made up of 11,000 troops and rescue workers from Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria — to assist in a renewed push against the terror group. VOA could not independently verify if troops of MNJTF have been deployed, but Cameroon says its military is alert. The United Nations says over 40,000 people have been killed and 3 million have fled their homes in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad. since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants degenerated into an armed conflict and spread to Cameroon, Niger and Chad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-president-launches-vast-operation-to-fight-boko-haram-after-attack-kills-over-40-troops-/7843203.html	2024-10-29T05:59:39-07:00

Gunmen kill 5 workers at southwest Pakistan dam	ISLAMABAD — Officials in Pakistan's violence-stricken Balochistan province said Tuesday that gunmen attacked workers at the site of a dam, killing five and wounding two others. The deadly shooting occurred in the Panjgur district of the sparsely populated Pakistani province renowned for its abundant natural resources. Residents reported that the assailants fled the scene on motorcycles immediately after the attack. A provincial government spokesperson, Shahid Rind, confirmed casualties, saying district authorities launched an investigation into the attack. The two injured men and bodies have been transferred to a local hospital, he said. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the violence in Balochistan, where several separatist groups are active and routinely target Pakistani security forces as well as government installations. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned Tuesday’s attack. 'Those who attacked the personnel working on the dam are enemies of the development in Pakistan and Balochistan,' Sharif’s office in Islamabad quoted him as saying. Earlier this month, heavily armed assailants stormed a coal mine in the impoverished province’s Duki district and killed 21 coal workers. The Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, has been blamed for or claimed most of the recent attacks. The insurgent group, listed as a global terrorist organization by the United States, claims to be fighting for the province’s independence. The BLA also took credit for a suicide car bombing in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in early October that officials said resulted in the deaths of two Chinese engineers and several local security personnel. Separately, gunmen killed a police officer Tuesday in an attack targeting a health office in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where polio vaccination teams had gathered as part of an ongoing national immunization campaign. The deadly shooting in the Orakzai district prompted authorities to suspend the anti-polio drive in the area. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but provincial authorities suspected Islamist insurgents could be behind it. Militants active in the area have previously targeted polio teams and their police escorts, suspecting them of spying for the government. The attack on polio workers comes as the number of active paralytic poliovirus cases in Pakistan surged drastically to 41 this year, up from only six in 2023. Meanwhile, Russia’s embassy in Islamabad said on its social media platform X that it was 'verifying reports about the alleged abduction of a Russian citizen' in the Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A report in The Moscow Times has identified the missing man as a tourist cyclist and a resident of the city of St. Petersburg. Pakistani officials have not commented on the reported abduction being claimed by militants loyal to the banned Pakistani Taliban outfit. Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, both sit on the border with Afghanistan, have experienced almost daily militant attacks. The violence has killed more than 1,000 Pakistani civilians and security forces this year alone, according to the Islamabad-based independent Center for Research and Security Studies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-kill-five-workers-at-southwest-pakistan-dam-/7843153.html	2024-10-29T04:52:36-07:00	
Sudan's RSF, allies sexually abused victims from 8-75 years, UN mission says	Geneva — Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allies have committed 'staggering' levels of sexual abuse, raping civilians as troops advance and abducting some women as sex slaves during the more than 18-month war, a U.N. mission said on Tuesday. Victims have ranged between eight and 75 years, said the U.N. fact-finding mission's report, with most sexual violence committed by the RSF and allied Arab militia in an attempt to terrorize and punish people for perceived links to enemies. 'The sheer scale of sexual violence we have documented in Sudan is staggering,' said mission chair Mohamed Chande Othman in a statement accompanying an 80-page report based on interviews with victims, families and witnesses. The report echoed investigations by Reuters and rights groups into widespread sexual abuse in the conflict. The RSF, which is fighting Sudan's army, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has previously said it would investigate allegations and bring perpetrators to justice. The paramilitary RSF has roots in so-called Janjaweed militias, which helped the military crush a rebellion in Sudan's western Darfur region two decades ago. In the current conflict, the RSF has seized control of large parts of Sudan including in West Darfur where it is accused of carrying out ethnic killings against the Masalit people with the help of Arab militias. The U.N. mission said racist slurs against non-Arabs in parts of West Darfur state were widely used during sexual attacks, indicating ethnicity targeting. Forced impregnation One victim from El Geneina in West Darfur said her rapist told her at gunpoint: 'We will make you, the Masalit girls, give birth to Arab children,' the report said. In another case, a West Darfur woman was held captive for over eight months by RSF guards and impregnated by her main captor during repeated rapes, it added. In four other incidents, women were taken from the street before being beaten and raped then released or abandoned unconscious on the street. Perpetrators mostly wore either RSF uniforms or scarves concealing their faces, victims said. The report said it had documented a smaller number of sexual violence cases involving the Sudanese army, with more investigation needed. It also said it had credible reports that both warring parties had recruited child soldiers. Last month, the mission found that both the army and RSF had committed major abuses like torture and arbitrary arrests. Though pushed out of global headlines by the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts, Sudan's war has created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, with thousands killed, more than 11 million uprooted, widespread hunger and involvement of foreign powers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-rsf-and-allies-sexually-abused-victims-from-8-75-years-un-mission-says-/7843151.html	2024-10-29T04:43:56-07:00	
Trump ally Steve Bannon is released after serving 4 months in prison for contempt of Congress	DANBURY, Conn. — Longtime Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon was released from prison early Tuesday, after serving a four-month sentence for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Bannon left the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, according to Kristie Breshears, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Prisons. He planned to hold a news conference later in the day in Manhattan, his representatives said. He's also expected to resume his podcast Tuesday. Bannon, 70, reported to the prison July 1 after the Supreme Court rejected his bid to delay the prison sentence while he appeals his conviction. A jury found Bannon guilty in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and a second for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement Trump's efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race. When he began serving his sentence in July, Bannon called himself a 'political prisoner.' 'I am proud of going to prison,' he said at the time, adding that he was standing up Attorney General Merrick Garland and a 'corrupt' Justice Department. Trump, a Republican, is seeking to regain the presidency in next week's election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. A federal appeals court panel upheld Bannon's convictions in May. Bannon is now asking the full appeals court to hear his case. His legal team had argued that the congressional subpoena was invalid because Trump had asserted executive privilege. Prosecutors, though, say Bannon had left the White House years before and Trump had never invoked executive privilege in front of the committee. Bannon faces additional criminal charges in New York state court, alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges. A trial in that case is scheduled to begin in December.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-ally-steve-bannon-is-released-after-serving-4-months-in-prison-for-contempt-of-congress-/7843149.html	2024-10-29T04:37:20-07:00	
Saudi energy minister commits to crude capacity levels and climate targets	RIYADH — Saudi Arabia is 'committed' to maintaining crude capacity at 12.3 million barrels per day, Energy Minister Prince Abulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh, he said the world's largest oil exporter would maintain its crude targets while also pursuing its climate aims. 'We will monetize every molecule of energy this land has, period,' Prince Abdulaziz said. That policy would be carried out hand in hand with other goals, such as emission reduction, he added. 'We are committed to maintaining 12.3 million (barrels per day) of crude capacity and we are proud of that,' he said. He was speaking ahead of an announcement, expected on Tuesday, about a carbon credit exchange involving the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund. Saudi Arabia backed a deal at last year's U.N. climate conference, COP28, giving countries more leeway to follow their own pathways to cleaner sources of energy. More than 100 countries had lobbied at that summit, held in the United Arab Emirates, for the 'phase out' of fossil fuels, but faced opposition from the Saudi-led oil producer group OPEC, which argued that the world can cut emissions without shunning specific fuels. 'We are not ashamed of our record when it comes to emissions,' Prince Abdulaziz told the FII conference. 'We are proud of it, but the pundits try to create a smoke screen not to allow us to be on the so-called higher moral ground.' He also said Saudi Arabia would update its national climate pledge under the Paris Agreement to raise its target. 'We ensure we will have a refreshed NDC [Nationally Determined Contribution] next year, and I can guarantee you out of knowing the number will be higher.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kingdom-commits-to-daily-crude-capacity-/7843136.html	2024-10-29T04:30:26-07:00	
Germany recalls ambassador to Iran over execution of German-Iranian national	Berlin — Germany has recalled its ambassador to Iran over the reported execution of German-Iranian national Jamshid Sharmahd and summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires to voice Berlin's protest against the killing, the German foreign office said on Tuesday. 'We have sent our strongest protest against the actions of the Iranian regime & reserve the right to take further action,' the foreign ministry said in a post on X. Germany's ambassador in Tehran demarched to the Iranian foreign minister and protested in the strongest possible terms the murder of Jamshid Sharmahd, the post said, adding that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock subsequently recalled the ambassador to Berlin for consultations. Iran executed Iranian-German national Jamshid Sharmahd after he was convicted of carrying out terrorist attacks, Iranian state media said on Monday. Sharmahd, who also holds U.S. residency, was sentenced to death in 2023 on charges of 'corruption on earth,' a capital offence under Iran's Islamic laws. He was accused by Iran of heading a pro-monarchist group accused of a deadly 2008 bombing and planning other attacks in the country. His daughter Gazelle Sharmahd, also on X, demanded proof for his execution and called for the immediate return of her father.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-recalls-ambassador-to-iran-over-execution-of-german-iranian-national/7843128.html	2024-10-29T04:17:54-07:00	
Human Rights Watch: At least 11 killed in Mozambique vote protests	Johannesburg, South Africa — Police in Mozambique killed at least 11 people and injured more than 50 others in violence after a disputed presidential election this month, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Tuesday. Protests have rocked the southern African nation since Daniel Chapo, candidate of the ruling Frelimo party that has held power since 1975, was announced winner of the October 9 election. Hundreds of opposition supporters took to the streets last week, leading to clashes with riot police. 'Mozambique security forces killed at least 11 people,' HRW said in a statement, adding that 'over 50 people suffered serious gunshot wounds' on October 24 and 25. Eight police were also reportedly injured, the rights group said. HRW said it interviewed 22 people, including victims, witnesses, physicians, journalists, government officials and civil society groups. 'Many, including children as young as one year old, inhaled tear gas that the police fired indiscriminately into residential areas,' the rights group said. HRW said it had been told by one doctor that he treated dozens of injured people and one victim had 'a bullet in his spine.' 'Mozambican authorities should promptly and impartially investigate alleged misuse of force and hold those responsible accountable,' said Allan Ngari, Africa advocacy director at HRW. A local NGO, the Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD), also counted at least 11 people killed in the violence, including six in Nampula province. More than 450 people were arrested, including 370 in Maputo, CDD said in a statement on Sunday, adding that at least 85 had since been released. Police have not commented on the reports by CDD and HRW but previously said that 20 people had been injured in the protests. Police also told AFP that one person had been killed in Nampula while another died in Niassa, without giving further details. Mozambique's electoral commission said Chapo won the presidential election with 71 percent of votes, while the main opposition candidate Venancio Mondlane, backed by the small Podemos party, received 20 percent. On Monday, Podemos filed a lawsuit demanding a recount of votes. Election observers noted serious flaws before, during and after the vote. European Union election observers were among those who noted 'irregularities during counting and unjustified alteration of election results at polling station and district level.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-watch-at-least-11-killed-in-mozambique-vote-protests/7843119.html	2024-10-29T04:08:11-07:00	
Saudi 'Davos in the desert' opens with region on war footing	Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — Global business leaders gathered in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for a glitzy investor forum as conflict shakes the region and skepticism mounts over the Gulf kingdom's most ambitious development projects. The Future Investment Initiative (FII) debuted in 2017 as a showcase for de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's dream of diversifying the economy of the world's largest crude exporter away from oil. This year's three-day event is expected to draw more than 7,000 delegates including TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and the chief executives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. It kicked off with a performance by South African opera singers and remarks from Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, about the kingdom's attempts to be a leader in artificial intelligence and the energy transition. But for the second year in a row, conflict in the Middle East was sure to shape panel discussions and side meetings. Last year's FII took place just weeks after Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel triggered the war in Gaza, with high-level speakers warning about economic turmoil should the fighting draw in other countries. A year later those fears have been realized, as Israel presses operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon and carries out tit-for-tat strikes with Iran. Muhammad al-Jasser, chairman of the Islamic Development Bank, told a panel on Tuesday that the Gulf region was 'a bright spot in the region' but that the ongoing wars have been a drag on growth. 'The potential that was sitting there waiting to be cultivated is evaporating with all these conflicts and this level of uncertainty,' he said. 'Show must go on' While most speakers refrained from overtly political messages, American economist Jeffrey Sachs used his speaking slot to issue a full-throated call for the establishment of a Palestinian state. 'Why is there war in Gaza and in Lebanon and possibly spreading to Iran and further in this region? Because there's no state of Palestine, obviously,' he said. 'Because Israel blocks it, the United States blocks it, and until there is, there's going to be no peace in the region.' FII Institute CEO Richard Attias told a press conference in Riyadh this month that the gathering is not meant to focus on 'politics' and should instead tackle big-picture investments 'to build a better world.' 'We are an independent platform and we don't want to be, forgive me for the word, polluted by any political events,' said Attias, former producer of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 'I am curating events for 35 years now, and I learnt one thing: The show must go on.' On Tuesday Attias announced that this year's FII would be his last as CEO of the institute. 'Doubters beware' This year's FII, sometimes referred to as 'Davos in the Desert', also comes as Saudi officials try to demonstrate progress on signature elements of Prince Mohammed's Vision 2030 reform agenda. Authorities have reportedly scaled back 2030 size and population targets for NEOM, a planned futuristic megacity in northwest Saudi Arabia meant to feature a ski resort and twin skyscrapers 170 kilometers (105 miles) long. On Sunday, NEOM announced the opening of its 'first physical showcase', a luxury Red Sea island known as Sindalah featuring restaurants, hotels and yachting berths. 'There was so much skepticism over NEOM in the Western media that the Saudis had to do something to demonstrate their commitment,' said Jim Krane of Rice University's Baker Institute. 'The early opening at NEOM is probably designed to embarrass the naysayers by telling the world that Saudi Arabia is moving ahead. It's a 'doubters beware' message.' Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in May that 'shocks' including the war in Gaza were prompting officials to 'reprioritize' some aspects of Vision 2030. At a briefing with journalists in December last year, Jadaan said officials had decided to push the timeframe for some major projects past 2030, though he did not provide details and also noted that others would be accelerated. Saudi Arabia has enacted a series of oil cuts since 2022 in a bid to hike prices and is currently producing around nine million barrels per day, well below its declared capacity of 12 million bpd. Last month, the finance ministry said it anticipated a budget deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2025, citing increased government spending and lower oil revenues. Additional spending commitments meanwhile continue to pile up for events such as Expo 2030 and the 2034 World Cup, for which Saudi Arabia is the sole bidder.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-davos-in-the-desert-opens-with-region-on-war-footing-/7843105.html	2024-10-29T03:54:29-07:00	
Adidas reaches out-of-court settlement with rapper Ye	London — Adidas has reached an out-of-court settlement with rapper Ye to end all legal proceedings between them, the sportswear brand said on Tuesday, adding that no money changed hands in the agreement. Adidas and Ye had been embroiled in multiple lawsuits for the past two years, since the German company ended a partnership with the rapper previously known as Kanye West over antisemitic comments he made. 'There isn't any more open issues, and there is no... money going either way, and we both move on,' CEO Bjorn Gulden told reporters on a conference call, declining to give further details of the deal. 'There were tensions on many issues, and... when you put the claims on the right side and you put the claims on the left side, both parties said we don't need to fight anymore and withdrew all the claims,' Gulden added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/adidas-reaches-out-of-court-settlement-with-rapper-ye-/7843091.html	2024-10-29T03:41:57-07:00	
Malaysian landslide victims sue, accusing officials of negligence	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — Survivors and family members of campers killed in a 2022 landslide at an agritourism farm in Malaysia have filed a lawsuit contending the disaster was caused by negligence – not only excessive rainfall as an earlier government report concluded. 'We want this lawsuit to bring to the public’s attention the real reasons why this tragedy happened,' said Tan Ei Ein, whose 7-year-old son, Zech, was killed in the landslide. The government 'is trying to save itself from trouble by blaming it on nature,' Tan told VOA, describing the report as a 'whitewash.' 'That way nobody needs to take any accountability,' Tan said. In December 2022, the earth swept over tents at a campsite on Father’s Organic Farm in in the rural community of Batang Kali, in Selangor state, about 50 kilometers north of Kuala Lumpur. The landslide left 31 people dead, including 13 children. Some of the 61 survivors had serious injuries. Disputing the cause Last year, the federal government issued a report on the tragedy that said the landslide was triggered by slope failure after unusually high rainfall over a period of weeks. The report said there was no strong evidence that human activity was a contributing factor. The report did not address standing questions about why a farm and campsite were able to operate in what experts call a risky location and did not mention an environmental assessment approved by a federal agency a decade earlier that said the area where the farm and campsite were located should not be developed. While the lawsuit also said rainfall was a significant factor behind the landslide, it additionally accused the state and local governments of multiple failures and said the property owner and farm operator also made careless missteps. Those entities, along with a state agency, a government-linked company and another private company, are targets of the lawsuit. No federal agencies are being sued. The landslide started downhill from a state government road on a section of a hill where there was a manmade embankment before striking the farm and campsite below. The lawsuit blames the Selangor state government’s public works department for shoddy construction when the embankment was built, which increased the likelihood of a landslide. The lawsuit also accuses the state public works department and Infrasel, a private road work company contracted by the state, of not conducting proper safety testing and necessary maintenance on the embankment. 'The government’s public report says that there was no one to blame but, more or less, an act of God, the rainfall caused the tragedy,' Teckwyn Lim, a geographer and honorary associate professor at the University of Nottingham Malaysia, told VOA. Lim is part of a team of scientists, lawyers and a geotechnical engineer who investigated the tragedy for the plaintiffs. 'What we are saying is that ‘no, it was actually the result of negligence from the authorities and also the landowners. If the people in charge, if the government had been doing its job, then those lives wouldn’t have been lost,’' Lim said. The government report did not blame any agency or private company, saying slope and road maintenance were conducted on a regular schedule. Development of the property Father’s Organic Farm was on property owned by Malaysia Botanical Gardens Resort. Last year, VOA reported that Kong Yew Foong and his father Kong Hon Kong, who also goes by the name David Kong, were listed in Companies Commission of Malaysia records as directors at Malaysia Botanical Gardens Resort. Earlier this year, Forbes listed David Kong’s net worth at $825 million. The lawsuit points to an environmental impact assessment (EIA) approved by the Department of Environment in 2013 that said the area where the farm and campsite were located was not to be developed. VOA was first to report on the existence of this EIA about one month after the landslide. In January 2023 correspondence with VOA, Malaysia’s Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change wrote: 'The area of which Father’s Organic Farm was built had been determined as a No-Go Area. Therefore, the development of Father’s Organic Farm was in violation of the approval conditions of the EIA report approved to Malaysia Botanical Gardens Resort.' But the assessment was not addressed in the government’s landslide report. 'The fact that the government report makes no mention of the EIA suggests that they wanted to cover it up,' said Lim. 'The 2013 EIA says the site should’ve been kept as forest land and the implication was that’s because the site was too sensitive to develop, meaning it’s unsafe to develop.' The suit also accuses the campsite operator and the property owner of negligence for not following regulations because the farm and campsite were allegedly run without the appropriate business license, development permits and engineering approvals. The lawsuit says the local municipal council should have closed the campsite down for not following regulations. The plaintiffs also blame owners for clearing land and removing trees below the embankment, which they said might have kept the landslide from reaching the campsite. The lawsuit does not specify a figure for compensation for the families of the victims who were killed. The defendants listed in the lawsuit are BL Agro, which the plaintiffs say is the new name of the business that owned and operated Father’s Organic Farm and the campsite; Malaysia Botanical Gardens Resort; Selangor state public works department; Infrasel, a private road work company contracted by the state of Selangor; the Hulu Selangor Municipal Council; the state government of Selangor and the Selangor State Agricultural Development Corporation. VOA left messages for Amirudin Shari, who serves as the equivalent of a chief minister for Selangor state, but has not received a response. Amirudin Shari is not a defendant. VOA has also not received responses to its inquiries from representatives of the other defendants. 'We want accountability,' said Loh Teng Shui, the father of 7-year-old landslide victim Zech. 'So far no one has been held accountable and we want the full truth to come out.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysian-landslide-victims-sue-accusing-officials-of-negligence/7843056.html	2024-10-29T02:17:59-07:00	
Israeli strike kills at least 55 in northern Gaza, health officials say	Palestinian health officials said an Israeli airstrike Tuesday hit a five-story residential building in northern Gaza, killing at least 55 people. The strike happened in Beit Lahiya where officials said there were people believed to be trapped under rubble left by the attack. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticized legislation passed by the Israeli parliament banning the main U.N. aid agency for the Palestinians, UNRWA. The law is set to go into effect in 90 days, which Guterres said 'could have devastating consequences' for Palestinian refugees. In a statement late Monday, Guterres called on Israel to uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law and said national legislation 'cannot alter those obligations.' 'The implementation of these laws would be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for peace and security in the region as a whole. As I said before, UNRWA is indispensable,' Guterres said. UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement Monday that the bill 'sets a dangerous precedent.' 'This is the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role towards providing human-development assistance and services to Palestine Refugees,' he wrote on social media platform X. Israel has accused dozens of UNRWA staffers of being members of Hamas and some of participating in the October 7, 2023, terror attacks. UNRWA says it has taken action against about a dozen employees that Israel provided evidence about regarding their involvement with the terror group. However, in dozens of other cases, UNRWA has received either insufficient or no evidence from Israeli authorities. United Nations Security Council members urged Israel and Iran on Monday to end their spiraling cycle of tit-for-tat attacks on one another, following Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran. 'All sides must exercise restraint. No good can come of pouring more fuel on the flames of this escalating cycle of violence,' said British Ambassador Barbara Woodward. Iran’s foreign minister requested the Security Council meet in an emergency session following an early Saturday wave of airstrikes by Israel that struck missile factories in three Iranian provinces. Council members Algeria, China and Russia supported Tehran’s request. 'Now West Jerusalem is trying to involve Iran in confrontation -- Iran, which is showing unprecedented restraint under the circumstances,' Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, referring to Israel. Russia is a close ally of Iran. 'It is very difficult not to have the impression that West Jerusalem is intentionally raising tensions, despite the signals from Tehran that they are ready to refrain from further spiraling confrontation,' he added, referring to Israel. 'It is our view that such aggressive actions on the part of Israel are aimed at further stoking the flames of war, are unacceptable and need to stop.' Israel’s strikes came weeks after Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel amid Israel’s wars with Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the Israeli strikes 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for retaliation. It was Israel's first open attack on its archenemy’s territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the attacks achieved Israel’s goals, including harming Iran’s defense capabilities and its ability to produce missiles. His envoy told the Security Council that Israel’s response was 'measured and proportionate,' but warned of stiff consequences if provoked again. 'To Iran’s leaders, take this as a warning: Israel has shown restraint. But from here on, you will see only strength,' Danny Danon said. 'Any further aggression will be met with consequences that are swift and decisive.' Iran’s envoy accused Israel of violating international law and the U.N. Charter and said Washington’s support had emboldened it to attack its neighbors. 'Regrettably, unwavering and unconditional support provided by the United States to Israel, coupled with its obstruction of the Security Council mandate as a permanent member, has emboldened Israel to persist in its crimes and aggression in Gaza and Lebanon, and now against Iran, gravely undermining regional peace and security,' said Amir Saeed Iravani. He urged the Security Council to respond with 'firm and dissolute action' and condemn Israel’s actions. U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Washington does not want to see further escalation and she delivered messages to both parties. 'Today, the United States’ message for Israel remains clear: We will always help secure its people and territory from Iran and its terrorist proxies and partners,' she said. 'Our message for Iran remains clear, as well: Should it choose to undertake further aggressive acts against Israel or U.S. personnel in the region, there will be severe consequences. We will not hesitate to act in self-defense.' Gaza cease-fire Israel said Monday that David Barnea, the head of the Mossad spy agency, had returned from talks in Doha with his U.S. CIA counterpart, William Burns, and the Qatari premier, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, where they discussed a new 'framework' for a Gaza hostage release deal. 'During the meeting, the parties discussed a new unified framework that combines previous proposals and also takes into account key issues and recent developments in the region,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. 'In the coming days, discussions will continue between the mediators and Hamas to assess the feasibility of talks and to further efforts to promote a deal.' U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Monday, 'We need a cease-fire. This war should end.' Hamas and Hezbollah are U.S.-designated terror groups. The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, while the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people.

The potential impact of Trump’s tariff proposal	Former U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed sweeping tariffs if elected for a second term: a 20% universal tax and 60% tax on goods from China. He argues that the policy will help create jobs, shrink the national debt and boost government revenue for public services, such as child care. Most economists, however, agree that it is ultimately U.S. consumers who will pay more. Economists also warn of unintended ripple effects that could do more harm than good to the U.S. economy. This explainer video explores how increased tariffs might affect U.S. buyers, domestic and foreign producers, and the budget.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-potential-impact-of-trump-s-tariff-proposal/7843021.html	2024-10-29T01:29:47-07:00	
Germany needs reform and investment to overcome recession, says IMF Europe head	Berlin — Germany needs both structural reforms and more investment in public infrastructure to overcome recession, the European head of the International Monetary Fund said in an interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung. 'Without a functioning infrastructure, there can be no productive economy,' Alred Kammer told the paper in an interview published on Tuesday. In order to mobilize more money, it would also make sense to revise the current credit rules, Kammer said. 'We at the IMF already calculated this some time ago: The debt brake can be relaxed - and the government debt ratio will still continue to fall.' Finance Minister Christian Lindner has insisted on sticking with Germany's debt brake, which restricts the budget deficit to 0.35% of gross domestic product, despite a forecast second year of recession and a sluggish growth outlook. Economy Minister Robert Habeck, on the other hand, recently proposed a multibillion-euro fund to stimulate investment and remedy growth. Asked whether Lindner or Habeck was right in the German government's fundamental dispute, Kammer responded that 'a lot would be gained if politicians clearly communicated what their strategy is in the medium and long term.' This was particularly true for the climate-friendly restructuring of the country. 'Companies will only invest if they know what is going to happen in the next ten to 15 years,' Kammer said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-needs-reform-and-investment-to-overcome-recession-says-imf-europe-head/7843024.html	2024-10-29T00:53:34-07:00	
Malaysia's former PM Mahathir discharged from hospital	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was discharged from hospital on Monday, his aide said, after the 99-year-old had been admitted earlier this month because of coughing due to a lower respiratory infection. Mahathir, who served as prime minister for more than two decades, has a history of heart problems and has been in and out of hospital several times in recent years. Because of his admission to the National Heart Institute on Oct. 15, Mahathir had been unable to attend a court hearing on a defamation case he had filed against the country's deputy prime minister. Mahathir will attend the court proceedings on Tuesday, his aide said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-s-former-pm-mahathir-discharged-from-hospital/7843020.html	2024-10-29T00:40:26-07:00	
DR Congo wants UN peacekeepers gone, but war around minerals complicates that	GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — The end of one of the world's deadliest and yet most shadowy wars is as difficult to predict as the end of the large peacekeeping force meant to contain it. Congo desperately wants stability in its mineral-rich east, of intense interest to the global economy. But political friction means the government wants the longtime United Nations peacekeeping force there to get out. That would leave the vast region, overrun with dozens of armed groups including one affiliated with the Islamic State organization, with even less defense for millions of displaced civilians. But frustration has become so high with the peacekeepers that many Congolese want them gone, too. The Associated Press witnessed the dilemma on a rare visit and night patrol with the U.N. force now known as MONUSCO, which entered Congo more than two decades ago and has 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground. It patrols a landscape that feels far from the authority of Congo's government, with its dirt roads churned into slippery mud in pounding rains and residents long accustomed to feeling that, security-wise, they are on their own. Some of the region's armed groups are self-defense collectives. During a visit to one frontline town, Sake, about 24 kilometers from the regional hub of Goma, the AP spoke with militia members trying to defend the population from a resurgent group, the M23, and its sniper fire from surrounding hills. The M23 is backed by neighboring Rwanda, whose government denies it. The involvement of better-equipped Rwandan forces, with U.N. experts estimating up to 4,000 of them in Congo, has led to talk of war by Congo's government. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces, but clashes between M23 and other militias continue. 'We are fighting the enemy who is a foreigner in our country. They are not Congolese, but they want to take Congo,' said one fighter, Amini Bauma. Sake is one of the last main routes into Goma under government control, but fierce fighting this year forced most residents to flee, leaving boarded-up homes. About 160 civilians and soldiers came through Sake's military hospital during the summer, most with gunshot wounds, said Omar Kalamo, a nurse. In August, a bomb exploded behind the building, he said. Some who fled are now returning, finding little safety elsewhere. Bitakuya Buhesha found his house destroyed. But he said he'd rather brave the gunfire than live in displacement camps, which have been infiltrated by fighters. 'We've waited a long time and we don't know whether our army will win this war or if it'll be the M23 rebels,' he said. Many Congolese who once looked to the U.N. peacekeeping force with hope are now angry. Multiple protests, some of them violent, have targeted the force in recent years. Last year, at Congo's request, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to draw down the peacekeeping force and gradually hand over its security responsibilities to Congo's government by this December. But the soaring violence means that departure is now delayed. On a recent day, peacekeepers in armored vehicles pulled into a small base in the hazy hills outside Goma, its tents surrounded by looping razor wire and sandbags. Troops perched with a machine gun pointed in the rebels' direction. In recent months, clashes between Congo's army and M23 came within a mile of the base. The U.N. force is trying to find new ways to repel the rebels. Last year, it established new bases between the frontlines and about 600,000 displaced people sheltering around Goma. It is training Congolese soldiers in the hope that they can fill the security void once it leaves. 'If the belligerent armed groups had come forward and attacked the civilians, the MONUSCO would have changed its stance purely from defensive to offensive operations,' said U.N's center sector commander for North Kivu province, Brig. General Ranjan Mahajan. MONUSCO described the security challenges 'multiple and multifaceted' and said only one of its brigades is tasked to go on the offensive. That affects a single area, Beni, where deadly attacks have been especially frequent. The U.N. mission otherwise is defensive and works alongside Congolese forces and others. But some Congolese, who see the U.N. force as not aggressive enough, said any new efforts to protect them are futile. 'You can see that MONUSCO is there, but that's in name only ... People are dying, but it does nothing,' said Maombie Aline, a displaced person in Goma. And yet, the international community has warned that the U.N. force's pullout would leave a security vacuum. More than 80% of Congo's 7 million displaced people live in areas protected by the U.N., according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. Last month, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the peacekeepers' pullout from South Kivu province in June left critical gaps, and the Security Council shouldn't authorize further withdrawals until there's a plan to mitigate them. The U.S. is the force's top financial supporter. Congo's communication minister, Patrick Muyaya, said there would be a new timeline for MONUSCO's departure, but didn't give details. He said a joint team of government and U.N. officials was evaluating the situation. Goma's streets are full of armed men, local and foreign. In addition to the U.N. force and an unknown number of Congolese forces, there are about 1,000 foreign mercenaries, a coalition of local militia and a Southern African regional force. A recently deployed East African force was kicked out amid criticism it was ineffective. 'It's a military jungle,' said Onesphore Sematumba, a Congolese researcher for the International Crisis Group. 'There are many actors, but everyone has their own agenda ... they can't make a difference because they are divided.' Global interest in eastern Congo's minerals is one reason the violence is so difficult to contain, experts said. Congo is the world's largest producer of cobalt, a mineral used to make lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and smartphones. It also has substantial gold, diamond, copper and cobalt reserves. In May, M23 fighters seized the town of Rubaya, which holds deposits of tantalum — used in electronics, including Apple devices —and extracted from coltan. The area is estimated to supply more than 15% of global production of tantalum and now generates about $300,000 a month for M23, said Bintou Keita, head of Congo's U.N. mission. U.N. experts in June said a portion of Rubaya minerals have been smuggled across the Rwandan border. Rwanda is selling minerals from eastern Congo and passing them off as conflict-free, said Darren Davids, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit — allegations documented by both U.N experts and the U.S. Davids said the international community has hesitated to meaningfully call on Rwanda to stop the fighting because it has become a reliable trading partner for the West as competition grows for the minerals. Meanwhile, the Rwandan-backed rebels are accused of obstructing and threatening the U.N. mission so it can seize more territory, and are widely expected to benefit from its departure. Rwanda's government and M23 didn't respond to requests for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-wants-un-peacekeepers-gone-but-war-around-minerals-complicates-that/7843019.html	2024-10-29T00:33:35-07:00	
Fireworks explosion injures more than 150 people at a temple in India	NEW DELHI — A huge explosion of fireworks injured more than 150 people at a religious festival in a temple in southern India, a report said Tuesday. The explosion occurred Monday night when a fireworks storage facility near Veerarkavu temple caught fire, the Press Trust of India reported, citing the police. It happened in Kasargod, which is nearly 580 kilometers (360 miles) northwest of Thiruvananthapuram, the Kerala state capital, The injured were treated at various hospitals in Kasargod, Kannur, and Mangaluru districts. Eight of them had serious injuries. There is a huge demand in India for firecrackers, which are used in religious festivals and weddings. Fatal accidents occur nearly every year as people work in makeshift factories without proper safety measures. An explosion at a fireworks factory in southern India July last year killed eight people. In 2018, a massive fire at a firecracker factory in New Delhi killed 17 workers. A year earlier, a blast killed 23 people while they were making firecrackers in a village in Madhya Pradesh state in central India.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fireworks-explosion-injures-more-than-150-people-at-a-temple-in-india/7843016.html	2024-10-29T00:06:07-07:00	
China's Xi pressed Biden to alter language on Taiwan, sources say	WASHINGTON/BEIJING/TAIPEI — Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S. President Joe Biden last year to change the language the United States uses when discussing its position on Taiwanese independence, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the private conversation. During last November's Biden-Xi meeting near San Francisco, Xi and his aides asked Biden and his team to tweak the language in U.S. official statements. China wanted the U.S. to say 'we oppose Taiwan independence,' rather than the current version, which is that the United States 'does not support' independence for Taiwan, said the people, who requested anonymity to speak about private diplomatic exchanges they participated in or were briefed on. Xi's aides have repeatedly followed up and made the requests in the months since, according to two U.S. officials and another person familiar with the exchanges. The U.S. has declined to make the change. The White House responded to a request for comment with a statement that repeated the line that Washington does not support Taiwan independence. 'The Biden-Harris administration has been consistent on our long-standing One China policy,' the statement read. China's foreign ministry said: 'You should ask this question to the U.S. government. China's position on the Taiwan issue is clear and consistent.' Taiwan's foreign ministry declined comment. The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists. The Republic of China remains Taiwan's formal name and the government says it has no plans to change that given they are already a sovereign, independent state and Beijing has no right to claim Taiwan as its own. Sensitive issue For several years, Chinese diplomats have pushed the United States to make changes to how it refers to Taiwan's status, which remains the most sensitive area in U.S.-China relations. The unusually direct and renewed push at the leader level has not been reported previously. The United States severed official relations with the government in Taipei in 1979 but is bound by law to provide democratically governed Taiwan with the means to defend itself. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. It was not clear why Xi chose to raise the issue with Biden, but he has made opposition to Taiwan independence a focus of his time in office and China's military has significantly ramped up its activities around the island in recent years. The Biden administration regards the proposed language change as a non-starter. Taiwan was briefed on the recent overtures at a high level by Washington, said one of the sources. Leaders in Beijing 'would love it if Joe Biden said very different things about Taiwan than he says, no doubt,' said one senior Biden administration official, adding that Biden would stick with the standard U.S. formulation for talking about Taiwan independence. During his time in office, Biden has upset the Chinese government with comments that appeared to suggest the United States would defend the island if it were attacked, a deviation from a long-held U.S. position of 'strategic ambiguity.' Change would reverberate A change by the U.S. to say that it opposes Taiwanese independence would reverberate through the trade-rich Asia Pacific and with U.S. partners, competitors and adversaries alike. Officials from two governments in the region told Reuters they would interpret any such change in wording as a change in U.S. policy toward less support for Taipei's defense and diplomatic aspirations at a time when Beijing has ramped up military pressure. China has over the past five years staged almost daily military activities around Taiwan. Earlier this month, Beijing held a day of war games using what Taiwan said was a record 153 military aircraft as part of drills simulating blockading ports and assaulting maritime and ground targets. Any switch in language could also be seen signaling a shift in U.S. policy from supporting the resolution of Taiwan's future through peaceful talks to one suggesting the United States stands against Taiwanese aspirations regardless of the circumstances at play. Opinion polls in Taiwan show most people support maintaining the status quo, neither seeking to join with China nor establishing a new state. In 2022, the State Department changed its website on Taiwan, removing wording both on not supporting Taiwan independence and on acknowledging Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China, which angered the Chinese. It later restored the language on not supporting independence for the island. The two leaders are expected to speak again before Biden's term in office ends in January, talks that may come by phone or on the sidelines of next month's G20 summit in Brazil or APEC summit in Peru. APEC is one of few international forums where both Taiwan and China take part. The Democratic president will hand over the tense Taiwan issue to his successor, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican former President Donald Trump, following the Nov. 5 election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-pressed-biden-to-alter-language-on-taiwan-sources-say/7843008.html	2024-10-28T23:40:03-07:00	
South Korea says Russia-North Korea military cooperation ‘poses significant security threat’	PENTAGON — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Tuesday that military cooperation between North Korea and Russia 'poses a significant security threat to the international community.' The comments at a Cabinet meeting in Seoul followed Yoon saying Monday that the deployment of North Korean troops to the battlefield in Ukraine could happen 'more quickly than anticipated,' according to South Korean intelligence assessments. The U.S. Defense Department said Monday that North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to train in Russia, more than tripling the previous estimate. 'We believe that the DPRK has sent around 10,000 soldiers in total to train in eastern Russia that will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks,' deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters at the Pentagon, using an abbreviation for North Korea’s official name. 'A portion of those soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are increasingly concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk oblast, near the border with Ukraine,' she added. Earlier on Monday, NATO confirmed that 3,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia to help Moscow fight its war against Ukraine and have also been deployed to Russia’s Kursk region where Kyiv’s forces invaded in a surprise attack in August and still hold territory. 'The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security,' NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters in Brussels after NATO officials and diplomats received a briefing from a South Korean delegation of intelligence and military officials. The NATO secretary general said the deployment of North Korean troops was a sign of 'growing desperation' on the part of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rutte added that more than 600,000 Russian forces have been killed or wounded since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Pentagon did not provide further details on the type of troops or equipment that North Korea had sent with their troops. When pressed by VOA on what types of capabilities these troops could bring, Singh said, 'It’s additional bodies on the battlefield.' 'If we see DPRK troops moving in and towards the front lines, they are co-belligerents in the war,' she warned. Russia and North Korea have boosted their political and military alliance since Moscow’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Gen. David Allvin, the chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, told VOA Friday at a Military Reporters and Editors conference that increased cooperation between the two malign actors is 'certainly a cause for more consideration and investigation.' The Kremlin had dismissed reports about a North Korean troop deployment as 'fake news.' But Putin last week did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia and said that it was up to Moscow to decide how to deploy them as part of a mutual defense security pact he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. At odds with Putin’s comments, a North Korean representative to the United Nations in New York last week characterized the reports of Pyongyang’s deployment of troops in Russia as 'groundless rumors.' U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will host his South Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-Hyun, on Wednesday at the Pentagon, where the two are expected to discuss the North Korean troops who are now in Russia. Drone warfare Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russian aerial attacks killed at least four people in the Kharkiv region in northeastern Ukraine. Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram the attack destroyed two houses and damaged about 20 others. Russian attacks overnight also targeted Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, injuring at least six people, according to Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said falling debris from a downed Russian drone ignited a fire at a residential building. In the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine, officials said a Russian rocket attack killed one person. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down seven Ukrainian drones overnight, including two over the Belgorod region, two over Bryansk, two over Kursk and one over the Black Sea. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram the Ukrainian attack damaged several residential buildings.

Myanmar opposition: Dialogue impossible, China must rethink junta support	Despite efforts by China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to resolve Myanmar's political and economic crisis, opposition leader Zaw Wai Soe told VOA that dialogue with the military regime is impossible amid ongoing atrocities. Zaw Wai Soe is a minister in Myanmar’s National Unity Government (NUG), a shadow government of former lawmakers and opponents created after the February 2021 coup. 'The military must have no place in politics,' he said. Speaking to VOA in Washington after attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York in September, Zaw Wai Soe commented on opinions that humanitarian aid to victims of Typhoon Yagi in early September could provide a political way out. 'They continue to drop bombs, and it is obvious they are committing war crimes,' he said. 'It is impossible to engage in dialogue with such an organization.' The military has appealed to the opposition to negotiate. According to Tu Maung Nyo, a political columnist based along the Myanmar-Thailand border, the military’s recent calls to end the conflict indicate an attempt 'to achieve on the table what they cannot accomplish on the battlefield.' He added, 'This approach has been used repeatedly whenever the military faces political or military crises.' On October 15, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar's military leader, called on ethnic rebel groups to engage in peace talks to end armed conflicts, marking the second appeal for negotiations in less than a month. Military’s view on crisis VOA contacted Myanmar's military regime, the State Administration Council (SAC), to comment on Zaw Wai Soe's statements but did not receive a direct response at the time of publication. In September, in an effort to start peace talks, SAC spokesperson Zaw Min Tun told the media that 'the military is committed to solving political problems through political means.' The day after, the military made its first public appeal since the coup, calling on its opponents, including the People’s Defense Force, to lay down their weapons and return to the political process to end the country's conflict. SAC urged ethnic armed organizations and 'terrorist insurgent groups' to 'communicate with us to solve political problems politically' and participate in the military-managed election it plans to hold next year. Doubts over cease-fire Analysts and critics question the sincerity of the military's calls for peace, given its ongoing airstrikes. Jason Tower, Burma program director at the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), noted that the military’s actions, especially its airstrike campaigns, contradict any genuine interest in a cease-fire. 'It’s pretty clear that there’s absolutely no interest on the part of the regime in a cease-fire,' he said. 'If there were any negotiations, it would really require that the regime make major concessions to ethnic armed organizations.' According to Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow in the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute, the crisis poses a significant challenge to regional stability. ASEAN has struggled to find a cohesive strategy since adopting a Five-Point Consensus in 2021. Progress has been limited, as highlighted in the recent ASEAN Summit in Laos. Regional partners such as Singapore have urged the United States and China to assist ASEAN in finding a solution for Myanmar, which is strategically significant to China's global policy, particularly concerning the 'Malacca Dilemma'— China's reliance on the Strait of Malacca for oil imports. Skepticism over China's approach China has positioned itself as a mediator in the Myanmar conflict, advocating cease-fires and dialogue between the junta and ethnic armed organizations. According to a commentary by Kyi Sin, a research officer at the Myanmar study program at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, China has adapted its approach by forging security agreements with all parties involved in the civil war and mediating or participating in peace talks, signaling a potentially more assertive stance toward Myanmar’s ongoing conflict. In an email to VOA, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu reaffirmed that China advocates for all parties in Myanmar to cease hostilities and resolve issues through dialogue. China's strategic interest in Myanmar is securing infrastructure projects like the Sino-Myanmar pipeline, which links Myanmar’s deep-water port of Kyaukphyu in the western part of the country in the Bay of Bengal with Kunming in Yunnan, an inland province in southwestern China. The Chinese state media outlet Global Times reported in 2023 that approximately 52 billion cubic meters of natural gas have been transported through the Sino-Myanmar pipeline since it began operation on July 28, 2013, reaching its intended transmission capacity. The report cited China National Petroleum Corp., a state-owned oil company. Tower noted that fighting near the pipeline complicates China's efforts to maintain regional stability. 'China's geostrategic investments are already in the crossfire,' he said. Malaysia will be ASEAN’s chair in 2025. Its prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has pledged to strengthen engagement and push for decisive action on human rights violations in Myanmar. Malaysia, hosting about 200,000 Myanmar refugees, has a direct stake in resolving the crisis. A recent USIP report highlighted areas for Malaysia to target: pushing back against China's dominance, ensuring the opposition has a voice within ASEAN, and increasing leverage over the military regime. Obstacles to peace International experts like Yaacob and Tower highlighted the challenge that Myanmar’s political and humanitarian crises pose for ASEAN and the international community, noting that while regional powers such as China advocate for dialogue, the opposition argues meaningful negotiations are impossible amid ongoing atrocities. Zaw Wai Soe stressed that for meaningful change, 'China needs to rethink its policy of supporting an extreme, violent organization that is against the people and all ethnic groups.' Yaacob summed up the stakes ahead for China, 'What will make any Chinese involvement successful is China cutting off arms supply to the junta. That could force the junta to rethink its position and move toward a peaceful transfer of power.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-opposition-dialogue-impossible-china-must-rethink-junta-support/7842993.html	2024-10-28T22:27:22-07:00

Guinea authorities dissolve dozens of political parties with no election date set	CONAKRY, Guinea — Guinea authorities dissolved dozens of political parties and placed two major opposition ones under observation late Monday, while the transitional government has yet to announce a date for elections. The West African country has been led by a military regime since soldiers ousted President Alpha Conde in 2021. The West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS has pushed for a return to civilian rule and elections are scheduled for 2025. The mass dissolution of 53 political parties and required observation of 54 others for three months is unprecedented in Guinea, which held its first democratic election in 2010 after decades of authoritarian rule. The Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization announced the moves based on an evaluation of all political parties begun in June. The evaluation was meant to 'clean up the political chessboard,' according to the ministry. The 67 parties that will be under observation for three months can operate normally but must resolve irregularities noted in the report. Those parties include the Rally of the Guinean People, which is the party of former President Alpha Condé, and another major opposition party, the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea. The authorities said the parties placed under observation failed to hold their party congress within the time limit and to provide bank statements, among other issues. Guinea is one of a growing number of West African countries, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military has taken power and delayed a return to civilian rule. Earlier this year, the military junta in Burkina Faso extended its transition term by five years. Col. Mamadi Doumbouya, who leads Guinea, overran the president three years ago, saying he was preventing the country from slipping into chaos and chastised the previous government for broken promises. However, since coming to power he's been criticized by some for being no better than his predecessor. In February, the military leader dissolved the government without explanation, saying a new one will be appointed. Doumbouya has rebuffed attempts by the West and other developed countries to intervene in Africa's political challenges, saying Africans are 'exhausted by the categorizations with which everyone wants to box us in.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/guinea-authorities-dissolve-dozens-of-political-parties-with-no-election-date-set/7842956.html	2024-10-28T20:00:56-07:00	
Knife attack near school in Beijing injures 5 people, including 3 children	Beijing — A knife attack near a school in China's capital on Monday injured five people, including three children, police said. The attack occurred midafternoon in Beijing's northwestern Haidian district. None of the injuries was life-threatening, police said in a statement. A 50-year-old suspect surnamed Tang was detained at the scene and is under investigation, police said. The location of the attack given by the statement is near a famous primary school. Video circulating on social media showed two school-aged children on the ground. Another image showed a man with blood on his face being held to the ground. Multiple knife attacks have occurred in China this year, including several involving school children. Last month, a 10-year-old Japanese student died after being attacked with a knife near his school in the southern city of Shenzhen. Another attack in June at a school bus stop for a Japanese school in Suzhou injured a woman and her child. A Chinese woman who tried to intervene was killed. In early October, three people were killed and 15 others were wounded in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket. China tightly restricts private gun ownership, making knives and homemade explosives among the most common weapons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/knife-attack-near-school-in-beijing-injures-5-people-including-3-children/7842930.html	2024-10-28T19:06:20-07:00	
Washington Post's Bezos defends decision to end presidential endorsements	Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos on Monday defended the newspaper's decision not to endorse a U.S. presidential candidate after a report that more than 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions following the move. The decision blocked an endorsement of Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris, the National Public Radio report said, and many people in messages on the newspaper's website criticized Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon.com and rocket company Blue Origin. Bezos, in an opinion piece late on Monday, said 'most people believe the media is biased' and the Washington Post and other newspapers needed to boost their credibility. No candidate was informed or consulted about the decision and that there was 'no quid pro quo,' Bezos said, adding that there was no connection between the decision and a meeting between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Blue Origin's CEO on the same day. 'Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,' Bezos wrote. 'What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.' The subscription cancellations as of midday represented about 8% of the paper's paid circulation of 2.5 million subscribers, which includes print as well, reported NPR, which said a series of columnists had resigned their positions in protest. The Washington Post declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters. In a post on Friday, William Lewis, The Washington Post's publisher and CEO, said the newspaper would not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in the Nov. 5 election, nor in any future presidential election. 'We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates,' Lewis wrote. 'The Washington Post's decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential campaign is a terrible mistake,' wrote 20 columnists in an opinion piece on the Post's website, adding that it 'represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/washington-post-s-bezos-defends-decision-to-end-presidential-endorsements/7842916.html	2024-10-28T18:40:43-07:00	
US, South Korea to confer on North Korean troop deployment to Russia	state department — Top diplomatic and military officials from the United States and South Korea are set to convene in Washington this Thursday as the two allies closely monitor and express concerns about North Korea's deployment of about 10,000 troops to Russia. Meanwhile, U.S. officials and analysts say that China could be displeased by Russia's growing influence over North Korea, and that if Beijing chose, it could restrict exports of materials that Pyongyang might use for munitions production. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will co-host South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul and Minister of Defense Kim Yong-hyun to coordinate on pressing security threats facing the alliance. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told VOA during Monday’s briefing that high on the agenda would be discussion of 'North Korea's expanding relationship with Russia,' which includes the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia; various other provocative actions by North Korea in recent months; and the U.S. commitment to security in the Indo-Pacific region. The consultation between Washington and Seoul will come two weeks after establishment of the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team, a group formed by the United States, South Korea, Japan and other allies to better coordinate enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. The group said that while 'the path to dialogue' with North Korea remained open, it was committed to 'safeguard the global nonproliferation regime and address the threat arising from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s [DPRK, North Korea’s official name] weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, which are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.' Some analysts suggest that by sending troops to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, North Korea may gain an opportunity to test the effectiveness of its ballistic missiles and munitions. 'We have communicated with the PRC about this matter to make clear that we are concerned about it, and that they ought to be concerned about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and North Korea,' Miller added. He was referring to People’s Republic of China. Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that while China has been supportive of Russia’s war in Ukraine, North Korea’s involvement introduces an unsettling dynamic. 'For one,' Cha said, 'China does not like Russia to have so much influence over North Korea.' Cha added that Beijing could take specific actions, such as curbing exports of petroleum coke to North Korea, which can be used in munitions production. 'According to recent public reports, imports of this good [used for steel production] have dramatically increased while overall trade has only slowly started to return to normal,' he said. Defense Department spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Austin would also meet with his South Korean counterpart Wednesday, when he will host Kim at the Pentagon for the 56th U.S.-ROK Security Consultative Meeting. ROK refers to South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.

Biden hosts White House Diwali reception	U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday hailed the start of the five-day festival of Diwali — the celebration that symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and is marked by Hindus, Jains and Sikhs around the world, especially in India. Biden began the White House festivities by lighting a small prayer lamp known as a diya. Several hundred guests — including South Asian administration officials, elected officials, prominent community members and others — wore silks and embroidered finery and thronged the White House’s massive and heavily chandeliered East Room for the occasion. But Biden used the occasion to shine a light on someone who was not in the crowd: Vice President Kamala Harris, the most prominent South Asian American, who was busy on the campaign trail as the election swiftly approaches. Her late mother immigrated to the United States from what was then the Indian city of Madras, now called Chennai. 'One of the things we bonded over was the role each of our mothers played in our lives,' Biden said. 'They come from different places, different generations, different lives, but they shared a basic belief about America: Only in America is anything possible. Only in America.' And, he said, after hundreds of years of struggle, South Asian Americans have made the U.S. their home. 'Diwali is celebrated openly and proudly here in the White House,' he said. 'And by the way, this is not my house. This is your house.' The festival starts on the darkest night of the year, per the Hindu lunar calendar — October 31, according to the Indian government. The day is a national holiday. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who was visibly moved by the occasion, spoke of how his parents’ faith illuminated their path after they immigrated to the U.S. from India. 'That is the message of Diwali,' he said. 'Choose light always, whatever the future may bring. Whatever the future may bring, it is our light and our fierce commitment to one another that will see us through to a better day.' And joining the festivities from afar was International Space Station commander Sunita Williams. Her father immigrated to the U.S. from India; her mother, from Slovenia. She spoke to the White House crowd via a recorded message from 420 kilometers (260 miles) above the Earth. 'On this day, I specifically think about my father, who immigrated to the U.S. from India,' she said. 'He kept and shared his cultural roots by teaching us about Diwali and other Indian festivals. Diwali is a time of joy, as goodness in the world prevails. I am so thankful to have grown up in a multicultural household where our parents encouraged us to seek opportunities and reach for the stars.' Monday’s reception marks the latest in a line of presidential celebrations of Diwali that date to President George W. Bush's time in office. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump also held Diwali celebrations. The festival marks the return of the mythical Lord Ram, named in Sanskrit scripture as a reincarnation of the god Vishnu, from exile after 14 years. The people of his kingdom, Ayodhya, lit lamps to illuminate his path home — a tradition that merrymakers continue today with lamps and pyrotechnics. Indian Americans are the largest non-mixed Asian group in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, with nearly 4.4 million people identifying as 100% Indian in origin. Today, celebrants around the world honor the occasion with new clothes, extravagant decorations and massive quantities of sugar-laden confections. This year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is the top proponent of a Hindu-nationalist movement known as Hindutva, saw a sweet named in his honor. The so-called 'Modi Laddu' — the Modi Ball — is made of saffron, clarified butter, pistachios, almonds and rose water. But there is also a vein of bitterness in India’s observance of this holiday. Modi was the driving force behind the rebuilding of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, on what was thought to be Ram’s birthplace. In 1992, a Hindu mob demolished a mosque on that site, prompting deadly religious riots that were the worst since India’s independence, leaving more than 2,000 people dead. Modi spent years raising funds to erect a massive Hindu temple on the ruins. He opened it earlier this year, saying, 'Today, our Ram has come.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-hosts-white-house-diwali-reception-/7842893.html	2024-10-28T18:04:23-07:00	
UN Security Council members urge restraint between Israel and Iran	United Nations Security Council members urged Israel and Iran on Monday to end their spiraling cycle of tit-for-tat attacks on one another, following Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran. 'All sides must exercise restraint. No good can come of pouring more fuel on the flames of this escalating cycle of violence,' said British Ambassador Barbara Woodward. Iran’s foreign minister requested the Security Council meet in an emergency session following an early Saturday wave of airstrikes by Israel that struck missile factories in three Iranian provinces. Council members Algeria, China and Russia supported Tehran’s request. 'Now West Jerusalem is trying to involve Iran in confrontation -- Iran, which is showing unprecedented restraint under the circumstances,' Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, referring to Israel. Russia is a close ally of Iran. 'It is very difficult not to have the impression that West Jerusalem is intentionally raising tensions, despite the signals from Tehran that they are ready to refrain from further spiraling confrontation,' he added, referring to Israel. 'It is our view that such aggressive actions on the part of Israel are aimed at further stoking the flames of war, are unacceptable and need to stop.' Israel’s strikes came weeks after Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel amid Israel’s wars with Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the Israeli strikes 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for retaliation. It was Israel's first open attack on its archenemy’s territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the attacks achieved Israel’s goals, including harming Iran’s defense capabilities and its ability to produce missiles. His envoy told the Security Council that Israel’s response was 'measured and proportionate,' but warned of stiff consequences if provoked again. 'To Iran’s leaders, take this as a warning: Israel has shown restraint. But from here on, you will see only strength,' Danny Danon said. 'Any further aggression will be met with consequences that are swift and decisive.' Iran’s envoy accused Israel of violating international law and the U.N. Charter and said Washington’s support had emboldened it to attack its neighbors. 'Regrettably, unwavering and unconditional support provided by the United States to Israel, coupled with its obstruction of the Security Council mandate as a permanent member, has emboldened Israel to persist in its crimes and aggression in Gaza and Lebanon, and now against Iran, gravely undermining regional peace and security,' said Amir Saeed Iravani. He urged the Security Council to respond with 'firm and dissolute action' and condemn Israel’s actions. U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Washington does not want to see further escalation and she delivered messages to both parties. 'Today, the United States’ message for Israel remains clear: We will always help secure its people and territory from Iran and its terrorist proxies and partners,' she said. 'Our message for Iran remains clear, as well: Should it choose to undertake further aggressive acts against Israel or U.S. personnel in the region, there will be severe consequences. We will not hesitate to act in self-defense.' Egyptian proposal Israeli forces carried out fresh airstrikes Monday in southern Lebanon where health officials said at least five people were killed in the city of Tyre and 10 were killed in the eastern Baalbek governorate. Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on Sunday proposed a two-day cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that would include the militant group freeing four hostages during the halt in fighting. Neither Israel nor Hamas offered any immediate response to el-Sissi’s plan, the first he has proposed during months of playing a role, along with the United States and Qatar, in trying to broker a halt to fighting. Israel said Monday that David Barnea, the head of the Mossad spy agency, had returned from talks in Doha with his U.S. CIA counterpart, William Burns, and the Qatari premier, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, where they discussed a new 'framework' for a Gaza hostage release deal. 'During the meeting, the parties discussed a new unified framework that combines previous proposals and also takes into account key issues and recent developments in the region,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. 'In the coming days, discussions will continue between the mediators and Hamas to assess the feasibility of talks and to further efforts to promote a deal.' U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Monday, 'We need a cease-fire. This war should end.' Hamas and Hezbollah are U.S.-designated terror groups. Separately, the Israeli parliament passed legislation Monday banning the main U.N. aid agency assisting the Palestinians, UNRWA. The law will go into effect in 90 days. UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement that the bill 'sets a dangerous precedent.' 'It opposes the U.N. Charter and violates the state of Israel’s obligations under international law,' he wrote on social media platform X. 'This is the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role towards providing human-development assistance and services to Palestine Refugees.' Israel has accused dozens of UNRWA staffers of being members of Hamas and some of participating in the October 7, 2023, terror attacks. UNRWA says it has taken action against about a dozen employees that Israel provided evidence about regarding their involvement with the terror group. However, in dozens of other cases, UNRWA has received either insufficient or no evidence from Israeli authorities. The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants.

France, Morocco announce major investments as Macron visits Rabat	RABAT, Morocco — Morocco's King Mohammed VI welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron to Morocco on Monday, kicking off a state visit with a series of bilateral agreements, including major investments in renewable energy and transportation. Macron's trip to Morocco — his first in six years — comes as immigrants, including North Africans, face continued scrutiny in France and while France reassesses its role in its former colonies throughout Africa. Morocco has historically been a key economic and security partner, but relations between the two countries have often been fragile. Among the objectives of Macron's visit, the Elysee Palace said, is 'to rebuild the exceptional partnership that links our two countries.' French and Moroccan flags on Monday flew throughout the capital, where crowds lined the streets to watch the motorcade containing Macron, his wife and members of Morocco's royal family drive to one of their palaces. Macron and Mohammed VI, who used a cane to walk, later oversaw a ceremonial signing of 22 agreements to facilitate future investments as well as cultural and scientific partnerships. The investments are worth a total of 10 billion euros and include expanding Morocco's high-speed rail line southward to Marrakech, which the country hopes to complete before it holds events for the FIFA World Cup in 2030. Also included were plans to develop green hydrogen, wind farms and water projects, which Morocco has identified as needed to help insulate the country from the effects of climate change. In the days leading up to the visit, Moroccan publications lauded the 'warm reunion' and a 'new honeymoon' between the two countries. Warmer ties Macron changed France’s long-standing public position and backed Morocco’s autonomy plan for the disputed Western Sahara. Doing so endeared France to Morocco but alienated it from Algeria, which hosts refugee camps governed by the pro-independence Polisario Front and considers Morocco an occupying power. France and Morocco have historically partnered on issues ranging from counterterrorism to migration. Morocco is the top destination for French investment in Africa and France is Morocco’s top trade partner. Morocco imports French cereals, weapons and renewable energy infrastructure, like turbines. France imports goods from Morocco including tomatoes, cars and airplane parts. Moroccans are among the largest foreign-born communities in France, where North African immigrants are a key political constituency and a focal point of debates about the roles of Islam and immigration in French society. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, a member of the French delegation in Morocco this week, has pushed for the country to take a hard-line approach toward immigration and seek deals with countries like Morocco to better prevent would-be migrants from crossing into Europe. On Macron’s last visit to Morocco, he and King Mohammed VI inaugurated Al Boraq, Africa’s first high-speed rail line, made possible by French financing and trains manufactured by the French firm Alstrom. The rail line currently functions from central to northern Morocco, running from Kenitra to Tangiers. The extension will more than double its length. Despite close ties, relations have at times been fragile between France and Morocco, which was a French protectorate from 1912 to 1956. In 2021, Morocco suspended consular relations after France momentarily reduced the number of visas offered to Moroccans in protest of its refusal to provide documents needed to deport people who migrated to France without authorization. France later reversed the decision. Relations between the two countries soured further that year, when a 2021 report revealed Morocco’s security services had used Israeli spyware to infiltrate the devices of activists and politicians, including Macron. Morocco denied and sued over the allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-morocco-announce-major-investments-as-macron-visits-rabat-/7842591.html	2024-10-28T16:21:55-07:00	
Ex-US Marine sentenced to 7 years for white supremacist plot	Washington — A former U.S. Marine was sentenced to seven years in prison Monday for his role in a white supremacist plot to destroy power facilities. Jordan Duncan, 29, pleaded guilty in North Carolina in June to aiding in the manufacture of a firearm. Duncan and four other men, including two other ex-Marines, were arrested in 2020 in connection with what authorities described as a neo-Nazi plot to sow chaos by targeting the power grid. 'We have now brought to justice all five of the defendants involved in a self-described 'modern day SS,' who conspired, prepared, and trained to attack America's power grid in the name of violent white supremacist ideology,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the group was 'inspired by racially motivated violent extremism.' 'If the defendants had been able to carry out an attack it could have caused suffering to thousands of American citizens,' Wray said. The other four defendants were previously sentenced to prison terms between 21 months and 10 years. According to court documents, two members of the group were active on 'Iron March,' a neo-Nazi online forum, until it was closed in 2017. They also recruited the other three people involved. The group accumulated firearms and produced a video of live-fire training in the desert near Boise, Idaho, that ended with the phrase 'Come home white man' as the final frame. Components of the power grid in the northwestern United States were listed as potential targets in handwritten notes found in the possession of one of the conspirators.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-us-marine-sentenced-to-7-years-for-white-supremacist-plot/7842572.html	2024-10-28T16:20:45-07:00	
One person dead in Iowa from Lassa fever, state health department says	The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services on Monday confirmed the death of a middle-aged eastern Iowa resident from Lassa fever. The individual had recently returned from travel to West Africa, where it is believed the person contracted the virus, the state health department said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to confirm the diagnosis of Lassa fever, the state health department said. The CDC said it assesses the risk to the general public to be extremely low. Lassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa, but rarely seen in the United States. There have been eight travel-associated cases of Lassa fever in the United States in the past 55 years, according to the Iowa health department. In West Africa, the Lassa virus is carried by rodents and spread to humans through contact with urine or droppings of infected rodents. About 100,000 to 300,000 cases of Lassa fever and 5,000 related deaths occur in West Africa each year, according to the CDC.	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-person-dead-in-iowa-from-lassa-fever-state-health-department-says-/7842584.html	2024-10-28T16:15:31-07:00	
Milei's popularity rebounds as Argentina's markets hit record highs	BUENOS AIRES — Argentina's President Javier Milei saw his popularity ratings rebound sharply in October, a poll on Monday showed, bolstering the libertarian whose pro-market reforms have driven markets to record highs since winning a shock election last year. A closely watched poll from the local Torcuato Di Tella University showed Milei's approval rating jump 12% after it slid in September because of tensions around pension reforms. The South American grains producer is battling triple-digit inflation and a recession, but former pundit Milei has managed to boost confidence in markets with tough spending cuts while largely keeping voters onside with his straight-talking style. Inflation, still in triple digits on an annual basis, has come down sharply each month, foreign currency reserve levels are being rebuilt and his government has turned around a deep fiscal deficit. Poverty levels, however, have risen sharply. A separate survey from consultancy Aresco showed the approval rating of Milei's government bouncing to 52.5% in October from 49.6% a month before, which it attributed to improving economic indicators. Milei, a political outsider, is riding a wave of voter anger with the main political parties after years of economic crises, despite a tough economic background and painful austerity measures he has pushed to try to boost the nation's finances. His government's non-negotiable zero deficit plan has gained huge cheers from markets, boosting bonds and stocks, while a tight monetary policy has also tamped down inflation and reduced a wide gap between official and parallel exchange rates. On Monday bonds jumped further away from distressed territory, where they had languished in recent years, rising on average 1.2%. Meanwhile, a key J.P. Morgan risk index of the country's debt hit its lowest level since mid-2019. 'The BCRA [central bank] buying reserves, new loans from international organizations, and high-frequency indicators showing October inflation at 3% were key to the fall in country risk,' said Roberto Geretto of AdCap Grupo Financiero. Andres Vernengo of consultancy CMA said Milei was, against the odds, making the market happy. Fears about further potential sovereign debt defaults were receding. 'Just when it seemed local assets were beginning to falter ... more rabbits appeared out of the hat,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/milei-s-popularity-rebounds-as-argentina-s-markets-hit-record-highs/7842577.html	2024-10-28T16:10:22-07:00	
UN body says Vietnam is unlawfully detaining journalist	Washington — A United Nations working group has found that a VOA contributing journalist imprisoned by Vietnam was arbitrarily detained prior to sentencing and incarceration. Pham Chi Dung was arrested in November 2019 and is serving a 15-year prison term for sharing what Vietnam calls 'anti-state propaganda.' The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention earlier in October adopted an opinion that Pham’s 'deprivation of liberty lacks a legal basis' and his 'detention resulted from his exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression.' The 58-year-old journalist is being held in a prison in Dong Nai province. Pham, a contributor to VOA Vietnamese, is also the founder and head of the Independent Journalists Association of Vietnam, or IJAVN. The group advocates for democracy, freedom of the press and expression, and against corruption in Vietnam. In the indictment against Pham, authorities described the IJAVN as 'illegal.' The journalist’s lawyer, Kurtulus Bastimar, welcomed the U.N. working group’s opinion. 'The U.N. has decided that fundamental rights and freedom of [Pham have] been violated. For example, he was not allowed to communicate with his lawyers and with his family,' Bastimar, who filed his case to the working group, told VOA. Based in Turkey, Bastimar is an international lawyer who specializes in human rights and arbitrary detention. The U.N. working group also found that the journalist’s detention violates Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Bastimar said. Both guarantee freedom of expression. 'The arrest and the detention was due to the fact that he was exercising his right to freedom of expression, and because of his being a journalist or journalist-related works,' the lawyer said. VOA Director Mike Abramowitz said that the broadcaster stands with its contributor. 'For decades, Voice of America has acted on a clear mission to deliver fact-based information to people in unfree, closed societies and protect press freedom worldwide. VOA stands with Vietnamese journalist and VOA contributor Pham Chi Dung and denounces his unjust imprisonment after exercising his right to free speech,' Abramowitz said in a statement. A copy of the U.N. working group opinion shared with VOA recommended that Pham be freed immediately and that a full and independent investigation be held into the circumstances of his detention. Before adopting the opinion, the working group requested comment from the Vietnamese government. The request, which gives the government 60 days to respond, was sent on March 12. To date, the authorities have not responded. In response to a 2021 request from the U.N., however, the government said that the cases of Pham and Nguyen Tuong Thuy, who contributes to VOA sister network Radio Free Asia, 'were prosecuted due to their activities which violated Vietnamese law, not for the exercise of their fundamental freedoms.' Neither the Vietnamese embassy in Washington nor its Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to VOA's request for comment. Journalist jailings Police arrested Pham at his home in Ho Chi Minh City on Nov. 21, 2019, and seized documents. He was accused of 'producing, possessing, and spreading anti-state information and documents' and disseminating 'distorted information,' according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. A court convicted him during a one-day trial in January 2021. Vietnam has a poor record for media freedom and jailings of journalists. Pham is one of 19 journalists detained in late 2023, when CPJ released its latest census of media workers imprisoned for their work. The country ranks 174 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 denotes the best environment for press freedom. The U.N. has ruled that Vietnam should stop persecuting people over their right to freedom of expression, said Bastimar, who has defended other imprisoned journalists in Vietnam. 'In each and every case, the government has used the penal code or propaganda grounds to restrict or to violate the right to freedom of expression,' he said. In its opinion, the U.N. working group referenced the high number of cases in Vietnam. 'The present case is one of a number of cases brought before the working group in recent years concerning the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of persons, in particular human rights defenders, in Vietnam,' the opinion said. The working group said that the cases follow a pattern of arrest that does not comply with international norms, including lengthy pretrial detention with no access to judicial review; denial of or limited access to legal counsel; people held incommunicado; brief trials held behind closed doors. It added that prosecutions are often under vaguely worded criminal offenses for the peaceful exercise of human rights. 'The working group is concerned that this pattern indicates a systemic problem with arbitrary detention in Vietnam, which, if it continues, may amount to a serious violation of international law,' the U.N. group said.

Bogus bomb threats torment Indian aviation industry	Ahead of the busiest annual travel season in India, more than 400 hoax bomb threats have triggered domestic and international travel chaos during the past two weeks, with Indian airlines grounding and diverting planes and incurring huge financial losses. Some flights were escorted to safety by fighter jets as the unprecedented wave of bogus threats caused disruption to scores of flights and India’s air travel industry. The threats created panic among air passengers, authorities said. Heightened security measures were enforced at most airports shortly after the first spate of threats surfaced in the second week of October. Investigating agencies quickly began probes to trace and determine the sources. India’s junior civil aviation minister, Murlidhar Mohol, told local media that most of the hoax bomb threats originated from outside the country. 'Up to 80% of the threats this month came from abroad. Police in different states are investigating some threats that originated in India,' Mohol said on October 23. On October 17, police in Mumbai arrested a 17-year-old boy for allegedly posting bomb threats to four flights on X, formerly Twitter. Police also questioned another minor as a suspect in the cases of the threats to airlines, it was reported. On Saturday, a 25-year-old man was arrested in New Delhi for emailing hoax bomb threats to some Indian airlines and to Indira Gandhi International Airport. Fresh threats, however, continued to arrive largely via emails and through anonymous social media accounts on platforms like X and Meta, authorities said. On Sunday, fresh hoax bomb threats targeted at least 50 flights of Indian airlines. On Monday, threats affected more than 60 flights across multiple Indian airlines. Although Indian airlines like Air India, IndiGo, Spicejet and Vistara have been mostly targeted by the hoax threats, American Airlines and Air New Zealand have also received threats since the second week of October. Civil Aviation Minister K. Ram Mohan Naidu deemed the burst of economic harassment and threats a 'serious concern' even if the threats of violence seemed to be hoaxes. 'The safety and security of the people are the foremost aspect. … Those responsible for the threats would be identified and duly prosecuted,' Naidu said on October 21. The Indian government was planning to introduce stricter legislative measures to tackle the growing trend of bomb threats, including a law to categorize such threat-making as a criminal offense with the accused facing prosecution and the offenders being placed on no-fly lists, Naidu said. On Saturday, India sent a warning to social media platforms, including X, calling the spread of the threats 'dangerously unrestrained.' In a statement, Indian authorities warned the social media platforms of 'consequential action as provided under any law' if they do not comply with the 'prompt removal of misinformation.' 'The instances of malicious acts, in the form of hoax bomb threats to such airlines, lead to a potential threat to the public order and security of the state,' the statement said. 'Such hoax bomb threats, while affecting a large number of citizens, also destabilizes the economic security of the country.' Hoax bomb threats are not a new trend in India. In recent years, some airports and airlines have received similar bogus threats. But their frequency in the past two weeks has been unprecedented, leading to significant responses from authorities and investigators. The police have managed to trace only three persons in India who are accused of sending around a dozen such threats over the past two weeks. Investigators are yet to determine who sent more than 96% of this month’s threats. The investigators reported that by tracking IP addresses some of the threats appeared to have originated from Germany and the United Kingdom. Airlines, passengers suffer India’s aviation industry has been massively impacted by the bomb threats. Following international protocols, the airlines had to act on every threat. Dozens of international flights originating from India were diverted and some made emergency landings in third countries such as Canada, Germany or Turkey. Sanjay Lazar, an aviation professional and former Air India crew member, told VOA that protocol requires each bomb threat to be treated with the 'utmost seriousness.' He says the threats lead to financial losses and substantial inconveniences for airline companies and passengers. 'An aircraft on the ground is evacuated and taken to a remote bay, then the bomb squad checks it, security sanitizes it, and it takes three to four hours for an entire process to be completed. This costs money, both in man hours wasted and additional man hours and costs spent in the checks and more importantly, in the reduced utilization of the aircraft,' said Lazar, the CEO of Avialaz Consultants, an aviation consultancy firm. 'It also brings about wastage of pilots and crew duty time limits, which entails fresh crew in case of long delays. It also costs airlines by way of passenger meals and, in some cases, hotel accommodation.' Air India said that on October 15, its flight from New Delhi to Chicago with 211 passengers was forced to make an emergency landing in Iqaluit, a remote northern city in Canada, following a threat. A Canadian Air Force aircraft later transported the passengers to Chicago. On October 20, Afghanistan refused permission for an emergency landing to a Frankfurt-bound Vistara flight after it received a bomb threat. The flight had to return to India. In two separate incidents, around the middle of the month, authorities in the U.K. and Singapore had to send fighter jets to escort two Air India flights that had received bomb threats, authorities said. The investigators said that the motive behind the threats had yet to be determined. Lazar, the aviation expert, said the threats may be driven by a ‘’malicious intent’’ to invoke chaos and fear among persons traveling to and from India, and cause economic damage. 'The miscreants may want to create huge losses for airlines and inconveniences for the general public. Their actions would also show India in a poor light,' he said. Lazar described the threats as 'cyber terrorism,' and that the government needs to enforce laws 'to the fullest' to punish the perpetrators. 'India should ensure that, like the U.S., hoax bomb threats are treated as a federal offense, are investigated the way FBI does and causes mandatory jail time for those involved,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bogus-bomb-threats-torment-indian-aviation-industry/7842500.html	2024-10-28T15:13:32-07:00

Police in Botswana block opposition protest alleging election rigging	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswanan opposition activists took to the streets of capital Gaborone over the weekend ahead of general elections set for this Wednesday. They wanted to march to Zimbabwe’s embassy with a petition that voiced concerns the neighboring country is conspiring to help Botswana’s ruling party extend its 58-year hold on power. But the marchers did not reach their destination. The weekend march was organized by a coalition of opposition parties under the Umbrella for Democratic Change, or UDC. But police, wielding guns, batons and shields pushed back the marchers and barricaded roads, forcing them to disperse. UDC representative Phenyo Butale read out the petition despite the failed effort to reach the Zimbabwean Embassy. The petition urged Zimbabwe not to interfere in Botswana’s election. Butale told VOA there have been reports Zimbabwe wants to aid the ruling Botswana Democratic Party, or BDP, by helping it rig this Wednesday’s election. The party has been in power since 1966. Its candidate, President Mokgweetsi Masisi, is seeking a second term. He faces three challengers. 'We decided to march to the Zimbabwe Embassy because we have been receiving credible information that there is an attempt by the Zimbabwean government to assist their friends here, the ruling party in Botswana, through clandestine means,' Butale said. He said the police were not supposed to prevent them from marching to the embassy. 'We were met by brute force,' he said. 'Heavily armed police blocked the way and said we cannot go to the embassy; we need a permit. We told them that our interpretation of the law is that the process of asking for a permit is not because we need permission to enjoy our freedom of expression; the purpose is for the police to facilitate us and ensure our safety.' Police said that for a demonstration to take place the organizers must obtain a permit first. But political analyst Zibani Maundeni, a professor at the University of Botswana, says the police’s actions could be viewed as political. 'The police have to be a neutral body,' Maundeni said. 'If people organize a peaceful demonstration, there is no reason it should be stopped. In many countries in the region, the police have been a problem, acting in favor of the ruling party.' Meanwhile, the ruling BDP has denied claims it is working with Zimbabwe’s ruling ZANU-PF party to win the elections. Equally, ZANU-PF spokesperson Farai Marapira said there is no truth in the Botswana opposition’s allegations. 'We do not interfere in the internal activities of any other country, Marapira said. 'We do not interfere in the processes. We respect the electoral processes in different countries, and we support what the people of those countries will have decided on. This is just absurd and an insult to ZANU-PF and an insult to the people of Botswana themselves.' The handling of early voting in Botswana has also been criticized, with reports saying some polling stations ran out of ballot papers. Masisi is a former vice president. He took office in 2018 after he was handpicked to succeed President Ian Khama, who stepped down that year. Masisi was officially elected in 2019 to a five-year term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-in-botswana-block-opposition-protest-alleging-election-rigging/7842320.html	2024-10-28T13:31:29-07:00

UN: 'Decisive action' needed to halt fighting in Sudan	United Nations — United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for 'decisive action' on Monday to end the 18-month-long civil war in Sudan, where millions face starvation and have been displaced from their homes. 'We have consistently appealed to both sides to end the fighting and come to the negotiating table,' he told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Sudan. 'But instead of lowering tensions, they are escalating military action.' The warring parties are led by rival generals, Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) chief Abdel-Fattah al Burhan, and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. The former allies turned rivals have been tearing the country apart in a power struggle. The U.N. chief said 'suffering is growing by the day' as he called for a cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians, scaled up humanitarian assistance, and an immediate end to the flow of weapons and ammunition to both parties. He also expressed deep concern about the situation in the capital of North Darfur, El Fasher, where fighting has escalated since mid-April between the SAF, which is trying to hold the city, and the RSF, which is poised to take it. El Fasher is the only capital in the Darfur region that has not yet fallen to the paramilitary group. 'I am horrified by the Rapid Support Forces’ continued attacks against civilians in El Fasher and surrounding areas, which include displacement sites where famine conditions have been confirmed,' Guterres said. The United Nations and others fear that a full-scale battle for El Fasher, where there are some 1.5 million civilians, could unleash atrocities similar to the genocide carried out by Arab Janjaweed fighters against African Zaghawa, Masalit, Fur and other non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur in the early 2000s. Janjaweed fighters make up elements of today's RSF. From October 20 to 25, the RSF carried out major attacks in villages across eastern Al Jazriah state. The paramilitary reportedly killed more than 120 civilians, shooting indiscriminately and raping women and girls, looting markets and homes, and burning down farms. The United Nations says nearly 47,000 people have fled the area in the past week. 'And I am also horrified by reports of attacks against civilians perpetrated by forces affiliated with the Sudanese Armed Forces in Khartoum, and by continuing mass civilian casualties due to apparently indiscriminate airstrikes in populated areas,' Guterres added, saying all perpetrators of serious crimes must be held accountable. In response to calls from some quarters for an impartial force to protect civilians on the ground, Guterres said conditions do not presently exist for a U.N. peacekeeping force to successfully deploy. Humanitarian catastrophe Eleven million people have been displaced and half of Sudan’s population, an estimated 25 million people, are struggling with crisis level food insecurity. Famine was confirmed in August in Sudan’s Darfur region. At least 14 other areas of Sudan are considered at risk of famine in the coming months. Meanwhile, disease, including cholera, is spreading. Sudan’s envoy said the government has begun allowing more aid in, reopening the critical Adre border crossing from Chad in August for an initial three months, as well as opening nine other crossings and seven airports. But Ambassador Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed reiterated SAF concerns about the RSF using Adre to smuggle in both arms and mercenaries and signaled that the government may not renew Adre’s opening when it expires on Nov. 15. 'The United Nations needs to cooperate with the Humanitarian Aid Commission to review the situation every three months and to consider the security risks,' he said, adding that 'thousands' of mercenaries from Africa and the Sahel region had entered the country through the crossing. 'The border crossing at Adre is really a threat to national security,' Mohamed added. Security Council members expressed support for the U.N. secretary-general’s personal envoy on Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, who was present at Monday’s meeting and briefed council members afterwards in a closed session. Council members called for an end to the fighting and increased efforts toward a political solution, as well as better cooperation from the parties to facilitate scaled-up aid distribution. Council members also condemned ongoing attacks on civilians and welcomed the renewal last month of their arms embargo on Darfur. U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield urged council members to use 'the tools at its disposal' to impose a cost on spoilers. 'And so, we must all give more and do more,' she said. 'To pressure the belligerents and their external backers to end the violence, protect civilians, and let life-saving aid flow. To ensure accountability for those who have committed atrocities and other abuses. And to put Sudan back on the path to democracy, freedom, and hope.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-decisive-action-needed-to-halt-fighting-in-sudan/7842249.html	2024-10-28T11:48:39-07:00	
Bolivia government says ex-President Morales fired upon anti-narcotics patrol	la paz, bolivia — Bolivia's government on Monday denied accusations that it had led a targeted attack on ex-President Evo Morales, whose car was shot at on Sunday, claiming the former leader's convoy had fired on special anti-narcotics police who were carrying out a patrol. Morales claims that the government had attempted to assassinate him when bullets struck his car in the early hours of Sunday, marking a new chapter of tensions in the Andean nation between Morales and former ally President Luis Arce. Interior Minister Eduardo del Castillo said during a press conference that the FELCN anti-drug trafficking unit were carrying out a standard highway patrol when Morales' convoy shot at police and ran over an officer. Morales had said in a radio interview on Sunday that he had indeed shot back at police after they opened fire. Morales' vehicles were suspected of transporting drugs, according to the government. Morales, meanwhile, called the allegations that authorities were carrying out an anti-drug trafficking operation false. 'If that were the case, why did your elite military and police team shoot more than 18 times at the vehicles I was traveling in?' he wrote on X. Del Castillo added that Morales had instructed his vehicles to be burned after the run-in, destroying any evidence before it could be collected. 'If he had really been victim of an assassination attempt, it would have been in his interest to leave them intact' so that investigators could search them to collect evidence, del Castillo said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-government-says-ex-president-morales-fired-upon-anti-narcotics-patrol-/7842186.html	2024-10-28T11:23:55-07:00	
Pakistan, Afghanistan launch polio vaccination drives as cases resurge	Islamabad — Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan simultaneously launched fresh vaccination campaigns against polio Monday amid a resurgence in cases in the only two countries globally where the virus continues to be endemic and paralyze children. The World Health Organization reported 64 polio infections this year: 41 from Pakistan and 23 from Afghanistan, up from six each in both countries in 2023. Pakistani officials said the weeklong house-to-house nationwide campaign that was rolled out Monday enlists 400,000 polio workers, who aim to vaccinate over 45 million children under five against the paralytic disease. 'This is Pakistan’s third nationwide campaign this year, launched in response to the alarming increase in polio cases across 71 districts,' said Ayesha Raza Farooq, the prime minister’s point-person for polio eradication. More than half the infections in 2024 are located in southwestern Balochistan province, which sits on the Afghan border and is 'facing an intense transmission' of the poliovirus. The southern province of Sindh has recorded 12 cases this year, while other regions in Pakistan, a country of more than 240 million, have reported the remaining cases, according to Pakistan's polio eradication program. Anwarul Haq, the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Center for Polio Eradication, urged parents to cooperate with health teams in protecting their children against the crippling disease, stressing that there is no cure for polio. 'With the threat at an all-time high, we must act as one nation to keep our children safe through vaccination,' he stated. Local and WHO officials attribute the resurgence of poliovirus in Pakistan to vaccine boycotts in rural areas stemming from the false propaganda that these initiatives are a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children. Additionally, anti-state militants in violence-hit districts bordering Afghanistan occasionally attack vaccinators and their police escorts, suspecting them of spying for the government. The violence has resulted in the deaths of dozens of polio workers and police personnel, including at least two vaccinators and seven police members killed this year. Afghanistan Meanwhile, health officials in Taliban-led Afghanistan announced Monday the opening of a three-day polio-vaccination campaign, saying it aims to reach 6.2 million children under five in 16 of the country’s 34 provinces. The target areas are primarily located close to the border with Pakistan. The latest round of this year's anti-polio campaign in Afghanistan began after nearly a two-month delay because Taliban authorities abruptly halted house-to-house vaccine deliveries in the southern province of Kandahar without publicly stating any reason. Instead, de facto Afghan authorities stressed the need to conduct vaccinations for children from site to site and mosque to mosque. In a report released last month, an independent monitoring board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative believed that the Taliban’s action had stemmed from their 'administration’s concerns about covert surveillance activities.' The report quoted Taliban officials as explaining that their leadership is living in Kandahar and has concerns about their security. Kandahar, regarded as the unofficial capital of Afghanistan under Taliban rule, is where the militant group’s reclusive supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, resides and governs the country through his decrees based on his strict interpretation of Islam. The Taliban chief has banned most Afghan women from public and private sector workplaces and barred girls from receiving an education beyond the sixth grade. WHO officials say eradicating polio in Afghanistan requires comprehensive integration of large migrant populations into the vaccination program. They say it is also crucial to reach out to groups that refuse vaccination and establish a female public health workforce dedicated to the polio initiative to tackle multiple challenges facing polio-eradication efforts in the impoverished country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-afghanistan-launch-polio-vaccination-drives-as-cases-resurge/7842175.html	2024-10-28T11:23:43-07:00	
Iran executes Iranian German dissident	Iran's state media reported Monday that authorities have executed Iranian German dissident Jamshid Sharmahd after convicting him on terrorism charges. Sharmahd, an Iranian German dual citizen and opposition figure, was accused of masterminding a deadly 2008 bombing of a mosque in Shiraz. His family strongly denied the charges. Sharmahd, 68, had been living in the United States, where he served as the spokesperson for Tondar, a group that aims to restore the Western-backed monarchy that ruled Iran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Sharmahd’s family says Iranian authorities kidnapped him during a stopover in Dubai in 2020. He was given the death penalty for 'corruption on Earth.'

Hungary's Orban arrives in Georgia after disputed election	TBILISI — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrived in Georgia on Monday after having congratulated the ruling party on its victory in an election which the opposition says was marred by voting violations. Georgia's electoral commission said Georgian Dream won Saturday's election with nearly 54% of the vote, but opposition parties disputed the results and called for protests. The election results are a blow for pro-Western Georgians who had cast the vote as a choice between a ruling party that has deepened ties with Russia and an opposition aiming to fast-track integration with Europe. Orban congratulated Georgian Dream party on their victory on Saturday. 'The people of Georgia know what is best for their country, and made their voice heard today!' he wrote on X. Orban was accompanied on his visit to Georgia by Hungary's finance, economy and foreign ministers. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wrote on Facebook on Monday the Georgian result was an 'ugly defeat' for liberals. Hungary — which currently holds the presidency of the EU Council — has angered fellow members of the EU and NATO with its determination to maintain close ties with Russia despite the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The European Union, the United States and NATO have called for a full investigation of alleged election irregularities. Georgian Dream and the electoral commission say the vote was free and fair. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili called the result a 'Russian special operation,' accused the ruling party on Monday of resorting to Russian-style tactics and propaganda, and called for Georgians to take to the streets on Monday evening. The Kremlin on Monday denied any Russian interference in the vote, saying it was the West, not Moscow, that was trying to destabilize the situation. In July, Orban stoked controversy when he traveled on what the Hungarian government has described as a 'peace mission' to Moscow and Beijing during Hungary's presidency without coordinating with its EU partners.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hungary-s-orban-arrives-in-georgia-after-disputed-election/7841984.html	2024-10-28T09:04:18-07:00	
Building collapse in Nigeria's capital leaves at least 7 dead	Abuja, Nigeria — A building collapsed in a suburban area of Nigeria's capital over the weekend, killing at least seven people, police said Monday. The building, located in the Sabon-Lugbe area of Abuja, had already been partly demolished and its structure was further compromised by scavengers looking for scrap metal, the Abuja police said. Abuja police spokesperson Josephine Adeh said five people were rescued from the rubble on Sunday. Building collapses are becoming increasingly common in Nigeria, with more than a dozen such incidents recorded in the last two years. Authorities often blame such disasters on failures to enforce building safety regulations and on poor maintenance. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, has recorded 22 building collapses between January and July this year, according to the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria. In July, a two-story school collapsed in north-central Nigeria, killing 22 students. The Saints Academy college in Plateau state's Busa Buji community collapsed shortly after students, many of whom were 15 years old or younger, arrived for classes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-abuja-building-collapse/7841975.html	2024-10-28T08:48:41-07:00	
Around 40 killed in Chad in jihadist attack on army	N'Djamena, Chad — An attack by jihadist group Boko Haram on the Chadian army killed around 40 people overnight near the Nigerian border, the government and local sources said Monday. 'A garrison housing more than 200 soldiers was targeted by members of Boko Haram' late on Sunday, a local source told AFP. The presidency said in a statement that the attack struck near Ngouboua in the west of the country, 'tragically leaving about 40 people dead.' Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno visited the scene early on Monday and launched an operation 'to go after the attackers and track them down in their furthest hideouts', the statement added. The attack struck at 10:00 pm local time (2100 GMT), local sources told AFP. 'Boko Haram members took control of the garrison, seized the weapons, burnt vehicles equipped with heavy arms, and left,' said one local source, who asked not to be named. A vast expanse of water and swamps, Lake Chad's countless islets serve as hideouts for jihadist groups, such as Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP), who make regular attacks on the countries' army and civilians. Boko Haram launched an insurgency in Nigeria in 2009, leaving more than 40,000 people dead and displacing two million, and the organization has since spread to neighboring countries. In March 2020, the Chadian army suffered its biggest ever one-day losses in the region, when around 100 troops died in a raid on the lake's Bohoma peninsula. The attack prompted then-president Idriss Deby Itno -- the current president's father -- to launch an anti-jihadist offensive. In June, the International Office for Migration (IOM) recorded more than 220,000 people displaced by attacks from armed groups in Lake Chad province.	https://www.voanews.com/a/around-40-killed-in-chad-in-jihadist-attack-on-army/7841759.html	2024-10-28T06:20:17-07:00	
For Japanese Unit 731 survivor, speaking truth carries a cost	Iida City, Japan — In August 1945, as Soviet troops closed in on Japanese positions in occupied China, 14-year-old Hideo Shimizu was given a grim task: Collect and dispose the burnt bones of prisoners who had been murdered. Only later did he realize he had helped destroy evidence of one of the 20th century’s most horrific war crimes: the actions of Unit 731, a covert branch of the Japanese military that tortured and killed prisoners in the name of scientific research. For decades, Shimizu kept his past hidden, not even telling his wife or the two daughters they raised together in a quiet corner of the Japanese Alps. But now, at 94, he is not remaining silent. Though not directly involved in the atrocities, Shimizu is speaking out about his experience with Unit 731, recently returning to China to apologize in person. Reopening such a dark chapter of Japan’s past has come at a cost. Shimizu has endured online attacks by angry nationalists, uneasy silence from his community and distance from some family members. Sitting cross-legged on the floor of his small home, which is now slowly being overtaken by the surrounding vegetation of rural Nagano Prefecture, Shimizu speaks quietly but with unmistakable conviction as he discusses the personal toll of his decision. 'I’m ready for it,' he told VOA, during what he said was his first interview with an American reporter. 'I’m only telling the truth.' Inhumane research Unit 731 was a small part of Japan’s 1931-45 occupation of China, though it was perhaps the cruelest. At its headquarters in Harbin, scientists conducted experiments on Chinese civilians and other prisoners of war as they pursued biological and chemical warfare advancements. The details that have emerged — testimonies of surviving members, postwar investigations and research by historians — reveal practices that were unspeakably brutal. Diseased prisoners were locked with healthy ones to see how fast deadly plagues would spread. Children were forced into gas chambers so doctors could time their convulsions. Others were subjected to frostbite experiments, their limbs repeatedly frozen and thawed to study the effects of extreme cold. An estimated 3,000 people were killed by such experiments, with many more believed to have died from biological warfare tests that intentionally spread deadly diseases in Chinese villages. Shocking realization As a young apprentice responsible for taking care of lab rats, Shimizu didn’t understand the full extent of what was happening around him. His suspicions grew after he was taken to a specimen room, where he saw preserved body parts, including heads and hands, floating in jars of formalin. He was especially rattled by the sight of a pregnant woman whose midsection had been splayed open to expose a fetus. 'I thought it was a study on how to prevent people from getting sick,' recalls Shimizu. 'I only later realized we were infecting and dissecting people to conduct germ warfare.' Shimizu spent over four months with Unit 731 before fleeing with retreating Japanese forces. When he returned home, he was told never to speak about what he had seen. For over 70 years, he didn’t. Instead, Shimizu focused on building his career as an architect, having been warned to pursue nonmedical professions. During those early years, Unit 731 rarely crossed his mind, as he tried to support his young family in a country rebuilding after the war. 'I didn’t think about it very much, because [I thought] I couldn’t say anything,' Shimizu recalls. Revisiting the past Shimizu’s attitude changed in 2015, when he and his wife visited a traveling peace exhibit in his area. Among the relics and photographs on display were images of Unit 731 — including an old brick building at the Harbin headquarters where he had worked as a teenager. For the first time, Shimizu found himself telling his wife about his involvement with Unit 731. As he confronted his past, Shimizu gradually became involved in peace activism. In August, he returned to China for the first time, visiting the site of Unit 731’s headquarters. There, in front of a black stone pagoda built as an anti-war monument and surrounded by Chinese state media cameras, he bowed deeply, expressing his 'profound regret and apology' for joining Unit 731 and 'becoming an aggressor.' Local dispute Shimizu’s visit was well-received in China, viewed as a long-overdue acknowledgment of Japanese atrocities. But the reaction was more complicated in Japan, where some uglier parts of the country’s past are still debated — and for many, quietly swept under the rug. The tension is evident in nearby Iida City, where Shimizu and other activists have pushed for greater transparency about Unit 731 at a local museum meant to preserve the wartime experiences of area residents. After years of deliberations, a small section of the museum acknowledges Unit 731’s biological weapons research and human experiments. However, the display also includes a disclaimer saying that 'research is ongoing' and that society has 'many different opinions' about the unit. 'People have lots of different views. So, we try to maintain a certain balance with this kind of exhibit,' explains Takeshi Goto, an official with the Iida City board of education, which runs the museum. The museum has refused to display testimony from local Unit 731 members, including Shimizu, saying it was too lengthy, and in some cases, too graphic for children. 'There were many tragedies during the war, but this museum is not intended to display all of those sad events,' Goto said. However, for local activist Hideaki Hara, who works closely with Shimizu, the real issue is the government’s reluctance to confront the uncomfortable parts of Japanese history. 'Iida and other local governments tend to align themselves with the central government,' Hara explains. 'This makes them hesitant to acknowledge Japan’s role in these events.' Historical debates Shimizu’s effort to bring Unit 731 into the light is part of a larger battle over Japan’s wartime legacy. In recent decades, some conservative politicians, seeking to restore Japan’s national power, have worked to downplay certain aspects of the country’s history, even rewriting school textbooks. Many conservatives argue that Japan has been unfairly singled out and should not be restrained by its past forever — especially under a U.S.-written pacifist constitution, which they believe limits Japan’s ability to assert itself in a dangerous region. 'They want to create a more beautified, white-washed wartime past they feel would be more palatable to young Japanese and help nurture pride in the nation,' said Jeffrey Kingston, a Tokyo-based professor of history and Asian studies at Temple University Japan. 'So, when veterans like Shimizu testify about what actually happened, it’s rather awkward for the revisionists — because he was there.' Shimizu is not alone. His testimony is part of a wave of revelations that began in the late 1980s following the death of Emperor Hirohito. Dark episodes of Japan’s history — including Unit 731 — started to emerge as veterans came forward with their stories. 'After the emperor died, suddenly the archives yielded their secrets, veterans found their diaries, and a more honest, forthright history emerged,' Kingston said. US role As it turns out, however, Japan wasn’t the only country that helped obscure Unit 731’s actions. After Japan's surrender in World War II, the United States gave immunity from prosecution to many of Unit 731’s top scientists in exchange for their research, which they wanted to keep out of Soviet hands, according to U.S. government records. 'The United States was a co-conspirator in the cover-up of Unit 731,' said Kingston. 'Their experiments in biological warfare, chemical warfare, vivisection experiments — all this was considered useful and would give the United States a great advantage.' Those given immunity included Shiro Ishii, the microbiologist and army medical officer who led Unit 731. In exchange for protection, Ishii and his colleagues provided 'a great deal of information to U.S. authorities,' according to a 1998 letter sent by the U.S. Department of Justice to the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. Personal toll Shimizu is resentful that so many of his fellow Unit 731 members thrived after the war — especially since his own career opportunities were restricted. 'My superiors became professors at universities, presidents of pharmaceutical companies and members of the Self-Defense Forces. Can you believe that?' he asked, his voice breaking. When asked if he wants an apology from the United States, Shimizu deflected, instead shifting the conversation to Japan’s growing military ambitions, which he fears could lead the country back into war with its neighbors. 'My wish is for the future happiness of my children, nothing else,' Shimizu said. 'I just want all countries to get along.' But his decision to speak out has strained his relationship with his family. His two daughters, once close, have grown distant and rarely visit him, especially since his trip to China. His wife, now suffering from dementia, lives in a care facility, leaving him alone in their home. The isolation, he says, has made it harder to understand why his daughters have pulled away. Even with those challenges, Shimizu — who appears to be the last living Unit 731 member willing to speak out — is focused on making sure the truth is not forgotten. After talking with VOA, he began preparing for an upcoming speech in a neighboring town. He’s already given more media interviews than he can count. And though he knows the end of his life is near, he remains defiant. 'I think it’s shameful and outrageous,' he said, 'to pretend that what happened didn’t happen.'

Lithuania leftist opposition win election, eyes coalition	VILNIUS — The opposition Social Democrats claimed victory in Lithuania's parliamentary election on Sunday, which was dominated by frustration with the cost of living and worries over potential threats from neighboring Russia. The left-leaning grouping has pledged to maintain the Baltic state's hefty defense spending program, while criticizing the center-right coalition government of Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte over raising taxes to fund it. Official government data showed the center-left grouping leading with 52 seats in the 141-member assembly, after 99% of the vote was counted. The ruling Homeland Union Party was on track to take second place with 28 seats. The Baltic country of 2.9 million people has a hybrid voting system in which half of parliament was elected by popular vote on Oct. 13. The remainder was decided on Sunday in district-based run-off votes between the top two candidates, a process that favors the larger parties. SD leader Vilija Blinkeviciute told reporters she believed her party would have a parliamentary majority alongside its likely coalition partners: For Lithuania, plus The Farmers and Greens Union. 'The results of this election showed that the Lithuanian people, no matter where they live, in large cities, in small cities or villages, they want change.' She declined to confirm whether she would seek the job of prime minister: 'We will discuss this within the party, we will weigh all pluses and minuses.' The For Lithuania party was on track to win 14 seats in the parliament and The Farmers and Greens Union was getting eight seats, provisional official data showed. Simonyte's center-right three-party coalition has seen its popularity eroded by inflation that topped 20% two years ago, deteriorating public services and a widening rich-poor gap. Domestic economic issues were in focus during the election campaign, with the SD vowing to tackle increased inequality by raising taxes on wealthier Lithuanians to help fund more spending on healthcare and social support. But national security is also a major concern in Lithuania, which lies on the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union and shares a border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus, a close Moscow ally. Lithuania will spend about 3% of GDP on its armed forces this year, according to NATO estimates, making it the military alliance's sixth-biggest spender. 'For me, it's of utmost importance to keep the calmness, and to stop the war in Ukraine,' said Mykolas Zvinys, 79, before casting his vote on the outskirts of Vilnius. Three-quarters of Lithuanians think Russia could attack their country in the near future, a Baltijos Tyrimai/ELTA opinion poll found in May, following its attack on Ukraine in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuania-leftist-opposition-win-election-eyes-coalition-/7841684.html	2024-10-28T04:58:31-07:00	
Georgian opposition pushes rally to challenge election results	Tbilisi, Georgia — The Georgian opposition has announced a major rally for Monday, urging followers to take to the streets to contest what they call a fraudulent election that handed victory to the ruling Georgian Dream party. Speaking alongside opposition leaders at the presidential palace, President Salome Zourabichvili called the vote 'totally falsified.' The preliminary results, with 99% of precincts reporting, showed the ruling Georgian Dream leading with 53.9%. The Coalition for Changes had 11.3%, Unity-National Movement secured 9.83%, Strong Georgia gathered 10.1%, and Giorgi Gakharia's For Georgia party garnered 7.7%. Other minor parties took the remaining vote. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, who is a member of Georgian Dream, on Sunday described his party's victory as 'impressive and obvious,' and said 'any attempts to talk about election manipulation ... are doomed to failure.' Georgian Dream, now headed for a fourth term in office, will take 89 seats in parliament, one less than it secured in 2020, the commission said, with four pro-Western opposition parties receiving 61 seats in total. However, the opposition claims the election was rigged. Western countries have expressed concerns, describing the results as a setback for Georgia's democracy and a worrying shift toward Moscow. 'There is overwhelming evidence provided by international observers and local NGOs indicating that this election was neither free nor fair,' Elene Khoshtaria of the Coalition for Change, told VOA. 'Secondly, there is a stark contradiction between the international exit polls and the official election results. And thirdly, there is a clear rejection by the people, which will be evident at tomorrow’s demonstration, that we will not accept Russian-style, manipulated election results,' Khoshtaria added. Tina Bokuchava, leader of the Unity-National Movement, told VOA, 'We are not going to accept the results of these falsified elections. 'We believe the [voting] verification machines were used for duplicate voting, among other methods. Additionally, the environment leading up to the election was marred by intimidation, vote-buying, confiscation of IDs, and pressure tactics,' Bokuchava said. 'These actions either prevented many people from voting altogether or forced them to vote under such intense pressure that it doesn’t truly reflect the free will of the people as it should be expressed at the ballot box.' In a significant move, three of the four main opposition parties have declared they will not take their seats in parliament, refusing to legitimize what they describe as a stolen election. Mamuka Mdinaradze, executive secretary of Georgian Dream, responded to the opposition's decision to forgo parliamentary mandates, saying, 'If they say they won't enter parliament, then let them stay out. We will continue working for our homeland and prevent any sabotage of our country by agents.' President Zourabichvili, standing beside leaders of the major opposition parties, except Gakharia’s For Georgia, said, 'I do not recognize these elections. Acknowledging these results is akin to accepting Russia's control over Georgia.' 'No one can take away Georgia's European future,' she said. The OSCE election watchdog, ODIHR, noted 'numerous irregularities' and highlighted an election environment affected by the controversial 'foreign agent' law adopted in June, which impacted freedoms. 'Contestants could generally campaign freely,' the OSCE said in its preliminary findings report, while also noting 'reports of pressure on voters, particularly on public sector employees, remained widespread in the campaign.' The ODIHR report further stated that the election 'unfolded amid entrenched polarization in an environment marred by concerns over recently adopted legislation, its impact on fundamental freedoms and civil society.' International response The European Union voiced its concerns, with EU High Representative Josep Borrell urging Georgian authorities to investigate electoral irregularities. 'We urge the Georgian authorities to conduct a transparent investigation into all allegations of electoral irregularities,' Borrell said. European Council President Charles Michel said the EU is planning to put Georgia on the agenda during its next meeting. 'These alleged irregularities must be seriously clarified and addressed. We reiterate the EU’s call to the Georgian leadership to demonstrate its firm commitment to the country’s EU path,' Michel added. Georgia received candidate status of the EU last December. Foreign Ministers of Germany, Norway, Latvia, Poland, France and Sweden also expressed concern over reported intimidation and manipulation, calling for steps to restore trust in the electoral process and uphold democratic principles. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement praised Georgia’s 'vibrant democracy.' However, regarding Saturday’s vote, 'international and local observers noted a pre-election environment marked by the ruling party’s misuse of public resources, vote buying, and voter intimidation, all of which contributed to an uneven playing field and undermined public and international trust in the possibility of a fair outcome,' he said. 'While international and local observers agreed that Election Day was generally well administered, we note reports of irregularities and sporadic violence. International observers have not declared the result to be free and fair. We condemn all contraventions of international norms and join calls from international and local observers for a full investigation of all reports of election-related violations,' Blinken said. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova responded to Zourabichvili's statement on her Telegram channel, saying, 'As long as countries and nations think independently and do not unquestioningly follow the orders of their Washington curators, they have a future.' The election took place amid an atmosphere many described as tense and filled with fear. Led by Russian-backed businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgian Dream has created a powerful electoral machine that relies on state resources and budget incentives to secure votes, observers say. The party’s core supporters include 'budget voters,' public sector workers and social assistance recipients, especially in rural areas where employment options are limited. The party relies on these voters, many of whom fear the loss of a job or benefits if the party loses. The campaign strategy of Georgian Dream was centered around the theme of stability versus conflict, portraying the opposition and their Western supporters as part of a 'global war party.' This narrative played into the deep-seated fear of war among Georgians — a country that has endured conflicts with Russia multiple times, most recently in 2008. The opposition, meanwhile, asserted that a vote for the ruling party, was a vote for Russia. 'The fear of war played a significant role,' Lasha Bakradze from Unity-National Movement told VOA. 'Georgian Dream effectively instilled the language of hatred and fear. Unfortunately, we thought avoiding this narrative was the right approach, as it seemed absurd that anyone in Georgia would want war, but it turned out to be a miscalculation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-opposition-pushes-rally-to-challenge-election-results-/7841602.html	2024-10-28T03:37:14-07:00

UN Security Council to discuss Israeli attack on Iran	The United Nations Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss the situation in the Middle East following Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran. Council president Switzerland said Iran requested the meeting with the support of Algeria, China and Russia. 'Israeli regime's actions constitute a grave threat to international peace and security and further destabilize an already fragile region,' Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in a letter to the 15-member council on Saturday. The early Saturday attack included several waves of strikes from Israeli jets targeting Iranian missile factories. It came weeks after Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel amid Israel’s wars with Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the Israeli strikes 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for retaliation. It was Israel's first open attack on its archenemy. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday the attacks achieved Israel’s goals, including harming Iran’s defense capabilities and its ability to produce missiles. Ahead of Monday’s council meeting, Iraq submitted a complaint to the U.N. complaining of Israel’s use of Iraqi airspace in the attack against Iran. An Iraqi government spokesperson said the letter condemns Israel’s violation of Iraq’s airspace and its sovereignty. Israeli forces carried out fresh airstrikes Monday in southern Lebanon where health officials said at least five people were killed in the city of Tyre. Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on Sunday proposed a two-day cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, that would include the militant group freeing four hostages during the halt in fighting. Neither Israel nor Hamas offered any immediate response to el-Sissi’s plan, the first he has proposed during months of playing a role, along with the United States and Qatar, in trying to broker a halt to fighting. Speaking in Cairo, el-Sissi said the plan also calls for more humanitarian aid for famished Palestinians in Gaza. El-Sissi said the proposal aims to 'move the situation forward.' He said that if the two-day cease-fire deal is adopted, negotiations would continue to make it permanent. There has been no cease-fire since last November's weeklong pause in fighting and hostage and prisoner exchange. Meanwhile, Israel's Mossad chief, David Barnea, headed to Doha on Sunday for talks with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and U.S. CIA chief William Burns. Hamas and Hezbollah are U.S.-designated terror groups. The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed nearly 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-to-discuss-israeli-attack-on-iran/7841578.html	2024-10-28T02:25:29-07:00	
A Philippine town in the shadow of a volcano is hit by landslides it never expected	TALISAY, Philippines — As a storm pounded his rural home, Raynaldo Dejucos asked his wife and children to stay indoors and keep safe from possible lightning strikes, slippery roads or catching a fever. One thing the 36-year-old didn't mention was landslides. In the lakeside town of Talisay in the northeastern Philippines, the 40,000 inhabitants have never experienced them in their lifetime. But after leaving home last Thursday to check his fish cages in nearby Lake Taal, an avalanche of mud, boulders and toppled trees cascaded down a steep ridge and buried about a dozen houses, including his. Talisay, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Manila, was one of several towns ravaged by Tropical Storm Trami, the deadliest of 11 storms to hit the Philippines this year. The storm veered toward Vietnam across the South China Sea after leaving at least 152 people dead and missing. More than 5.9 million people were in the storm's path in northern and central provinces. 'My wife was breastfeeding our 2-month-old baby,' Dejucos told The Associated Press on Saturday in a municipal basketball gym, where the five white coffins of his entire family were laid side by side with those of a dozen other victims. 'My children were holding each other on the bed when we found them.' 'I was calling out the names of my wife and our children repeatedly. Where are you? Where are you?' Disasters and migration to danger zones are a deadly mix It's the latest reality check in the Philippines, long regarded as one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, in the era of climate change extremes. Located between the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea, the Philippine archipelago is regarded as the doorway for about 20 typhoons and storms that barrel through its 7,600 islands each year, some with devastating force. The nation of more than 110 million people also lies in the Pacific 'Ring of Fire,' where many volcanic eruptions and most of the world's earthquakes occur. A deadly mix of increasingly destructive weather blamed on climate change, and economic desperation that has forced people to live and work in previously off-limits disaster zones, has made many communities across Southeast Asia disasters waiting to happen. Villages have sprouted in landslide-prone mountainsides, on active volcano slopes, on earthquake fault lines and on coastlines often inundated by tidal surges. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Kamal Kishore, who heads the U.N. disaster-mitigation agency, warned during a recent conference in the Philippines that disasters, including those caused by increasingly ferocious storms, were threatening more people and could derail the region's economic progress if governments don't invest more in disaster prevention. A volcano town bears the brunt of calamity The picturesque resort town of Talisay lies north of Taal, one of the country's 24 most active volcanoes nestled on an island in the middle of a lake. Fruit and vegetable farms have flourished on the fertile land, which is also a key tourist destination. Thousands of poor settlers like Dejucos have descended on Talisay over the decades, and its villages have expanded inland away from the lake toward a 32-kilometer (20-mile) long ridge with an average height of 600 meters (2,000 feet). Fernan Cosme, a 59-year-old village councilor, told the AP that the towering ridge at Talisay's northern fringes had never posed any major risks, at least in his lifetime. The key worry has always been the volcano, which has been restive on and off since the 1500s. 'Many take the risks,' Cosme said of Talisay villagers, who have grown accustomed to Taal's volatility and survived in its shadow. In 2020, Taal's eruption displaced hundreds of thousands and sent clouds of ash all the way to Manila, shutting the main international airport. Kervin de Torres, a carpenter, wanted a safer community for his daughter Kisha, a high school student, but he and his wife separated and she bought a house close to the Talisay ridge, where she lived with Kisha. His daughter was in the house when she was buried by the landslide. The mother survived. A distraught de Torres showed his daughter's picture to police officers who on Saturday searched for the last two missing people — Kisha and a baby from another family. Three hours later, a backhoe dug up school uniforms dangling from plastic hangers, in a spot where Kisha was believed to have been entombed by the debris. Dozens of police and volunteers dug furiously with shovels until a foot was seen in the mud. De Torres wept when the remains of a young girl were placed in a black body bag. He nodded when asked if it was his daughter. Teary-eyed residents expressed their sympathies. Doris Echin, a 35-year-old mother, said she nearly died when the mudslide swamped her up to the waist as she darted out of her hut, carrying her two daughters. She said she prayed hard and managed to plod through. Standing beside her hut, which was half-buried in mud as police and emergency personnel searched the area with backhoes and sniffer dogs, Echin worried about her family's fate. 'If we relocate, where will we get the money to build a new house? Which employer will give us jobs?' she asked. 'If we get to rebuild and stay, we'll be living between a volcano and a crumbling mountain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-philippine-town-in-the-shadow-of-a-volcano-is-hit-by-landslides-it-never-expected/7841570.html	2024-10-28T01:43:54-07:00	
Resistance forces push military regime close to brink in Myanmar	Bangkok — Three well-armed militias launched a surprise joint offensive in northeastern Myanmar a year ago, breaking a strategic stalemate with the regime's military with rapid gains of huge swaths of territory and inspiring others to attack around the country. The military's control had seemed firmly ensconced with vast superiority in troops and firepower, plus material support from Russia and China. But today the government is increasingly on the back foot, with the loss of dozens of outposts, bases and strategic cities that even its leaders concede would be challenging to take back. 'The military is on the defensive all over the country, and every time it puts its energy into one part of the country, it basically has to shift troops and then is vulnerable in other parts,' said Connor Macdonald of the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar advocacy group. 'To us it doesn't look like there's any viable route back for the military to recapture any of the territory that it's lost.' The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar's ethnic minority groups in its border regions, which have struggled for decades for more autonomy. The army's takeover also sparked the formation of pro-democracy militias known as People's Defense Forces. They support the opposition National Unity Government, which was established by elected lawmakers barred from taking their seats after the army takeover. But until the launch of Operation 1027, eponymously named for its Oct. 27 start, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, had largely been able to prevent major losses around the country. Operation 1027 brought coordinated attacks from three of the most powerful ethnic armed groups, known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance: the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army. The alliance quickly captured towns and overran military bases and outposts along the Chinese border in northeastern Shan state. Two weeks later, the Arakan Army launched attacks in its western home state of Rakhine, and since then other militia groups and PDFs have joined in around the country. Myanmar's military has been pushed back to the country's center A year after the offensive began, resistance forces now fully or partially control a vast horseshoe of territory. It starts in Rakhine state in the west, runs across the north and then heads south into Kayah and Kayin states along the Thai border. The Tatmadaw has pulled back toward central Myanmar, around the capital Naypyidaw and largest city of Yangon. 'I never thought our goals would be achieved so quickly,' Lway Yay Oo, spokesperson for the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, told The Associated Press. 'We only thought that we would attack the military council together to the extent we could, but it has been easier than expected so we've been able to conquer more quickly.' Along the way, the Tatmadaw has suffered some humiliating defeats, including the loss of the city of Laukkai in an assault in which the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army captured more than 2,000 troops, including six generals; and of the city of Lashio, which had been home to the military's Northeast Command. 'The 1027 offensive was a highly impressive operation, quite complex, and the use of drones played a big role because basically they were able to dismantle the military's network of fire-support bases across northern Shan,' said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies who runs its Myanmar Conflict Map project. 'And then, once the military's artillery support eroded, they were able to overrun harder targets like towns and battalion headquarters.' A year later, the military is 'substantially weakened,' he said, but it's too early to write it off. The military has been weakened, but not defeated The Tatmadaw has managed to claw back the town of Kawlin in the Sagaing region, which had fallen in the first days of the 1027 offensive, stave off an attack by three ethnic Karenni militias on Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state, and has retained administrative control of Myawaddy, a key border crossing with Thailand, after holding off an assault by one ethnic group with the assistance of a rival militia. Many expect the military to launch a counteroffensive when the rainy season soon comes to an end, bolstered by some 30,000 new troops since activating conscription in February and its complete air superiority. But at the same time, resistance groups are closing in on Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, in the center of the country. And where they might be out-gunned, they have gained strength, hard-won experience and confidence over the last year, said the Ta'ang National Liberation Army's Lway Yay Oo. 'We have military experience on our side, and based on this experience we can reinforce the fighting operation,' she said. Thet Swe, a spokesperson for the military regime, conceded it will be a challenge for the Tatmadaw to dislodge the Three Brotherhood Alliance from the territory it has gained. 'We cannot take it back during one year,' he told the AP in an e-mailed answer to questions. 'However, I hope that I will give you a joyful message ... in (the) coming two or three years.' Civilian casualties rise as the military turns more to indiscriminate strikes As the military has faced setbacks in the fighting on the ground, it has been increasingly relying on indiscriminate air and artillery strikes, resulting in a 95% increase in civilian deaths from airstrikes and a 170% increase in civilians killed by artillery since the 1027 offensive began, according to a report last month by the United Nations' Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Tatmadaw has been accused of deliberately targeting civilians whom it believes support the resistance militias, a tactic that is only turning more against them, said Isabel Todd, coordinator for the SAC-M group. 'It doesn't seem to be having the effect that they want it to have,' she said. 'It's making them even more hated by the population and really strengthening the resolve to ensure that this is the end of the Myanmar military as it's known.' Military spokesperson Thet Swe denied targeting civilians, saying it was militia groups that were responsible for killing civilians and burning villages. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting, and there are now more than 3 million internally displaced people in Myanmar overall, and some 18.6 million people in need, according to the U.N. At the same time, the 2024 humanitarian response plan is only 1/3 funded, hindering the delivery of aid, said Sajjad Mohammad Sajid, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs operation in Myanmar. 'The humanitarian outlook for the next year is grim, and we anticipate that the deteriorating situation will have a massive impact on the protection of civilians,' he said in an interview. In some areas, however, the offensive has eased pressure, like northwestern Chin state, which borders Bangladesh and India and had previously been the focus of many of the Tatmadaw's operations, said Salai Htet Ni, a spokesperson for the Chin National Front whose armed wing has been involved in fighting the military. 'In October of last year the military convoys that were going up into the Chin mountains were withdrawn,' he said. 'As a result of the 1027 operation there have been almost no major military activities.' Success brings new tensions between resistance groups As the front has expanded it has seen militias advancing out of their own ethnic areas, like when Rakhine-based Arakan Army in January seized the Chin town of Paletwa, which has given rise to some friction between groups, foreshadowing possible future strife should the Tatmadaw eventually fall. In the case of Paletwa, Salai Htet Ni said his group was happy that the AA took it from the Tatmadaw, but added that there should have been negotiations before they began operating in Chin territory and that the AA should now bring Chin forces in to help administer the area. 'Negotiations are mandatory for these regional administration issues,' he said. 'But we will negotiate this case through dialogue, not military means.' At the moment there is a degree of solidarity between the different ethnic groups as they focus on a common enemy, but Aung Thu Nyein, director of communications for the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar think tank said that does not translate to common aspirations. Should the Tatmadaw fall, it could lead to the fragmentation of Myanmar unless the groups work hard to resolve political and territorial differences. 'As far as I see, there is no established mechanism to resolve the issues,' he said. 'The resistance being able to bring down the junta is unlikely, but I cannot discount this scenario, (and) if we cannot build trust and common goals, it could lead to the scenario of Syria.' Chinese interests and ties with both sides complicate the picture Complicating the political picture is the influence of neighboring China, which is believed to have tacitly supported the 1027 offensive in what turned out to be a successful bid to largely shut down organized crime activities that had been flourishing along its border. In January, Beijing used its close ties with both the Tatmadaw and the Three Brotherhood groups to negotiate a ceasefire in northern Shan, which lasted for five months until the ethnic alliance opened phase two of the 1027 offensive in June, accusing the military of violating the ceasefire. China has been displeased with the development, shutting down border crossings, cutting electricity to Myanmar towns and taking other measures in a thus-far unsuccessful attempt to end the fighting. Its support for the regime also seems to be growing, with China's envoy to Myanmar urging the powerful United Wa State Army, which wasn't involved in the 1027 offensive or related fighting, to actively pressure the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and Ta'ang National Liberation Army to halt the renewed offensive, according to leaked details of an August meeting widely reported by local media. There is no evidence that the UWSA has done that, however. 'The idea that the northern groups and the Three Brotherhood Alliance etc. are somehow just agents of China is a complete misconception,' Todd said. 'They have their own objectives which they are pursuing that are independent of what China may or may not want them to do, and that's apparent in the incredible amount of pressure that China has put on them recently.' Because of the grassroot support for the resistance, it is less vulnerable to outside influence, said Kyaw Zaw, a spokesperson for the opposition National Unity Government. 'No matter who is putting pressure on us, we are winning because of the power of the people,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/resistance-forces-push-military-regime-close-to-brink-in-myanmar/7841567.html	2024-10-28T01:35:50-07:00	
Duterte offers 'no apologies, no excuses' for deadly Philippine drug war	MANILA, Philippines — Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte strongly defended his deadly drug war as he testified on Monday at a senate probe of the crackdown. Police said the campaign left more than 6,000 people dead, but rights groups estimate tens of thousands of mostly poor men were killed by officers and vigilantes, often without proof they were linked to drugs. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is investigating allegations that the killings were a state-sanctioned 'crime against humanity.' 'Do not question my policies because I offer no apologies, no excuses. I did what I had to do, and whether or not you believe it or not, I did it for my country,' Duterte, 79, said in an opening statement at the public hearing. 'I hate drugs, make no mistake about it.' During the anti-drug campaign he launched shortly after taking office in 2016, Duterte ordered police to shoot dead suspects if officers believed their lives were in danger. While the crackdown has been widely condemned and sparked an international investigation, only nine police officers have been convicted for killing drug suspects. The drug war has continued under Duterte's successor, Ferdinand Marcos, though he has pushed for more emphasis on prevention and rehabilitation. While the current and former president have had a bitter falling out, Marcos has stressed his government will not cooperate with the ICC investigation. The Philippines quit the ICC in 2019 on Duterte's instructions, but the tribunal has said it has jurisdiction over killings before the pullout, as well as killings in the southern city of Davao when Duterte was mayor there, years before he became president. Duterte claimed Monday that 'drug-related crimes are on the rise again,' with daily reports of 'children being raped, people getting killed' because 'the purveyors of this menace are back in business.' 'The Filipinos are anxious and distressed,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/duterte-offers-no-apologies-no-excuses-for-deadly-philippine-drug-war/7841565.html	2024-10-28T01:28:13-07:00	
McDonald's Quarter Pounder returns after E. coli testing rules out beef	LOS ANGELES — McDonald's announced Sunday that Quarter Pounders will again be on its menu at hundreds of its restaurants after testing ruled out beef patties as the source of the outbreak of E. coli poisoning tied to the popular burgers that killed one person and sickened at least 75 others across 13 states. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to believe that slivered onions from a single supplier are the likely source of contamination, McDonald's said in a statement. It said it will resume selling the Quarter Pounder at affected restaurants — without slivered onions — in the coming week. As of Friday, the outbreak had expanded to at least 75 people sick in 13 states, federal health officials said. A total of 22 people had been hospitalized, and two developed a dangerous kidney disease complication, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. One person has died in Colorado. Early information analyzed by the FDA showed that uncooked slivered onions used on the burgers 'are a likely source of contamination,' the agency said. McDonald's has confirmed that Taylor Farms, a California-based produce company, was the supplier of the fresh onions used in the restaurants involved in the outbreak, and that they had come from a facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. McDonald's pulled the Quarter Pounder burger from menus in several states — mostly in the Midwest and Mountain states — when the outbreak was announced Tuesday. McDonald's said Friday that slivered onions from the Colorado Springs facility were distributed to approximately 900 of its restaurants, including some in transportation hubs like airports. The company said it removed slivered onions sourced from that facility from its supply chain on Tuesday. McDonald's said it has decided to stop sourcing onions from Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility 'indefinitely.' The 900 McDonald's restaurants that normally received slivered onions from Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility will resume sales of Quarter Pounders without slivered onions, McDonald's said. Testing by the Colorado Department of Agriculture ruled out beef patties as the source of the outbreak, McDonald's said. The Department of Agriculture received multiple lots of fresh and frozen beef patties collected from various Colorado McDonald's locations associated with the E. coli investigation. All samples were found to be negative for E. coli, the department said. Taylor Farms said Friday that it had preemptively recalled yellow onions sent to its customers from its Colorado facility and continues to work with the CDC and the FDA as they investigate. While it remains unclear if the recalled onions were the source of the outbreak, several other fast-food restaurants — including Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC and Burger King — pulled onions from some menus in certain areas this week. Colorado had the most illnesses reported as of Friday, with 26 cases. At least 13 people were sickened in Montana, 11 in Nebraska, 5 each in New Mexico and Utah, 4 each in Missouri and Wyoming, two in Michigan and one each in Iowa, Kansas, Oregon, Wisconsin and Washington, the CDC reported. McDonald's said Friday it didn't pull the Quarter Pounder from any additional restaurants and noted that some cases in states outside the original region were tied to travel. The CDC said some people who got sick reported traveling to other states before their symptoms started. At least three people said they ate at McDonald's during their travel. Illnesses were reported between Sept. 27 and Oct. 11. The outbreak involves infections with E. coli 0157:H7, a type of bacteria that produces a dangerous toxin. It causes about 74,000 infections in the U.S. annually, leading to more than 2,000 hospitalizations and 61 deaths each year, according to CDC. Symptoms of E. coli poisoning can occur quickly, within a day or two of eating contaminated food. They typically include fever, vomiting, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea and signs of dehydration — little or no peeing, increased thirst and dizziness. The infection is especially dangerous for children younger than 5, people who are elderly, pregnant or who have weakened immune systems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mcdonald-s-quarter-pounder-returns-after-e-coli-testing-rules-out-beef/7841561.html	2024-10-28T01:18:45-07:00	
Indonesia labor group urges state bailout for troubled textile giant Sritex	JAKARTA, Indonesia — A major labor group in Indonesia has called on the government to bail out troubled textile giant Sritex, after President Prabowo Subianto ordered his ministers to save the firm from bankruptcy. Prabowo, who took office last week, has ordered his cabinet to find solutions for Sritex quickly, after a court last week accepted a petition by one of its trade partners over unpaid debt, which has put the firm, which employs about 50,000 people, on the brink of bankruptcy. Sritex had $1.6 billion of debt as of June. Said Iqbal, chairman of the labour party, a prominent workers' movement and political party, said a state bailout is one solution to prevent massive layoffs that may come from Sritex's bankruptcy. 'The government needs to provide bailout funds to settle Sritex's debts,' he said on Sunday, adding another solution was state intervention in the legal process to annul the bankruptcy decision. Sritex, which has produced clothes for high street brands like H&M, Rip Curl and Forever 21, as well as military uniforms for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), has suffered from weak global demand and cheaper imported fashion. It struck a deal with its creditors in 2022 to restructure more than $1.4 billion of debt but the court last week ruled to annul that agreement following the petition by its trade partner PT Indo Bharat Rayon. Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said the government was working to find the right measures to ensure Sritex's operations and to avoid layoffs, according to state news agency Antara. Sritex's outstanding debt to Indo Bharat Rayon as of June was at 101.3 billion rupiah ($6.48 million) or 0.4% of its total liabilities, Sritex said in a stock exchange filing. Indo Bharat Rayon did not immediately respond to request for comment. Sritex has filed an appeal against bankruptcy and has asked for government's support, the company said in its Instagram account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-labor-group-urges-state-bailout-for-troubled-textile-giant-sritex/7841537.html	2024-10-27T23:34:25-07:00	
Seven European countries match US in startup-friendly laws, report says	STOCKHOLM — Seven European countries have changed their laws to increase employee ownership in startups to rival the U.S. in attracting talent and investment, while other countries are lagging, a report by venture capital firm Index Ventures found. While stock options were integral to Silicon Valley’s success, Europe has been hampered by bureaucracy and by taxing employees too early, among other restrictions. The European Union needs a coordinated industrial policy, rapid decisions and massive investment if it wants to keep pace with the U.S. and China economically, Mario Draghi said in a long awaited report last month. Over 500 startup CEOs and founders joined a campaign called 'Not Optional' in 2019 to change rules that govern employee ownership — the practice of giving staff options to acquire a slice of the company, as European-based companies compete for talent with U.S. firms. Germany, France, Portugal and the UK lead European countries in making changes that match or exceed those of the U.S., while Finland, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden got lower ratings in the Index report. When companies such as Revolut and others go public, that ownership translates into real money for employees, said Martin Mignot, a partner at Index and an investor at fintech Revolut, which is valued at $45 billion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/seven-european-countries-match-us-in-startup-friendly-laws-report-says/7841533.html	2024-10-27T23:22:57-07:00	
Police out in force to prevent rowdy Halloween celebrations in Shanghai	SHANGHAI — Shanghai police patrolled the downtown streets over the weekend to crack down on Halloween celebrations in China's most international city. Local authorities appeared to be trying to prevent a repeat of last year, when Halloween revelers thronged central Shanghai, with some dressed in costumes that poked fun of the Chinese stock market, youth unemployment and strict COVID-19 policies. This weekend, the police presence, online postings about a crackdown and constant rain kept the revelry to a minimum. At least half a dozen people in costumes that turned up in Shanghai's Zhongshan park on Friday night were seen by Reuters’ witnesses being led away by police. There was no official city-wide notice banning Halloween, though local district officials sent notices to businesses in advance of the weekend encouraging family-friendly celebrations and discouraging activities in which adults would be wearing costumes. A bar and restaurant owner in the Jing An nightlife district was asked to sign an agreement issued by the local district authorities pledging they would not organize any activities such as costume contests 'to maintain good social order and public image,' he said on Friday. Reuters reviewed a copy of the order the owner signed. Jing An district police did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Reuters. One party-goer dressed up as a skeleton on Friday night in the Jing An district until detained by police and escorted to an administrative building and asked to remove his makeup, he said. He declined to be identified for privacy reasons. By Saturday, news of Shanghai's crackdown on Halloween was a trending topic on Chinese social media sites, including Weibo. 'Even in relatively open Shanghai, the scale of freedom is constantly shrinking,' one user posted. Officially sanctioned Halloween celebrations at the Shanghai Disney Resort and Happy Valley Amusement Park went ahead as scheduled.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-out-in-force-to-prevent-rowdy-halloween-celebrations-in-shanghai/7841530.html	2024-10-27T23:17:08-07:00	
Uruguay election heading for second round, pension reform likely rejected	MONTEVIDEO/TREINTA Y TRES, URUGUAY — Official presidential results in Uruguay on Sunday showed center-left candidate Yamandu Orsi will likely face conservative Alvaro Delgado in a second round next month, as no candidate secured the majority needed for a photo-finish. Of the 60% of votes tallied, Orsi had secured 41.5% support, according to the official count on Sunday. Delgado had secured 28.69%, while Andres Ojeda, a young, social media savvy conservative, had secured 16.8%. Ojeda has pledged to support Delgado to block a left victory if eventually knocked out in the first round. If no presidential candidate gets more than 50% of the vote on Sunday, a second round will be held on Nov. 24. Uruguay's race between two centrist candidates bucks a Latin America trend of sharp right-left divides, with significant overlap between the major conservative and liberal coalitions taking some of the sting out of the result. The nation of 3.4 million, known for its beaches, legalized marijuana and stability, also voted for its next vice president and members of parliament on Sunday. Vote counting was also underway for two binding plebiscites - one on a pension reform that would lower the retirement age by five years to 60 and another that would boost police powers to fight drug-related crime. Exit polls show both were likely rejected. Uruguayans appeared to reject the $22.5 billion pension overhaul, two exit polls showed on Sunday, defusing fears from investors and politicians that it could hurt the economy. According to local pollsters Cifra and Equipos Consultores, 61% of eligible voters struck down the proposal, versus 39% who voted in favor. The security referendum also failed, according to Equipos Consultores, securing less than 40% support. As polling stations closed on Sunday, hundreds of Broad Front supporters in capital Montevideo, where residents have historically supported the center-left, gathered by a stage overlooking the city's waterfront to await the results. 'We are the party that grew the most in this election,' Orsi said addressing the crowds from the stage. 'In these next 27 days we're going for that last push, with more desire than ever,' he added. However, the mood was more subdued among Broad Front voters as results showed that the conservatives combined could eventually beat the left in a second round. Miguel Angel Chirivao, 71, who had cast his ballot for the Broad Front, said it would be hard for the left to bounce back after Sunday's result, which was tighter than expected. 'They had a poorer result than we expected. That'll be difficult to reverse,' he said. In Treinta y Tres, a rural region of eastern Uruguay that has traditionally voted conservative, 60-year-old farm worker Ramon Silveira, who cast his ballot for Delgado, said: 'I want the trend of the last five years to continue.' While security was an area the ruling coalition could improve on, Silveira was confident that with more time in government, crime rates would come down. Uruguayans also voted on whether to remove constitutional curbs on nighttime police raids targeting private homes as a way to combat drug-related crime. Despite rising voter concerns over security, exit polls suggested the proposal was rejected. The pension reform and security referendums require simple majorities to pass. The ruling conservative coalition is struggling to defend its security record, but hopes successes on the economy - with both employment and real salaries on the rise - may be enough to convince voters in a run-off to choose continuity over change. 'I'm convinced that all the work we've done and what we represent is going to turn out well,' Delgado said earlier on Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uruguay-election-heading-for-second-round-pension-reform-likely-rejected/7841525.html	2024-10-27T23:07:26-07:00	
Biden to speak at White House Diwali reception	U.S. President Joe Biden is set to speak Monday at a Diwali celebration at the White House. The festival symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and is celebrated by Hindus, Jains and Sikhs around the world, especially in India. Monday’s reception marks the latest in a line of presidential celebrations of Diwali that goes back to President George W. Bush's time in office. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump also held Diwali celebrations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-speak-at-white-house-diwali-reception/7841523.html	2024-10-27T23:01:25-07:00	
After vote, Japan faces new era of political instability	Seoul, South Korea — Japan faced a period of political instability on Monday after its longtime ruling party suffered its worst election performance in 15 years, leaving Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba under pressure to resign and casting doubt on the makeup of the next government. Sunday’s vote saw the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner, Komeito, fail to secure a majority in the country’s powerful lower house, setting off a scramble to find smaller partners to form a government within 30 days. Ishiba, who became prime minister just last month, had hoped the election would solidify his leadership amid public outrage over a political funding scandal and rising living costs. Instead, his gamble backfired. The ruling coalition won just 215 seats, far short of the 233 needed for a majority. For the LDP, which has dominated Japan’s post-war politics, it was the worst showing since 2009, when the party lost power for four years. 'The result is that the Japanese political system is indeed entering a new and uncertain period,' said Tobias Harris, founder of Japan Foresight, a political risk advisory company. No easy path forward Despite major gains, the opposition – ranging from Communists to far-right groups – is seen as too divided to form a government. Many opposition parties have also ruled out joining a coalition with the LDP and Komeito, further complicating the path forward. Some analysts predict the LDP and Komeito may try to form a minority government, relying on smaller, center-right parties like the Democratic Party for the People and the Innovation Party, to pass legislation on a case-by-case basis. However, such an arrangement would not be 'particularly stable' and would be vulnerable to collapse if it fails to meet opposition demands, Harris wrote in a blog post. Another question is the fate of Ishiba himself. Just last month, Ishiba emerged victorious over his more conservative rivals within the LDP, including those loyal to the late prime minister and conservative icon Shinzo Abe. But the election result has weakened both Ishiba and the Abe faction, with many of Abe’s allies losing their seats after being implicated in the slush fund scandal. Though Ishiba has expressed eagerness to form a new government, analysts are divided on how long he can last as head of the LDP, especially with a difficult upper house election approaching in July. For now, Abe’s allies may be happy to let Ishiba deal with the consequences of this week’s defeat. 'It’s going to be a messy situation for months,' said James DJ Brown, a political science professor at Temple University Japan. 'In a way, it’s better for them to wait…then later on, at a moment of their choosing, push him aside and take power,' he added. Foreign policy challenges Despite the domestic upheaval, Japan’s foreign policy is not expected to undergo major changes, though some priorities may shift. Ishiba, a former defense minister, had embraced several controversial proposals, such as forming an Asian version of NATO and a nuclear-sharing arrangement with the United States. However, his weakened position means these plans are unlikely to gain traction. Instead, if he survives, Ishiba will likely focus on areas with broader political consensus, analysts say. 'There will be no big change on foreign policy. But obviously because of the outcome of this election, foreign policy will never be a top priority for the new government,' said Tetsuo Kotani, a professor of global studies at Meikai University in Chiba, Japan. This could raise concerns as Japan faces growing threats from North Korea, pressure from China, and uncertainty over the U.S. presidential election. Tomohiko Taniguchi, a former Abe advisor, noted that while the U.S.-Japan alliance remains a priority, many opposition parties are less interested in boosting Japan’s military capabilities. 'They’re not interested as much in raising tax revenue to help support the growing necessity for Japan to rearm itself more fundamentally,' said Taniguchi. A weakened Japanese prime minister could also struggle to negotiate with Donald Trump, should he win the U.S. presidential election next month, Taniguchi warned. 'To deal successfully with Mr. Trump, you need to be strong, you need to be well endowed with your political capital. And that's the thing that the Japanese leader – Ishiba, whoever – cannot show and cannot have.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-vote-japan-faces-new-era-of-political-instability/7841519.html	2024-10-27T22:53:52-07:00	
Russian aerial attacks hit Kherson, Kharkiv	Ukrainian officials said Monday that Russian aerial attacks overnight killed at least one person in Kherson and injured several people in Kharkiv. Kherson Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram that Russian shelling hit residential buildings in the city of Kherson. In Kharkiv, officials reported strikes from Russian guided bombs and shelling, including attacks that damaged an apartment building and a house. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram there were at least 13 people injured in the attacks that hit three districts of the city. Russia’s Defense Ministry reported Monday it destroyed 21 Ukrainian drones that were used in overnight attacks. The ministry said Russian air defense destroyed 13 of the drones over the Belgorod region, six over Byransk, one over Voronezh and one over Kursk. Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said drones damaged two businesses and injured two people.

China's private tutoring firms emerge from the shadows after crackdown	SHANGHAI/BEIJING — China is quietly easing regulatory pressure on private tutoring operators as it looks to revive a flagging economy, spurring a nascent revival of a sector hit hard by a government crackdown three years ago, according to industry figures, analysts and data reviewed by Reuters. There has been no formal acknowledgement of a change in policy. But there is now tacit consent from policymakers to allow the tutoring industry to grow, in a pivot by Beijing to support job creation, eight industry figures and two analysts familiar with the developments told Reuters. The shift is evident in new growth among tutoring businesses and moves by Beijing to clarify its approach, as well as in Reuters interviews with five Chinese parents who described a gradual liberalization in recent months. Details in this story about the relaxation of policy enforcement and the increasing openness of tutoring organizations' operations have not been previously reported. Starting in 2021, a government crackdown known as the 'double reduction' policy prohibited for-profit tutoring in core school subjects, with the aim of easing educational and financial pressure on parents and students. The move wiped billions of dollars off the market value of providers such as New Oriental Education & Technology Group and TAL Education Group and led to tens of thousands of job losses. Before the crackdown, China's for-profit tutoring industry was valued at some $100 billion and its three biggest players employed over 170,000 people. Still, the industry proved resilient, as parents like Michelle Lee, 36, continued to seek tutoring services to give their children a leg-up in China's ultracompetitive education system. Lee, who is based in southern China, spends 3,000 yuan a month, or about $420, on after-school classes for her son and daughter, including one-on-one mathematics tutoring and online lessons in English. She told Reuters that in recent months tutoring schools had been operating more openly than they have since 2021. 'When the policy first came out, I think those tutoring organizations were a little bit scared, so they kind of hid, like they would close the curtains during class,' she said. 'But it seems like they don't do that anymore.' In China's high-pressure educational environment, parents have little choice but to rely on outside tutoring just so their children can keep pace, Lee said, adding that she had 'felt a huge sense of failure' as she tried to support her children's education. China's education ministry did not respond to questions about its evolving approach to the tutoring industry. At a ministry press conference in March, Liu Xiya, a delegate of China's legislature and president of a Chongqing-based education group, told local media that 'pain points' in education policy were gradually being addressed. Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said China was unlikely to admit that the crackdown 'was a little too forceful.' Rather, there would be a 'tacit easing back toward a looser regulatory stance,' he said. 'The overall policy environment has shifted from restrictive to supportive as the main goal now is stabilization,' Song said, adding that the tutoring industry should benefit from the broader shift. Evolving environment Two executives at large tutoring companies who deal with regulatory issues told Reuters that government moves to ease the crackdown had accelerated in recent months. Most notable was a decision in August by the State Council, China's cabinet, to include education services in a 20-point plan to boost consumption - a key aspect of Beijing's efforts to fire up the economy. The move boosted stocks of listed education companies, and came as more than 11 million university graduates entered China's employment market. That announcement followed draft guidelines from China's education ministry in February, which clarified the kinds of off-campus tutoring that would be permitted, and its introduction last year of an online 'white list' of companies approved to provide tutoring in non-core subjects. In addition, inspections by local authorities of tutoring schools have lessened considerably this year, from their peak early in the crackdown, one of the executives said. Both executives said the message they have received from Chinese officials since August is that the tutoring industry will remain tightly regulated, but with a wider pathway to operate successfully and above-board, provided operators do not flout restrictions on teaching core academic curriculum. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk to the media. Claudia Wang, who leads the Asia Education Practice at consultancy Oliver Wyman, said that having eliminated some low-quality players, the government was pinning hope on the education sector to help address 'super high' youth unemployment. 'I think that's very, very fundamental to the shift,' Wang said. Hiring patterns and other moves by listed education firms point to an expansion of the industry this year. Active licenses for extracurricular for-profit tutoring centers rose 11.4% between January and June, according to research firm Plenum China. TAL and New Oriental have been hiring for thousands of positions this year, according to data from their annual reports and a Reuters review of job listings on major Chinese employment platforms. The number of schools and learning centers operated by New Oriental and TAL has also rebounded, according to data from the companies and Plenum China. The companies' shares have traded this year at their highest on average since 2021, though still far below pre-crackdown levels. New Oriental declined to comment to Reuters about how it was responding to the changing regulatory landscape, while TAL did not reply to a similar request. In its annual report in September, New Oriental noted continuing 'significant risks' from the ways in which regulations and policies related to private education are interpreted and implemented. 'We have been closely monitoring the evolving regulatory environment and are making efforts to seek guidance from, and cooperate with, the government authorities to comply,' the report said. Creative curriculum Another reason for the industry's revival is that it proved impossible to eliminate. In practice, private tutoring operators, while diminished, continued to exist in various forms, often redesigning courses to skirt restrictions or advertising them under code words. Mathematics-related courses, for example, are commonly marketed as 'logical thinking.' Lisa ran an English tutoring school in the eastern province of Zhejiang that shifted its curriculum to comply with rules that prohibit the teaching of core subjects such as mathematics and English. Lisa, who declined to give her full name for fear of official retribution, said she laid off 60% of her staff following the crackdown. But the school maintained classes by pivoting to teaching science-related courses in English, without calling them English classes. One-on-one tutoring, meanwhile, flourished as parents who could afford the higher prices hired tutors to come to their homes. That worried parents like Yang Zengdong, a Shanghai-based mother of two, who said the policy presented families with the unenviable choice of paying up to 800 yuan ($112) per class for a private tutor or investing hours each day themselves in helping their children keep up. 'If double reduction continues, the academic gap between rich people and everyone else will get worse,' she said. 'That wasn't what the policy was meant to do but that's the reality, so of course it needs to change.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-private-tutoring-firms-emerge-from-the-shadows-after-crackdown/7841514.html	2024-10-27T21:41:58-07:00	
Bavarian tradition honors St. Leonhard, patron saint of farmers, horses and livestock	WARNGAU, Germany — Farmers and their horses walked in a festive parade through the small Bavarian town of Warngau on Sunday to honor their patron saint, St. Leonhard. Their manes neatly combed, the massive horses were decorated with ribbons and greenery as they pulled the adorned carriages to a local church as part of the procession some 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Munich. Farmers donned colorful regional costumes and hats decorated with tufts of animal hair called Gamsbart, or chamois beards, as townspeople joined in amid the pounding of hooves. After the procession, the revelry traditionally turned to toasts with schnapps. Often called Leonhardiritt or Leonhardifahrt, the traditional pilgrimage dates back centuries in Bavaria and Austria. It was revived in Warngau in 1983, after an 80-year break, and takes place there each year on the fourth Sunday in October, ahead of the annual Nov. 6 feast day. St. Leonhard (St. Leonard in English) is the patron saint of farmers, horses and livestock. Also known as St. Leonard of Noblac, he was a Frankish courtier who asked God to repel an invading army, according to the Catholic News Agency. His plea worked, and he converted to Christianity following what he believed was a miracle. Other Bavarian towns have similar traditions. In Bad Tolz, southwest of Warngau, this year's Nov. 6 procession will be the 169th in a row. Bad Tolz's pilgrimage is listed on the Nationwide Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage by the German Commission for UNESCO. Only cold-blooded horses — large draft horses like Clydesdales — are allowed in the procession, which begins at 9 a.m. when all of the town's church bells ring. The crowd journeys to a Leonhardi chapel for blessings and an open-air Mass. The tradition involves the entire town, from the youth to the clergy and the city councilors. St. Leonhard mostly lived in monasteries and in seclusion in what is now France, though Bad Tolz calls him the 'Bavarian Lord.' According to legend, his prayers were believed to be breaking the chains of captives. He is also the patron saint of prisoners, among other groups. He died of natural causes around the year 559, and many Catholic churches have been dedicated to him throughout Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bavarian-tradition-honors-st-leonhard-patron-saint-of-farmers-horses-and-livestock/7841473.html	2024-10-27T19:11:13-07:00	
In Ecuador, power-dependent patients wait in anguish as government imposes hours-long blackouts	QUITO, Ecuador — The first time the electricity went off at night, Linda Vidal went into panic mode. For more than a year, the 52-year-old Ecuadorian woman suffering from Hodgkin lymphoma and a chronic respiratory disease has relied on an electricity-powered oxygen concentrator to breathe properly. Despite her condition, she is one of an estimated 1,000 power-dependent patients in Ecuador who spend hours in anguish as the government imposes electricity cuts of up to 14 hours a day to deal with a severe drought. Like other South American countries, Ecuador has faced a prolonged dry season that has hindered hydroelectric generation, which represents 72% of the national electricity production. When it's time for the power to go off, Vidal must sit still without fidgeting, in anguish. for as long as her device is off in order to be able to breathe. 'For me, having a supply of energy is extremely important,' said Vidal, who lives with her younger sister in the capital, Quito. 'I depend entirely on my oxygen concentrator, and I am always worried about whether we are going to have power cuts or not so that I can live.' According to the Ecuadorian Foundation Youth Against Cancer, there are about 1,000 patients suffering from respiratory problems in the country who require the same mechanical assistance as Vidal. 'Their life is at risk. It depends on elements that are basic rights like electricity or water,' said Gustavo Dávila, the foundation's director. The foundation says that changing a device like Linda's for one that works with batteries would cost more than $3,000, which is unfeasible given Vidal and her sister's modest income. 'The biggest risk I face is that by not being able to breathe I will not get enough oxygen to the brain and will suffer a stroke,' she said. Sitting in an armchair with her inseparable concentrator, which while connected emits a constant sound, pumps water and sends oxygen through a tube, she recounts how the recent power cuts have made her and her sister go through a nightmare. They are orphans, single and share a home in the north center of the capital where extensive rationing is divided into two scheduled outages each day: from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. and from 5 p.m. until midnight. Rationing 'is causing anxiety, anguish, fear of dying and could even trigger a panic attack that can produce tachycardia because the sufferer feels an imminent danger of death,' said psychologist Verónica Chávez, who has spent a decade working with patients at the Youth Against Cancer Foundation. Ecuador began establishing an electricity rationing system of up to 10 hours a day in some cities since mid-September, but the power cut hours announced Thursday are the most extreme so far. The drought affecting several countries in South America has been linked to the El Nino weather phenomenon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-ecuador-power-dependent-patients-wait-in-anguish-as-government-imposes-hours-long-blackouts/7841472.html	2024-10-27T19:04:34-07:00	
Missouri sports betting ballot measure highlights national debate about tax rates	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — The ads promoting a November ballot measure to legalize sports betting in Missouri tout the potential for millions of new tax dollars devoted to schools. If voters approve the measure, it's a good bet they will see even more ads offering special promotions for bettors. Many of those promotional costs — in which sportsbooks provide cash-like credits for customers to place bets — will be exempt from state taxes, effectively limiting the new revenue for education. The Missouri ballot measure highlights an emerging debate among policymakers over how to tax the rapidly growing industry, which has spread from one state — Nevada — to 38 states and Washington, D.C., since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to legalized sports wagering in 2018. 'It's a fledging industry,' said Brent Evans, an assistant finance professor at Georgia College & State University who has taught classes on gambling. 'So nobody really knows what is a reasonable tax.' Since authorizing sports betting, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., all have already raised or restructured their tax rates. And Colorado and Virginia have pared back the tax deductions they originally allowed. Tax rates range from a low of 6.75% in states such Iowa to 51% in states such as New York. That tax gap is even wider, because Iowa allows promotional bets to be deducted from taxable revenue while New York does not. About half the states allow tax deductions for promotional costs. It's a common way of enticing people to start — or continue — making bets. But in the short-term, it also can decrease the tax revenue available for governments and schools. Missouri's proposed 10% tax rate on sports betting revenue is below the national average of 19% that sportsbooks paid to states last year. Because of deductions for 'free play,' there could be some months in which sportsbooks owe nothing to the state. Missouri's proposed constitutional amendment acknowledges that possibility, stating that negative balances can be carried over from one month to the next until revenue rises enough to owe taxes. Unlike in some states, Missouri's amendment caps the amount of promotional credits that can be deducted from taxable revenue, at 25% of all wagers. But it appears unlikely that cap would come into play. An analysis conducted by consultant Eilers & Krejcik Gaming for amendment supporters projects promotional bets will comprise around 8% of total wagers in Missouri's first year of sports betting, declining after that. The Missouri proposal 'is very much in line with what has worked and been effective in other states,' said Jack Cardetti, a spokesman for Winning for Missouri Education, the group backing the measure. After voters narrowly approved it, Colorado launched sports betting in 2020 with a 10% tax rate and full deductions for promotional bets. It logged $2.7 billion of total bets during its first full fiscal year, yielding $8.1 million in taxes, just slightly below legislative projections. But Colorado changed its law starting in 2023 to cap promotional tax deductions at 2.5% of total bets, gradually declining to 1 .75% by July 2026. Colorado's sports betting tax revenue has since risen to over $30 million in its most recent fiscal year. That growth led lawmakers to place a proposal on the November ballot seeking permission for the state to keep more than the original $29 million limit on sports betting tax revenue. Capping tax deductions for promotional bets is a good step, said Richard Auxier, a principal policy associate at the nonprofit Tax Policy Center. But he questions why some states exempt them from taxes in the first place. 'We don't give out free samples of cannabis when a state legalizes cannabis,' Auxier said. 'Is this something you want to be subsidizing through your state tax policy — to encourage people to gamble?' The Missouri amendment was placed on the November ballot by initiative petition after legislation to legalize sports betting repeatedly stalled in the state Senate. The $43 million campaign — a record for a Missouri ballot measure — has been been funded entirely by DraftKings and FanDuel, which dominate the nationwide sports betting marketplace. If the measure passes, the companies could apply for two statewide licenses to conduct online sports betting. The amendment authorizes additional sports betting licenses for Missouri casinos and professional sports teams. The $14 million opposition campaign has been funded entirely by Caesars Entertainment, which operates three of Missouri's 13 casinos. Although Caesars generally supports sports betting, it opposes 'the way this measure is written,' said Brooke Foster, a spokesperson for the opposition group Missourians Against the Deceptive Online Gambling Amendment. In some other states, sports betting is run through casinos. Though research is limited, a study of seven states released last year found that casino gambling revenue declined as online sports betting increased. 'There will definitely be a shift from placing bets in a physical space with a Missouri incorporated casino versus hopping on an app in your living room,' Foster said. The effect of different tax rates can be seen in Illinois and New Jersey, which spearheaded the court challenge leading to widespread legal sports betting. People in each state placed between $11.5 billion and $12 billion of sports bets last year, resulting in $1 billion of revenue for sportsbooks after winnings were paid to customers, according to figures from the American Gaming Association. New Jersey took in $129 million in tax revenue, based on a 14.25% tax rate for online sports bets and a 9.75% tax rate with some promotional deductions for sports bets at casinos and racetracks. Illinois took in $162 million of tax revenue — one-quarter more than New Jersey — with a 15% tax rate in most places and no promotional deductions. But Illinois officials weren't satisfied with those results. Beginning in July, Illinois imposed a progressive tax scale, starting with a 20% tax on sports betting revenue of less than $30 million and rising to a 40% rate on revenue exceeding $200 million. Some sportsbooks representatives had raised the possibility of leaving Illinois if tax rates rose. But that hasn't happened. There's also not much evidence that sportsbooks worsen the odds for wagers in states where they pay higher taxes, said Joe Weinert, executive vice president of Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting firm. 'The sports betting operators compete vigorously for bettors,' he said, 'and how you compete vigorously is to offer attractive odds and good promotions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/missouri-sports-betting-ballot-measure-highlights-national-debate-about-tax-rates/7841467.html	2024-10-27T18:49:39-07:00	
How to prepare for potential health effects of upcoming end to daylight saving time	The good news: You will get a glorious extra hour of sleep. The bad: It'll be dark as a pocket by late afternoon for the next few months in the U.S. Daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. local time next Sunday, Nov. 3, which means you should set your clock back an hour before you go to bed. Standard time will last until March 9 when we will again 'spring forward' with the return of daylight saving time. That spring time change can be tougher on your body. Darker mornings and lighter evenings can knock your internal body clock out of whack, making it harder to fall asleep on time for weeks or longer. Studies have even found an uptick in heart attacks and strokes right after the March time change. 'Fall back' should be easier. But it still may take a while to adjust your sleep habits, not to mention the downsides of leaving work in the dark or trying exercise while there's still enough light. Some people with seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression usually linked to the shorter days and less sunlight of fall and winter, may struggle, too. Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have said it's time to do away with time switches and that sticking with standard time aligns better with the sun — and human biology. Most countries do not observe daylight saving time. For those that do — mostly in Europe and North America — the date that clocks are changed varies. Two states — Arizona and Hawaii — don't change and stay on standard time. Here's what to know about the twice yearly ritual. How the body reacts to light The brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that determines when we become sleepy and when we're more alert. The patterns change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into hard-to-wake teens. Morning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light in the evening — that extra hour from daylight saving time — delays that surge and the cycle gets out of sync. And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and metabolism. How do time changes affect sleep? Even an hour change on the clock can throw off sleep schedules — because even though the clocks change, work and school start times stay the same. That's a problem because so many people are already sleep deprived. About 1 in 3 U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven-plus hours nightly, and more than half of U.S. teens don't get the recommended eight-plus hours on weeknights. Sleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline, obesity and numerous other problems. How to prepare for the time change Some people try to prepare for a time change jolt by changing their bed times little by little in the days before the change. There are ways to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep. Will the U.S. ever get rid of the time change? Lawmakers occasionally propose getting rid of the time change altogether. The most prominent recent attempt, a now-stalled bipartisan bill named the Sunshine Protection Act, proposes making daylight saving time permanent. Health experts say the lawmakers have it backward — standard time should be made permanent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-to-prepare-for-potential-health-effects-of-upcoming-end-to-daylight-saving-time/7841456.html	2024-10-27T17:55:43-07:00	
Journalists trained to help stop Africa’s $90 billion lost to financial crime	Africa loses nearly $90 billion annually to financial crimes linked to corruption, tax evasion, environmental crime and more. But an initiative is training journalists to follow the money and expose how these crimes are connected to other illegal activities. For VOA, Senanu Tord reports from Accra.

Voters in Brazil's largest city reelect mayor, who detaches from Bolsonaro	SAO PAULO — Voters in Brazil's biggest city, Sao Paulo, on Sunday reelected mayor Ricardo Nunes following a tumultuous campaign that had pitted him against a leftist ally of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Nunes, who received lukewarm support from former President Jair Bolsonaro in the campaign, distanced himself from the far-right leader in his victory speech. Nunes, who inherited the mayorship after Bruno Covas died of cancer in 2021, had almost 60% of the vote to secure another four years on the job, election officials said. He topped lawmaker Guilherme Boulos in the runoff which followed a first round of voting on Oct. 7. The reelected mayor did not mention Bolsonaro as one of the people who helped him win and championed Sao Paulo Gov. Tarcisio de Freitas, an ally of the far-right leader. The former president's conservative base was split in Sao Paulo by Nunes and Pablo Marçal, who narrowly lost a place in Sunday's runoff. Nunes thanked 'the biggest leader, without whom we could not have had this victory, and that's Governor Tarcisio de Freitas.' Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo, said both Lula and Bolsonaro suffered defeats in the various mayoral elections held in Brazil. 'Neither have a positive tally in these elections. Bolsonaro was hidden in several places. Wherever he appeared too much, he lost,' Melo told The Associated Press. 'Lula lost the myth that he can transfer votes,' he added. 'It isn't that simple, these are different times. His administration might do relatively well in the economy, but it doesn't thrill anyone so far. The president had a big bet in Sao Paulo, in the city of Natal, and did not win.' Earlier, Gov. de Freitas added another chapter to the metropolis' troubled election. He claimed during a press conference, without providing evidence, that police had detected an endorsement of Boulos by criminal organization PCC. Boulos, who frequently accused Nunes of harboring members of the criminal group in his administration, said in a press conference the governor should be arrested for his comments during the vote. The leftist candidate said he was not going to deliver 'a loser's speech' after Nunes' victory. 'We lost an election, but in this campaign, we recovered the dignity of Brazil's left,' Boulos said. The federal lawmaker will be under pressure to leave his Socialism and Liberty Party for Lula's Workers' Party after the election. Most of the attention in this year's municipal elections in Brazil has been on Sao Paulo, where the first round of voting was marred by episodes of violence. Boulos, a longtime housing advocate for the poor, had his second consecutive defeat in the race. Other Brazilian cities with more than 200,000 registered voters were also holding mayoral elections. In Rio de Janeiro, incumbent Mayor Eduardo Paes was reelected in the first round for his fourth, non-consecutive term. Paes, an enthusiastic fan of Carnival, had Lula's support but focused his campaign on local issues against Bolsonaro's candidate, Alexandre Ramagem. Brazilians were also watching closely for results in Belo Horizonte, one of the country's biggest cities, where Mayor Fuad Noman beat pro-Bolsonaro candidate Bruno Engler. The vote in Fortaleza, another of the nation's biggest cities, was a dead heat between the candidate from Lula's Workers' Party, Evandro Leitão, and pro-Bolsonaro challenger André Fernandes. Leitão won by less than 1%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voters-in-brazil-s-largest-city-reelect-mayor-who-detaches-from-bolsonaro/7841441.html	2024-10-27T17:30:30-07:00	
Biden marks anniversary of Pittsburgh synagogue attack that killed 11	PITTSBURGH — President Joe Biden on Sunday marked the sixth anniversary of a gunman's deadly attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue and called out what he called an 'appalling surge of antisemitism' amid the war in Gaza. The 2018 attack claimed the lives of 11 worshippers from Dor Hadash, New Light and Tree of Life congregations, which shared space in the synagogue in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. Two worshippers and five responding police officers were also injured in the attack, the deadliest act of antisemitism in U.S. history. Biden said in a statement that the attack 'shattered families, pierced the heart of the Jewish community, and struck the soul of our nation.' But he said that in the years since, the Jewish community 'has also shown the country how to courageously turn pain into purpose' launching 'a global initiative to counter hate and hate-fueled violence.' Biden noted that the remembrance of the Pittsburgh synagogue attack comes weeks after the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack in Israel 'during which Hamas killed more than 1,200 people, took another 250 hostage and committed horrific acts of sexual assault.' He said the trauma and losses of Oct. 7 are made worse by 'the appalling surge of antisemitism against Jews in America and around the world.' The attack sparked a war between Israel and the militant group Hamas and has resulted in widespread destruction and civilian deaths in Gaza. Biden said his administration was implementing a national strategy to counter antisemitism, including securing $1.2 billion for security of nonprofits such as synagogues and Jewish community centers and day schools. He also cited the Justice Department's investigation and prosecution of antisemitic hate crimes and said his administration had 'put colleges on notice that antisemitism is discrimination' and barred under laws protecting civil rights. Vice President Kamala Harris also cited a rise in antisemitism in a statement marking the anniversary of the Pittsburgh attack. 'I will always work to ensure the safety and security of Jewish people in the United States and around the world and will always call out antisemitism whenever and wherever we see it,' she said. The Pittsburgh attacker was sentenced to death last year after being convicted on 63 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death. In June, ground was broken for a new complex on the Pittsburgh site that is to include a cultural center, sanctuary, educational center and museum along with a memorial to the slain worshipers from three congregations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-marks-anniversary-of-pittsburgh-synagogue-attack-that-killed-11/7841432.html	2024-10-27T17:11:12-07:00	
Georgian president calls for protests after ruling party wins disputed election	TBILISI — Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili called on Sunday for people to take to the streets to protest the results of Saturday's disputed parliamentary election, which the electoral commission said the ruling party had won. The Georgian Dream party clinched nearly 54% of the vote, the commission said, as opposition parties contested the result and vote monitors reported significant violations. Zourabichvili, a former Georgian Dream ally turned fierce critic of the ruling party, said she did not recognize the results and referred to the vote as a 'Russian special operation.' She did not clarify whether she believed Russia had a direct role in the elections. 'It was a total fraud, a total taking away of your votes,' Zourabichvili told reporters, flanked by Georgian opposition party leaders. Zourabichvili called on Georgians to protest in the center of the capital, Tbilisi, on Monday evening 'to announce to the world that we do not recognize these elections.' The results, with almost all precincts counted, were a blow for pro-Western Georgians who had cast the election as a choice between a ruling party that has deepened ties with Russia and an opposition aiming to fast-track integration with Europe. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, who is a member of Georgian Dream, on Sunday described his party's victory as 'impressive and obvious,' and said 'any attempts to talk about election manipulation ... are doomed to failure.' Georgian Dream, now headed for a fourth term in office, will take 89 seats in parliament, one less than it secured in 2020, the commission said, with four pro-Western opposition parties receiving 61 seats in total. A series of violations were reported on Sunday by three separate monitoring missions, including the 57-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The groups said the alleged violations, including ballot-stuffing, bribery, voter intimidation and violence near polling stations, could have affected the result but stopped short of calling the outcome fraudulent. 'We continue to express deep concerns about the democratic backsliding in Georgia,' said Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White, head of the European Parliament's delegation to the OSCE mission. 'The conduct of yesterday's election is unfortunately evidence to that effect,' he told reporters. In a post on X, European Council President Charles Michel called on Georgia's electoral commission to fully investigate the reported violations. 'We reiterate the EU's call to the Georgian leadership to demonstrate its firm commitment to the country's EU path,' he said. The electoral commission did not respond immediately to requests for comment, but on Saturday hailed a free and fair election. Prime Minister Kobakhidze said the observers' conclusions showed there was no doubt about the election's legitimacy. Georgia's four pro-Western opposition parties said they did not recognize the results, and some members pledged to boycott the new parliament and called for supporters to take to the streets. Coalition for Change opposition party leader Nika Gvaramia called the vote 'a constitutional coup' and a 'usurpation of power.' His party cited two exit polls that showed the opposition winning a majority of seats in parliament. The leader of the United National Movement opposition party, Tina Bokuchava, said the election had been 'stolen,' calling for protests. EU expansion challenge Georgian Dream's reclusive billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, who campaigned heavily on keeping Georgia out of the war in Ukraine, hailed the party's victory on Saturday night after its strongest performance since 2012. Electoral commission data showed it winning by huge margins of up to 90% in some rural areas, though it underperformed in bigger cities. Georgian Dream says it wants Georgia to join the European Union, though Brussels says the Caucasus country's membership application is frozen over what it says are the party's authoritarian tendencies. It has pushed through a law on 'foreign agents' and another curbing LGBT rights, both of which drew strong criticism from Western countries but were praised by some Russian officials. For years, Georgia was one of the most pro-Western countries to emerge from the Soviet Union, with polls showing many Georgians disliking Russia for its support of two breakaway regions of their country. Russia and Georgia fought a brief war over the rebel province of South Ossetia in 2008. Georgia was defeated. But the election result poses a challenge to the EU's ambition to bring in more ex-Soviet states. Last week, Moldova voted narrowly to approve its EU accession in a vote that Moldovan officials said was marred by Russian interference. An EU official told Reuters there was 'a sense of disappointment' over the Georgian opposition's performance, but Brussels was primarily concerned about a contested result leading to a standoff. The German, Estonian, Latvian foreign ministries said they were concerned by the reports of electoral irregularities. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who was quick to congratulate Georgian Dream, planned to visit the country on Monday, the Georgian government said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-president-calls-for-protests-after-ruling-party-wins-disputed-election/7841159.html	2024-10-27T15:48:37-07:00	
On Navajo Nation, push to electrify more homes on vast reservation	HALCHITA, Utah — After a five-year wait, Lorraine Black and Ricky Gillis heard the rumblings of an electrical crew reach their home on the sprawling Navajo Nation. In five days' time, their home would be connected to the power grid, replacing their reliance on a few solar panels and propane lanterns. No longer would the CPAP machine Gillis uses for sleep apnea or his home heart monitor transmitting information to doctors 400 miles away face interruptions due to intermittent power. It also means Black and Gillis can now use more than a few appliances — such as a fridge, a TV, and an evaporative cooling unit — at the same time. 'We're one of the luckiest people who get to get electric,' Gillis said. Many Navajo families still live without running water and electricity, a product of historic neglect and the struggle to get services to far-flung homes on the 70,000-square-kilometer (27,000-square-mile) Native American reservation that lies in parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Some rely on solar panels or generators, which can be patchy, and others have no electricity whatsoever. Gillis and Black filed an application to connect their home back in 2019. But when the coronavirus pandemic started ravaging the tribe and everything besides essential services was shut down on the reservation, it further stalled the process. Their wait highlights the persistent challenges in electrifying every Navajo home, even with recent injections of federal money for tribal infrastructure and services and as extreme heat in the Southwest intensified by climate change adds to the urgency. 'We are a part of America that a lot of the time feels kind of left out,' said Vircynthia Charley, district manager at the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, a non-for-profit utility that provides electric, water, wastewater, natural gas and solar energy services. For years, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority has worked to get more Navajo homes connected to the grid faster. Under a program called Light Up Navajo, which uses a mix of private and public funding, outside utilities from across the U.S. send electric crews to help connect homes and extend power lines. But installing power on the reservation roughly the size of West Virginia is time-consuming and expensive due to its rugged geography and the vast distances between homes. Drilling for power poles there can take several hours because of underground rock deposits while some homes near Monument Valley must have power lines installed underground to meet strict regulations around development in the area. About 32% of Navajo homes still have no electricity. Connecting the remaining 10,400 homes on the reservation would cost $416 million, said Deenise Becenti, government and public affairs manager at the utility. This year, Light Up Navajo connected 170 more families to the grid. Since the program started in 2019, 882 Navajo families have had their homes electrified. If the program stays funded, Becenti said it could take another 26 years to connect every home on the reservation. Those that get connected immediately reap the benefits. Until this month, Black and Gillis' solar panels that the utility installed a few years ago would last about two to three days before their battery drained in cloudy weather. It would take another two days to recharge. 'You had to really watch the watts and whatever you're using on a cloudy day,' Gillis said. Then a volunteer power crew from Colorado helped install 14 power poles while the tribal utility authority drilled holes six feet deep in which the poles would sit. The crew then ran a wire about a mile down a red sand road from the main power line to the couple's home. 'The lights are brighter,' Black remarked after her home was connected. In recent years, significantly more federal money has been allocated for tribes to improve infrastructure on reservations, including $32 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — of which Navajo Nation received $112 million for electric connections. The Navajo tribal utility also received $17 million through the Biden administration's climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, to connect families to the electric grid. But it can be slow to see the effects of that money on the ground due to bureaucracy and logistics. Next spring, the tribal utility authority hopes to connect another 150 homes, including the home of Priscilla and Leo Dan. For the couple, having grid electricity at their home near Navajo Mountain in Arizona would end a nearly 12-year wait. They currently live in a recreational vehicle elsewhere closer to their jobs but have worked on their home on the reservation for years. With power there, they could spend more time where Priscilla grew up and where her dad still lives. It would make life simpler, Priscilla said. 'Because otherwise, everything, it seems like, takes twice as long to do.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-navajo-nation-push-to-electrify-more-homes-on-vast-reservation-/7841155.html	2024-10-27T15:31:40-07:00	
Egypt’s el-Sissi proposes 2-day Gaza cease-fire, release of 4 hostages	Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on Sunday proposed a two-day cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, with the militant group also freeing four hostages during the halt in fighting if implemented. Neither Israel nor Hamas offered any immediate response to el-Sissi’s plan, the first he has proposed during months of playing a role, along with the United States and Qatar, in trying to broker a halt to fighting in the 13-month war and the release of the remaining 101 hostages, about one-third of whom are believed to be dead. Speaking in Cairo, el-Sissi said the plan also calls for more humanitarian aid for famished Palestinians in Gaza, the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea. El-Sissi said the proposal aims to 'move the situation forward.' He said that if the two-day cease-fire deal is adopted, negotiations would continue to make it permanent. There has been no cease-fire since last November's weeklong pause in fighting and hostage and prisoner exchange. Meanwhile, Israel's Mossad chief, David Barnea, headed to Doha on Sunday for talks with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and U.S. CIA chief William Burns. On the battlefront, fighting raged. Israeli strikes on northern Gaza killed at least 33 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Sunday, as Israel's offensive in the hard-hit and isolated area entered a third week. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the plight of Palestinians there 'unbearable.' Israel said it targeted militants. In a separate development, a truck rammed into a bus stop near Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding more than 30 others. Israeli police said the attacker was an Arab citizen of Israel. The ramming occurred outside a military base and near the headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, meanwhile, said Israeli strikes on the country on Saturday in response to an October 1 ballistic missile attack by Iran 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for retaliation. It was Israel's first open attack on its archenemy. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes achieved Israel's goals. 'We severely harmed Iran's defense capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed toward us,' the Israeli leader said. Satellite images showed damage to two secretive Iranian military bases, one linked to work on nuclear weapons that Western intelligence agencies and nuclear inspectors say was discontinued in 2003, and another linked to Iran's ballistic missile program. Iran on Sunday said a civilian had been killed, with no details. It earlier said four people with the military air defense were killed. That exchange of attacks has raised fears of an all-out regional war pitting Israel and the United States against Iran and its militant proxies, which include Hamas and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion earlier in October after nearly a year of lower-level conflict. Hamas and Hezbollah are U.S.-designated terror groups. In its latest fighting, two Israeli strikes killed eight people in Sidon city in southern Lebanon, with 25 wounded, according to Lebanon's health ministry. One strike hit a residential building, according to footage taken by an Associated Press reporter. The Israeli military said four soldiers, including a military rabbi, were killed in fighting in southern Lebanon, without providing details. It said five other personnel were severely wounded. An explosive drone and a projectile fired from Lebanon wounded five people in Israel, authorities said. The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed nearly 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/egypt-s-el-sissi-proposes-2-day-gaza-cease-fire-release-of-4-hostages/7841146.html	2024-10-27T14:49:14-07:00	
Lithuania left-wing opposition leading in early election results	VILNIUS, Lithuania — The opposition Social Democrats took an early lead in the second round of Lithuania's parliamentary election on Sunday, with voters focusing on concerns over the cost of living and potential threats from neighboring Russia. Official government data showed the center-left grouping leading with 33 seats after 64% of the vote was counted on top of 20 secured in the first round, in the 141-member assembly, ahead of the ruling Homeland Union Party which led in six constituencies in addition to 18 first-round wins. The Baltic country of 2.9 million people has a hybrid voting system in which half of parliament is elected by popular vote. The remainder is decided in district-based run-off votes between the top two candidates, a process that favors the larger parties. If the Social Democrats, or SD, succeed in forming a government, they are expected to maintain Lithuania's hawkish stance against Russia and hefty defense spending. Lithuania will spend about 3% of GDP on its armed forces this year, according to NATO estimates, making it the military alliance's sixth-biggest spender. Full results are expected at about midnight (2200 GMT). 'Probably there will be some changes, but I want to believe that direction will remain the same,' Marius Slepetis, a businessman, told Reuters after his young daughter dropped his ballot into the box. The SD won 20% of the vote in the first round on Oct. 13, making it the largest party ahead of the ruling Homeland Union with 18% and the anti-establishment Nemunas Dawn with 15%. Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte's center-right three-party coalition has seen its popularity eroded by inflation that topped 20% two years ago, deteriorating public services and a widening rich-poor gap. After the first round, SD leader Vilija Blinkeviciute said she was already in talks about forming a majority coalition government with two other parties - For Lithuania, and the Farmers and Greens Union. The SD made a pact with opposition parties to support all run-off candidates in contests against Simonyte's Homeland Union nominees. Domestic economic issues were in focus during the election campaign, with the SD vowing to tackle increased inequality by raising taxes on wealthier Lithuanians to help fund more spending on health care and social support. But national security is also a major concern in Lithuania, which lies on the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union and shares a border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus, a close Moscow ally. 'For me, it's of utmost importance to keep the calmness, and to stop the war in Ukraine,' Mykolas Zvinys, 79, told Reuters before casting his vote on the outskirts of Vilnius. Three-quarters of Lithuanians think Russia could attack their country in the near future, a Baltijos Tyrimai/ELTA opinion poll found in May.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuania-left-wing-opposition-leading-in-early-election-results/7841137.html	2024-10-27T13:54:20-07:00	
Iran: 4 'terrorists' killed after Saturday's jihadist attack	Tehran — Iranian armed forces killed at least four 'terrorists' in the southeast of the country on Sunday after a deadly jihadist attack on police the day before. At least 10 police officers were killed in the attack, one of the deadliest claimed by a jihadist group in a border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The attack targeted police cars in Taftan county, part of Sistan and Baluchestan, a region some 1,200 kilometers from the capital, Tehran. The Sunni jihadist group Jaish al-Adl ('Army of Justice' in Arabic), based in Pakistan and active in the area, claimed responsibility for the attack via the Telegram messaging service. According to the Tasnim news agency, law enforcement officers killed at least four of the 'terrorists' involved in the attack during a drone targeting operation. 'During this operation, four terrorists were killed, others escaped and four were arrested,' the agency added. Sistan and Baluchestan, which shares a long, porous border with Pakistan and Afghanistan, is one of the poorest parts of Iran. The region is home to a large population of the Baloch ethnic minority, who practice Sunni Islam in contrast to the country's predominant Shia branch. Recurring clashes there pit Iranian security forces against rebels from the Baluch minority, radical Sunni groups, and drug traffickers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-four-terrorists-killed-after-saturday-jihadist-attack/7841128.html	2024-10-27T13:35:39-07:00	
Russian forces thwart attempted cross-border assault from Ukraine, official says	Kyiv, Ukraine — Russian forces thwarted an attempt at another cross-border incursion by Ukraine into southwestern Russia, a local official reported Sunday, months after Kyiv staged a bold assault on its nuclear-armed enemy that Moscow is still struggling to halt. An 'armed group' sought Sunday to breach the border between Ukraine and Russia's Bryansk region, its governor, Aleksandr Bogomaz, said but was beaten back. Bogomaz did not clarify whether Ukrainian soldiers carried out the alleged attack but claimed on Sunday evening that the situation was 'stable and under control' by the Russian military. There was no immediate acknowledgement or response from Ukrainian officials. The region neighbors Kursk province, where Ukraine launched a surprise push on Aug. 6 that rattled the Kremlin and constituted the largest attack on Russia since World War II. Hundreds of Russian prisoners were blindfolded and ferried away in trucks in the opening moments of the lightning advance, and Ukraine's battle-hardened units swiftly pressed on across hundreds of square kilometers of territory. Responsibility for previous incursions into Russia's Belgorod and Bryansk regions has been claimed by two murky groups: the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion. Russian officials and state media have sought to downplay the significance of Kyiv's thunderous run in Kursk, but the country's forces have so far been unable to dislodge Ukrainian troops from the province. Western officials have speculated that Moscow may send troops from North Korea to bolster its effort to do so, stoking the almost three-year war and bringing geopolitical consequences as far away as the Indo-Pacific region. Russian lawmakers Thursday ratified a pact with Pyongyang envisioning mutual military assistance, a move that comes as the United States confirmed the deployment of 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia. North Korean units were detected Wednesday in Kursk, according to Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate, known by its acronym GUR. The soldiers had undergone several weeks of training at bases in eastern Russia and had been equipped with clothes for the coming winter, the GUR said in a statement late Thursday. It did not provide evidence for its claims. Moscow warns West against approving long-range strikes against Russia Also on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow is working on ways to respond if the U.S. and its NATO allies allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range Western missiles. Putin told Russian state TV that it was too early to say exactly how Moscow might react, but the defense ministry has been mulling a range of options. Russia has repeatedly signaled that it would view any such strikes as a major escalation. The Kremlin leader warned on Sept. 12 that Moscow would be 'at war' with the U.S. and NATO states if they approve them, claiming military infrastructure and personnel from the bloc would have to be involved in targeting and firing the missiles. He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv. Putin also declared the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, opening the door to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they need permission to strike weapons depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. In response, U.S. defense officials have argued that the missiles are limited in number, and that Ukraine is already using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. That capability was evidenced by a Ukrainian drone strike in mid-September that hit a large Russian military depot in a town 500 kilometers from the border. The U.S. allows Kyiv to use American-provided weapons in more limited, cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. Civilian deaths reported in Kherson as warring sides trade drone strikes In a separate update, Bryansk Gov. Bogomaz claimed that more than a dozen Ukrainian drones were shot down over the region on Sunday. Separately, at least 16 drones were downed over other Russian regions, including the Tambov province some 450 kilometers north of the border, officials reported. There were no reports of casualties from any of the alleged attacks. In Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, Russian shelling killed three civilians on Sunday, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin claimed. Another Kherson resident died in a blaze sparked by shells hitting a high-rise, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service. Air raid sirens wailed for more than three hours in Kyiv overnight into Sunday, and city authorities later reported that 'around 10' drones had been shot down. They said no one had been hurt. Ukraine's air force on Sunday reported that it had shot down 41 drones launched by Russia across Ukrainian territory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-forces-thwart-attempted-cross-border-assault-from-ukraine-official-says/7841129.html	2024-10-27T13:33:36-07:00	
Indonesia's Marapi volcano erupts, spewing ash and hot clouds	Padang, Indonesia — One of Indonesia’s most active volcanoes erupted Sunday, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing villages with debris, but no casualties were reported. Mount Marapi, in Agam district of the province of West Sumatra, is known for sudden eruptions that are difficult to predict because they are not caused by a deep movement of magma, which sets off tremors that register on seismic monitors. It unleashed hot ash clouds that spread for several kilometers, covering nearby villages and towns with thick volcanic residue, said Ahmad Rifandi, an official with Indonesia’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center at the Marapi monitoring post. It also shot ash columns as high as 2,000 meters. Rifandi said the nearly 2,900-meter volcano has stayed at the second highest of four alert levels since January, prohibiting climbers and villagers within 3 kilometers from the crater’s mouth because of potential lava. Marapi erupted in December 2023, killing 24 climbers and injuring several others who were caught by its sudden weekend eruption. Two climbing routes in the mountain have been closed since then. Sunday’s eruption came five months after monsoon rains triggered a landslide of mud and cold lava from Mount Marapi, causing rivers to breach their banks. The deluge tore through mountainside villages and swept away people and dozens of homes, killing 67 people. 'Villagers are still haunted by the flash floods of cold lava as rainy season is coming,' Rifandi said, 'But they have learned an important lesson on how to avoid the danger of eruption.' Indonesia, an archipelago of 282 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along the 'Ring of Fire,' a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-marapi-volcano-erupts-spewing-ash-and-hot-clouds/7841124.html	2024-10-27T13:05:24-07:00	
Destruction of Lebanon-Syria border crossings in Israeli airstrikes creates difficulties	Qusair, Syria — A stream of refugees fleeing Lebanon to Syria crossed a narrow makeshift bridge on foot Sunday in the Qusair area of Syria's Homs province after the official border crossing was put out of commission by an Israeli strike two days earlier. Only three functioning crossings remain between the countries, which share a border 375 kilometers (233 miles) long. In late September, an Israeli airstrike hit the border crossing of Matraba in Lebanon's northeast, forcing it to close. A few weeks later came a strike on Masnaa, the main crossing between the two countries, putting it out of service. The Jousieh crossing was struck on Friday. The Israeli military has accused the Hezbollah militant group of using the crossings to move weapons and military equipment from Syria to Lebanon. But humanitarian officials say that the closure of the crossings have intensified an already severe humanitarian crisis by blocking key routes for supplies and impeding access for those fleeing to safety. 'The situation is a tragedy,' said Ghossoun Mubarak, who fled with her three children from the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, describing the bombardment that pushed her to leave her home. They crossed via the makeshift foot bridge on Sunday. The United Nations refugee agency, or UNHCR, said this week that around 430,000 people had crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past month since Israel launched a major aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon as part of its push against Hezbollah. Lebanese officials give a higher estimate of more than half a million people. Rula Amin, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, voiced concern over the damage to the crossings, calling them 'a main lifeline for people escaping the conflict.' 'Today, it was better,' said Omar Abu Jabal, 29, who was returning to Lebanon Sunday via the Jousieh crossing after a work trip. 'No issues along the way. But before, there were bombings, which stopped people from moving.' Nabil Aakoul, director of transportation for the Homs province, said the recent strikes destroyed a bridge over the Orontes River, disrupting movement between vital agricultural areas. Aakoul estimated that rebuilding the bridge will cost around 35 billion Syrian pounds (around $2.5 million dollars at the official exchange rate), while the damage has severed access to agricultural areas and isolated communities dependent on cross-river trade and travel. Yahya Abu Youssef, who lives near the damaged bridge, described the strike as 'inhumane' and reported injuries to children and livestock nearby. 'All that's here is a bridge connecting villages and farms,' he said, noting that villagers now face an additional 10 kilometers (6 miles) of travel to reach the city of Homs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/destruction-of-lebanon-syria-border-crossings-in-israeli-airstrikes-creates-difficulties/7841107.html	2024-10-27T12:37:38-07:00	
Venom: The Last Dance' misses projections as superhero films' grip on theaters loosens	New York — 'Venom: The Last Dance' showed less bite than expected at the box office, collecting $51 million in its opening weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, significantly down from the alien symbiote franchise's previous entries. Projections for the third 'Venom' film from Sony Pictures had been closer to $65 million. More concerning, though, was the drop off from the first two 'Venom' films. The 2018 original debuted with $80.2 million, while the 2021 follow-up, 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage,' opened with $90 million even as theaters were still in recovery mode during the pandemic. 'The Last Dance,' starring Tom Hardy as a journalist who shares his body with an alien entity also voiced by Hardy, could still turn a profit for Sony. Its production budget, not accounting for promotion and marketing, was about $120 million — significantly less than most comic-book films. But 'The Last Dance' is also performing better overseas. Internationally, 'Venom: The Last Dance' collected $124 million over the weekend, including $46 million over five days of release in China. That's good enough for one of the best international weekends of the year for a Hollywood release. Still, neither reviews (36% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audience scores (a franchise-low 'B-' CinemaScore) have been good for the film scripted by Kelly Marcel and Hardy, and directed by Marcel. The low weekend for 'Venom: The Last Dance' also likely insures that superhero films will see their lowest-grossing year in a dozen years, not counting the pandemic year of 2020, according to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment. Following on the heels of the 'Joker: Folie à Deux' flop, Gross estimates that 2024 superhero films will gross about $2.25 billion worldwide. The only upcoming entry is Marvel's 'Kraven the Hunter,' due out Dec. 13. Even with the $1.3 billion of 'Deadpool & Wolverine,' the genre hasn't, overall, been dominating the way it once did. In 2018, for example, superhero films accounted for more than $7 billion in global ticket sales. Last week's top film, the Paramount Pictures horror sequel 'Smile 2,' dropped to second place with $9.4 million. That brings its two-week total to $83.7 million worldwide. The weekend's biggest success story might have been 'Conclave,' the papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes and directed by Edward Berger ('All Quiet on the Western Front'). The Focus Features release, a major Oscar contender, launched with $6.5 million in 1,753 theaters. That put 'Conclave' into third place, making it the rare adult-oriented drama to make a mark theatrically. Some 77% of ticket buyers were over the age of 35, Focus said. With a strong opening and stellar reviews, 'Conclave' could continue to gather momentum both with moviegoers and Oscar voters. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. 'Venom: The Last Dance,' $51 million. 2. 'Smile 2,' $9.4 million. 3. 'Conclave,' $6.5 million. 4. 'The Wild Robot,' $6.5 million. 5. 'We Live in Time,' $4.8 million. 6. 'Terrifier 3,' $4.3 million. 7. 'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,' $3.2 million. 8. 'Anora,' $867,142. 9. 'Piece by Piece,' $720,000. 10. 'Transformers One,' $720,000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venom-the-last-dance-misses-projections-as-superhero-films-grip-on-theaters-loosens/7841103.html	2024-10-27T12:26:03-07:00	
Opposition decries results of Georgia's parliamentary election	The former Soviet republic of Georgia’s ruling party is claiming victory following Saturday’s parliamentary elections.

More than 120 killed in paramilitary rampage in Sudan, UN and doctors group say	Cairo — Fighters from the notorious paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ran riot in east-central Sudan in a multi-day attack that killed more than 120 people in one town, a doctors group and the United Nations said. It was the group's latest attack against the Sudanese military after suffering a series of setbacks, losing ground to the military in the area. The war, which has been going on for more than a year and a half, has wrecked the African country, displacing millions of its population and pushing it to the brink of a full-blown famine. RSF fighters went on a rampage in villages and towns on the eastern and northern sides of the province of Gezira between Oct. 20-25, shooting at civilians and sexually attacking women and girls, the United Nations said in a statement Saturday, adding that they looted private and public properties, including open markets. The attack displaced more than 4,000 people in the city of Tambiuk and other villages in eastern Gezira, according to the International Organization for Migration’s Tracking Matrix. 'The killings and appalling human rights violations in Gezira province intensify the unacceptable human toll this conflict has taken on the people of Sudan,' IOM Director General Amy Pope told The Associated Press ahead of her trip to the country next week. She called for concerted international efforts to stop the conflict, saying: 'There is no time to lose. Millions of lives are in the balance.' 'These are atrocious crimes,' Clementine Nkweta-Salami, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, said in a statement on Saturday. 'Women, children, and the most vulnerable are bearing the brunt of a conflict that has already taken far too many lives.' She said the attacks resembled the horrors committed during the Darfur genocide in the early 2000s, including rape, sexual violence, and mass killings. The RSF was born out of Arab militias, commonly known as Janjaweed, mobilized by ex-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir against populations in Darfur that identify as Central or East African. At the time, the Janjaweed were accused of mass killings, rapes and other atrocities, and Darfur became synonymous with genocide. Janjaweed groups still aid the RSF. The Sudanese Doctors’ Union said in a statement that at least 124 people were killed and 200 others were wounded in the town of Sariha, adding that the group rounded up at least 150 others. It called on the U.N. Security Council to pressure the RSF to open 'safe corridors' to enable aid groups to reach people in impacted villages. 'There is no way to help the injured or evacuate them for treatment,' the statement said. Footage circulating online, some shared by RSF fighters themselves, showed members of the paramilitary group abusing detained people. One video showed a man wearing a military uniform grabbing an old man by the chin and dragging him around as other armed men chanted in the background. The RSF didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Coordination of Civilian Democratic Forces, an alliance of pro-democracy parties and groups, also accused the RSF of storming villages, and opening fire on civilians as well as rounding up and mistreating 'a large number of residents.' In a statement, the alliance held the RSF 'responsible for these massive violations,' and called for holding the preparators accountable. The attack on Gezira came as the military had successfully taken back areas held by the RSF. In September, the military launched a massive operation in and around the capital city of Khartoum, reclaiming large swaths of areas from the RSF. Also, earlier this month, it seized control of Jebel Moya, a strategic mountainous area in Gezira province, as well as areas in Gezira and nearby Sinnar province, driving out RSF forces. In October, a top RSF commander, Abu Aqlah Keikel, the de facto ruler of Gezira, defected and surrendered himself to the military. That prompted RSF fighters to attack villages and towns in Gezira seen as loyal to Keikel, according to local reports. The war in Sudan began in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in Khartoum, before spreading across the country. The war has been marked by atrocities such as mass rape and ethnically motivated killings. The U.N. and international rights groups say these acts amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly in the western region of Darfur, which has been facing a bitter onslaught by the RSF. The conflict has killed more than 24,000 people so far, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group monitoring the conflict since it started.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-120-killed-in-paramilitary-rampage-in-sudan-un-and-doctors-group-say-/7841028.html	2024-10-27T10:34:00-07:00	
Polls close in Uzbekistan's parliamentary election held without real opposition	Polls closed in Uzbekistan's parliamentary election Sunday that featured no real opposition to the Central Asian country’s strongman president, despite a recent overhaul of the electoral system and years of reform that have included economic liberalization and easing censorship. Shavkat Mirziyoyev retains a tight grip on power in the country of 37 million. Since taking office in 2016, he has enjoyed broad support for a slew of political and economic reforms that relaxed the repressive policies of his predecessor, longtime dictatorial leader Ismail Karimov. Over 71% of voters had cast their ballots by 5 p.m. (1200 GMT), election authorities said, well above the 33% needed for the vote to be valid. Preliminary results are expected on Monday and the final ones within 10 days. Mirziyoyev has released some political prisoners, allowed the emergence of some independent news media and bloggers, and eased the tight controls on Islam that Karimov imposed to counter dissident views. But reform appeared to stall last year, following a constitutional referendum in April that reset presidential term limits and could pave the way for Mirziyoyev to stay in office until 2037. Parliament rarely opposes laws drafted by Mirziyoyev's Cabinet, while rights groups say thousands of people in Uzbekistan remain imprisoned on false charges. Mirziyoyev’s government in 2022 claimed to have eliminated what rights groups said had amounted to systemic forced labor, but some concerns have remained. Under changes introduced last year, Uzbekistan switched to a mixed election system, with half of its 150 lawmakers elected from party lists and the other half elected individually. The new rules also stipulate that 40% of those running for parliament must be women. However, all candidates running in Sunday’s vote have been nominated by the country’s five registered parties. There are differences in focus among the parties, some of which stress issues such as the business climate or environmental protection, but none of them oppose Mirziyoyev.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polls-close-in-uzbekistan-s-parliamentary-election-held-without-real-opposition/7840990.html	2024-10-27T09:32:48-07:00	
Brazil runoff vote in city elections expected to confirm right-wing clout	BRASILIA — Brazilians on Sunday began voting in 51 cities for municipal officials in runoff elections expected to confirm a swing to the right of the electorate and redraw the political landscape for presidential and congressional elections in 2026. Right and center-right parties are favored to win most of the 15 state capitals that will pick mayors for the next four years, with former hard-right President Jair Bolsonaro's Liberal Party (PL) enhancing its political clout. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's leftist Workers Party (PT) has done poorly, in part due to his falling popularity. In his main bastion of support, the poorer northeastern Brazil, the PT is in a tight race against the PL for mayor of Fortaleza. Lula has appeared reluctant to campaign for candidates at risk of being defeated, and a head injury a week ago kept him away from the campaign trail in its closing days. Heading a minority government, Lula has become increasingly hostage to a Conservative Congress in Brasilia to be able to govern. The jewel in the crown of Sunday's election is Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, where Mayor Ricardo Nunes, endorsed by Bolsonaro, is expected to win re-election and defeat his leftist challenger Guilherme Boulos, who is backed by Lula. A six-day power blackout this month in the city lost Nunes points, but polls show those voters did not switch to Boulos. A Datafolha poll on Saturday said Nunes was leading Boulos by 48% to 37% in voter support. Sao Paulo is a key race in setting the stage for the 2026 elections, showing that Bolsonaro's right-wing movement remains strong even though he was banned from seeking elected office until 2030 for his baseless attacks on Brazil's voting system. The electoral growth of the right has led to divisions in its ranks, especially in Sao Paulo where Bolsonaro supporters were split between his candidate, the incumbent Nunes, and far-right influencer Pablo Marcal, who has positioned himself as Bolsonaro's political heir. In the farm state Goias, Bolsonaro's PL party went head-to-head in the mayor's race in Goiania against the candidate of the conservative Uniao Brasil, who was backed by Governor Ronaldo Caiado, a more moderate possible standard-bearer of the right. The runoffs were being held in cities of more than 200,000 voters where no candidate won a majority in the first round vote on Oct. 6, which boosted Brazil's center-right while Lula's PT failed to win any of the state capitals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-runoff-vote-in-city-elections-expected-to-confirm-right-wing-clout-/7840995.html	2024-10-27T09:31:27-07:00	
Bolivia's ex-President Morales claims his car was shot at in attempted assassination	La Paz, Bolivia — Former President Evo Morales of Bolivia claimed he survived an assassination attempt on Sunday after unidentified men opened fire on his car. He was not injured and there was no immediate confirmation of the attack from authorities. Morales alleged the shots were fired while he was being driven in Bolivia's coca leaf-growing region of Chapare, the ex-president's rural stronghold whose residents have blockaded the country's main east-west highway for the past two weeks. The roadblocks — protesting what Morales' supporters decry as President Luis Arce's attempts to sabotage his former mentor and bitter political rival — have isolated cities and disrupted food and fuel supplies. Morales, who led Bolivia from 2006-2019, emerged unscathed from the alleged attack Sunday, appearing on his weekly radio show in his usual calm manner to recount what happened. He told the radio host that as he was leaving home for the radio station, hooded men fired at least 14 shots at his car, wounding his driver. Morales was quick to blame his successor, President Arce, with whom he is fighting to be the candidate of governing socialist party in next year's presidential election. He claimed that Arce's government resorted to physical force having been unable to defeat him politically. 'Arce is going to go down as the worst president in history,' Morales said. 'Shooting a former president is the last straw.' Officials in Arce's government did not respond to requests for comment on the incident. Cellphone video circulating online shows Morales' driver bleeding from the back of his head. Morales can be seen in the passenger's seat holding a phone to his ear as the vehicle swerves and a woman's voice shrieks 'Duck!' The footage shows the car's front windshield cracked by at least three bullets and its rear windshield shattered. Morales can be heard saying, 'Papacho has been shot in the head,' apparently referring to his driver. 'They are shooting at us,' Morales continues on the phone. 'They shot the tire of the car and it stopped on the road.' Morales' claim deepens political tensions in Bolivia at a volatile moment for the cash-strapped Andean nation of 12 million. In June there was an alleged attempted coup by a rogue general. Last month Morales led a massive march against the government's mismanagement of the economy that quickly devolved into street clashes with pro-government mobs. Imported goods are scarce and prices are rising. Drivers wait for hours to fill up at gas stations. The gap between the official and black-market exchange rates is widening. Earlier this month, the feud between Morales and Arce moved to the courts as Bolivian prosecutors launched an investigation into accusations that Morales fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl in 2016, classifying their relationship as statutory rape. Morales has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and refused to testify in the case. Since reports surfaced of a possible arrest warrant against him, the ex-president has been holed up in the Chapare region, in central Bolivia, where supportive coca growers have kept vigilant watch to protect him from arrest. Arce accuses Morales of trying to undermine his administration to advance his own ambitions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-s-ex-president-morales-claims-his-car-was-shot-at-in-attempted-assassination/7840910.html	2024-10-27T08:11:13-07:00	
Real Madrid, Spanish league and government condemn racist insults against Yamal in league 'clasico'	Madrid — Real Madrid, the Spanish league and the local government on Sunday condemned racist insults against Lamine Yamal during Saturday's 'clasico,' and Madrid said it was working to identify those who abused the Barcelona forward. Madrid said it 'has opened an investigation in order to locate and identify the perpetrators of these deplorable and despicable insults so that the appropriate disciplinary and judicial measures can be taken.' The league said it was going to formally denounce the 'intolerable racist' insults and gestures against Barcelona players at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. The league said it 'strongly condemns these events' and 'remains firm in its commitment to eradicate any type of racist behavior and hatred inside and outside stadiums. There is no place for this scourge in sport.' The Spanish government said the commission in charge of fighting against violence, racism and other hate crimes in sport will meet Monday to analyze what happened at the Bernabeu. 'The 'clasico' is one of the greatest spectacles in the world, a true expression of the importance that soccer has in our country,' the government said. 'During this game, or in any sporting event, there can never be any room for expressions of violence, racism, xenophobia, hatred or intolerance.' The reaction came after videos on social media showed the alleged insults against Yamal after he scored Barcelona's third goal in the second half of its 4-0 rout of Madrid. The 17-year-old celebrated in a corner in front of Madrid fans and made some gestures apparently provoking the fans. A few fans could be heard yelling insults at Yamal and the other Barcelona players. 'Real Madrid strongly condemns any kind of behavior involving racism, xenophobia or violence in football and sport, and deeply regrets the insults that a few fans uttered last night in one of the corners of the stadium,' the club said in a statement. Madrid has been denouncing racist insults against its forward Vinicius Junior, who is also Black, for several years, including when he played a match at Barcelona's Camp Nou Stadium. Four Atletico Madrid fans who allegedly led a social media campaign aimed at promoting racist acts against Vinícius were detained earlier this month. Barcelona's victory left the Catalan club six points ahead of Madrid at the top of the league standings after 11 matches.	https://www.voanews.com/a/real-madrid-spanish-league-and-government-condemn-racist-insults-against-yamal-in-league-clasico-/7840870.html	2024-10-27T07:21:35-07:00

South Korean Christian groups in massive protest against rights for same-sex couples	SEOUL — Hundreds of thousands of members of South Korea's Christian groups held a service in Seoul on Sunday to protest against a landmark court ruling that acknowledged same-sex the rights of partners in same-sex couples to state health insurance. The supreme court in July upheld a high court ruling that a same-sex partner was eligible for spousal benefits from the National Health Insurance Service, a move hailed as a win for LGBTQ rights in a country that has lagged others in the region. Sunday's massive service drew hundreds of thousands of Christians from across the country, disrupting traffic on several major roads in central Seoul. As many as 230,000 people attended, the Yonhap news agency reported, citing police, The organisers, meanwhile, said as many as 1.1 million people took part. Calls to the Seoul metropolitan police agency were not answered. Kim Jeong-hee, a spokesperson for the organizing committee, said the verdict was unconstitutional because same-sex marriage has not been legalized. 'I think that would only be the starting point for same-sex marriage legalization policy,' Kim said. 'We see this not simply as a Christian issue, but as a huge crisis that shakes our country's foundation.' The court had said that with no clauses in the national health insurance act that refer to same-sex union, denial of benefits to such people constitutes discrimination based on sexual orientation. Some participants held signs saying 'oppose the anti-discrimination law' and 'protect our children from gender pollution, gender confusion and gender division destruction.' A coalition of hundreds of LGBTQ activists and Catholic and Anglican organizations issued a statement criticizing the joint service as an act that denies the values of inclusiveness, diversity and respect for human rights and an attempt to infringe on the minority's human rights in the name of the majority.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-christian-groups-in-massive-protest-against-rights-for-same-sex-couples-/7840847.html	2024-10-27T06:23:09-07:00	
War casts shadow over Lebanon's ancient Baalbek	Baalbek, Lebanon — Since war erupted between Israel and Hezbollah, the famed Palmyra Hotel in east Lebanon's Baalbek has been without visitors, but long-time employee Rabih Salika refuses to leave — even as bombs drop nearby. The hotel, which was built in 1874, once welcomed renowned guests including former French President Charles de Gaulle and American singer Nina Simone. Overlooking a large archaeological complex encompassing the ruins of an ancient Roman town, the Palmyra has kept its doors open through several conflicts and years of economic collapse. 'This hotel hasn't closed its doors for 150 years,' Salika said, explaining that it welcomed guests at the height of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war and during Israel's last war with Hezbollah in 2006. The 45-year-old has worked there for more than half his life and says he will not abandon it now. 'I'm very attached to this place,' he said, adding that the hotel's vast, desolate halls leave 'a huge pang in my heart.' He spends his days dusting decaying furniture and antique mirrors. He clears glass shards from windows shattered by strikes. Baalbek, known as the 'City of the Sun' in ancient times, is home to one of the world's largest complex of Roman temples — designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. But the latest Israel-Hezbollah war has cast a pall over the eastern city, home to an estimated 250,000 people before the war. Life at a standstill After a year of cross-border clashes with Hezbollah, Israel last month ramped-up strikes on the group's strongholds, including parts of Baalbek. Only about 40 percent of Baalbek's residents remain in the city, local officials say, mainly crammed into the city's few Sunni-majority districts. On October 6, Israeli strikes fell hundreds of meters (yards) away from the Roman columns that bring tourists to the city and the Palmyra hotel. UNESCO told AFP it was 'closely following the impact of the ongoing crisis in Lebanon on the cultural heritage sites.' More than a month into the war, a handful of Baalbek's shops remain open, albeit for short periods of time. 'The market is almost always closed. It opens for one hour a day, and sometimes not at all,' said Baalbek mayor Mustafa al-Shall. Residents shop for groceries quickly in the morning, rarely venturing out after sundown. They try 'not to linger on the streets fearing an air strike could hit at any moment,' he said. Last year, nearly 70,000 tourists and 100,000 Lebanese visited Baalbek. But the city has only attracted five percent of those figures so far this year, the mayor said. Even before the war, local authorities in Baalbek were struggling to provide public services due to a five-year economic crisis. Now municipality employees are mainly working to clear the rubble from the streets and provide assistance to shelters housing the displaced. A Baalbek hospital was put out of service by a recent Israeli strike, leaving only five other facilities still fully functioning, Shall said. 'No one' Baalbek resident Hussein al-Jammal said the war has turned his life upside down. 'The streets were full of life, the citadel was welcoming visitors, restaurants were open, and the markets were crowded,' the 37-year-old social worker said. 'Now, there is no one.' His young children and his wife have fled the fighting, but he said he had a duty to stay behind and help those in need. 'I work in the humanitarian field, I cannot leave, even if everyone leaves,' he said. Only four homes in his neighborhood are still inhabited, he said, mostly by vulnerable elderly people. 'I pay them a visit every morning to see what they need,' he said, but 'it's hard to be away from your family.' Rasha al-Rifai, 45, provides psychological support to women facing gender-based violence. But in the month since the war began, she has lost contact with many. 'Before the war... we didn't worry about anything,' said Rifai, who lives with her elderly parents. 'Now everything has changed, we work remotely, we don't see anyone, most of the people I know have left.' 'In the 2006 war we were displaced several times, it was a very difficult experience, we don't want this to happen again,' she said. 'We will stay here as long as it is bearable.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/war-casts-shadow-over-lebanon-s-ancient-baalbek/7840810.html	2024-10-27T05:47:53-07:00	
Thousands turn out for Thai royal barge pageantry	Bangkok — Thousands of well-wishers lined the banks of Bangkok's Chao Phraya River Sunday to watch King Maha Vajiralongkorn ride a glittering royal barge procession to mark his 72nd birthday. A flotilla of 52 ornately decorated boats, paddled by more than 2,000 oarsmen decked out in scarlet and gold, carried the king and Queen Suthida in formation through the heart of the Thai capital to a Buddhist ceremony at Wat Arun, the city's ancient Temple of Dawn. The king, officially regarded as semi-divine but who came in for unprecedented criticism in street protests in 2020 and 2021, took his place on a century-old royal barge known as the 'Golden Swan' to deliver robes to monks in a ceremony marking the end of Buddhist Lent. Royal barge processions date back hundreds of years, but are held rarely, saved for the most significant occasions — most recently, the king's coronation in 2019. During the 70-year reign of the previous king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, only 16 barge processions were held. King Vajiralongkorn turned 72 in July, completing his 'sixth cycle' in the 12-year astrological calendar — a milestone regarded by Thais as important and auspicious. Normally the intricately ornamented barges — their prows decorated with garudas, nagas and other mythical creatures from Buddhist and Hindu mythology — are kept in a museum. But on days of national importance, navy oarsmen in sarongs, red tunics and traditional hats propel them through the water to the banging of drums, as perfectly coordinated golden paddles break the waters. Only four of the barges are actually deemed 'royal,' while the others are officially royal escort vessels. The barge procession dates back to Thailand's 1350-1767 Ayutthaya period. When Bangkok was built more than 250 years ago, kings used the boats to travel through the capital's network of canals. As Thailand modernized, the barges fell out of use, but king Bhumibol revived the tradition in 1957 to celebrate the 25th century of the Buddhist era.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-turn-out-for-thai-royal-barge-pageantry-/7840790.html	2024-10-27T05:04:06-07:00	
Satellite images show damage from Israeli attack at 2 Iranian military bases	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An Israeli attack on Iran damaged facilities at two secretive military base southeast of the Iranian capital, satellite photos analyzed Sunday by The Associated Press show. In the past, experts have linked one site to Tehran's onetime nuclear weapons program and the other to its ballistic missile program. Some of the damaged buildings sat in Iran's Parchin military base, where the International Atomic Energy Agency suspects Iran in the past conducted tests of high explosives that could trigger a nuclear weapon. Iran long has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an active weapons program until 2003. The other damage could be seen at the nearby Khojir military base, which analysts believe hides an underground tunnel system and missile production sites. Iran's military has not acknowledged damage at either Khojir or Parchin from Israel's attack early Saturday, though it has said the assault killed four Iranian soldiers working in the country's air defense systems. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the Israeli military. However, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday told an audience that the Israeli attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for an immediate retaliatory strike. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu separately said Sunday that Israel's strikes 'severely harmed' Iran and that the barrage 'achieved all its goals.' It remains unclear how many sites in total were targeted in the Israeli attack. There have been no images of damage so far released by Iran's military. Iranian officials have identified affected areas as being in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. Burned fields could be seen in satellite images from Planet Labs PBC around Iran's Tange Bijar natural gas production site in Ilam province on Saturday, though it wasn't immediately clear if it was related to the attack. Ilam province sits on the Iraq border in western Iran. The most telling damage could be seen in Planet Labs images of Parchin, about 40 kilometers southeast of downtown Tehran near the Mamalu Dam. There, one structure appeared to be destroyed while others looked damaged in the attack. At Khojir, about 20 kilometers away from downtown Tehran, damage could be seen on at least two structures in satellite images. Analysts including Decker Eveleth at the Virginia-based think tank CNA, Joe Truzman at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former United Nations weapon inspector David Albright, as well as other open-source experts, first identified the damage to the bases. The locations of the two bases correspond to videos obtained by the AP showing Iranian air defense systems firing in the vicinity early Saturday. At Parchin, Albright's Institute for Science and International Security identified the destroyed building against a mountainside as 'Taleghan 2.' It said an archive of Iranian nuclear data earlier seized by Israel identified the building as housing 'a smaller, elongated high explosive chamber and a flash X-ray system to examine small-scale high explosive tests.' 'Such tests may have included high explosives compressing a core of natural uranium, simulating the initiation of a nuclear explosive,' a 2018 report by the institute says. In a message posted to the social platform X early Sunday, the institute added: 'It is not certain whether Iran used uranium at 'Taleghan 2,' but it is possible it studied the compression of natural uranium hemispheres, which would explain its hasty and secretive renovation efforts following the IAEA's request to access Parchin in 2011.' It's unclear what, if any, equipment would have been inside of the 'Taleghan 2' building early Saturday. There were no Israeli strikes on Iran's oil industry, nor its nuclear enrichment sites or its nuclear power plant at Bushehr during the assault. Rafael Mariano Grossi, who leads the IAEA, confirmed that on X, saying 'Iran's nuclear facilities have not been impacted.' 'Inspectors are safe and continue their vital work,' he added. 'I call for prudence and restraint from actions that could jeopardize the safety & security of nuclear & other radioactive materials.' Other buildings destroyed at Khojir and Parchin likely included a warehouse and other buildings where Iran used industrial mixers to create the solid fuel needed for its extensive ballistic missile arsenal, Eveleth said. In a statement issued immediately after the attack Saturday, the Israeli military said it targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year.' Destroying such sites could greatly disrupt Iran's ability to manufacture new ballistic missiles to replenish its arsenal after the two attacks on Israel. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees the country's ballistic missile program, has been silent since Saturday's attack. Iran's overall ballistic missile arsenal, which includes shorter-range missiles unable to reach Israel, was estimated to be 'over 3,000' by Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, then-commander of the U.S. military's Central Command, in testimony to the U.S. Senate in 2022. In the time since, Iran has fired hundreds of the missiles in a series of attacks. There have been no videos or photos posted to social media of missile parts or damage in civilian neighborhoods following the recent attack — suggesting that the Israeli strikes were far more accurate that Iran's ballistic missile barrages targeting Israel in April and October. Israel relied on aircraft-fired missiles during its attack. However, one factory appeared to have been hit in Shamsabad Industrial City, just south of Tehran near Imam Khomeini International Airport, the country's main gateway to the world. Online videos of the damaged building corresponded to an address for a firm known as TIECO, which advertises itself as building advanced machinery used in Iran's oil and gas industry. Officials at TIECO requested the AP write the company a letter before responding to questions. The firm did not immediately reply to a letter sent to it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/satellite-images-show-damage-from-israeli-attack-at-2-iranian-military-bases-/7840767.html	2024-10-27T03:57:12-07:00	
Hundreds march to mark 35 years of Pride Johannesburg in South Africa	JOHANNESBURG — Hundreds of people marched Saturday in South Africa to mark 35 years of Pride Johannesburg, an annual event that has been critical in advocating equal rights for the LGBTQ+ community. The march in the Sandton district of Johannesburg, was a colorful spectacle but also an opportunity for the LGBTQ+ community to highlight critical issues, such as the discrimination most members of the community still face despite South Africa's progressive stance on equality issues. Johannesburg resident Alice Mpholo, was one of the people who supported the march. 'Pride is really kind of reminiscent of just the rights and the opportunities that this community has fought so hard for,' she said. 'And it's not just in South Africa. It's across the continent.' Mpholo said there were still many countries on the African continent where LGBTQ+ people's rights are not recognized. 'They are being prosecuted. They are being killed just for existing. So a day like this is a day for celebration, but it is a day to appreciate the privilege of being able to be myself and be with people that are just like me,' Mpholo said. Bruce Conway, another participant, said the event provides a safe space for the community to express themselves. 'I'm here today to celebrate myself and other people who embrace their identity in radical ways and ways that we don't normally appreciate on a day-to-day way. And I'm here to experience love in multiple capacities,' he said. Traffic around the central district of Sandton was diverted to accommodate the march.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-march-to-mark-35-years-of-pride-johannesburg-in-south-africa-/7840765.html	2024-10-27T03:38:04-07:00	
Criminals may be leveraging climate change as record acreage burns in Brazil's Amazon	BRASILIA, Brazil — Wildfires in Brazil have swept through an area the size of Switzerland, a level of destruction that will take decades to recover, if it ever does, according to a new satellite assessment. The breadth of forest that has been lost or degraded was revealed as smoke that has blanketed the country cleared, thanks to rains that may be ending the worst drought Brazil has ever recorded. 'The data is exceptionally alarming, it's a very abrupt surge,' Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit, told The Associated Press. The area that burned between January and mid-October 2024 represents an 846% increase over the same period in 2023. That's five times larger than the forest fires of 2019 when, under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, rampant destruction of the Amazon made headlines worldwide. The estimate comes from the National Institute for Space Research, which tracks Brazil's official deforestation rate. This surge in fire comes one year before the Amazon city of Belem will host the annual U.N. climate conference, COP30. The level of destruction is raising suspicions among Brazilian officials and experts that criminals are using climate change to their advantage. Deforestation in the Amazon usually begins with chainsaws. Wet, fallen trees are left lying on the ground until they're dry enough to set afire. They're not even used for lumber. Now with the forest drying out from drought, lawbreakers seeking to create more pasture may be skipping the expensive, labor-intensive step of felling trees. A lighter and a few gallons of gasoline suffice to start a blaze. 'The drought played a major role in fueling the spread, but fire has also been weaponized,' Alencar said. 'The forest’s resilience to a severe drought is proving to be very low,' Andre Lima, secretary of deforestation control at the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, told the AP in an interview in Brasilia. 'You don't need 1 million people setting fires to cause the disaster. One thousand can do it. We recorded 500 large blazes, that all began with a match.' Fueled by human-induced climate change and the El Nino phenomenon, the world’s largest basin is reeling from two years of severe drought. Many rivers fell to record lows in 2023, then broke those records again in 2024. Fish and endangered river dolphins have died in water that is too hot for them. Hundreds of river communities have been stranded without transportation. Then came fire. In September, wildfires surged through the region, doubling the acreage that had burned so far this year. With more than two months still remaining in 2024, it's already the largest area burned since the government began using its current methodology a decade ago. The estimate of forest loss comes as delegates from around the world are meeting in the Colombian city of Cali for COP16, focused on preserving biodiversity. The hypothesis that criminals are piggybacking on climate change needs more study, Lima said. But there is some evidence for it. One clue is that the conservation area that has suffered the most damage is Jamanxim National Forest. Dozens of land grabbers have been illegally ranching cattle there, hoping their operations will be legalized. It is near the city of Novo Progresso, a deforestation hotspot where Bolsonaro, who favors economic development over forest preservation, received 83% of the votes in his failed 2022 reelection bid. The blazes have swept through 1,900 square kilometers (733 square miles) of Jamanxim this year, mostly in September, a 700% increase over 2023, according to MapBiomas, a network of non-governmental organizations that monitors land use. The unprecedented rise in fire has prompted Brazil's government to consider mandating that all burned areas be reforested — a deterrent for land grabbers who hope to convert public forest into their own private pasture. Lima thinks local and state governments should act as well, since most fires start on rural private property, which is their jurisdiction. 'We need structural changes in policies to address climate change,' he said. The rise of wildfire in the Amazon is part of a global trend and makes climate change worse. A recent study published in the journal Science estimated that carbon emissions from forest fires increased 60% between 2001 and 2023. The researchers warned that forests, and all the carbon they store, are increasingly vulnerable to fire. Unlike wildfire in North America, where blazes sometimes reach treetops and expand from there, in the Amazon rainforest, fire spreads mostly through leaves on the ground, causing less harm. The deforestation control agency, known as INPE, tallies these areas as burn scars, not as deforestation. That is why, despite the surge in fire, this year's deforestation rate is still slowing under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and could end 2024 with a 60% reduction compared to Bolsonaro's years. This shows how deforestation is only one metric — and one that does not provide a full picture for damage to the forest in a given year. 'In areas where the fire was very intense, the forest may completely collapse,' Claudio Almeida, a senior officer at INPE, told the AP. 'Even regions where the fire was not as intense are now severely degraded and fragile. Another season of intense drought and fires could lead to the breakdown of the forest.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-weekend---criminals-may-be-leveraging-climate-change-as-record-acreage-burns-in-brazil-s-amazon/7839093.html	2024-10-27T02:18:31-07:00	
What is GivingTuesday? Annual day of charitable giving approaches	Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, GivingTuesday, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of the year for nonprofits in the U.S. In 2022 and 2023, GivingTuesday raised $3.1 billion for charitable organizations, according to estimates from GivingTuesday. This year, GivingTuesday is on December 3. How did GivingTuesday start? The #GivingTuesday hashtag started as a project of the 92nd Street Y in New York in 2012 and became an independent organization in 2020. It's grown into a worldwide network of local organizations that promote giving in their communities, often on different dates that have local relevance, such as holidays. Now, GivingTuesday, the nonprofit, also convenes researchers working on topics about everyday giving. It collects data from a wide range of sources such as payment processors, crowdfunding sites, employee giving software and institutions that offer donor-advised funds, a kind of charitable-giving account. What is the purpose of GivingTuesday? The hashtag was started to promote generosity, and the nonprofit continues to promote giving in the broadest sense. For nonprofits, the point of GivingTuesday is to raise money and engage their supporters. Many will be familiar with the barrage of email and mail appeals that coincide on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. Essentially all major American nonprofits will organize fundraising campaigns, and many smaller, local groups also participate. Nonprofits don't have to be affiliated in any way with GivingTuesday, the organization, to run a fundraising campaign. They can just do it, although GivingTuesday does provide graphics and advice. In that way, it remains a grassroots effort with groups and donors participating however they like. Has GivingTuesday been successful? That depends on how success is measured, but it certainly has grown far beyond the initial effort to promote giving on social media. The day has become an enduring and well-known event that seeks to center charitable giving, volunteering and civic participation in the United States and around the world. For years, GivingTuesday has been a major focus of fundraising for nonprofits, with many seeking to organize matching donations from major donors and leverage their networks of supporters to contribute. It is the beginning of the end-of-year fundraising rush, as nonprofits seek to reach their budget targets for the following year. Donations on GivingTuesday in 2022 and 2023 reached $3.1 billion, an increase from $2.7 billion in 2021. While that’s a lot to raise in a single day, the trend last year was flat and with fewer donors giving, which the organization said is a worrying sign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-is-givingtuesday-annual-day-of-charitable-giving-approaches/7839017.html	2024-10-27T02:15:39-07:00	
Bulgarians’ 7th vote in 3 years unlikely to break political deadlock	SOFIA, Bulgaria — Bulgarians were voting Sunday in the seventh general election in more than three years with little hope that a stable government will be formed to stop the country's slide into political instability. Voter fatigue and disillusionment with politicians have created an environment where radical political voices, aided by Moscow's widespread disinformation, are successfully undermining public support for the democratic process and boosting the popularity of pro-Russian and far-right groups. The never-ending election spiral has a serious impact on Bulgaria's economy and its foreign policy. The country risks losing billions of euros in EU recovery funds because of the lack of reforms. Full integration into the open-border Schengen area and joining the eurozone are likely to be delayed further. Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. local time Sunday. Initial exit poll results will be announced after polls close at 8 p.m., and preliminary results are expected on Monday. According to latest opinion polls, Bulgarians' lack of confidence in elections will result in record low voter turnout. Gallup World Poll data show only 10% of Bulgarians trust the integrity of their elections, the lowest proportion in the EU, where the average is 62%. Some observers have called the past few years a period of 'revolving-door governments,' which has additionally fueled voters' apathy. There was no clear winner in the latest vote, held in June, and the seven groups elected to the fragmented legislature were unable to put together a viable coalition. Observers suggest that Sunday's vote will produce more of the same. These early elections are not expected to break a protracted political stalemate, Teneo, a political risk consultancy, said in a report last week. Although former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov's center-right GERB party is set to win a plurality of seats, it will likely struggle to form a majority government in a fragmented parliament, Teneo predicted. 'As a result, a technocratic government or another early election are the most likely outcomes. Political instability and a surging budget deficit are key challenges to Bulgaria's accession to the eurozone,' the consultancy said. The Balkan country of 6.7 million has been gripped by political instability since 2020, when nationwide protests erupted against corrupt politicians that had allowed oligarchs to take control of state institutions. Bulgaria is one of the poorest and most corrupt European Union member states. Attempts to fight graft are an uphill battle against an unreformed judiciary widely accused of serving the interests of politicians. Despite a fall in support for GERB in recent elections, it is tipped to finish first with a quarter of the votes. It will be a hard task for Borisov, however, to secure enough support for a stable coalition government. Analysts believe that the main pro-Russia party in Bulgaria, Vazrazhdane, could emerge as the second-largest group in parliament. The far-right, ultra-nationalist and populist party demands that Bulgaria lift sanctions against Russia, stop helping Ukraine, and hold a referendum on its membership in NATO. The reformist, pro-EU We Continue the Change/Democratic Bulgaria bloc is likely to come in third. The Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which traditionally represented Bulgaria's large ethnic Turkish minority, recently split into two rival factions, one around party founder Ahmed Dogan, and the other behind U.S.-sanctioned businessman and former media tycoon Delyan Peevski. Both factions are likely to enter parliament, gaining between 7% and 9% each. Up to four smaller groups could also pass the 4% threshold for entering parliament, which would even more complicate the forming of a government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bulgarians-7th-vote-in-3-years-unlikely-to-break-political-deadlock/7840733.html	2024-10-27T01:03:24-07:00	
Voters in ‘boring’ Uruguay to pick between 2 centrists	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — The small South American nation of Uruguay is holding a remarkably civilized general election on Sunday that pits an incumbent conservative coalition against a moderate left-wing alliance in a country free from the political histrionics of other presidential contests around the world. No one expects the outcome of the vote to herald drastic change in this nation of 3.4 million people, long heralded as a model democracy and island of stability in the region. With the main parties in broad agreement on many issues, the campaign is being fought over voter concerns like child poverty and security. Rising homicides and robberies represent the biggest concern for Uruguayans, polls show, even though the country is one of the region's safest. 'In a way, Uruguay has been boring, but boring in this sense is very good,' said Juan Cruz Díaz, a political analyst who runs the Cefeidas consultancy group in Buenos Aires. 'We've seen so many dramatic changes in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and suddenly we face elections in Uruguay in which there is a general consensus, there's stability.' While in neighboring Brazil and Argentina, voters recently vented their rage at the status quo, Uruguay's electorate remains largely satisfied with the government's business-friendly policies and the economy's steady growth. The current center-right president, Luis Lacalle Pou, enjoys a 50% approval rating. As constitutional term limits bar Lacalle Pou from running for a second consecutive term, the governing party's candidate is Álvaro Delgado, 55, a congressman and Lacalle Pou's former chief of staff who started his career as a veterinarian. 'This government leaves us with a very solid first level to continue building the future,' Delgado said at his closing campaign rally. His main challenger is Yamandú Orsi, 57, a center-left former mayor and history teacher with humble roots from the Frente Amplio (or Broad Front) coalition, which governed for 15 years before Lacalle Pou's 2019 victory. His campaign ads show him drinking mate, the herbal drink beloved by Uruguayans, and walking his dog in casual wear. From 2005-2020, Frente Amplio oversaw progressive laws, such as the legalization of same-sex marriage. Uruguay became the first country in the world to legalize cannabis for recreational use and developed one of the greenest grids, powered by 98% renewable energy. The latest polls show Orsi in a comfortable lead at 44%, but not winning outright, which would send the country to a run-off on Nov. 24. Orsi has benefited from the support of popular former President José 'Pepe' Mujica, the eccentric former guerrilla who helped spearhead Uruguay's transformation into the continent's most socially liberal country during his 2010-2015 presidency. Now 89, Mujica is battling esophageal cancer. Like Mujica, who lives in a modest farmhouse on the outskirts of Montevideo, Orsi says he wouldn't live in the presidential palace if elected. In a distant third is Andrés Ojeda, 40, a muscular and media-savvy lawyer who has tried to energize apathetic young voters with splashy campaign videos showing him lifting at the gym and describing himself as a classic Capricorn. 'I want to be the candidate who inspires and enthralls people,' he said at his campaign event Thursday. He told The Associated Press that his unconventional style draws inspiration from other charismatic 'leaders of the new politics' in Latin America wielding social media to amass fans, like El Salvador's populist Nayib Bukele and Argentina's radical libertarian Javier Milei. But he backs the ruling coalition and promises no radical change. Voters in the nation of 3.4 million will also choose the next vice president and members of parliament on Sunday. Perhaps more controversial than the country's presidential contest is a constitutional referendum also held Sunday that would overhaul Uruguay's social security system. If approved by more than 50% of voters, the $23 billion scheme backed by the country's powerful leftist unions would lower the retirement age, boost payouts and transfer Uruguayans' privately managed savings to a government-run trust. Both leading candidates have spoken out against the proposal, which has already sent tremors through global markets. Shrugging off the fiscal consequences, supporters say it would redistribute Uruguay's resources more fairly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voters-in-boring-uruguay-to-pick-between-2-centrists/7840730.html	2024-10-27T00:19:19-07:00	
Rare Sahara floods bring Morocco's dried-up south back to life	Merzouga, Morocco — In Morocco's southeastern desert, a rare downpour has brought lakes and ponds back to life, with locals — and tourists — hailing it as a gift from the heavens. In Merzouga, a tourist town about 600 kilometers southeast of the capital, Rabat, the once-parched golden dunes are now dotted with replenished ponds and lakes. 'We're incredibly happy about the recent rains,' said Youssef Ait Chiga, a local tour guide leading a group of German tourists to Yasmina Lake nestled amid Merzouga's dunes. Khalid Skandouli, another tour guide, said the rain has drawn even more visitors to the tourist area, now particularly eager to witness this odd transformation. With him, Laetitia Chevallier, a French tourist and regular visitor to the region, said the rainfall has proved a 'blessing from the sky.' 'The desert became green again, the animals have food again, and the plants and palm trees came back to life,' she said. Locals told AFP the basin had been barren for nearly 20 years. But this September, torrential rains triggered floods in southern parts of Morocco, killing at least 28 people, according to authorities. The rare heavy rains come as the North African kingdom grapples with its worst drought in nearly 40 years, threatening its economically crucial agriculture sector. Last year was Morocco's driest in 80 years, with a 48% drop in rainfall, according to an October report from the General Directorate of Meteorology. Neighboring Algeria saw similar rain and flooding in early September, killing six people. North African countries currently rank among the world's most water-stressed, according to the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit research organization. The kingdom's meteorological agency described the recent massive rainfall as exceptional. It attributed it to an unusual shift of the intertropical convergence zone, the equatorial region where winds from the northern and southern hemispheres meet, causing thunderstorms and heavy rainfall. 'Everything suggests that this is a sign of climate change,' Fatima Driouech, a Moroccan climate scientist, told AFP. 'But it's too early to say definitively without thorough studies.' Experts say climate change is making extreme weather events, such as storms and droughts, more frequent and intense. In Morocco's south, the rains have helped partially fill some reservoirs and replenish groundwater aquifers. But for those levels to significantly rise, experts say the rains would need to continue over a longer period of time. The rest of the country is still grappling with drought, now in its sixth year and jeopardizing the agricultural sector that employs more than a third of Morocco's workforce. Jean Marc Berhocoirigoin, a 68-year-old French tourist, said he was surprised to find Yasmina Lake replenished. 'I felt like a kid on Christmas morning,' he said. 'I hadn't seen these views for 15 years.' Water has also returned to other desert areas such as Erg Znaigui, about 40 kilometers south of Merzouga, AFP reporters saw. Last week, Morocco's meteorological agency said such downpours could become increasingly frequent, 'driven partly by climate change as the intertropical convergence zone shifts further north.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7840728.html	2024-10-27T00:07:23-07:00	
Israeli strikes kill 22 people in northern Gaza, health ministry says	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes on northern Gaza have killed at least 22 people, Palestinian medical officials said. The Gaza Health Ministry's emergency service said that 11 women and two children were among those killed in the strikes late Saturday on several homes and buildings in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. It said another 15 people were wounded and that the death toll could rise. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. For the last three weeks, Israel has been waging a massive air and ground offensive in northern Gaza, where it says Hamas militants had regrouped. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Gaza City in the latest wave of displacement in the yearlong war. Israel is carrying out daily strikes across Gaza, even as it wages war with the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon. On Saturday, Israeli warplanes attacked Iran, which backs Hamas and Hezbollah, both U.S.-designated terror groups, in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack earlier this month. The cascading conflicts have raised fears of an all-out regional war pitting Israel and the United States against Iran and its militant proxies, which also include the Houthi rebels in Yemen and armed groups in Syria and Iraq. Israel says its strikes on Gaza only target militants, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the local Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half of those killed were women and children. The offensive has devastated much of the impoverished coastal territory and displaced around 90% of its population, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people have crowded into squalid tent camps along the coast, and aid groups say hunger is rampant.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-kill-22-people-in-northern-gaza-health-ministry-says/7840721.html	2024-10-26T23:43:39-07:00	
Despair in Tbilisi as Georgian Dream leads in election results	Tbilisi, Georgia — The streets of Tbilisi echoed with despair on Sunday as preliminary results pointed to a decisive lead for the ruling Georgian Dream party in Saturday’s election. With 99% of the precincts reporting, Georgian Dream had secured 54.2% of the vote, reinforcing its grip on a nation polarized over its political future. Most of the leaders of the opposition parties say the vote, seen as a referendum on Georgia’s path toward deeper Western alignment or closer ties with Russia, was rigged. Judging by the preliminary results, the opposition struggled to mount a strong challenge. Initial counts show the Coalition for Changes at 10.8%, Unity-National Movement at 10%, Strong Georgia at 8.7%, and Giorgi Gakharia’s For Georgia party at 7.7%. As exit polls were announced, both the ruling party and opposition initially declared victory, though the official results quickly favored Georgian Dream securing its fourth term with more votes than it received in the last election. 'Such cases are rare worldwide, where the same party achieves such success under challenging circumstances,' Bidzina Ivanishvili said, shortly after the first exit polls were announced. The oligarch is seen as Georgian Dream's true leader. Soon after, Hungary’s Victor Orban congratulated the Georgian Dream, and Margarita Simonian, editor-in-chief of the Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT, wrote on Telegram: 'Georgians won, well done.' 'This is election theft, a constitutional coup, and Georgian Dream will answer for it according to Georgian law,' said Nika Gvaramia, one of the leaders of the Coalition for Changes. He said his coalition had uncovered a 'technological scheme' used to manipulate the election results. 'We promised to protect your votes, and I apologize for not identifying this complex scheme earlier,' Gvaramia said. Elene Khoshtaria, another member of the Coalition for Changes and leader of the Droa party, echoed Gvaramia. 'We are firm and principled in our stance that this election was stolen, and we won’t accept it. We are moving to continuous protest, organized and coordinated, starting tomorrow. The protest will be in the streets, and we will announce the time and place,' she said. Unity-National Movement also sees the elections as stolen. 'Oligarch Ivanishvili stole the victory from the Georgian people and thereby stole the European future. On behalf of the Unity-National Movement, we declare that we do not accept the results of the elections,' Tina Bokuchava, party leader, said. Some of the independent observers also criticized the reported outcome. 'Based on analysis of the pre-election environment, widespread manipulation on election day, and unprecedented pressure on voters, we believe that the preliminary results released by the CEC do not reflect the true will of Georgian citizens. We will continue to demand the annulment of these results,' said Londa Toloraia of the NGO coalition 'My Voice.' Many of the analysts in the country cite fraud as the source of the ruling party’s success. Other observers also argue that Georgian Dream’s success stemmed not only from its strengths but also from the opposition's weaknesses. Because of internal conflicts, a lack of coherent policies, and shifting political allegiances, opposition parties failed to offer a compelling alternative to the ruling party. 'I voted for a change … by a process of elimination,' a 20-year-old first-time voter told VOA on the condition of anonymity. It was a sentiment many echoed. 'The opposition appears bankrupt, having relied on the hope that a) Georgian Dream would collapse on its own, or b) the West would ultimately bring down Ivanishvili’s regime. Consequently, they failed to conduct a genuine campaign, with even fewer events than in previous elections,' said Levan Ramishvili, associated professor of political philosophy and international relations at Tbilisi-based Free University. 'Adding to this is the West’s lack of moral clarity, characterized by hesitation, ambiguity, and a ‘leading from behind’ approach — granting EU candidate status one moment, suspending it the next; imposing sanctions, but only on marginal figures,' he said. Leading up to the election, the United States and European Union voiced concerns, citing a perceived drift from democratic principles and closer ties to Russia. 'The picture is very clear now — despite pressure, intimidation, violence and vote-buying, they lost the capital and Rustavi and lost by catastrophic landslide abroad. But in regions where there were less oversight and people are more vulnerable and dependent on the state won with Kadyrov-style numbers of 80-90%. [The] international community cannot possibly agree that this is fair and square. Legitimizing this would mean granting major geopolitical victory to Russia,' said Giorgi Kandelaki, project manager at the Soviet Past Research Laboratory. Analysts and opposition figures warned that Ivanishvili is guiding the country toward Russia, tightening control over the media and independent institutions. Earlier this year, the government passed a controversial 'foreign agent' law, modeled on Russian legislation. It targets NGOs and media outlets that receive foreign funding, mainly from the West. The law led to widespread protests in the country and a subsequent brutal response from the government. Like their leaders, many of the opposition voters question the legitimacy of Georgian Dream’s lead. 'Nobody around me voted for them. How did they get a million votes?' asked Davit, a man in his 30s. Another said, 'The government you elect is the government you deserve,' expressing frustration with fellow Georgians, while a third added, 'They’ve sold out the country for a 300 GEL (around $120) salary.' Georgian Dream’s core supporters include 'budget voters,' public sector workers and social assistance recipients, especially in rural areas where employment options are limited. The party relies on these voters, many of whom fear the loss of a job or benefits if the party loses. 'The election that was held was neither fair nor free,' said the Free University’s Ramishvili. 'Since the 2018 presidential election, Georgian Dream has built a powerful electoral machine that relies heavily on bribery, intimidation of vulnerable voters, and fear of war. This machine operates by using both administrative and budgetary resources for partisan purposes, as well as outright bribery.' Over the years, Georgian Dream has forged strong alliances with wide range of political actors and groups, from pro-Russian socially conservative groups to street hooligans, and chiefly with the highly popular, Georgian Orthodox Church. 'Last week, my priest officially asked us from the pulpit to vote for Georgian Dream,' said Rusudan, a middle-aged voter. 'He even said anyone voting for the opposition would lose the right to communion.' This message, repeated in the churches across the country, has bolstered Georgian Dream’s support among religious and traditionalist voters over the years. The ruling party framed the election as a choice between war and peace, labeling critics at home and abroad as part of a 'global war party,' a term borrowed from Kremlin narratives. For a country scarred by wars with Russia in the 1990s and again in 2008, this message resonated strongly. Meanwhile, the opposition cast the election as a referendum on ending up under Russian influence. 'Amid rising Russian aggression and a hesitant West unable to defend its values, anti-Western and anti-liberal forces are growing stronger in our region. These groups skillfully exploit the West’s failure to protect its principles, citing Russia’s unpunished aggression against neighboring countries as an example,' Ramishvili said. For now, Georgian Dream celebrates its apparent victory. But many Georgians, particularly younger urbanites, feel increasingly disillusioned. As results are confirmed, Georgia faces deep divisions and an uncertain path forward.	https://www.voanews.com/a/despair-in-tbilisi-as-georgian-dream-leads-in-election-results/7840716.html	2024-10-26T23:31:40-07:00	
Russian forces advance toward strategic Ukrainian city, military bloggers say	Russian forces have advanced further into several eastern Ukrainian towns, bringing them closer to capturing the strategic city of Pokrovsk, Russian and Ukrainian bloggers said. 'The enemy advanced in Selydove,' DeepState, a group with close links to the Ukrainian army that analyzes combat footage, wrote on the Telegram messaging app late Saturday. It posted a map indicating Russian troops in the town's southeast. Russian forces have been storming the coal mining town of Selydove in Ukraine's Donetsk region for the past week. Capturing it would pave the way for a Russian advance on the logistical hub of Pokrovsk 20 km northwest. The Russian news outlet SHOT said on Telegram that Moscow's troop control 80% of Selydove. The Russian-installed head of Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, said Russian forces had hoisted their unit's flag on the roof of one of the buildings in the town of Hirnyk, about 14 km south of Selydove, Russia's state news agency RIA reported. Russian military bloggers also reported that Russian forces were close to taking over the town of Kurakhove, just southwest of Hirnyk. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. Ukraine has not commented on them. Ukraine's Armed Forces said in its evening report on Saturday that Kyiv forces had repelled 36 Russian attacks along the Pokrovsk front-line in the previous day, including in the area of Selydove, while several battles were still ongoing. After Moscow's full-scale invasion in Ukraine in February 2022 failed to seize the capital, Kyiv, and win a decisive victory, President Vladimir Putin scaled back his war ambitions to taking the old industrial heartland in Ukraine's east known as Donbas, which covers the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Last month Russian forces advanced there at their fastest rate since March 2022, according to open-source data, despite Ukraine taking a part of Russia's Kursk region. Early Sunday, Russia's air defense units reported destroying at least 30 Ukrainian drones overnight across the southern regions of Voronezh, Bryansk, Oryol, Lipetsk and Belgorod, the Russian defense ministry wrote on Telegram. One woman was injured as a result of the drone attack on the border region of Belgorod, the region's governor Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on Telegram. He added that a few cars were also damaged. Maxim Yegorov, governor of the Tambov region, about 450 km southeast of Moscow, said a Ukrainian drone fell onto the Michurinsky district of the region, sparking a short-lived fire but causing no injuries or material damage. The Russian defense ministry reports only how many drones its units destroy, not how many Ukraine launches. Russian officials also rarely disclose the full scale of damage inflicted by the attacks, especially when they involve military or energy infrastructure. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-forces-advance-toward-strategic-ukrainian-city-military-bloggers-say/7840709.html	2024-10-26T23:14:59-07:00	
Bioeconomy offers path to mitigating climate change, enhancing food production	Nairobi — Bioeconomy is the production, use, and conservation of biological resources to produce goods that sustain communities. A new report says the promotion of bioeconomy as a way to deal with climate change holds promise for rural areas in Africa and elsewhere. As the world grapples with how to cope with the effects of climate change on the environment, food production, and people’s livelihoods, experts say the bioeconomy can offer solutions to those challenges and help achieve sustainable development. Their conclusions are presented in a new report, The State of the Bioeconomy in East Africa Report 2024, authored by the Stockholm Environment Institute, the East African Science and Technology Commission, and the International Center of Insects Physiology and Ecology, or ICIPE. The authors say the use of renewable biological resources, and the application of related knowledge, science and technology offers a chance to drive economic growth and — most importantly — boost food security while protecting the environment. For example, Regina Muthama is a farmer who trains other farmers in her community in Eastern Kenya, where there is often a shortage of rain to grow food. She says she plants several types of crops and trees together to maximize the water supply, and so the trees can shade crops from the strong African sun. 'We are growing trees, which we integrate with crops so that when we water the trees, we can also water the crops that can give us food. The kind of trees we plant can mitigate climate change, prevent soil erosion, and give us good oxygen,' she said. Experts say Eastern Africa is home to vast agricultural fertile lands, biodiversity, and a youthful population, which positions the region as a leader in bioeconomy innovation. Abdou Tenkouano is the director general of ICIPE Kenya. Speaking at the Global Biodiversity Summit (GBS) this week in Nairobi, he said bioeconomy development needs to provide opportunities for young people, and develop ways to meet people’s food needs. 'We must also meet the employment needs of the youth, who are the largest demographic segment in Africa and the global south,' he said. 'We are in a climate crisis, which is now an existential threat. We must adopt new ways of production and consumption that are sustainable. The bioeconomy offers this new model of sustainable economic growth.' According to the Stockholm Environment Institute, more than 65 percent of people living in Eastern Africa depend on biological resources for food, energy, medicine, and other purposes. Venter Mwongera is the chairperson of national and international engagements at the Intersectoral Forum on Agrobiodiversity and Agroecology in Kenya. She explains the benefits of embracing the bioeconomy. 'We can continue growing our economy, contributing to GDP and contributing to job creation because these industries that manufacture the produce or products we get from agriculture minimize the emission of greenhouse gases, which means that we will have a cleaner environment. It also means that jobs will be retained and more will be created, and there will also be sustainable food production,' said Mwongera. The East African Community regional bloc has developed a bioeconomy strategy that aims to have sustainable industrialization, improve food and nutrition security, improve health, and create bio-based products which are derived from plants, animals and microorganisms. Tenkouano says ICIPE is trying to show the way. 'We develop and deploy nature-positive solutions for insect pests and vector management. We also lead research in insects as alternative sources of protein for food and feed and agents of organic waste conversion,' he said. Experts say the bioeconomy as a principle is winning supporters. However, a lack of financing, poor infrastructure, low agricultural productivity, and excessive government regulation still present challenges to broader adoption.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bioeconomy-offers-path-to-mitigating-climate-change-enhancing-food-production/7838972.html	2024-10-26T21:29:52-07:00	
Colombia's Awa resist violence, maintain 'spiritual bond' with nature	EL DIVISO, COLOMBIA — The Awa of Colombia are an Indigenous people who have been threatened by armed groups in the country's southwestern rainforests for decades but insist on protecting the environment they say they are 'connected' to. As environmental policy leaders gather for a major biodiversity meeting in the South American nation, the Awas embody the struggle for survival of native peoples and the defense of the jungle. 'The Awa people have been resisting for 500 years. Against invasion, discrimination, armed groups, forced recruitment and displacement, acculturation,' said Olivio Bisbicus, one of the leaders of this community of nearly 50,000. 'Being an Awa chief is complicated and dangerous,' he said. 'Drug trafficking brings vice, territorial disharmony and the destruction of our culture and nature.' The group's full name, Inkal Awa, means 'People of the jungle' in the ancestral language. The people live in the mountainous rainforest of Colombia and neighboring Ecuador. 'Three armed groups are fighting over this strategic border region, a drug trafficking corridor to the Pacific' that is also dotted with illegal gold mines, Alex Javier Gonzalez, an official with the Narino governorate, told AFP. The situation is 'critical for the Awas,' he said. 'Risk of extinction' The Colombian justice system has documented 25 years of violence against the Awas, who have been caught up in the conflict with the FARC guerrilla army, warning of a 'risk of physical, cultural and spiritual extermination.' Between 1990 and 2016, the guerrillas killed 185 Awas. The murders continued after a 2016 peace agreement. At least 22 members of the group were killed in 2022, including a prominent leader who was shot by the men with whom he was supposed to negotiate. Many of Colombia's Indigenous communities 'are at risk of extinction' due to pressure from criminal groups involved in drug cultivation and trafficking, Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told AFP. 'The violent competition for the land is so fierce,' he said. In early 2023, the ombudsman's offices of Colombia and Ecuador issued a joint warning regarding the future of the Awa people. The Colombian Constitutional Court has repeatedly called for their protection. But fresh violence claimed the lives of three more Awa men at the end of August, according to Unipa, an organization representing them. 'And yet they are holding on,' Gonzalez said. 'The Awas have managed to maintain control over their lands.' 'Spiritual bond' Gilles Bertrand, the European Union ambassador to Colombia, describes their group's struggle as 'emblematic.' 'They show great courage,' he said. Armed with only sticks and an ethos of nonviolence, the Unipa Indigenous guard, made up of 2,000 volunteers, works to protect nature. 'In the face of weapons, we are empty-handed. But we have dialogue, and our ancestral knowledge, our identity, our authorities, our presence here for centuries,' Bisbicus said. 'We have been able to maintain the unity of our people, and demand respect for our territory. Our land is not a battlefield,' he said. The Awas are also characterized by what they call a 'spiritual bond' with their land. 'The territory is a living space, where we coexist with nature, animals and spirits. Nature is our mother,' said Wilmer Rigoberto Bisbicus, a coordinator in Nutria, a private nature reserve. At almost 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) above sea level, La Nutria hides an enchanting waterfall overlooking a lush valley. 'Here it rains a lot. This water is life,' said Alvaro Pai, a guide at the reserve. 'The waterfall listens and heals you,' he said. Described by the European Union's ambassador as an 'ambitious peace and ecotourism project,' Nutria's 365 hectares are home to 185 species of birds, butterflies and frogs. 'We must take care of the earth, because we come from it, learn from it, and we will return to it,' Olivio Bisbicus said. 'The further we move away from it, the more we harm ourselves.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-s-awa-resist-violence-maintain-spiritual-bond-with-nature/7838913.html	2024-10-26T21:26:22-07:00	
BRICS’ de-dollarization agenda has a long way to go	New Delhi — BRICS leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, have publicly voiced their commitment to jointly introduce an alternative payment system that would not be dependent on the U.S. dollar. Independent analysts, however, question the feasibility of implementing the idea anytime soon. The recently concluded meeting of BRICS -- Brazil, Russia, India. China and South Africa -- discussed ways to establish an alternative to SWIFT, the international payment system. Russia was removed from the SWIFT system after the start of Ukraine war in 2022 and has been particularly keen to find an alternative. 'We are looking into the possibility of expanding the use of national currencies and settlements and want to establish the tools that would make this safe and secure enough,' Putin said. BRICS will work out a payment arrangement with the cooperation of central banks affiliated with the group’s member countries, he said. Analysts assert this is easier said than done. But some experts, like Gregory Zerzan, former deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department, have warned about the danger of ignoring the BRICS’ efforts. He said that’s because its members, some of whom are less friendly toward the U.S., appear determined to achieve their goal. 'There is still a long way to go before BRICS will ever launch a payment system that could be treated as a serious alternative to the SWIFT,' Eva Seiwert, analyst at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies, told VOA. She pointed out that the Kazan Declaration, which was adopted after the two-day BRICS meeting this week, was vague about even the milder version called the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative, or BCBPI, which is supposed to strengthen corresponding banking networks within BRICS and enable settlements in local currencies of BRICS members. The declaration said that participation by member countries in BCBPI would be 'voluntary and non-binding.' The BRICS plan is taken seriously in some quarters because China and India have shown it is possible to defy the economic sanctions and buy Russian oil using local currencies. Some analysts think that provision may be extended to oil-rich Iran, which has joined the BRICS club. At the same time, bankers are not convinced that BRICS has been able to come up with a technical support system for creating and sustaining an alternative to the SWIFT system. 'How do you account for currency fluctuations if the alternative payment system is established?' asked Gopal Tripathy, head of Treasury at Jana Small Finance Bank based in Bengaluru, India. 'They might use the USD [U.S. dollar] as a reference currency. In that case, the whole purpose of moving away from the dollar is lost.' Companies in India, China, South Africa and Brazil may find it difficult to make and receive payments with business partners in countries outside the BRICS club. 'There is no moving away from the U.S. dollar unless you can create a parallel ecosystem,' he said. Though the BRICS do not appear ready with the mechanism to implement the idea, there are concerns in Washington about the de-dollarization campaign launched by some countries. Speaking with the House Financial Services Committee in July, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S. economic sanctions have led to BRICS trying to kickstart the de-dollarization agenda. 'The more sanctions the U.S. imposes, the more countries [BRICS] will seek financial transaction methods that do not involve the U.S. dollar,' she said. Washington appears to have amended its view on the subject since July 2023, when Yellen said there was not much to worry about. 'We have deep liquid open financial markets, strong rule of law and an absence of capital controls that no country is able to replicate,' she said at that time. Brazil, one of the group’s members, has gone a step further, suggesting that a BRICS currency should be released into the market. But this suggestion has not been widely accepted by other members of the group. 'A BRICS currency would require major political compromises, including a banking union, a fiscal union and general macroeconomic convergence … many experts doubt that a new BRICS reserve currency would be stable or reliable enough to be widely trusted for global transactions,' the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations said in an October 18 article on its website.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brics-de-dollarization-agenda-has-a-long-way-to-go/7840686.html	2024-10-26T20:24:53-07:00	
Japan's ruling party braces for blow in elections to lower house	Tokyo — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's conservative ruling party braced for a blow to its comfortable majority in the lower house of parliament in Sunday's elections amid public rage over the party's financial scandals and discontent over a stagnant economy. The results could weaken Ishiba's grip on power, possibly leading Japan into political uncertainty, though a change of government was not expected. Ishiba took office on October 1, replacing his predecessor, Fumio Kishida, who resigned after failing to pacify the public over widespread slush fund practices among Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers. Ishiba immediately ordered a snap election in hopes of shoring up support by using his outspoken, reformist image. Voting began Sunday morning across Japan, where 1,344 candidates, including a record 314 women, are running for office. Polls close at 8 p.m., with early results expected within hours. Ishiba has set a goal of retaining 233 seats for the ruling coalition between the LDP and its Buddhist-backed junior partner Komeito, a majority in the 465-member lower house, the more powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament. Ishiba, in his final speeches Saturday in Tokyo, apologized over his party's mishandling of funds and pledged 'to restart as an equal, fair, humble and honest party.' He said only the LDP's ruling coalition can responsibly run Japan with its experience and dependable policies. Once a popular politician known for his criticism of even his own party's policies, Ishiba has also seen support for his weeks-old Cabinet plunge. The biggest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, is led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda who briefly served as prime minister during the LDP's 2009-2012 descent from power. Noda's party is expected to make significant gains. Noda says Sunday's election is a rare chance for a change of government, which will be the most effective political reform, though his party has trouble finding other opposition groups with which to cooperate. At a downtown Tokyo polling station early Sunday, a number of voters said they considered the corruption scandal and economic measures. A 77-year-old man said his biggest concern was rising prices and wondered if the LDP should win despite the wrongdoings. Another resident in her 60s said she would vote in hope of making a change. Analysts suggest Ishiba could fall short of reaching his target, though his LDP was expected to remain the top party in Japan's parliament as voters are skeptical about the opposition's ability and inexperience. Losing a majority would mean Ishiba would have difficulty establishing policies and could face calls from within his party for a replacement ahead of next summer's election in the upper house, experts say. 'The public's criticisms against the slush funds scandal has intensified, and it won't go away easily,' said Izuru Makihara, a University of Tokyo professor of politics and public policy. 'There is a growing sense of fairness and people are rejecting privileges for politicians.' Makihara suggested Ishiba needs bold political reform measures to regain public trust. Ishiba pledged to revitalize the rural economy, address Japan's falling birth rate and bolster defense. But his Cabinet has old faces, only two women and was seen as alienating members of the scandal-tainted faction led by late premier Shinzo Abe. Ishiba quickly retreated from earlier support for a dual surname option for married couples and legalizing same-sex marriage, an apparent compromise to the party's influential ultra-conservatives. His popularity fell because of 'the gap in what the public expected him to be as prime minister versus the reality of what he brought as prime minister,' said Rintaro Nishimura, a political analyst at The Asia Group. The LDP is also being tested Sunday for its ability to break from the legacy of Abe, whose policies focused on security, trade and industry but largely ignored equality and diversity, and its nearly eight-year long rule led to the corruption, experts say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-ruling-party-braces-for-blow-in-elections-to-lower-house/7840684.html	2024-10-26T20:07:01-07:00	
China vows 'countermeasures' after $2 billion US arms sale to Taiwan	Beijing — China will take 'countermeasures' to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the government said, lambasting a $2 billion arms sale package by the United States to Taiwan. The United States is bound by law to provide Chinese-claimed Taiwan with the means to defend itself despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, to the constant anger of Beijing. On Friday, the Pentagon said the United States had approved a potential $2 billion arms sale package to Taiwan, including the delivery for the first time to the island of an advanced air defense missile system battle-tested in Ukraine. The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the new sale consisted of $1.16 billion in missile systems and radar systems worth an estimated $828 million. The principal contractor for the missile system will be RTX Corp, the Pentagon said. 'This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,' it said in a statement. 'The proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region.' In a statement late Saturday, China's foreign ministry said it strongly condemns and firmly opposes the sales and has lodged 'solemn representations' with the United States. China urges the United States to immediately stop arming Taiwan and stop its dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, it added. 'China will take resolute countermeasures and take all measures necessary to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,' the ministry said, without elaborating. China has over the past five years stepped up its military activities around democratically governed Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, including staging a new round of war games earlier this month. Taiwan's government has welcomed the new arms sale, the 17th of the Biden administration to the island. 'In the face of China's threats, Taiwan is duty-bound to protect its homeland and will continue to demonstrate its determination to defend itself,' Taiwan's foreign ministry said, responding to the arms sale.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-vows-countermeasures-after-2-billion-us-arms-sale-to-taiwan/7840681.html	2024-10-26T19:40:33-07:00	
Unpacking America's urban-rural divide	The divide between urban and rural voters is a key indicator in U.S. electoral politics. Cities favoring Democrats and rural areas favoring Republicans isn’t new. But since 2000, the gap has grown dramatically. What is behind this trend, and why is it so important? The answer is partly economic — but there are also complex cultural factors involved.

Israel hopes focused targets in retaliatory strike will limit Iranian response	Jerusalem — Israeli officials say its series of strikes Saturday overnight on Iran achieved their objectives. 'Following the directive of the political echelon, we carried out precise and targeted strikes on targets in different areas in Iran,' Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing. 'These included missile manufacturing facilities used by Iran in its attacks on the State of Israel over the past year. Simultaneously, we targeted Iran’s surface-to-air missile arrays and Iranian aerial capabilities that were intended to restrict Israel's aerial freedom of operation in Iran. Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran,' Hagari said. Iranian state news site IRNA quoted the nation’s air defense organization as saying Israel attacked military centers in Tehran and in the western provinces of Khuzestan and Ilam. It said Iranian forces 'successfully' intercepted many of the strikes, ensuring they caused only 'limited damage.' Israeli analysts said the decision to limit the attack to military targets gives Iran a way to back away from its escalating rhetoric against Israel. 'Israel didn't make it larger than it was expected,' Beni Sabit, an Iran expert at Tel Aviv’s Institute for National Security Studies, said. 'Last time, Iran attacked [Israel’s] military bases, air force bases, so Israel also attacked military bases, air force, air defense bases, and also some military factories for missiles and drones. 'So, we see that Israel wants to close this event to pass this message to Iran that it is closed, [this is] a closure, and we don't want to escalate it,' Sabit said. 'So now it depends on Iran, if they take this message, understand this message, or no — they want to escalate it, too.' The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said there had been no Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. 'Iran’s nuclear facilities have not been impacted. IAEA inspectors are safe and continue their vital work. I call for prudence and restraint from actions that could jeopardize the safety & security of nuclear & other radioactive materials,' Rafael Mariano Grossi wrote on social media platform X. One of Israel’s broadcast network’s reported that Israel initially planned to strike Iran’s oil and natural gas facilities but changed the targets after U.S. pressure, a claim the Israeli prime minister’s office called 'totally false.' 'Israel chose the targets ahead of time, based on its national interests,' the prime minister’s office said in a statement, 'and not based on American directives.' 'That’s how it was, and that’s how it will be,' the statement reads. Israeli analysts say the ball is now in Iran’s court, and they can choose to de-escalate the conflict with Israel. 'I do hope they realize that the best way to go would be to stop attacking Israel with ballistic missiles,' said Shmuel Spiro, a professor of national security at Bar Ilan University. 'If the Iranians would retaliate now, that may drive Israel to an even harsher response, and that could escalate into a regional conflagration. I don’t think any of the sides now need that and I hope that cooler minds will prevail,' Spiro said. The Israeli government did not issue any special instructions to the population after the strikes, meaning they did not expect an imminent Iranian response. On October 1, Iran attacked Israel with 200 missiles, which damaged property but did not cause any fatalities. Israel vowed at that time to respond, and almost a month later, it launched this series of attacks on Iran, which showed Israel’s capability for long-range attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-hopes-focused-targets-in-retaliatory-strike-will-limit-iranian-response/7840679.html	2024-10-26T19:23:17-07:00

China-led AIIB head criticizes advanced nations for trade barriers	washington — Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) President Jin Liqun on Saturday criticized advanced economies for creating trade barriers including for renewable energy goods, saying there was 'no longer free trade' in the global economy. The United States last month locked in steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports — including a 100% duty on electric vehicles — to strengthen protections for strategic domestic industries from China's state-driven excess production capacity. The European Union and Canada also have announced new import tariffs on Chinese EVs, the latter matching the 100% U.S. duties. Jin, who heads the China-led development bank, said trade spats between advanced and emerging economies have increased partly because manufacturers in the latter have boosted their competitiveness. Emerging economies that build up capacity for trade and become competitive could be accused for over-capacity 'no matter how much benefit you can bring to your trade partners,' he said. 'It's no longer free trade, because you cannot rely on the WTO rules,' Jin told the Group of Thirty (G30) International Banking Seminar. 'What worries us even more is the barriers to trade in low carbon and renewable energy products, which are rising even more faster, just when we need more of these green products to save the planet,' he said. AIIB was set up by President Xi Jinping in 2016 as a Chinese alternative to the World Bank and other Western-led multilateral lenders. 'I'm dismayed to see this spat over trade. Free trade has brought huge benefits to so many countries since the end of second World War,' he said. Jin also said the series of stimulus measures China's government has recently announced were different from those deployed during 2008-2009 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, in that they were now 'more focused.' China had more scope to expand fiscal stimulus, and so has been more proactive in expanding spending and issuing special bonds to help local governments and businesses, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-led-aiib-head-criticizes-advanced-nations-for-trade-barriers-/7840668.html	2024-10-26T18:26:36-07:00	
Curfew extended in French Caribbean territory amid power blackout	paris — French authorities maintained a night curfew amid fresh unrest on the Caribbean territory of Guadeloupe on Saturday as they battled to restore power they accused striking energy workers of sabotaging. Guadeloupe and the nearby French island of Martinique have seen weeks of often violent protests over the cost of living. A night curfew has been in force in Martinique for 16 days because of unrest there. French authorities kept Guadeloupe under curfew for a second night 'to guarantee safety and tranquility' after the island's power was completely cut on Friday. But pillagers took advantage of the blackout to ransack Guadeloupe's commercial center Pointe-a-Pitre. Looters busted through the windows of several stores with an excavator, in images filmed and published on social media, with some 50 people then piling in to snatch the contents. 'This is the second time in three years that my shop has been gutted,' said jewelry shop owner Carole Venutolo, her voice choked with grief and anger. Police said they were fired on with live ammunition, with bullets twice hitting one of their vehicles. The EDF power company said that two-thirds of the 380,000 people hit by a blackout had electricity again. Authorities accused striking workers of blocking the Jarry power station's engines and cutting electricity to the island. Regional government chief Guy Losbar said he was 'outraged' by the workers' actions. Authorities in Martinique, which has a population of about 350,000, said that despite the curfew around 50 masked 'troublemakers' had set up burning roadblocks in two districts. On previous nights, shots have been fired, trucks stolen and petrol stations looted, authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/curfew-extended-in-french-caribbean-territory-amid-power-blackout-/7840667.html	2024-10-26T18:06:09-07:00	
Thousands gather for east Asia's largest Pride march	taipei, taiwan — More than 180,000 people celebrated LGBTQ+ equality and diversity in Taipei on Saturday at east Asia's largest Pride march, joined by Taiwan Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim and the reigning queen of RuPaul's Drag Race, Nymphia Wind. Taiwan legalized same sex marriage in 2019 in a first for Asia and is a bastion of tolerance and liberalism in a region where the rights of sexual minorities are often either suppressed or outlawed. The streets of central Taipei were packed for the 22nd annual parade. Taiwan's Nymphia Wind, whose Drag Race win in April electrified the island, appeared wearing an outfit inspired by medieval armor with a rainbow flag shoulder cape. 'I just have to come back every year for the parade,' she said, describing her armor look as representing the defense of gay rights. Hsiao led the ruling Democratic Progressive Party delegation, marching behind a banner reading 'Be Yourself' and stopping every now and again to dance and wave to the crowd. 'I'm proud of you, and I'm proud of Taiwan,' she said before setting off. President Lai Ching-te, who last year while he was running for the presidency marched in Pride as the most senior government official ever to do so, posted a video message of support on social media, though said he could not take part in person due to prior appointments and for security reasons. 'The government will continue to work hard to put into practice gender equality so everyone in this land of Taiwan can embrace inclusion and not need fear what others think,' he said. Organizers put the number of attendees at more than 180,000. Taiwan's openness on LGBTQ+ issues stands in marked contrast with its giant neighbor China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own territory over the strong objections of the government in Taipei. While same sex relations are not illegal in China, same sex marriage is not recognized, and the government has been cracking down on activists and depictions of LGBTQ+ people in the media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-gather-for-east-asia-s-largest-pride-march-/7840664.html	2024-10-26T17:42:19-07:00	
Zelenskyy says North Korean troops poised to join war, cancels UN chief's visit	KYIV, Ukraine — North Korean troops are poised to be deployed by Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine as early as this weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Friday. Western officials have warned that North Korean units joining the fight would stoke the almost three-year war and bring geopolitical consequences as far away as the Indo-Pacific region. The possibility has alarmed leaders and deepened diplomatic tensions. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Friday that the top national security advisers for the United States, Japan and South Korea met and 'expressed grave concern' about North Korea's troop deployments for potential use with Russia on the battlefield against Ukraine. Kirby said that the national security advisers from the three countries 'call on Russia and the DPRK to cease these actions that only serve to expand the security implications of Russia's brutal and illegal war beyond Europe and into the Indo-Pacific.' 'It is possible that there are now more than 3,000 troops from North Korea that have been dispatched to Russia for outfitting and for training,' Kirby said on a call with reporters. Kirby said the U.S. government did not have firm intelligence assessments on where the troops were going 'but we believe it is certainly possible' and 'perhaps even likely' that some of the North Korean troops would be deployed to the Kursk region of Russia, where Ukraine has held some territory since capturing it in August. But he cautioned that he did not know in what capacity and to what purpose the North Korean troops would be deployed. A senior official in the Ukrainian presidential office told The Associated Press on Friday that Zelenskyy had canceled a planned visit to Kyiv by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the visit was supposed to come after this week's summit in the Russian city of Kazan of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, which Guterres attended. A photograph of Guterres shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the summit triggered an outcry in Ukraine. Zelenskyy, in a post on Telegram, said Ukrainian intelligence had determined that 'the first North Korean military will be used by Russia in combat zones' between Sunday and Monday. He said on Telegram that the deployment was 'an obvious escalating move by Russia.' He didn't provide any further details, including where the North Korean soldiers may be sent. Russia has been conducting a ferocious summer campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually compelling Kyiv to surrender ground. But Russia has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region following an incursion almost three months ago. North Korean units were detected on Wednesday in Kursk, according to Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate, known by its acronym GUR. The soldiers had undergone several weeks of training at bases in eastern Russia and had been equipped with clothes for the upcoming winter, GUR said in a statement late Thursday. It estimated the number of North Korean soldiers sent by Pyongyang to Russia at around 12,000, including some 500 officers and three generals. GUR provided no evidence for its claims. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said Friday on the social platform X that intelligence reports indicated the North Korean soldiers 'will probably first be deployed in Kursk.' The deployment of North Korean forces under a military pact between Moscow and Pyongyang brings a new dimension to the conflict, which is Europe's biggest war since World War II and has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides, including many civilians. The U.S. said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations, calling the move very serious. Zelenskyy said a week ago that his government has intelligence information that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being readied to join Russian forces fighting against his country. He said that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war.' North Korea had already been supplying ammunition to Russia under a defense pact, but putting boots on the ground could severely complicate a war that has inflamed international politics, with most Western countries supporting Kyiv. Putin, meanwhile, has looked for support among BRICS countries. He has neither confirmed nor denied that North Korean troops were in Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-says-north-korean-troops-poised-to-join-war-cancels-un-chief-s-visit/7840658.html	2024-10-26T17:25:39-07:00	
NASA astronaut released from hospital after return from space station	washington — A NASA astronaut who was hospitalized upon return from the International Space Station for an unspecified medical condition was released Saturday in 'good health,' the U.S. space agency said. The four-member Crew-8 mission splashed down off the coast of Florida early Friday after nearly eight months aboard the orbital laboratory. NASA did not reveal which of the astronauts was hospitalized nor the reason, citing medical privacy. However, it said in a blog post that the crew member has returned to the Johnson Space Center in Houston 'in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.' On its way back to Earth, the SpaceX Dragon executed a normal re-entry and splashdown, and recovery of the crew and spacecraft was without incident, NASA said. But during routine medical assessments on the recovery ship, an 'additional evaluation of the crew members was requested out of an abundance of caution,' it added, without elaborating. NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were all flown to Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola. Three were subsequently released, while one remained at the hospital 'under observation as a precautionary measure.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-astronaut-released-from-hospital-after-return-from-space-station/7840469.html	2024-10-26T17:01:41-07:00	
G7 agrees new steps to curb Russian sanctions evasion	New York — Finance ministers of the G7 nations vowed Saturday to step up efforts to prevent Russia from evading sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine. 'We remain committed to taking further initiatives in response to oil price cap violations,' the group said in a statement following a meeting in Washington. Those further steps were not spelled out in detail. In December 2022, the G7 together with the European Union and Australia agreed to pressure purchasers of Russian oil to not go above a certain price ceiling. The agreement was intended to limit Russian petroleum sales and revenues without curbing exports so sharply that it would cause global oil prices to soar. But some countries, notably China, have continued to import Russian crude oil without observing the price ceiling. The G7 finance ministers also said they would take additional measures aimed at 'increasing the costs to Russia of using the shadow fleet to evade sanctions.' Officials say Russia has used its fleet of shadow tankers, many of them old, unmarked and poorly maintained, to skirt sanctions by transporting oil without properly declaring their cargo or itineraries. The tankers sometimes load or transfer their cargo at sea to avoid unwanted attention. The United States and the EU have sanctioned several of these ships and their government owners, notably Russia's-owned maritime company Sovcomflot. The G7 ministers said they intended 'to intensify our efforts to prevent financial institutions from supporting Russia's evasion of our sanctions.' According to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, Russian financial institutions have developed a network of foreign subsidiaries to facilitate the purchase or sale of sanctioned goods. Joining the G7 ministers in the meeting Saturday were the heads of the seven countries' central banks, plus top officials of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The G7, which groups seven of the world's most advanced economies, announced Friday it had reached an agreement to provide a loan of around $50 billion to Ukraine. The loan will be repaid not by Ukraine but with the interest —roughly $3 billion a year — generated by Russian assets seized and frozen after the war began in February 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-agrees-new-steps-to-curb-russian-sanctions-evasion-/7840465.html	2024-10-26T16:36:12-07:00	
Commonwealth nations adopt their first ocean declaration	APIA, Samoa — Commonwealth countries adopted Saturday their first ocean declaration during their summit held for the first time in the Pacific island nation of Samoa as calls from some of Britain's former colonies for reparatory justice for the trans-Atlantic slave trade grew louder. The Apia Ocean Declaration was announced during the closing session of the 27th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, or CHOGM, and calls on all 56 Commonwealth nations to protect the ocean in the face of severe climate, pollution and overexploitation. More than half the Commonwealth members are small countries like Samoa; many face significant, some even existential, threats from rising seas. While the environmental threat was foreshadowed as a predominant theme going into the summit, the transatlantic slave trade from Britain's colonial history dominated the discourse through the opening days. The Apia Commonwealth Ocean Declaration for One Resilient Common focuses on recognizing maritime boundaries amid sea-level rise, protecting 30% of oceans and restoring degraded marine ecosystems by 2030, and urgently finalizing the Global Plastics Treaty. It also calls for ratifying the high-seas biodiversity treaty, developing coastal climate adaptation plans, and strengthening support for sustainable blue economies. Samoa Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa said in a statement released by her office that it was fitting for 'our first ocean declaration' to be adopted 'in the Blue Pacific continent given climate change has been recognised as the single greatest threat to the security and well-being of our people.' The Commonwealth represents a third of the world's population, and 49 of its 56 countries have a coastline. The organization says 25 of its members are increasingly impacted by climate change, rising sea levels, growing temperatures and increasing ocean acidity – impacting sea life, ecosystems and the communities that depend upon them. Mata'afa said the declaration must become 'a line in the sand' for the world to collectively transform 'ocean exploitation into protection and sustainable stewardship.' Outgoing Commonwealth Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland said in a statement they were 'immensely proud of this achievement' which 'sets the standard for forthcoming international meetings, generating momentum for ocean protection as we head towards COP29 in Azerbaijan in November, and next year's UN Ocean Conference'.' Calls from some of Britain's former colonies for a reckoning over its role in the transatlantic slave trade was the thorniest issue at the summit and specifically reparatory justice. 'Painful aspects of our past' At its height in the 18th century, Britain was the world's biggest slave-trading nation and transported more than 3 million Africans across the Atlantic. Its legacy is interwoven in some of the country's richest and most revered institutions — from the Church of England to the insurance giant Lloyd's of London to the monarchy itself. King Charles III, who attended his first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting as sovereign, said in his address on Friday history couldn't be changed but that he understood 'the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate.' Although he stopped short of mentioning financial reparations, which some leaders at the event urged, his remarks were seen as an acknowledgment of how strongly many felt about the issue in countries that Britain once colonized. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had entered the summit vowing the U.K. would not offer an apology for slavery or discuss reparations. He left with that promise mostly intact, though the final communique called for discussion of the matter. 'Truthful, respectful conversation' encouraged The 52-point official Leaders Statement on Saturday included a paragraph that urged a 'meaningful, truthful, respectful conversation' to build a fair future. The communique also directed the Commonwealth secretary-general to engage governments and stakeholders in reparatory justice consultations, with a special focus on the impact on women and girls. Earlier in the week, Starmer suggested that opening the door to a conversation about reparations could lead to 'very, very long endless discussions.' '(The communique) agrees that this is the time for conversation,' Starmer said at a press conference in Apia on Saturday. 'But I should be really clear here. In the two days we've been here, none of the discussions have been about money. Our position is very, very clear in relation to that.' 'Let me first be clear that the slave trade, slave practice, was abhorrent, and it's very important we start from there. Abhorrent is the right word.' Earlier Saturday, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, the Ghanaian foreign minister, was announced as the incoming secretary-general of the Commonwealth. Botchwey, who has urged financial reparations for the past enslavement of colonized people, replaces Patricia Scotland of the United Kingdom, who had been in the post since 2016. Antigua and Barbuda was also announced as the host for the next CHOGM in 2026.	https://www.voanews.com/a/commonwealth-nations-adopt-their-first-ocean-declaration-/7840452.html	2024-10-26T16:28:33-07:00

Thousands of demonstrators march across Italy to call for end to wars	ROME — Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in seven Italian cities on Saturday calling for an immediate cease-fire in the Middle East, Ukraine and all global conflicts. Peaceful rallies were held in Rome, Turin, Milan, Florence, Bari, Palermo and Cagliari, with the support of hundreds of associations committed to peace, disarmament and human rights. The marches came in response to escalating violence in the Middle East and growing conflicts worldwide and denounced the diminished role of the United Nations on the global scene. In Rome, a few thousand demonstrators marched waving a giant rainbow flag in front of the Colosseum and a banner with the slogan: 'Let's stop wars. The time for peace is now!' 'The war in Ukraine has been going on for years now and what was the result? Nothing. … There are only a lot of Ukrainian and Russian people who died, many soldiers and many children,' said Daniela Ferraci, a demonstrator in the Italian capital. 'The same is happening in Gaza, in Israel, in Lebanon.' Giulio Marcon, one of the organizers of the Rome rally, said 'wars are never resolving problems.' 'War brings more war, weapons bring more weapons. We must choose the path of negotiation, cease-fire and diplomacy. This is the message from this square,' he said. Maurizio Landini, leader of Italy's CGIL trade union, called for the role of international diplomacy to be reaffirmed. 'Our strongest request is a cease-fire to let governments open a real peace conference, because the new world's balance can't be decided by wars,' he said on stage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-of-demonstrators-march-across-italy-to-call-for-end-to-wars/7840447.html	2024-10-26T15:25:10-07:00	
24 killed in Mexico when bus crashes after hitting trailer that detached from truck	mexico city — A bus tipped over in central Mexico after colliding with a trailer that detached from a truck transporting corn, killing 24 people and injuring five, Mexican authorities said Saturday. The crash happened at midnight Friday when the bus was leaving Tepic in the western Mexico state of Nayarit bound for Ciudad Juarez in northern Mexico. The injured were being treated at a hospital in Zacatecas. Juan Manriquez Moreno, coordinator of the National Guard in Zacatecas, said in a video statement shared on social media that the truck trailer detached on a highway. The passenger bus collided with the trailer and tipped over on its right side. Rodrigo Reyes Mugüerza, secretary general of the government in Zacatecas, also shared a statement from the scene of the accident. 'We send our solidarity and condolences to all the families and people who have lost a loved one in this unfortunate accident,' he said. He added that the highway where the crash happened was closed as officials secured the area. Authorities said they will soon release the names of the injured so families can locate them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-after-bus-in-mexico-crashes-after-colliding-with-trailer-that-detached-from-truck/7840440.html	2024-10-26T15:02:24-07:00	
At least 126 dead, missing after flooding, landslides in Philippines	TALISAY, Philippines — The number of dead and missing in massive flooding and landslides wrought by Tropical Storm Trami in the Philippines has reached nearly 130 and the president said Saturday that many areas remained isolated with people in need of rescue. Trami blew away from the northwestern Philippines on Friday, leaving at least 85 people dead and 41 others missing in one of the Southeast Asian archipelago's deadliest and most destructive storms so far this year, the government's disaster-response agency said. The death toll was expected to rise as reports come in from previously isolated areas. Dozens of police, firefighters and other emergency personnel, backed by three backhoes and sniffer dogs, dug up one of the last two missing villagers in the lakeside town of Talisay in Batangas province on Saturday. A father, who was waiting for word on his missing 14-year-old daughter, wept as rescuers placed the remains in a black body bag. Distraught, he followed police officers, who carried the body bag down a mud-strewn village alley to a police van when one weeping resident approaching him to express her sympathies. The man said he was sure it was his daughter, but authorities needed to do checks to confirm the identity of the villager dug up in the mound. In a nearby basketball gym at the town center, more than a dozen white coffins were laid side by side, bearing the remains of those found in the heaps of mud, boulders and trees that cascaded Thursday afternoon down the steep slope of a wooded ridge in Talisay's Sampaloc village. President Ferdinand Marcos, who inspected another hard-hit region southeast of Manila on Saturday, said the unusually large volume of rainfall dumped by the storm — including in some areas that saw one to two months' worth of rainfall in just 24 hours — overwhelmed flood controls in provinces lashed by Trami. 'The water was just too much,' Marcos told reporters. 'We're not done yet with our rescue work,' he said. 'Our problem here, there are still many areas that remained flooded and could not be accessed ...' His administration, Marcos said, would plan to start work on a major flood control project that can meet the unprecedented threats posed by climate change. More than 5 million people were in the path of the storm, including nearly half a million who mostly fled to more than 6,300 emergency shelters in several provinces, the government agency said. In an emergency Cabinet meeting, Marcos raised concerns over reports by government forecasters that the storm — the 11th to hit the Philippines this year — could make a U-turn next week as it is pushed back by high-pressure winds in the South China Sea. The storm was forecast to batter Vietnam over the weekend if it would not veer off course. The Philippine government shut down schools and government offices for the third day on Friday to keep millions of people safe on the main northern island of Luzon. Inter-island ferry services were also suspended, stranding thousands. Weather has cleared in many areas on Saturday, allowing cleanup work in most areas. Each year, about 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines, a Southeast Asian archipelago which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and flattened entire villages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-126-dead-and-missing-in-massive-flooding-landslides-in-philippines/7840435.html	2024-10-26T14:22:10-07:00	
Attack on police convoy in southeastern Iran kills 10 officers	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An attack on an Iranian police convoy Saturday in the country's restive southern province of Sistan and Baluchestan killed at least 10 officers, authorities said. Details remain scarce over the attack in Gohar Kuh, some 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) southeast of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Initially, reports simply described an attack by 'miscreants' without more information. But shortly after, Iranian state media said 10 officers had been killed. HalVash, an advocacy group for the Baluch people of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, posted photos and video of what appeared to be a disabled truck painted with the green stripe used by Iranian police vehicles. One graphic photo shared by the group showed what appeared to be the corpses of two police officers in the front seat of the truck. HalVash said the attack appeared to target two security force vehicles and all those riding in them were killed. The truck appeared to have only damage from bullets, rather than any explosive being used. The state-run IRNA news agency said that Eskandar Momeni, the country's interior minister, ordered an investigation into the incident that it described as causing the 'martyrdom of a number of police.' Authorities identified no immediate suspects for the attack, nor did any group claim responsibility. The assault came after Israel launched a major attack across Iran early Saturday morning. The Baluch regions across the three nations have faced a low-level insurgency by Baluch nationalists for more than two decades. Verifying information remains difficult in Iran's Sistan and Baluchistan, which for decades has been home to violence involving heroin traffickers. The province is one of the least developed parts of Iran. Relations between the predominantly Sunni Muslim residents of the region and Iran's Shiite theocracy have long been strained. Typical attacks involve hit-and-run assaults by militants in the region, like the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, that kill a few security officials at a time. However, there have been mass casualty attacks by militants in the past. In April, gunmen wearing explosive vests attacks several sites in the province, killing 10 before security forces gunned down 18 militants. Last December, another assault killed 11 and wounded eight others. Meanwhile, the Taliban said they are investigating reports that Afghan migrants had been killed by Iranian security forces in the region earlier in October, an incident that threatened to further strain relations between the nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/attack-on-a-police-convoy-in-a-restive-southeastern-province-of-iran-kills-10-officers-/7840431.html	2024-10-26T14:03:15-07:00	
War affects more than 600 million women and girls, UN says	united nations — More than 600 million women and girls are now affected by war, a 50% increase from a decade ago, and they fear the world has forgotten them amid an escalating backlash against women's rights and gender equality, top United Nations officials say. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a new report that amid record levels of armed conflict and violence, progress over the decades for women is vanishing and 'generational gains in women's rights hang in the balance around the world.' The U.N. chief was assessing the state of a Security Council resolution adopted on Oct. 31, 2000, that demanded equal participation for women in peace negotiations, a goal that remains as distant as gender equality. Guterres said current data and findings show that 'the transformative potential of women's leadership and inclusion in the pursuit of peace' is being undercut — with power and decision-making on peace and security matters overwhelmingly in the hands of men. 'As long as oppressive patriarchal social structures and gender biases hold back half our societies, peace will remain elusive,' he warned. The report says the proportion of women killed in armed conflicts doubled in 2023 compared with a year earlier; U.N.-verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence were 50% higher; and the number of girls affected by grave violations in conflicts increased by 35%. At a two-day U.N. Security Council meeting on the topic that ended Friday, Sima Bahous, head of the U.N. agency promoting gender equality known as UN Women, also pointed to a lack of attention to women's voices in the search for peace. She cited the fears of millions of women and girls in Afghanistan deprived of an education and a future; of displaced women in Gaza 'waiting for death'; of women in Sudan who are victims of sexual violence; and of the vanishing hopes of women in Myanmar, Haiti, Congo, the Sahel region of Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere. Bahous said the 612 million women and girls affected by war 'wonder if the world has already forgotten them, if they have fallen from the agenda of an international community overwhelmed by crises of ever deeper frequency, severity and urgency.' The world needs to answer their fears with hope, she said, but the reality is grim: 'One in two women and girls in conflict-affected settings are facing moderate to severe food insecurity, 61% of all maternal mortality is concentrated in 35 conflict-affected countries.' As for women's participation in decision-making and politics in countries in conflict, Bahous said it's stalled. 'The percentage of women in peace negotiations has not improved over the last decade: under 10% on average in all processes, and under 20% in processes led or supported by the United Nations,' she said. U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed announced the launch of a 'Common Pledge on Women's Participation in Peace Processes,' and urged governments, regional organizations and others involved in mediation to join the U.N. in taking concrete steps toward that end. The commitments include appointing women as lead mediators and team members, promoting direct and meaningful participation of women in peace processes, consulting women leaders at all stages and embedding women with expertise 'to foster gender-responsive peace processes and agreements,' she said. Many U.N. ambassadors who spoke at the council meeting focused on the lack of 'political will' to promote women in the peace process. 'We've seen how the lack of political will continues to stand in the way of the full implementation of the commitments entered into by member states,' Panama's U.N.

Israeli army leaves Gaza hospital, detains medics, says health ministry	cairo — Israeli forces withdrew from a hospital complex in northern Gaza on Saturday, one day after storming it, and the Palestinian enclave's health ministry said the troops had detained dozens of male medical staffers and some of the patients. Later on Saturday, the Palestinian official news agency WAFA said at least 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes on several houses in northern Gaza's Beit Lahiya. There was no immediate Israeli comment and no official confirmation from the health ministry on the death toll. Health officials said on Friday Israeli forces had stormed Kamal Adwan Hospital, one of three medical facilities struggling to operate in the area. Footage circulated by the health ministry — which Reuters could not immediately verify — showed damage to several buildings after the Israeli forces withdrew. Medics said at least 44 of the facility's 70-member team of the hospital had been detained by the army. It later said the army had released 14 of them, including the hospital's director. An Israeli military spokesperson declined comment on the hospital report. On Friday the Israeli military said it operated in the area of the hospital based on intelligence 'regarding the presence of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure' there. Medics said at least two children had died inside the intensive care unit after Israeli fire hit the generators and oxygen station in the facility on Friday. Medical staffers have refused Israeli army orders to evacuate the hospital or leave their patients unattended. Before the army raid, medics said at least 600 people had been in the hospital, including patients and their escorts. 'The safety and lives of patients who are left inside Kamal Adwan Hospital without medical staff and much needed medication are at risk now,' said Marwan Al-Hams of the health ministry. Israeli military strikes on the towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza have so far killed around 800 people during a three-week offensive, the Gaza ministry added. Israel says its forces returned to northern Gaza to root out Hamas fighters who regrouped there. The Israeli military said on Friday that three of its soldiers were killed in combat in the north of the Gaza Strip. 'Extremely dire' The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) described the situation in northern Gaza as 'extremely dire' and said people wishing to evacuate must be assured safe passage. 'Ongoing evacuation orders, and continued restriction on introduction of essential supplies, leaves the remaining civilian population in north Gaza in horrific circumstances,' the ICRC said in a statement on Saturday. 'Hospitals are being told to evacuate, leaving a potential vacuum of medical services for the many civilians who remain...,' it added. Senior Hamas official Basem Naim said Israel's incursions in northern Gaza and storming Kamal Adwan Hospital were a violation of international humanitarian law that it could not have committed without 'the protection of Western countries.' Israel regularly accuses Hamas of exploiting the civilian population and property, including hospitals and mosques, for military purposes. Hamas denies the accusation. The Israeli military said on Saturday it had expanded the humanitarian-designated area of Al-Mawasi in the southern Gaza Strip, where the army has in the past told Palestinians to go when forced to evacuate their homes. Separately on Saturday Israeli forces killed a Hamas member during a raid in the city of Tulkarm, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Israeli security force said in a statement. It said the man had been planning an imminent attack. Hamas said the man, identified as Islam Jamil Awda, had died 'clashing with the occupation forces who besieged him for hours in a house in Tulkarm camp.' Violence has surged across the West Bank since the start of the Hamas-Israel war in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians — including armed fighters, stone-throwing youths and civilian bystanders — have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces. Dozens of Israelis have also been killed in Palestinian street attacks over the past year. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7 attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed nearly 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-army-leaves-north-gaza-hospital-detains-medics-says-health-ministry-/7840411.html	2024-10-26T13:15:21-07:00

Arab world condemns Israeli attack on Iran, expresses concern of wider conflict	cairo — Arab governments reacted with mostly tepid condemnation of Israeli strikes overnight on Iran, expressing concern that a wider conflict could erupt, but avoiding strong language or taking any concrete action to protest the Israeli strikes. Iranian officials and government media denied that Israeli strikes on several locations in the country did serious damage to infrastructure, claiming that Iranian air defenses had 'stopped a number of Israeli missiles.' Tehran did admit, however, that two soldiers were killed in strikes on Iranian military facilities. Iranian media showed video to rebut reports that major oil facilities had been hit in the strikes. In the Arab world, both governments and media sided with Tehran to condemn the Israeli strikes, albeit avoiding strong language. The Saudi-owned Asharq Al Awsat newspaper posted a headline that Arab states 'condemn Israeli strikes on Iran [as a] breach of international law.' Saudi Arabia and Iran have been on the opposite sides of a number of Middle Eastern conflicts in recent years, most notably in Yemen, Syria and Iraq, and relations between the two countries remain strained. The Saudi foreign ministry — in a statement carried by the Saudi press agency — called on 'all parties to use the highest degree of self-restraint to avoid further escalation,' warning against the 'dangers of continuing military conflicts in the region.' Riyadh also urged international powerbrokers to exercise their responsibility to 'lessen tensions' in the Middle East. Saudi-owned al Arabia TV showed Iranians in Tehran expressing their views about the Israeli strikes, with one middle-aged man expressing relief the 'strikes were over without having resulted in a major catastrophe,' and a young woman insisting that she 'doesn't think that the Israeli strikes [overnight] would ignite a larger conflict.' In Cairo, the Egyptian foreign ministry issued a statement saying that Egypt is 'extremely worried about the dangerous and widening escalation in the Middle East.' Egypt and Iran have not had close relations in recent years, and they have remained strained since the government of former Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsi was toppled more than a decade ago. Egypt also condemned 'any actions that threaten stability in the region.' Egypt replaced veteran Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri several months ago, and his replacement, Badr Abdel Atti, has taken a more strident tone against Israel than his predecessor. Additionally, the Egyptian government recently replaced veteran intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, who had conducted numerous mediation sessions with Israeli officials in various conflicts in recent years, most notably the Gaza conflict that erupted in October of last year. The Sultanate of Oman, which has traditionally enjoyed close ties with Iran, 'strongly condemned the Israeli strikes on Iran,' calling them 'a grievous breach of Iranian sovereignty.' The sultanate, which has conducted back-channel negotiations in recent years between Iran and Western governments, including the U.S., urged the international community to 'take effective action to stop aggression and put an end to what it called the 'outrageous encroachment of the territory of regional states.' Qatar's foreign ministry also condemned the Israeli strikes on Iran, urging 'self-restraint and dialogue to avoid further destabilizing the region.' Qatar, like Egypt and Oman, has acted as a mediator in conflicts involving Iran and its regional allies in recent years, most notably the recent and ongoing conflict in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arab-world-reacts-with-tepid-condemnation-of-israeli-attack-on-iran/7840371.html	2024-10-26T11:50:29-07:00	
Suicide blast kills at least 8 in northwest Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Pakistani officials reported Saturday that a suicide bomber targeted a security checkpoint in a volatile region near the border with Afghanistan, killing at least eight people and injuring several others. The attack occurred in the town of Mir Ali in Pakistan’s militancy-hit North Waziristan district. At least two soldiers, four police officers and two civilians were said to be among the dead. Multiple area security officials confirmed the casualties, reporting that the bomber detonated a motorbike rickshaw filled with explosives at the checkpoint. The explosion also injured five security personnel, with local hospital sources describing the condition of some of them as 'critical.' Militants allied with the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, reportedly claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing. It came a day after fierce clashes with militants in districts surrounding North Waziristan killed at least 16 Pakistani security force members and injured many others. Pakistani officials have reported a dramatic surge in TTP-led gun attacks and suicide bombings in the country, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border province, where North Waziristan is located. The violence has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Pakistanis, half of them security forces, in the first 10 months of this year, according to independent research reports. Islamabad says TTP operates out of sanctuaries in Afghanistan and has intensified cross-border attacks since the Islamist Taliban regained power in the neighboring country. The Taliban government in Kabul has persistently denied allegations that the TTP or any other transnational militant groups are present on Afghan soil. TTP, commonly known as the Pakistani Taliban, is listed as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations and the United States. The group sheltered leaders of the Afghan Taliban in Pakistani border areas and joined them in staging years of insurgent attacks on U.S.-led international forces in Afghanistan until those departed in August 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suicide-blast-kills-at-least-8-in-northwest-pakistan/7840338.html	2024-10-26T10:34:14-07:00	
Experts: Apple’s removal of news apps in Russia sets 'dangerous precedent'	WASHINGTON — Analysts warn that Apple’s removal of two apps from an independent media site from its Russian App Store sets a 'dangerous precedent.' The affected apps are for Current Time, a Russian-language network produced by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL, in cooperation with VOA, and a Kyrgyz-language news app. RFE/RL and VOA are independent media outlets funded by the U.S. Congress. In a letter to RFE/RL, Apple said the action was in response to content that is deemed illegal in Russia. Apple added that in Russia, RFE/RL is labeled an 'undesirable' organization. RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said he is concerned about Apple’s compliance with Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media regulatory agency. 'We hope this decision — which is part of a trend to deny people in authoritarian countries access to uncensored information — will be reversed,' Capus said in a statement shared with VOA. Digital rights experts condemned the move. 'These trends set a dangerous precedent in which tech companies could inadvertently aid state-sponsored information censorship,' Matt Mahmoudi of Amnesty Tech told VOA. When tech companies comply with foreign government requests, it could be because they 'place profit margins over their obligations under international law,' according to Mahmoudi. These bans violate the U.N. right to free expression, he said. Apple did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, called on Apple to reinstate the apps. Such bans 'restrict access to vital information and embolden authoritarian regimes seeking to silence independent media in countries like Russia,' said CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, Gulnoza Said. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, analysts have documented how Moscow has used internet blocks along with laws around false information about the war and so-called 'undesirable' organizations to block independent media. Access to independent news is limited, with websites, including RFE/RL and VOA, blocked. In February, Russia also designated RFE/RL an 'undesirable organization.' The designation means that an entity is seen as a threat to national security. These organizations and their audiences can face penalties as a result. Separately, Russia experienced a mass YouTube outage in August. The platform is one of the few remaining sites where audiences can access independent information. The country has long experienced slow playback speeds, making video-watching nearly impossible. Russia at the time blamed YouTube’s parent company Google. But investigative reporters found Russia’s state regulator responsible. YouTube also rejected claims that it was responsible for the slowdown. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment. To circumvent censorship, audiences often rely on Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, to access banned apps, according to Anastasia Zhyrmont of the digital civil rights group Access Now. Last month, Apple was criticized after it banned 98 VPN services from its Russian App Store. The media regulator in July had publicly requested 25 be removed. 'The trend is very concerning,' Zhyrmont told VOA. 'VPNs are essential for users in restrictive environments, especially in Russia.' Some media sites that Russia has banned use technologies embedded in apps to circumvent the firewalls and bans. The news website Meduza, which is blocked inside Russia, uses data obfuscation technology to reach Russian audiences without a VPN, according to a representative from their tech team. 'It is cat-mice game — they're trying to block our tech, and we’re trying to come up with something new,' the representative, who asked not to be named for security reasons, told VOA in an email. Zhyrmont wants Apple to offer transparency on its decision to remove the news apps from the Russian market and on what Roskomnadzor’s requests looked like. Until then, she said, 'There’s an agreement between digital rights experts and human rights defenders that all that is happening is an act of censorship.' Russia scores 20 out of 100 on the Freedom on the Net index, where 0 shows the most restrictive digital environments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-apple-s-removal-of-news-apps-in-russia-sets-dangerous-precedent-/7840309.html	2024-10-26T10:02:26-07:00	
Major Vatican meeting sidelines talks of women priests, deacons	Rome — A major Vatican meeting gathering clerics and laity across the globe to discuss the future of the Catholic Church closes this weekend, thwarting discussion of women becoming priests or deacons in the world’s largest Christian denomination. But that didn’t stop a half-dozen Catholic women from 'ordination' in a secret ceremony in Rome that was not authorized by the Vatican. Jesuit Father Allan Deck, a professor at the Los Angeles-based Loyola Marymount University, told VOA that the Catholic Church under Pope Francis’ leadership recognizes the need for adaptability to realize its spiritual mission in the world at this time of significant change. 'Not the first time that the church in its 2,000-year history has experienced very significant shifts,' he said. 'The church, in order to accomplish its mission, has to engage people, circumstances and times. And it has to be capable of development, while at the same time remaining faithful to its mission and to the revelation that has been communicated to it. This is hard. This is what’s happening.' While Catholic women participated over the past month in what many consider the most significant Catholic gathering since the 1960s — called the 'synod on synodality' — many of their number were let down by a Vatican decision to sideline talk of the ordination of female priests or deacons, instead referring the matter to a future study group. Bridget Mary Meehan, an American co-founder of the Association of Roman Catholic Women Priests, told VOA that her organization has performed 270 ordinations of women in 14 countries since its creation in 2002. 'We wanted to share with Pope Francis that it is time to build a bridge between the international women priests’ movement and the Vatican,' she said. 'We are on the same page as he is about a synodal church. We believe all are called, all are equal and all are co-responsible for the mission of the church — to be the face of Christ in the world in loving and compassionate service. One of these ways is ordained ministry.' Advocates say women play a huge role in daily Catholic ministries — also called the diakonia — in education, pastoral care and hospitals worldwide. In some places, women are especially active because there are no priests, such as in the Amazon. But often their leadership is not recognized. Meehan 'ordained' six Catholic women from France, Spain and the United States on a barge on Rome’s Tiber River earlier this month to acknowledge their central role in ministry around the world. 'We did it because we felt that it’s time for us, after 22 years of serving the church in the diakonia ministry, to really share the good news that women are being ordained by Catholic communities who want to call them forward to ministry among them,' Meehan said. 'It’s like a renewal of ministry that is already in the midst of the Catholic Church. It’s already occurring,' she said. Although Pope Francis has appointed more women to top jobs at the Vatican than any of his predecessors, he has ruled out female priests or deacons ministering in the Catholic Church.	https://www.voanews.com/a/major-vatican-meeting-sidelines-talks-of-women-priests-deacons/7840263.html	2024-10-26T08:52:06-07:00	
Ten Iranian border guards killed in attack near southeastern border	DUBAI — Ten Iranian border guards were killed in an attack in restive southeastern Iran on Saturday, state media quoted the Interior Ministry as saying, in the latest clash with suspected Sunni Muslim militants.

It has long been the site of clashes between Iranian security forces and Sunni militants, as well as drug traffickers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ten-iranian-border-guards-killed-in-attack-near-southeastern-border/7840202.html	2024-10-26T07:00:58-07:00	
Five things to know about Israel's attack on Iran	JERUSALEM — Israel delivered its long-expected response to Iranian missile attacks early Saturday by carrying out a series of airstrikes against the Islamic Republic. Here's what to know: Multiple targets were struck Under the cover of darkness, Israel struck multiple sites in different parts of Iran. Explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, which sits deep inside the country. The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities used to produce weapons that have been used against Israel. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage.' It was not immediately clear how hard of a blow Israel dealt, with neither country providing detailed assessments of the destruction. Iran said the strikes targeted military bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. Israel appeared confident in its battering of Iran's air defenses, with military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari saying that 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' What wasn't hit also matters The strikes did not appear to target facilities that would all but ensure a harsh Iranian response. Those most notably include Iran's oil infrastructure, the backbone of the OPEC member's economy, and its nuclear facilities. U.S. President Joe Biden earlier this month said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. officials felt they had secured agreement from Israel not to hit nuclear or oil sites after dispatching another air-defense missile battery and associated troops, although those assurances were not set in stone. This attack has finished Israel signaled that the predawn bombardment was the end of this attack. 'The retaliatory strike has been completed, and its objectives have been achieved,' Hagari said early Saturday, still the Sabbath in Israel. Not long after, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said commercial flights would resume after being halted because of the airstrikes. The Israeli attacks aimed to deter future aggression and 'show we won’t be silent' but to do so in a way that would minimize the embarrassment for Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. Outrage and calls for restraint The White House indicated that it wants the strikes to end the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, and it warned Iran against responding. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was a 'need to avoid further regional escalation' and called on all sides to show restraint. Reactions in the region were harsher. Saudi Arabia, Iran's main Arab rival, condemned the strike, calling it a threat to regional security and 'a violation of international laws and norms.' Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' and said, 'Putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty.' Syria and Iraq also condemned the strikes. So did U.S.-designated terror group Hamas, which along with other militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 hostages into Gaza. Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 42,600 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up for more than half the deaths. Iran's response will be key The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would respond to the airstrikes, calling them a clear violation of international law as it asserted Tehran's right to self-defense. Israel characterized Saturday's attack as a response to previous aerial assaults by Iran using missiles and exploding drones in April and a missile attack this month. Many of those projectiles were shot down before reaching their targets. Iran could attempt another direct bombardment, although doing so risks provoking yet another direct Israeli attack on its territory at a moment when its defenses are weakened. It could also encourage allied militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to intensify their attacks, although both have suffered serious blows in their ongoing wars with Israel. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are, in fact, quite serious,' predicted Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in by their own military limitations, economic constraints from sanctions and by the U.S. election outcome,' which could affect the course of further escalation or diplomatic outreach.	https://www.voanews.com/a/five-things-to-know-about-israel-s-attack-on-iran/7840180.html	2024-10-26T06:24:42-07:00	
Kiribati president secures 3rd term as China, US vie for Pacific leverage	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Kiribati President Taneti Maamau, who has led the Pacific Island nation to build closer ties with China in recent years, secured his third term in office on Saturday. He defeated two other candidates in an election closely monitored by countries around the world. Maamau won about 55% of the vote, while his nearest challenger, Kaotitaaake Kokoria, won 42% of the vote, New Zealand’s High Commissioner in Kiribati said. Kiribati’s chief justice, Tetiro Semilota, declared Maamau the winner and congratulated him. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon became the first international leader to congratulate Maamau for his victory on Saturday. 'We look forward to working with the Government of Kiribati to deliver on our shared priorities,' he wrote in a post on social media platform X. Kiribati is one of the countries that relies heavily on foreign aid. The cost of living, rising sea level and relations with China were the main issues leading up to Friday’s presidential election. Saturday’s outcome is viewed as the Kiribati voters’ endorsement of policies Maamau’s government has implemented over the last four years, including deepening the Pacific Island nation’s ties with China. During the parliamentary election in August, the ruling Tobwaan Kiribati Party, or TKP, secured 33 out of 44 seats in the new parliament, and Maamau won his seat by winning close to 83% of the votes in his district. 'The TKP has a very healthy majority [in the parliament], and it sort of shows that the people of Kiribati want to see more of what has been happening [over the last few years],' said Henryk Szadziewski, an expert on Pacific-China relations at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Since switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019, Kiribati has deepened its engagement with Beijing. The Maamau administration’s efforts to elevate security ties with the Chinese government have prompted concerns from partners such as Australia and the United States. In 2021, China helped Kiribati revamp a World War II-era airstrip on the island of Kanton, which is less than 3,000 kilometers from Hawaii and Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, where major U.S. military bases are located. In February, Kiribati’s acting police commissioner, Eeri Aritiera, revealed that Chinese police would help Kiribati’s community policing program and IT department, raising concerns from the U.S. that the cooperation could negatively impact Kiribati’s sovereignty. Some analysts say since China has ambitions to deepen its economic and security reach in the Pacific region, Australia and the United States are very concerned about any advancement in security relations between Beijing and Pacific Island countries. 'It’s unclear how the policing arrangement with Kiribati will evolve in Maamou’s next term, but it’s unlikely that Chinese engagement will cease or decrease,' said Meg Keen, a senior fellow at Lowy Institute in Australia. Despite these concerns, Szadziewski said Kiribati’s efforts to build closer ties with China shouldn’t be viewed through a pure zero-sum lens. 'The Kiribati economy is heavily reliant on tourism and fishing, and China has stepped up with infrastructure projects in that respect,' he told VOA by phone. But China’s engagement with Kiribati hasn’t been 'all benevolence,' Szadziewski said. 'Kiribati has opened up its maritime domain for increased Chinese fishing, so there is something in it for China that’s economic,' he said. During a reception celebrating the fifth anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic ties between China and Kiribati, the Chinese ambassador to Kiribati, Zhou Limin, said the relationship has further consolidated and vowed to strengthen synergy between the two countries in the future. Under Maamau’s third term, Keen in Australia said, Kiribati will likely maintain its close relationship with China while also trying to seek assistance from other countries, such as Australia, to help improve the country’s infrastructure and climate resilience. 'There’s no indication that the relationship with China will change under another term for Maamau, and he will be seeking a strong legacy in his final term by working with any development partner that can assist with his ambitious development goals,' Keen told VOA in a written response. She added that most Pacific leaders don’t view maintaining relations with China or other democratic countries such as Australia as 'an either/or choice.' In response to China’s elevated relations with Kiribati, Australia and the United States have also stepped up efforts to deepen ties with the Pacific Islands nation. In 2023, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong announced that Canberra would 'rapidly scale up' security and development with Kiribati during her visit to the country. In February, the U.S. Coast Guard conducted joint patrols with Kiribati in the country’s exclusive economic zone. Despite these efforts, Szadziewski at the University of Hawaii said it’s important for democratic countries to understand the priorities of Pacific Island countries and try to engage with them on 'equal footing.' 'Pacific Island states have heightened sensitivity about sovereignty, so they prefer to see exchanges with other states on an equal footing,' he told VOA, adding that democratic countries should ensure the priority of their engagement with Pacific Island countries is not solely about geopolitics. 'If China is your main concern and why you are in the region, that’s not going to be something of interest to the Pacific Island leaders,' Szadziewski said. In addition to the presidential election in Kiribati, Palau is going to hold a general election on November 5, with the current president, Surangel Whipps Jr., running against former president Tommy Remengesau Jr. in a race that analysts say Beijing will be closely following. Experts say competition for geopolitical influence between China and the U.S. as well as its allies will intensify as countries try to engage with winners emerging from these important elections in the Pacific region. 'Election periods will always heighten activities, and competition [between these countries] is only going to get more intense over the next couple of years,' Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told VOA by phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kiribati-president-secures-3rd-term-as-china-us-vie-for-pacific-leverage/7840112.html	2024-10-26T04:07:46-07:00	
Israel deploys multilayered missile defense system	Israel has multilayered air defenses against attacks by regional adversaries such as Iran, where military sites were hit by Israeli strikes on Saturday in the latest exchange in the escalating conflict between the Middle East rivals. Israel said it was retaliating for Tehran's missile attack on Israeli targets on October 1. Israel has been honing its air defenses since coming under Iraqi Scud salvoes in the 1991 Gulf war, in addition to receiving support from the United States, which said in October it had sent an advanced anti-missile system to Israel to support those defenses. Here are details of Israel's missile defenses: Arrow The long-range Arrow-2 and Arrow-3 interceptors, developed by Israel with an Iranian missile threat in mind, are designed to engage threats in and outside the atmosphere, respectively. They operate at an altitude that allows for the safe dispersal of any nonconventional warheads. State-owned Israel Aerospace Industries is the project's main contractor, while Boeing Company is involved in producing the interceptors. On October 31, 2023, Israel's military said it had used the Arrow aerial defense system for the first time since the outbreak three weeks before of the war with Hamas to intercept a surface-to-surface missile fired from the area of the Red Sea towards its territory. In September last year, Germany signed a letter of commitment with Israel to buy the Arrow-3 system for nearly $4.2 billion. David’s Sling The midrange David's Sling system is designed to shoot down ballistic missiles fired from 100 to 200 kilometers away. Developed and manufactured jointly by Israel's state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and the U.S. RTX Corporation, formerly known as Raytheon, David's Sling is also designed to intercept aircraft, drones and cruise missiles. Iron Dome The short-range Iron Dome air defense system was built to intercept the kind of rockets fired by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas in Gaza. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. backing, it became operational in 2011. Each truck-towed unit fires radar-guided missiles to blow up short-range threats such as rockets, mortars and drones in midair. Rafael says it delivered two Iron Dome batteries to the U.S. Army in 2020. Ukraine is seeking a supply as well in its war with Russia, although Israel has so far provided Kyiv with only humanitarian support and civil defenses. A naval version of the Iron Dome to protect ships and sea-based assets was deployed in 2017. The system determines whether a rocket is on course to hit a populated area; if not, the rocket is ignored and allowed to land harmlessly. Iron Dome was originally billed as providing city-size coverage against rockets with ranges of between 4 and 70 kilometers (2.5 to 43 miles), but experts say this has since been expanded. Laser-based system Israel's interception systems cost between tens of thousands and millions of dollars to shoot down incoming threats. Israel is developing a laser-based system to neutralize enemy rockets and drones at an estimated cost of just $2 per interception. U.S. THAAD system The U.S. military said on October 21 it had sent the advanced antimissile system THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, to Israel. THAAD is a critical part of the U.S. military's air defenses and is designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missile threats in their terminal phase of flight.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-deploys-multilayered-missile-defense-system/7840099.html	2024-10-26T03:17:57-07:00	
Indonesia presses China for more investment in high-speed railways	Jakarta — One year after the opening of Indonesia's first high-speed railway that connects Jakarta to Bandung, named Whoosh, Indonesia is courting China to invest in an extension of the line eastward to the port city of Surabaya in East Java. The rail service is one of former President Joko Widodo's flagship infrastructure projects and part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. The Whoosh attracted over 4 million passengers in its first year, and the government has added more trips. Currently, the government is carrying out a feasibility study to extend the Jakarta-Bandung line to Surabaya in hopes of increasing use of the rail service. The extension would cut the journey from Jakarta to the port city from eight hours to only four. Danang Parikesit, professor of transport policy at Gajah Mada University, said the extension to Surabaya would have a positive economic impact, especially on cities where high-speed rail stations are located. 'This will further push the economic integration of Java and maintain the growth momentum for Indonesia in the service and trade sector.' Indonesia pitched three major railway projects during a rail expo in Shanghai in June. The projects include interconnecting the high-speed train, Whoosh, to urban railway systems in Bandung, an airport line in the future capital city of Nusantara, and an urban railway connecting Nusantara to neighboring cities. Transportation Ministry and Railways Director General Risal Wasal said these projects were part of the ministry's strategic plans for 2024-2029. The Bandung railway is projected to have an investment return rate of 11.9% and the government will support it with a viability gap fund covering 49% of the costs, according to the ministry. 'With such potential, we invite you to participate in the Bandung Urban Railway project through a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme with a concession period of up to 30 years,' Risal said in a statement to potential private investors. Danang added, 'Our transportation infrastructures face a backlog for many years and reduced our competitiveness in goods and services, both domestic and international. 'Indonesia's long-term development plans will be able to cut logistical costs by half. That's why we need international partners to invest and improve our highways, railways system, ports and airports as well as other infrastructures like gas pipes and floating storage.' Chinese investment in Bali and Nusantara In August, an Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit system, or ART, funded by China, was showcased at Indonesia's 79th Independence Day celebrations in Nusantara. Other growing urban cities, such as Bali, are also courting China to build its first Light Rail Transit, or LRT, system. The state-owned China Railway Construction Corporation (CRRC), involved in the construction of the Jakarta-Bandung high speed railway, is set to participate in building Bali's LRT system. However, Danang warned that over-dependence on China's investment will not be sustainable. 'Diversifying and extending partnership with other countries will provide a better base for our future transportation development. So I believe, we need to balance between the urgent need for our transport investment and to diversify our partnership, taking the best of what different countries can offer,' he explained. China overtaking Japan in Indonesia's railway sector China is not only making strides in building new railways but is also playing a growing role in replacing the aging fleet of the Greater Jakarta Commuter Line, according to some experts. Research done by the University of Malang found that Japan, through official development assistance loans, has helped Indonesia in rail modernization projects in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi (Jabodetabek) areas. But Fadlan Muzakki, a researcher at the ASEAN-China Research Center of Universitas Indonesia, said China is now surpassing Japan in developing the nation's railway sector. 'Indonesia chose China because China offered to transfer technical knowledge to Indonesia without any condition or complicated requirements and they were persistent in their lobby efforts,' he said. Fadlan's research indicates that Japan was willing to fully transfer knowledge of its train technology if Indonesia had paid 25% to 30% of its debt. That means Indonesia would have needed to wait at least five to 10 years before the technology transfer was completely provided. As a result, in February, PT Kereta Commuter Indonesia, a subsidiary of PT Kereta Api Indonesia, signed an agreement with China's CRRC to purchase three complete trains for $49.15 billion. Five months later, it decided to procure another eight trains. Fadlan warned that Indonesia should not become overly reliant on Chinese investment in the transportation sector. He suggested that Indonesia diversify its investment sources, allow for public fundraising, and implement strong risk assessment and negotiation strategies when dealing with Chinese investors. According to Mark Green, president of the Wilson Center, 10 years into the Belt and Road Initiative, 80% of China's government loans to developing countries have gone to nations in debt distress, further exacerbating economic problems such as inflation, currency depreciation and rising poverty levels. Djoko Setijowarno, a transportation analyst, agreed that Indonesia should further develop the state-owned train manufacturing company, PT Industri Kereta Api (INKA), to meet Indonesia's growing demand for trains rather than merely importing trains from China. INKA has exported trains worth $72.39 million to Bangladesh and worth over $26 million to the Philippines. Danang pointed out that Indonesia has set its next 20-year development plan with hopes to become a high-income country in 2045. He said that increased transport investment that will boost the country's competitiveness in the global market and reduce economic disparities among regions and social classes will be instrumental to achieve this target.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-presses-china-for-more-investment-in-high-speed-railways/7840093.html	2024-10-26T02:50:23-07:00	
Russian attacks on central Ukraine, Kyiv kill 5	Russian missile strikes killed three people including a child in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro while a teenager and another person died in attacks on Kyiv and the surrounding region, officials said Saturday. Overnight strikes on Dnipro wounded 19 others and damaged multiple buildings, said Sergiy Lysak, the governor of the central Dnipropetrovsk region. A two-story residential building was destroyed, he said. Images shared by Lysak showed rescuers working in a pile of rubble, while another showed what appeared to be a hospital room with its windows blown out. 'Three people were killed in Dnipro, including a child. Nineteen were injured, four of them children. Eight are hospitalized,' Lysak said. Separate night attacks on the capital Kyiv and surrounding region left two people dead, including a teenage girl who was killed in a drone strike, according to regional authorities. Ukrainian cities including Kyiv have been subjected to deadly drone and missile attacks throughout Russia's invasion. Kyiv has been asking for more air defenses from its allies ahead of what is likely to be its toughest winter yet, as Moscow ramps up strikes on energy infrastructure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-attacks-on-central-ukraine-kyiv-kill-5/7840091.html	2024-10-26T02:36:29-07:00	
India's green fashion lovers switch to secondhand	New Delhi, India — India's enormous garment sector churns out billions of dollars' worth of new clothes each year, but some local fashion lovers are switching to secondhand to assuage worries about the industry's environmental impact. It is a tiny drop in a massive ocean, but hipster shoppers in the capital New Delhi say their example is slowly shifting the throwaway attitudes rampant among India's middle class. New Delhi is dotted with markets offering secondhand clothes, a thrifty alternative for those on low wages — or making an ethical choice. 'It's an environmentally conscious decision,' said Yuvika Choudhary, a 21-year-old student shopping for vintage clothes. There is rarely an effective system for recycling clothing in India, with waste overflowing in towering landfills. Kriti Tula, 36, used repurposed fabric to found the fashion brand Doodlage in 2012. When she started, she was worried about telling shoppers her products were made from waste. But a decade later she said there was a greater awareness of the importance of sustainability. 'It's important to circulate things that are already existing,' Tula said. 'The only way to circulate them is to think of ways to rent, to thrift and to repair.' India is the world's fifth biggest garment exporter, with the trade worth $15 billion in 2023, according to the World Trade Organization. The industry employs 45 million people, according to the government-backed Invest India agency, nearly the same as the population of Spain. 'Consumption' Some in India turned to thrift shopping after being restricted at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and finding online stores promoted on social media. Neha Butt, 33, first ran her secondhand clothes business on Instagram before opening a physical store in the capital New Delhi in 2022. She said her Huckleberry Hangers store would have been unthinkable before the 'help of Instagram and because of climate awareness.' The market is microscopic compared to the industrial production of new garments, but shoppers say it is more about the message that it sends — and changing attitudes has to start somewhere. Swati Sambyal, an expert in the circular economy, warned that effective resource management required tackling the mass generation of textiles in the first place. 'When it comes to textile waste as an issue, we also have to address both generation as well as consumption patterns,' she said. Sambyal said some brands were shifting to using natural textiles, including ones made from banana and pineapple fibers, in a bid to reduce their environmental impact. But in the end, she said, nothing will change unless the consumer changes too. 'It depends entirely on the consumer,' she said. 'It's at their will and decision.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-weekend---india-s-green-fashion-lovers-switch-to-secondhand-/7839014.html	2024-10-26T02:15:42-07:00	
Villagers are wary of plans to dam a river to ensure Panama Canal's water supply	EL JOBO, Panama — A long, wooden boat puttered down the Indio River’s chocolate waters carrying Ana María Antonio and a colleague from the Panama Canal Authority on a mission to hear directly from villagers who could be affected by plans to dam the river. The canal forms the backbone of Panama’s economy, and the proposed dam would secure the water needed to ensure the canal’s uninterrupted operation at a time of increasingly erratic weather. It also would flood villages, where about 2,000 people would need to be relocated and where there is opposition to the plan, and curb the flow of the river to other communities downstream. Those living downstream know the mega-project will substantially alter the river, but they hope it will bring jobs, potable water, electricity and roads to their remote communities and not just leave them impoverished. 'We, as the Panama Canal, understand that many of these areas have been abandoned in terms of basic services,' Antonio said. The canal The Panama Canal was completed in 1914 and generates about a quarter of the government's budget. Last year, the canal authority reduced the number of ships that could cross daily by about 20% because rains hadn’t replenished the reservoirs used to operate the locks, which need about 50 million gallons of fresh water for each ship. It led to shipping delays, and in some cases companies looking for alternatives. By the time restrictions were lifted this month, demand had fallen. To avoid a repeat due to drought exacerbated by climate change, the plan to dam the Indio River was revived. It received a boost this summer with a ruling from Panama’s Supreme Court. For years, Panama has wanted to build another reservoir to supplement the main supply of water from Lake Gatun — a large manmade lake and part of the canal’s route — but a 2006 regulation prohibited the canal from expansion outside its traditional watershed. The Supreme Court’s decision allowed a re-interpretation of the boundaries. The Indio runs roughly parallel to the canal, through the isthmus. The new reservoir on the Indio would sit southwest of Lake Gatun and supplement the water from there and what comes from the much smaller Alhajuela Lake to the east. The Indio reservoir would allow an estimated 12 to 13 additional canal crossings each day. The reservoirs also provide water to the more than 2 million people — half the country’s population — living in the capital. The river Monkeys screeched in the thick jungle lining the Indio on an August morning. The boat weaved around submerged logs below concrete and rough timber houses high on the banks. Locals passed in other boats, the main means of transportation for the area. At the town of El Jobo, Antonio and her colleague carefully climbed the muddy incline from the river to a room belonging to the local Catholic parish, decorated with flowers and bunches of green bananas. Inside, residents from El Jobo and Guayabalito, two communities that won't be flooded, took their seats. The canal authority has held dozens of such outreach meetings in the watershed. The canal representatives hung posters with maps and photos showing the Indio’s watershed. They talked about the proposed project, the Supreme Court’s recent decision, a rough timeline. Antonio said that canal officials are talking to affected residents to figure out their needs, especially if they are from the 37 tiny villages where residents would have to be relocated. Canal authorities have said the Indio is not the only solution they’re considering, but just days earlier canal administrator Ricaurte Catín Vásquez said it would be the most efficient option, because it has been studied for at least 40 years. That’s nearly as long as Jeronima Figueroa, 60, has lived along the Indio in El Jobo. Besides being the area’s critical transportation link, the Indio provides water for drinking, washing clothes and watering their crops, she said. 'That river is our highway and our everything,' she said. The dam's effect on the river's flow was top of mind for the assembled residents, along with why the reservoir is needed, what would the water be used for, which communities would have to relocate, how property titles would be handled, would the construction pollute the river. Puria Nuñez of El Jobo summed up the fears: 'Our river isn’t going to be the same Indio River.' Progress Kenny Alexander Macero, a 21-year-old father who raises livestock in Guayabalito, said it was clear to him that the reservoir would make the canal a lot of money, but he wanted to see it spur real change for his family and others in the area. 'I’m not against the project, it’s going to generate a lot of work for people who need it, but you should be sincere in saying that ‘we’re going to bring projects to the communities that live in that area,’' he said. 'We want highways. Don’t try to fool us.' One complication was that while the canal authorities would be in charge of the reservoir project, the federal government would have to carry out the region's major development projects. And the feds weren’t in the room. The project is not a guarantee of other benefits. There are communities along Lake Gatun that don’t have potable water. Gilberto Toro, a community development consultant not involved in the canal project, said that the canal administration is actually more trusted by people than Panama’s federal government, because it hasn’t been enmeshed in as many scandals. 'Everybody knows that the canal projects come with a seal of guarantee,' Toro said. 'So a lot of people want to negotiate with the canal in some way because they know what they’re going to offer isn’t going to be trinkets.' Figueroa expressed similar faith in the canal administrators, but said that residents would need to monitor them closely to avoid being overlooked. 'We can’t keep living far behind like this,' she said. 'We don’t have electricity, water, healthcare and education.' Next steps President José Raúl Mulino has said a decision about the Indio River project would come next year. The canal administration ultimately will decide, but the project would require coordination with the federal government. No public vote is necessary, but the canal administrator has said they are looking to arrive at a public consensus. Opposition has emerged, not surprisingly, in communities that would be flooded. Among those is Limon, where the canal representatives parked their car and boarded a boat to El Jobo. It’s where the reservoir’s dam would be constructed. The highway only arrived there two years ago and the community still has many needs. Olegario Hernández has had a sign out in front of his home in Limon for the past year that says: 'No to the reservoirs.' The 86-year-old farmer was born there and raised his six children there. His children all left the area in search of opportunities, but Hernández wants to stay.	https://www.voanews.com/a/villagers-are-wary-of-plans-to-dam-a-river-to-ensure-panama-canal-s-water-supply/7835718.html	2024-10-26T02:14:57-07:00	
US Navy will apologize for 1882 obliteration of Tlingit village in Alaska	Shells fell on the Alaska Native village as winter approached, and then sailors landed and burned what was left of homes, food caches and canoes. Conditions grew so dire in the following months that elders sacrificed their own lives to spare food for surviving children. It was Oct. 26, 1882, in Angoon, a Tlingit village of about 420 people in the southeastern Alaska panhandle. Now, 142 years later, the perpetrator of the bombardment — the U.S. Navy — is set to say it is sorry. Rear Adm. Mark Sucato, the commander of the Navy's northwest region, will issue the apology during a ceremony on Saturday, the anniversary of the atrocity. While the rebuilt Angoon received $90,000 in a settlement with the Department of Interior in 1973, village leaders have for decades sought an apology as well, beginning each yearly remembrance by asking three times, 'Is there anyone here from the Navy to apologize?' 'You can imagine the generations of people that have died since 1882 that have wondered what had happened, why it happened, and wanted an apology of some sort, because in our minds, we didn't do anything wrong,' said Daniel Johnson Jr., a tribal head in Angoon. The attack was one of a series of conflicts between the American military and Alaska Natives in the years after the U.S. bought the territory from Russia in 1867. The U.S. Navy issued an apology last month for destroying the nearby village of Kake in 1869, and the Army has indicated that it plans to apologize for shelling Wrangell, also in southeast Alaska, that year, though no date has been set. The Navy acknowledges the actions it undertook or ordered in Angoon and Kake caused deaths, a loss of resources and multigenerational trauma, Navy civilian spokesperson Julianne Leinenveber said in an email. 'An apology is not only warranted, but long overdue,' she said. Today, Angoon remains a quaint village of about 420 people, with colorful old homes and totem poles clustered on the west side of Admiralty Island, accessible by ferry or float plane, in the Tongass National Forest, the nation's largest. The residents are vastly outnumbered by brown bears, and the village in recent years has strived to foster its ecotourism industry. Bald eagles and humpback whales abound, and the salmon and halibut fishing is excellent. Accounts vary as to what prompted its destruction, but they generally begin with the accidental death of a Tlingit shaman, Tith Klane. Klane was killed when a harpoon gun exploded on a whaling ship owned by his employer, the North West Trading Co. The Navy's version says tribal members forced the vessel to shore, possibly took hostages and, in accordance with their customs, demanded 200 blankets in compensation. The company declined to provide the blankets and ordered the Tlingits to return to work. Instead, in sorrow, they painted their faces with coal tar and tallow — something the company's employees took as a precursor to an insurrection. The company's superintendent then sought help from Naval Cmdr. E.C. Merriman, the top U.S. official in Alaska, saying a Tlingit uprising threatened the lives and property of white residents. The Tlingit version contends the boat's crew, which included Tlingit members, likely remained with the vessel out of respect, planning to attend the funeral, and that no hostages were taken. Johnson said the tribe never would have demanded compensation so soon after the death. Merriman arrived on Oct. 25 and insisted the tribe provide 400 blankets by noon the next day as punishment for disobedience. When the Tlingits turned over just 81, Merriman attacked, destroying 12 clan houses, smaller homes, canoes and the village's food stores. Six children died in the attack, and 'there's untold numbers of elderly and infants who died that winter of both cold, exposure and hunger,' Johnson said. Billy Jones, Tith Klane's nephew, was 13 when Angoon was destroyed. Around 1950, he recorded two interviews, and his account was later included in a booklet prepared for the 100th anniversary of the bombing in 1982. 'They left us homeless on the beach,' Jones said. Rosita Worl, the president of Sealaska Heritage Institute in Juneau, described how some elders that winter 'walked into the forest' — meaning they died, sacrificing themselves so the younger people would have more food. Even though the Navy's written history conflicts with the Tlingit oral tradition, the Navy defers to the tribe's account 'out of respect for the long-lasting impacts these tragic incidents had on the affected clans,' said Leinenveber, the Navy spokesperson. Tlingit leaders were so stunned when Navy officials told them, during a Zoom call in May, that the apology would finally be forthcoming that no one spoke for five minutes, Johnson said. Eunice James, of Juneau, a descendant of Tith Klane, said she hopes the apology helps her family and the entire community heal. She expects his presence at the ceremony. 'Not only his spirit will be there, but the spirit of many of our ancestors, because we've lost so many,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-navy-will-apologize-for-the-1882-obliteration-of-a-tlingit-village-in-alaska/7840082.html	2024-10-26T02:04:39-07:00	
In suburban Miami, Kmart's last 'Blue Light Specials' flicker	MIAMI, FLORIDA — The last Kmart on the U.S. mainland sits at the west end of a busy suburban Miami shopping center, quiet and largely ignored. All around it are thriving chain stores attracting steady streams of customers in sectors where the former box-store chain was once a major player: Marshalls, Hobby Lobby, PetSmart and Dollar Tree. But at this all-but-last outpost of a company once famed for its 'Blue Light Specials,' only an occasional shopper pops in, mostly out of curiosity or nostalgia, then leaves after buying little or nothing. 'I hadn’t seen Kmart in so long,' said Juan de la Madriz, who came to the shopping center on a recent weekday to buy dog food at PetSmart. The architect spotted the Kmart and wondered if he could find a gift for his newborn grandson. He exited 10 minutes later having spent $23 on a stuffed dog and a wooden toy workbench. 'It will be sad if it closes,' he said about the store, 'but everything now is on computers.' The last full-size Kmart in the 50 states closed Sunday in Long Island, New York, making the Miami store — now a fraction of its former size — the last operating in the continental United States. At its peak 30 years ago, Kmart operated about 2,500 locations. Today, four others remain: three in the U.S. Virgin Islands and one in Guam. There is also a website. Transformco, the Illinois-based holding company that owns Kmart and what’s left of another former retail behemoth, Sears, did not respond to email requests for comment or allow the store manager to speak. The company's plans for the Miami location are unknown — but there is no indication it will close soon. The last outpost If the Miami Kmart were a brand-new mom-and-pop retailer, a shopper might think it could eventually thrive with advertising and a little luck. Kmart long had a reputation for clutter and mess, but this store is immaculate, and the merchandise is precisely stacked and displayed. The size of a CVS or Walgreens drug store, the branch occupies what was its garden section during its big-box days. A couple years ago, an At Home department store took over the rest of the space. 'Get it all! Must Haves. Wish Fors. Friendly Faces,' the sign next to the door reads. Halloween and Christmas decorations line the entryway, next to the 30 shopping carts that no one is using. A robotic voice says 'Welcome,' as does a cheery employee, one of three spotted in the store. A lone customer checks out the Halloween candy. Straight ahead are a few dishwashers, refrigerators, washing machines and dryers: the appliance department. In the store’s main room, there is a large section of toiletries and diapers, a few hardware essentials and some cleaning and pet supplies. The toy department comprises a couple rows of dolls, action figures, games and squirt guns. Sun dresses, summer tops and sweatshirts make up the small clothing section. Oh, and there are snacks. Also still present: a recorded voice intoning a once-familiar message over a loudspeaker. 'Attention Kmart shoppers,' it says, announcing that almost all items are on sale. If there were only customers to hear it, like there used to be. A fast rise and a slow death Kmart was founded by the retailer S.S. Kresge Company in Michigan in 1962 and grew quickly, reaching 2,000 stores in 20 years. The company sold almost everything, from clothing to jewelry, TVs to dog food, appliances to toys to sporting goods. By the mid-1980s, it was the nation's second-largest retailer behind Sears, and there were stores in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The roots of Kmart's decline were laid during that decade when management bought Waldenbooks, Borders Books, Builders Square, Sports Authority and a stake in OfficeMax, thinking the company needed diversification. They were wrong. By the late 1990s, the company had sold those retailers yet still needed $5 billion in refinancing — the equivalent of $9 billion today. In 2002, Kmart declared bankruptcy as Walmart and Target devoured its market share. Its website never took off, allowing Amazon to beat it in the e-commerce space. There were executive pay scandals, a purchase by a hedge fund manager who stripped it bare and a disastrous 2005 acquisition of Sears. Mark Cohen, a former Sears Canada CEO and former director of retail studies at Columbia University’s graduate school of business, said Kmart would have thrived if not for the top executives who ran it into the ground. It could have been Walmart. 'It sold in its heyday things that people continue to buy in large quantities today,' Cohen said. 'Kmart went down the drain because it was led by incompetent managers.' Transformco bought Kmart and Sears out of another bankruptcy in 2019 for $5 billion — its critics say mostly for the stores' real estate. There were 202 Kmarts remaining. Over the past five years, the firm has kept closing Kmarts until all that's left in the states is Miami Store #3074. Nostalgia does not translate into sales On the day that de la Madriz dropped in to buy his grandson's gift, only a few customers trickled in and out of the store every hour. College students Joey Fernandez and Wilfredo Huayhua spent five minutes inside before leaving empty-handed. They knew about the chain’s near-demise, spotted the store while in the shopping center and went in to reminisce. It seemed small, they said, compared to the Kmarts they remembered. 'We were bummed out — I spent a lot of my childhood at Kmart,' said Fernandez, 18. Still, he might be back — the store has good prices on the facial cleanser he uses. Teacher Oliver Sequin had been entering Marshalls when he spotted the Kmart. That, too, triggered nostalgia but also reminded him he needed Band-Aids for his 5-year-old son. That was all he purchased. 'I remember when Kmarts were bigger,' Sequin said. 'But, to be honest, I like this one better. It is clean and organized, not like they were.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-suburban-miami-kmart-s-last-blue-light-specials-flicker/7838991.html	2024-10-26T01:58:06-07:00	
US missile agency scales back Guam defense plans	A proposed multibillion-dollar missile defense system for Guam has been reduced to 16 sites on the island from the original 22, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said in a draft environmental impact statement on Friday. The project is designed to create '360 degree' protection for the U.S. Pacific territory from missile and air attacks of all kinds, the agency said. Plans include integrating Raytheon's SM-6, SM-3 Block IIA, Lockheed Martin's THAAD, and the Patriot PAC-3, which uses components from both companies, over about 10 years. The environmental impact study, which began last year and included a public comment period this year, proposes 'deploying and operating and maintaining a combination of integrated components for air and missile defense positioned on 16 sites' on the island. The report does not say why the number of sites was reduced. All of the remaining 16 sites are on U.S. military property. The project is crucial to the U.S. and its Indo-Pacific allies because it provides a logistical hub far from U.S. shores - Guam is closer to China than it is to Hawaii. China's massive conventional ballistic missile inventory includes the DF-26, with an estimated range of about 4,000 km (2,500 miles), which can also carry anti-ship and nuclear warheads. Newer weapons in development, such as the hypersonic glide vehicle DF-27, are drawing increased attention from U.S. military planners. 'It’s a forward operating base for long-range bombers, and a port for ships, so that navy ships can sally forth from there,' said Peter Layton, a defense and aviation expert at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia. 'Certainly places in Japan and the Philippines are a lot closer (to China)... but a lot more exposed.' There will be public meetings in Guam next month to discuss Friday's report, the agency statement said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-missile-agency-scales-back-guam-defense-plans/7840058.html	2024-10-26T00:47:48-07:00	
US approves $2 billion arms sale to Taiwan including Ukraine tested missile system	The United States has approved a potential $2 billion arms sale package to Taiwan, the Pentagon said on Friday, including the delivery for the first time to the island of an advanced air defense missile system battle tested in Ukraine. The United States is bound by law to provide Chinese-claimed Taiwan with the means to defend itself despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, to the constant anger of Beijing. China has been stepping up military pressure against Taiwan, including holding a new round of war games around the island last week, the second time it has done so since Lai Ching-te took office as Taiwan's president in May. The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the new sale consisted of $1.16 billion in missile systems and radar systems worth an estimated $828 million. The principal contractor for the missile system will be RTX Corp, the Pentagon said. 'This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,' it said in a statement. 'The proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region.' The missile system sale is for three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) medium-range air defense solutions that includes the advanced AMRAAM Extended Range surface to air missiles, it added. The NASAMS system has been battle tested in Ukraine and represents a significant increase in air defense capabilities that the United States is exporting to Taiwan as demand for the system surges. A U.S. government source told Reuters on condition of anonymity that NASAMS was a new weapon for Taiwan, with Australia and Indonesia the only others in the region currently operating it. Taiwan's defense ministry welcomed the announcement, noting the 'proven' use of NASAMS in Ukraine and saying it would help Taiwan's air defense capabilities in the face of China's frequent military maneuvers. Taiwan's military is bolstering its armaments to be able to better face any attack from China, including building its own submarines to defend vital maritime supply lines. China detests Lai as a 'separatist' and has rebuffed his repeated calls for talks. Lai rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims saying only Taiwan's people can decide their future. China's government on Saturday kept up its attacks on Lai, denouncing comments he made on Friday on a sensitive frontline island about how no 'external force' can change Taiwan's future. 'There can be no future for 'Taiwan independence'. The future of Taiwan lies in the complete reunification of the motherland,' China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-approves-2-billion-arms-sale-to-taiwan-including-ukraine-tested-missile-system/7840053.html	2024-10-26T00:16:54-07:00	
Georgia votes in an election that could take it toward the EU or into Russia's orbit	Georgians headed to the polls Saturday in a ballot many citizens see as a make-or-break vote on the opportunity to join the European Union. The pre-election campaign in the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people has been dominated by foreign policy and marked by a bitter fight for votes and allegations of a smear campaign. Some Georgians complained of intimidation and being pressured to vote for the ruling party, Georgian Dream, while the opposition accused the party of carrying out a 'hybrid war' against its citizens. Ahead of the parliamentary election, Bidzina Ivanishvili — a shadowy billionaire who set up Georgian Dream and made his fortune in Russia — vowed again to ban opposition parties should his party win. Georgian Dream will hold opposition parties 'fully accountable under the full force of the law' for 'war crimes' committed against the people of Georgia, Ivanishvili said at a pro-government rally in the capital Tbilisi Wednesday. He did not explain what crimes he believes the opposition has committed. Georgians will elect 150 lawmakers from 18 parties. If no party wins the 76 seats required to form a government for a four-year term, the president will invite the largest party to form a coalition. Many believe the election may be the most crucial vote of their lifetimes; it will determine whether Georgia gets back on track to EU membership or embraces authoritarianism and falls into Russia's orbit. 'It's an existential election,' Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said. Georgians want 'European integration, want to move forward and want policies which will bring us a better, more stable, future,' Qristine Tordia, 29, told The Associated Press shortly after voting in the capital, Tbilisi. Around 80% of Georgians favor joining the EU according to polls and the country's constitution obliges its leaders to pursue membership in that bloc and NATO. But Brussels put Georgia's bid for entry to the EU on hold indefinitely after the ruling party passed a 'Russian law' cracking down on freedom of speech in June. Many Georgians fear the party is dragging the country towards authoritarianism and killing off hopes it could join the EU. The opposition parties have ignored Zourabichvili's request to unite into a single party but have signed up to her 'charter' to carry out the reforms required by the EU to join. Zourabichvili told the AP on Thursday she believed most Georgians would mobilize to vote 'despite some instances of intimidation, despite the use of state resources ... and the use of financial resources' by the government. Georgian Dream took out billboards across the country contrasting black-and-white images of destruction in Ukraine with colorful images of life in Georgia alongside the slogan, 'Say no to war — choose peace.' The governing and opposition parties told voters they would pursue EU membership even though laws passed by Georgian Dream have put that hope on hold. 'The EU decided to stop Georgia's integration process unilaterally,' said Vakhtang Asanidze, who spoke to AP at a pro-government rally in Tbilisi. He said he saw no reason why Georgia could not join the EU in spite of the laws. At the EU summit last week, EU leaders said they have 'serious concerns regarding the course of action taken by the Georgian government.' While Georgian Dream has adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on its critics, voters at the pro-government rally said they did not view the election as a choice between Russia or Europe. 'We remember everything about Russia, including Abkhazia and South Ossetia,' said Latavra Dashniani at the rally, referring to Russia's occupation of 20% of Georgian territory after the two countries fought a short war in 2008. Voting for the ruling party, she said, would ensure Georgia enters Europe 'with dignity,' alluding to its conservative values, including opposition to rights for LGBTQ+ people. Polls opened in the parliamentary election at 8 a.m. local time and will close 12 hours later. Georgian Dream stands against three coalitions: the Unity National Movement, the Coalition for Changes Lelo, and Strong Georgia. The Gakharia for Georgia party, set up by former prime minister Giorgi Gakharia, said it will not go into an alliance with anyone but will support the opposition to form a government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-votes-in-an-election-that-could-take-it-toward-the-eu-or-into-russia-s-orbit/7840050.html	2024-10-26T00:03:05-07:00	
Israel says major assault on Iran 'achieved' objectives; US urges nations to press Iran to stop further attacks	Israel says it has completed a major assault on Iran after more than a year of fighting, which began with an attack by Iranian proxy group Hamas on the Jewish state and has grown into a multi-front conflict directly involving Tehran and its other regional proxies. In a statement issued early Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces said its warplanes safely returned home after conducting 'precise and targeted strikes against military targets in a number of areas in Iran.' It issued the statement about four hours after the first reports emerged of explosions in Iran around 2:30 a.m. Tehran time. 'Based on intelligence, Israel air force aircraft struck missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at Israel over the last year,' the IDF said. 'These missiles posed a direct and immediate threat to the citizens of Israel. Simultaneously, the IDF struck surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel's aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters that the Israeli airstrikes achieved their objectives but did not immediately provide evidence. There also was no immediate reaction from the Iranian government to Israel's assault or to its assertions about targeted Iranian sites. A senior U.S. administration official told reporters that Israel carried out 'precision airstrikes against multiple military targets across Iran and outside populated areas. 'The president and his national security team, of course, worked with the Israelis over recent weeks to encourage Israel to conduct a response that was targeted and proportional, (with a) low risk of civilian harm. That appears to have been precisely what transpired this evening,' the administration official said. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were both briefed on Israel's operation, the White House said Friday. Both were closely following developments and would continue to be updated, according to media reports. A U.S. defense official told VOA, 'We were given a heads up' on the strikes, 'but we're not involved.' U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant Saturday and received updates on the Israel Defense Forces' strikes on military targets in Iran, according to a readout of their conversation from Pentagon Press Secretary Major General Pat Ryder. Austin reaffirmed the ironclad commitment of the United States to Israel's security and right to self-defense, the readout said. The secretary emphasized the United States' ability to defend U.S. personnel, Israel, and partners across the region in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations and the U.S. determination to prevent any actor from exploiting tensions or expanding the conflict in the region, the statement added. The Israeli military said it conducted Saturday's airstrikes on Iran 'in response to the attacks by the Iranian regime against Israel and its citizens in recent months.' Iran fired hundreds of cruise missiles and drones in its first direct attack on Israel in April. The barrage was in response to an Israeli airstrike that killed senior officers of Iran's top military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Damascus that month. The IRGC fired around 200 ballistic missiles in its second direct attack on Israel on October 1, saying it was retaliating for Israeli strikes that killed another IRGC commander and leaders of its proxies Hezbollah and Hamas in the preceding days and months. The U.S. has designated the IRGC, Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations. 'Israel has made clear to the world that its response is now complete,' the U.S. administration official said. 'Accordingly, we call on all countries of influence to press Iran to stop these attacks against Israel so that we can move beyond this direct cycle of attacks.' Three hours after Saturday's Israeli attack began, Iranian state news agency Tasnim cited 'informed sources' in a Telegram post saying 'there is no doubt that Israel will receive a proportionate response to any action.' Videos shared on social media and deemed credible by VOA's Persian Service showed Iranian air defenses firing into the night sky above Tehran, as some Iranians awoken by explosions filmed the scenes from their rooftops or windows. Iranian state media tried to downplay the impact of the strikes, asserting that the Islamic republic's air defenses were repelling the Israeli assault in various parts of the country. Iran closed its airspace while the Israeli assault was under way. State news agency IRNA said at 6 a.m. Saturday Tehran time that the nation's Civil Aviation Organization had canceled all flights in Iranian air space until further notice. The flightradar24 tracking website showed the airspaces of Iran, Iraq and Syria as clear of aircraft an hour later. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had warned Iran shortly after its October 1 ballistic missile attack that it 'would pay' for what he called 'a big mistake.' In both of Iran's aerial assaults on Israel, the Israeli military backed by U.S. forces intercepted most of the Iranian missiles and drones, preventing significant damage or casualties. All of the additional U.S. forces that the Pentagon had ordered to the Middle East earlier this month had arrived in the region before the Israeli assault on Iran, a U.S. defense official told VOA. IDF spokesman Hagari said Israel will know how to select additional targets in Iran and strike them if required. 'This is a clear message: Whoever threatens Israel, will pay a heavy price,' he said. The senior U.S. administration official said that if Iran 'chooses to respond [to Israel] once again, we will be ready, and there will be consequences for Iran.' In a message to VOA, former IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said he believes the Israeli airstrikes will not be the last in Iran. 'As the sun will rise over Tehran, we will have a better assessment of the damage caused to the regime and its military. These Israeli strikes are the first round under a new strategy to hold the Iranian regime directly accountable for its actions,' he said. Earlier this month, U.S. media outlets reported that the Biden administration had won assurances from Israel that its forces would not hit Iranian nuclear or oil sites in its threatened retaliation against Iran. There were no reports of any Israeli strikes on such sites. A long-running low-scale conflict between Israel, Iran and its proxies erupted into open warfare on October 7, 2023, when Iran-backed Hamas terrorists invaded southern Israel from Gaza, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 more as hostages to the Palestinian territory. Several Americans are among the 101 hostages whom Hamas still is holding, with a third of those hostages believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. VOA's White House correspondent Patsy Widakuswara, National Security correspondent Jeff Seldin and Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb contributed to this report, which was produced in collaboration with VOA's Persian service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-major-assault-on-iran-achieved-objectives-us-urges-nations-to-press-iran-to-stop-further-attacks/7840049.html	2024-10-25T23:57:32-07:00	
US election key to Latin American economies, says credit rating agency	Mexico city — The fate of Latin American economies, deeply reliant on remittances from the United States, hangs in the balance with the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, Fitch Ratings said on Friday. Why it's important The potential disparity in immigration policies between the Republican and Democratic administrations could significantly affect Central American nations, which are heavily dependent on remittances from the U.S. Key comment 'Central America is highly vulnerable to U.S. immigration policies, as remittances fund a large component of their economic activity,' said Fitch, a U.S.-based credit rating agency. In countries like El Salvador and Nicaragua, remittances currently account for more than 30% of their gross domestic product, the ratings agency said, adding that Mexico is also one of the largest recipients of remittances globally, where inflows have steadily increased over the past decade to close to 3.5% of GDP, from 2%. By the numbers Remittances to Nicaragua have tripled in the past five years, while those to other countries, specifically El Salvador and Jamaica, have considerably slowed. A study based on data from the U.S. Current Population Survey showed that a 1% increase in the country's household earnings results in a 0.2% to 0.3% increase in remittances sent abroad. Context The U.S. elections could usher in changes in immigration policies, with Donald Trump's campaign showing a willingness to restrict border crossings and increase deportations, while the potential Kamala Harris administration would aim to pass a bipartisan law to reform the asylum process and limit immigration parole. Policy changes could significantly affect migrants and the Central American economies that are heavily dependent on the money they send back home from the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-election-key-to-latin-american-economies-says-credit-rating-agency/7839694.html	2024-10-25T17:34:15-07:00	
NASA astronaut hospitalized upon return from extended stay in space	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — A NASA astronaut was taken to the hospital for an undisclosed medical issue after returning from a nearly eight-month space station stay extended by Boeing's capsule trouble and Hurricane Milton, the space agency said Friday. A SpaceX capsule carrying three Americans and one Russian parachuted before dawn into the Gulf of Mexico just off the Florida coast after undocking from the International Space Station at midweek. The capsule was hoisted onto the recovery ship where the four astronauts had routine medical checks. Soon after splashdown, a NASA astronaut had a 'medical issue' and the crew was flown to a hospital in Pensacola, Florida, for additional evaluation 'out of an abundance of caution,' the space agency said in a statement. The astronaut, who was not identified, was in stable condition and remained at the hospital as a 'precautionary measure,' NASA said. The space agency said it would not share details about the astronaut's condition, citing patient privacy. The other three astronauts were discharged and returned to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. It can take days or even weeks for astronauts to readjust to gravity after living in weightlessness for several months. The astronauts should have been back two months ago. But their homecoming was stalled by problems with Boeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule, which came back empty in September because of safety concerns. Then Hurricane Milton interfered, followed by another two weeks of high wind and rough seas. SpaceX launched the four — NASA's Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Russia's Alexander Grebenkin — in March. Barratt, the only space veteran going into the mission, acknowledged the support teams back home that had 'to replan, retool and kind of redo everything right along with us ... and helped us to roll with all those punches.' Their replacements are the two Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose own mission went from eight days to eight months, and two astronauts launched by SpaceX four weeks ago. Those four will remain up there until February. The space station is now back to its normal crew size of seven — four Americans and three Russians — after months of overflow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-astronaut-remains-in-the-hospital-after-returning-from-an-extended-stay-in-space/7839720.html	2024-10-25T17:18:33-07:00	
Israel launches strikes on Iran	The Israel military says it has launched strikes on Iran, as Iranian media reported several explosions were heard in Iran’s capital, Tehran, and the nearby city of Karaj early Saturday. The Israel Defense Forces said in a post on X that it was conducting 'precise strikes on military targets' in Iran, but did not elaborate. The region has been bracing for an Israeli response to Iran's ballistic-missile barrage on Israel on October 1. Following that attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iranian leaders made a 'big mistake' and warned that they would 'pay for it.' Iran's October attack involved nearly 200 ballistic missiles and was the largest direct attack on Israel from its own territory. It was the second direct attack on Israel in six months; Iran fired missiles and drones in April in response to an Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic base in Syria. This is a developing story.

Party of ousted Bangladeshi PM Hasina planning protest	islamabad, pakistan — The party of Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina may soon begin street agitation against the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, according to a party leader. 'We are planning to demonstrate and start our political activities,' Shafiul Alam Chowdhury, organizing secretary of the Awami League, told VOA on Friday. Chowdhury is among dozens of Awami League leaders who fled Bangladesh after a student-led mass uprising toppled Hasina's regime in August. The iron-fisted leader was serving her fourth consecutive term when she was forced to resign on August 5 and flee to India in a military helicopter. Since the fall of the regime, dozens of party leaders have been arrested, many in connection with the violent crackdown on protesters that killed hundreds across the country between July and August. Thousands of Awami League workers and supporters have gone underground, fearing mob attacks. On Wednesday, the interim government banned the Awami League's student wing, the Bangladesh Chhatra League, declaring it a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal issued arrest warrants for Hasina and 45 others linked with the ousted regime. Speaking to VOA over the phone, Chowdhury said the party is working to unite its ranks and is reaching out to other like-minded political forces to launch protests against the interim government. 'After two weeks or one month, we can move,' the Awami League leader said when asked how soon his party was planning to take to the streets. Major political parties in Bangladesh back the interim government agenda to reform institutions that they say the Awami League destroyed through massive political interference in the past 15 years. However, political parties are also publicly pushing the Yunus government to ensure a swift return to democracy. One of the country's biggest political parties is dissatisfied with the progress so far. 'This government is going a bit slow,' said Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. 'The election commission, they have resigned. But they [the interim government] have not formed the new election commission,' Alamgir told VOA at his residence in Dhaka earlier this month. Ten commissions, comprising civil society activists, retired officials and academics, are tasked with proposing reforms in key areas including the judiciary, police, constitution, electoral system, mass media and labor rights. Six of the commissions announced in September must submit their proposals by December 31. However, reviewing those proposals, seeking political consensus for them and implementing them may take several months. Alamgir, whose party has called out the interim government for embarking on reforms without a timetable, worries a delay in elections will prolong the political vacuum in the country, giving the rival Awami League the opportunity to regain lost political space. 'The fallen fascist Awami League, they have their support [base]. They are a very big, old political party, so they have support here. They will also get time to consolidate and create problems here,' veteran politician Alamgir told VOA. Bangladesh's election law requires the government to form a search committee that selects members for the election commission. The interim government recently announced it would follow the existing law but has not given a date for the formation of such a committee. 'Please try to understand that we are not a political force, and for the first time, we are working in a group,' said Asif Nazrul, Bangladesh's chief law adviser, defending the interim government's slow progress. 'We don't have the necessary experience. We have commitment, we have a hardworking attitude, we have integrity,' Nazrul told VOA late last month at his official residence in Dhaka. One of the major handicaps of the interim government, analysts said, is that it lacks a supportive security and administrative system because much of what is in place is from the last 15 years of Hasina's rule. 'The government is operating without having full control of the law enforcement and bureaucracy,' political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman said. To rid the system of the remnants of the Awami League, the interim government has been transferring and reassigning police officers and bureaucrats in and out of the capital, Dhaka. To chart a course for Bangladesh and calm political nerves, Yunus' team has been ramping up engagement with political parties. The Awami League so far has been shut out of the consultations. 'They should be given the political space. They should be given the right to do politics. They should also be given [a chance] to participate in elections in future. That's what I agree.' said Rahman, who is also a member of the electoral reform commission. But Rahman warned that bringing the Awami League to the table anytime soon could cause a backlash. 'Calling Awami League for [discussing] reforms, I think, will have some severe reaction in the society.' The Awami League is not interested in sitting down with the interim government either, Chowdhury said. 'This [interim] government is totally unconstitutional,' he said. 'If we protest them, demonstrate all over the country, this [interim] government will be no more.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/party-of-ousted-bangladeshi-prime-minister-planning-protest/7839645.html	2024-10-25T16:13:55-07:00	
Kurdish attack in Ankara could derail prospects for peace talks, analysts say	A Kurdish militant group on Friday claimed responsibility for an attack on a major state-run defense company in Turkey’s capital, an action that analysts say could complicate prospects for renewed peace talks between the Turkish government and the country’s Kurdish minority. Two assailants set off explosives and opened fire Wednesday at the aerospace and defense company TUSAS in Ankara, killing five people and wounding 22, Turkey’s interior ministry said. The Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, said in a statement Friday that the attack on the defense firm was for its role in producing weapons used in attacks against Kurdish civilians. The PKK has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The Kurdish militant group has engaged in a four-decade armed conflict with the Turkish government for greater Kurdish rights in Turkey. Unmanned aerial vehicles, designed and assembled by TUSAS, have been instrumental in Turkey’s fight against Kurdish militants. Wednesday’s attack came a day after Devlet Bahceli, leader of Turkey’s far-right nationalist party and a close ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, suggested the possibility of granting parole to PKK’s imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, if the Kurdish group laid down its arms. A peace process between the two sides that started in 2013 collapsed in 2015. Yerevan Saeed, director of the Global Kurdish Initiative for Peace at American University in Washington, said the attack in Ankara represented a significant strategic blunder for the PKK. 'This incident highlights a concerning lack of strategic vision at this important time,' he told VOA. 'While the Turkish government's initiative to restart peace talks could be seen as a tactical maneuver, the Kurdish armed group must avoid providing the state with any justification to abandon the dialogue, which could in turn diminish international sympathy for the Kurdish cause.' Shortly after the Ankara attack, Turkey’s military struck Kurdish militant targets in Iraq and Syria that Turkish officials said belonged to offshoots of the PKK. The Turkish state-run Anadolu Agency said Friday that 120 targets had been struck in Iraq and Syria since Wednesday. Erdogan, on a flight back from the BRICS summit in Russia, told reporters Friday that the perpetrators of the Ankara attack had infiltrated from Syria, and he vowed to continue efforts to combat terrorism. In Kurdish-controlled Syria, some of the strikes hit power grids and water pump stations, causing outages of water and electricity in several cities in northeast Syria. Reporters for VOA Kurdish in the region visited several sites that had been damaged in the strikes. Sinan Ciddi, a Turkey expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said Turkish citizens would demand 'a strong military response' from the government for the Ankara bombing. He told VOA that 'the terror attack also reduces the chances for renewed negotiations between Erdogan and the PKK for a peace process.' 'No military solution' Amy Austin Holmes, a professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, said in every peace process there are spoilers who want to sabotage it. 'There is no military solution to what is an inherently political and social issue of equal citizenship. President Erdogan and the Kurdish movement both recognize this,' she told VOA. 'In order for the dialogue process not to be derailed by the PKK's attack in Ankara, and Turkey's bombardment of northern Syria and Iraq, cooler heads need to prevail.' Henri Barkey, professor of international relations at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, said the PKK-claimed attack made no sense. 'The only thing I can think of is that operations such as this one take months to prepare, so these guys had orders and it was never called off because they may have been under a blanket-of-communication order,' he said. 'This is bad for the PKK given that a process is supposed to start and that they could not prevent it from happening,' he added. 'The other half of the explanation is that there may be divisions in the organization and the group in charge of this chose not to stop it.' But other analysts, like Brussels-based Kurdish affairs researcher Hosheng Ose, believe that regardless of the attack in Ankara and the strikes on Iraq and Syria, there seems to be a decision within the Turkish political establishment to reach a settlement with the country’s Kurds. 'There are elements within both the Turkish state and the PKK that oppose any prospects for peace, but I don’t believe that will have any effect on what the Turkish government wants to achieve,' he told VOA. 'Turkey is really concerned with the recent developments across the Middle East, and it wants to ensure that no Kurdish group would play a role that could threaten Turkey’s long-term objectives,' said Ose. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kurdish-attack-in-ankara-could-derail-prospects-for-peace-talks-analysts-say-/7839655.html	2024-10-25T14:57:30-07:00	
Chinese hackers access US telecommunications system	washington — Hackers linked to the Chinese government have broken into parts of the U.S. telecommunications system in a breach that might be connected to an attempt to access data from the 2024 presidential campaign of former President Donald Trump. The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency late Friday said they were investigating 'unauthorized access' to commercial telecommunications infrastructure, attributing the attack to Chinese-affiliated actors. The agencies said they immediately notified affected companies once the breach was detected and had offered assistance, though there might be additional victims. 'The investigation is ongoing, and we encourage any organization that believes it might be a victim to engage its local FBI field office or CISA,' the statement said. 'Agencies across the U.S. government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector,' it added. The Chinese Embassy in Washington dismissed the U.S. hacking allegations as disinformation, calling the U.S. 'the origin and the biggest perpetrator of cyberattacks.' 'For some time, the U.S. has compiled and spread all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,' said embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu in an email to VOA. 'China's position is consistent and clear,' he said. 'China firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cyber theft in all forms.' Word of the breach linked to China followed a report by The New York Times on Friday that Chinese hackers are thought to have broken into telecommunications networks to target the Trump campaign. People familiar with the investigation told the Times that the Chinese hackers specifically looked to access data from phones used by Trump and his running mate, Republican Senator JD Vance. Investigators are still trying to determine what data the hackers were able to get, if any, and whether the hackers could listen in on Trump's or Vance's conversations in real time. They also said the Trump campaign had been notified. The FBI declined to comment on the Trump campaign breach. The Chinese Embassy in Washington also declined to comment, telling VOA, 'We are not aware of the specific situation.' In a statement shared with VOA, the Trump campaign acknowledged the breach and blamed the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, for letting it happen. 'This is the continuation of election interference by Kamala Harris and Democrats who will stop at nothing, including emboldening China and Iran attacking critical American infrastructure, to prevent President Trump from returning to the White House,' said Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign communications director. 'Their dangerous and violent rhetoric has given permission to those who wish to harm President Trump,' Cheung added. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions asking for more details on how Harris or her campaign enabled the Chinese hack. The Harris campaign has yet to respond to VOA's request for comment. U.S. intelligence agencies have warned for months that foreign adversaries have been using a combination of cyberattacks and influence operations to meddle with the November 5 U.S. presidential election. According to a declassified intelligence assessment issued this week, 'foreign actors — particularly Russia, Iran and China — remain intent on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans' confidence in the U.S. democratic system consistent with what they perceive to be in their interests.' It further warned that Russia and Iran were formulating plans to spark election-related violence. In addition, reports issued this week by private cybersecurity firms likewise indicated a significant uptick in activity by actors linked to Russia, China and Iran. All three nations have repeatedly denied accusations of election meddling. And while U.S. intelligence officials assess there is little agreement among the three countries on the desired outcomes of the presidential election — Russia is said to want a Trump win, Iran is said to be rooting for Harris, and China sees both as equally bad — the Trump campaign has become a frequent target of attacks. Last month, the U.S. Justice Department charged three Iranian hackers tied to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in connection with a hack-and-leak operation seeking to undermine Trump's reelection bid. U.S. intelligence officials have also accused Iran of trying to ensnare the campaign of current U.S. President Joe Biden before he stepped down in favor of Harris. But U.S. security officials have been even more leery of China. U.S. agencies, led by CISA and the FBI, have been warning that China-linked hackers have burrowed into U.S. computer systems and networks, in some case hiding for years. The China-linked group, known as Volt Typhoon, has been 'positioning itself to launch destructive cyberattacks that would jeopardize the physical safety of Americans,' according to an advisory issued in February. 'What we've found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg,' CISA Director Jen Easterly said in a statement at the time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-hackers-access-us-telecommunications-system-/7839636.html	2024-10-25T14:36:27-07:00	
Here's a look at Musk's contact with Putin and why it matters	WASHINGTON — Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of major government contractor SpaceX and a key ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the last two years, The Wall Street Journal reported. A person familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, confirmed to The Associated Press that Musk and Putin have had contact through calls. The person didn't provide additional details about the frequency of the calls, when they occurred or their content. Musk, the world's richest person who also owns Tesla and the social media platform X, has emerged as a leading voice on the American right. He's poured millions of dollars into Trump's presidential bid and turned the platform once known as Twitter into a site popular with Trump supporters, as well as conspiracy theorists, extremists and Russian propagandists. Musk's contacts with Putin raise national security questions, given his companies' work for the government, and highlight concerns about Russian influence in American politics. Here's what to know: What they talked about Musk and Putin have spoken repeatedly about personal matters, business and geopolitics, The Journal reported Thursday, citing multiple current and former officials in the United States, Europe and Russia. During one talk, Putin asked Musk not to activate his Starlink satellite system over Taiwan as a favor for Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose ties to Putin have grown closer, The Journal reported. Putin and Xi have met more than 40 times since 2013. Russia has denied the conversations took place. In 2022, Musk said he'd spoken to Putin only once, in a call 18 months earlier focused on space. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said Friday that it was 'not aware of the specifics' of any requests made by Putin on China’s behalf. There was no immediate response to messages left with X and Tesla seeking Musk's comment. What the talks mean for national security Musk’s relationship with Putin raises national security questions given the billions of dollars in government contracts awarded to SpaceX, a critical partner to NASA and government satellite programs. Trump also has vowed to give Musk a role in his administration if he wins next month. The head of any large defense contractor would face similar questions if they held private talks with one of America's greatest adversaries, said Bradley Bowman, a former West Point assistant professor and Senate national security adviser who now serves as senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based defense think tank. Bowman said the timing of the calls as reported by The Journal and Musk's changing views on Ukraine was a 'disturbing coincidence.' 'The policy of the U.S. government is to try to isolate Vladimir Putin, and Elon Musk is directly undercutting that,' Bowman said. 'What is Putin doing with Musk? Putin is trying to reduce his international isolation and impact American foreign policy.' The request from Putin on Starlink as a favor to China is also likely to get attention, given U.S. support for Taiwan and concerns about the growing partnership between the Kremlin and Beijing. Musk, whose Tesla operates Gigafactory Shanghai, has developed a close relationship with China’s top leaders. His remarks about China have been friendly, and he has suggested Taiwan cede some control to Beijing by becoming a special administrative region. Moscow has growing ties to other American adversaries. The U.S. has accused Russia of sending ballistic missiles to Iran and said North Korea sent troops to Russia, possibly for combat in Ukraine. On Ukraine, Musk's views have shifted since he initially supported Kyiv following Russia's invasion in 2022 and provided it with his Starlink system for communications. Musk then refused to allow Ukraine in 2023 to use Starlink for a surprise attack on Russian soldiers in Crimea. He also floated a proposal to end the war that would have required Ukraine to drop its plans for NATO membership and given Russia permanent control of Crimea, which it seized in 2014. The plan infuriated Ukrainian leaders. One person familiar with the talks between Musk and Putin told The Journal that there is no evidence the contact between Musk and Putin represents a security problem for the U.S. Asked about Musk’s contacts with Putin, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Friday that he had no information to share. The CIA, Pentagon and National Security Agency had no comment. The State Department didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Musk's close ties to Trump Musk recently appeared at a Trump rally, sporting a Make America Great Again hat and delivered an ominous warning that if Trump lost the race, 'this will be the last election.' Last year, Musk mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s request for aid for his country with a meme and said in February that the U.S. should cut its assistance because Ukraine couldn’t win. Trump, who has praised Putin’s leadership and criticized the NATO alliance and U.S. aid for Ukraine, has raised questions about what he would be willing to concede if he's elected in a negotiation over Ukraine's future. U.S. intelligence officials and private tech analysts have concluded that Russia is working to covertly support Trump with disinformation and propaganda targeting his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Since he took over X, it has become a leading online source of Russian propaganda and disinformation aimed at Americans. Trump has faced scrutiny over his own recent contacts with Putin, outlined in a new book by Watergate journalist Bob Woodward. Woodward quoted an unnamed Trump aide who said the former president and Putin may have had as many as seven conversations since Trump lost reelection in 2020. Before one of the calls, the aide said they were asked to leave Trump’s office to give the two privacy. The Trump campaign and the Kremlin have denied those calls occurred. In response to questions about Musk and Putin, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the billionaire 'a once-in-a-generation industry leader' whose ideas could benefit 'our broken federal bureaucracy.' 'As for Putin, there’s only one candidate in the race that he did not invade another country under, and it’s President Trump,' Leavitt said in a statement. 'President Trump has long said that he will re-establish his peace through strength foreign policy to deter Russia’s aggression and end the war in Ukraine.' Russia confirms one conversation Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Friday rejected The Journal’s report as 'absolutely false information.' Peskov said Putin and Musk once held a 'medium-length phone conversation' prior to 2022 that was 'as more of an introductory nature' and that the two talked about 'visionary technologies, technological solutions for the future.' 'After that, Musk had no contacts with Putin,' Peskov said, dismissing The Journal’s article as political. 'The election has entered its home stretch, and of course the opponents stop at nothing,' Peskov said. 'Remember that a week ago they were saying that Putin allegedly talks to Trump all day long. Now he allegedly talks to Musk all the time. It’s all untrue.' Ukraine’s military intelligence told the AP that they would 'refrain from commenting' about communication between Putin and Musk.	https://www.voanews.com/a/here-s-a-look-at-musk-s-contact-with-putin-and-why-it-matters/7839641.html	2024-10-25T14:32:04-07:00	
Experts: Russia's hacking campaign seeks to thwart Georgia's westward path	Tbilisi, Georgia — Just ahead of Georgia's parliamentary elections on Saturday, a Bloomberg investigation has revealed a yearslong Russian hacking campaign targeting Georgia's government, major companies and critical infrastructure. Analysts see the large-scale cyberattack, which gave Moscow access to sensitive intelligence and the ability to disrupt essential systems, as part of Russia's efforts to undermine Georgia's pro-Western aspirations. 'One of the most shocking revelations was that the [Georgian] Ministry of Foreign Affairs was hacked 114 times, with information gathered from embassies and even high-level officials,' Giorgi Iashvili, a Tbilisi-based cybersecurity expert, told Voice of America's Georgian service. 'It shows just how deeply the Russian cyber campaigns have penetrated our systems. Not only public institutions were affected, but also the private sector — telecom operators, key energy infrastructure and service providers.' Between 2017 and 2020, Bloomberg reported, Russia's GRU and FSB intelligence agencies successfully infiltrated key Georgian ministries as well as the country's energy sector and telecommunications networks. They accessed Georgia's central bank, election commission and oil terminals, exposing the country's vulnerabilities. 'What the Russians are now trying to do here is to identify the weaknesses for potential sabotage, to identify where and how they can intervene in Georgia's domestic politics, more clearly and more aggressively if the need arises, and thirdly, build a network of agents of influence,' said former Georgian Interior Ministry official Shota Utiashvili. The Georgian government, widely seen as tilting toward Moscow, dismisses those concerns. In an interview with VOA, Archil Talakvadze, a member of parliament from the ruling Georgian Dream party, said: 'In the field of cybersecurity, we now have stronger systems in place. The State Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is better prepared to address this threat.' Others, however, are not convinced. Giga Bokeria, a former secretary of Georgia's National Security Council and now the chairman of the opposition Federalists party, argues that Russian actions go beyond hacking and espionage efforts in Georgia. 'We have the government which is allowing, embracing and even financing Russian infiltration into our political life, economic sphere and the security services because they are natural allies. And we have overwhelming evidence of that,' he told VOA. Last month, U.S. officials told VOA that Washington has readied sanctions against Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire Georgian Dream founder and former prime minister, accusing him of acting under Russia's direction. Ivanishvili is widely seen as the power broker behind Georgia's government. Bokeria pointed to the shielding of an Ivanishvili associate, Otar Partskhaladze, from U.S. sanctions as evidence of the government's alignment with Russia. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Partskhaladze, a former Georgian chief prosecutor, for allegedly advancing Russian interests and assisting Russia's intelligence services. 'This is a man who is very close associate of our de facto ruler, oligarch [Bidzina Ivanishvili],' Bokeria said. 'We know it from his own confessions. When he was sanctioned, the whole Georgian government and the state apparatus behaved embarrassingly, to accommodate him, to clean out his bank accounts, to give him time [before] the sanctions could create any discomfort to him.' Utiashvili noted that during the last 12 years, not a single Russian spy has been arrested in Georgia. 'There's no way one can believe that Russian intelligence does not work here. So no, there are [these] multitude of examples that show that Russians enjoy complete safety,' he said. Safety, however, is not guaranteed for Georgia's own security officers. In 2019, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was assassinated in Berlin, in broad daylight. Khangoshvili, an ethnic Chechen, was a former Georgian security operative who joined the Chechen militants fighting Russia in the first Chechen war, which made him a target of Russian intelligence. While he later helped Georgia's security services identify Islamists in the country, Georgian authorities failed to protect Khangoshvili, prompting him to leave the country. 'The government has not yet answered the question, why did it leave its own citizen defenseless in face of the Russians?' Utiashvili said. The Georgian government remained silent after Khangoshvili's death and never raised the issue publicly. In a recent prisoner swap, Russian President Vladimir Putin went to great lengths to secure the release of Khangoshvili's killer, Vadim Krasikov. 'We know how important it was for Vladimir Putin to release Khangoshvili's murderer,' Utiashvili said. 'He pretty much let most of the high-level political prisoners go in exchange for the killer. That gives you an idea of how high level this murder was planned and how important it was for the Russian regime.' Referring to the Georgian authorities, Utiashvili added: 'When you force such a citizen to go, that means that you don't want to intervene. You only don't want it to happen on your territory. But, you're basically signing a death warrant.' Kakhaber Kemoklidze, a former Georgian security service official under the Georgian Dream government, blames Georgia's political leadership for failing to counter Russian influence, which, he said, has reached into the government's high ranks. 'They are really implementing Russian intelligence services goals,' he told VOA. The influx of Russian emigres into Georgia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has only heightened espionage risks. 'There might be a big-scale infiltration within the different segments of the Georgian society or businesses,' Kemoklidze said. Western countries, including the United States, have spent millions to help Georgia defend itself from Russian hybrid tactics, including espionage and hacking, and to secure its information space. In 2020, NATO, funded by the United Kingdom, launched a project aimed at countering Russian hybrid threats in Georgia. However, as New Lines magazine reported in May, the Georgian government misused this initiative to spread anti-Western messages and target critics on social media. The oversight team for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said this abuse led to the removal of fake accounts linked to the Georgian government. 'The Western governments, the Americans, the Brits, the Europeans, have been helping the Georgian government to become resilient in the fight against the enemy propaganda and any disinformation,' Utiashvili said. 'However, the units that were set up in the Georgian government with the help of donors' money were used not to fight the Russian propaganda, but to enhance it, because, again, Georgian Dream and Russia share their propaganda assets in Georgia.' From shielding Russian allies to failing to protect its own operatives and using Western funds to spread Russian narratives, Georgia's government is helping Moscow fulfill its strategic objectives, analysts say. 'Russian intelligence officers on a senior level would be very much happy seeing what the current Georgian government is doing,' former Georgian security service official Kemoklidze said. According to Bokeria of the opposition Federalists party, Russia's goal is to ensure Georgia and other neighbors remain under Kremlin control. 'A successful statehood on its borders for Russia means that it is becoming a part of the free world, regardless of NATO or EU enlargement,' he said. 'And that is unacceptable for them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-russia-s-hacking-campaign-seeks-to-thwart-georgia-s-westward-path-/7839572.html	2024-10-25T14:10:02-07:00	
UN says Gaza residents are dying as medical evacuations dry up	GENEVA — United Nations agencies warn that medical evacuations from conflict-ridden Gaza have essentially dried up, putting at risk the lives of thousands of people, including children, with serious illnesses and injuries because they are unable to get the treatment they need. 'Children are being medically evacuated from Gaza at fewer than one child per day. If this lethally slow pace continues, it would take more than seven years to evacuate the 2,500 children needing urgent medical care,' UNICEF spokesperson James Elder told journalists Friday in Geneva. 'As a result, children in Gaza are dying,' he said, noting that even when 'miracles happen' and children survive the bombs, bullets and shells, 'they are then prevented from leaving Gaza to receive the urgent care that would save their lives.' The World Health Organization reports 15,600 patients require urgent medical evacuations, with only 5,138 evacuated so far. Nearly half of them had cancer, 40% had war injuries, and 200 had kidney diseases. The WHO says only 231 patients have been evacuated since May 7. UNICEF spokesperson Elder said that an average of 296 children were medically evacuated each month from January to May 7. Since the Rafah crossing closed on May 7 because of the ground offensive there, he said 'the number of children medically evacuated has collapsed to just 22 per month.' 'That is, just 127 children, many suffering from head trauma, amputations, burns, cancer, and severe malnutrition, have been allowed to leave since Rafah closed,' he said. Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative for occupied Palestinian Territory, agreed that this situation cries out for 'a proper medevac structure out of Gaza, an organized structure.' On a video link from Gaza, he recalled that before the crisis erupted a year ago, between 50 and 100 patients daily were referred from Gaza to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and 'those were 40% oncology cases — children, women and men with cancer — but also cardiovascular and all kinds of other diseases.' Between 12,000 and 14,000 critical patients must be medevaced outside Gaza, Peeperkorn said, 'and we are constantly pushing for that.' 'We want medical corridors. What would be needed would be to restore the traditional medical corridor, which is, of course, to the hospitals in East Jerusalem and West Bank, and they are very much ready to receive patients from Gaza,' he said. Peeperkorn said WHO always tries to prioritize children, who comprise at least one-third of patients on a medevac list, which subsequently goes through a security screening. 'It is really painful to see that many of these patients, which are on this list are not approved, including children,' he said, adding there is 'no explanation from Israeli authorities on why an evacuation is not granted.' Elder agreed with that assessment, noting that Israeli authorities do not say when applications for medical evacuations are declined, and 'does not provide reasons for refusals.' 'It is not known how many child patients have been rejected for medevac,' he said. 'Only a list of approved patients is provided by Israel's COGAT, which controls Gaza's entry and exit points. The status of others is not shared. When a patient is denied, there is nothing that can be done.' COGAT, the Israeli military body responsible for Palestinian civilian issues including medical evacuations from Gaza, has not commented on the question of evacuations. 'Mayhem and chaos' Peeperkorn took part in a U.N. mission Thursday, which managed to reach Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, which is under siege by Israeli authorities. The team delivered a range of medicines and fuel to the hospital and transferred 23 patients and 26 caregivers to the Al-Shifa hospital. Peeperkorn described a scene of 'mayhem and chaos' at Kamal Adwan Hospital, where there were more than 200 patients, and the emergency wards were overflowing. He said he had received unconfirmed reports that soldiers were close to the hospital, 'telling people that they needed to come out and separating people into groups of men, women, and children.' 'Hospitals should not be attacked. People should be protected. Hospitals are supposed to be safe places where people could receive treatment and shelter,' he said. Optimism about vaccination campaign Despite the ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure, which continue to jeopardize people's safety and movement in northern Gaza, Peeperkorn said he remained hopeful that a polio campaign in the region 'would be successful.' WHO and partners were forced to postpone a second round of polio vaccinations for more than 119,000 young children across northern Gaza due to the violence, intense bombardment, mass displacement orders and lack of assured humanitarian pauses. Peeperkorn noted the second round of the campaign has gone off without a hitch in southern and central Gaza and that coverage in those two zones 'surpassed 90%, putting the mission on the right track.' 'We still have good hopes that we can do this campaign … We have a window between the 28th of October and sixth of November to carry out the campaign,' he said. 'Over the coming week, the technical committee will engage in constant dialogue to ensure that the campaign can go ahead.' Underscoring the urgency of stopping the transmission of this crippling disease, he said, 'You do not want to get more polio cases in Gaza, but you also do not want to see a spread of the poliovirus in surrounding countries. So, we do this not only for the children in Gaza, but for children all around.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-gaza-residents-are-dying-as-medical-evacuations-dry-up/7839499.html	2024-10-25T13:34:02-07:00	
Reaction mixed as Ugandan court sentences former LRA commander to 40 years	KAMPALA, UGANDA — A Ugandan court sentenced former Lord’s Resistance Army commander Thomas Kwoyelo to 40 years in prison on Friday. In August, the Ugandan International Crimes Division found Kwoyelo guilty on 44 charges, including murder, pillaging, inhumane acts and gender-based violence such as rape. Lawyers for Kwoyelo, 50, said he is going to appeal the sentence. Francis Okello Oloya, a psychologist and head of a comfort dog project in Gulu for LRA war survivors, was blinded by a bomb blast at the age of 12 during Uganda’s war against the rebels. He told VOA that he welcomes the court process but that the sentence doesn’t satisfy him or other survivors. 'The perpetrator needed to ask for forgiveness and reconciliation with his heart,' Oloya said, adding, 'He will be serving his jail terms, but what benefits will the victims get?' In reading out the sentence, Justice Duncan Gaswaga emphasized that there is no chance Kwoyelo will be released early on parole. 'This sentence also excludes a possibility of rehabilitation, reconciliation and reform of the convict, and concentrates on punishment, retribution and deterrence,' he said. The judges also highlighted Kwoyelo’s guilt on the rape charges. Susan Aceng Oroma, the project officer for the Foundation for Justice and Development Initiative, a nongovernmental organization that works to promote justice and economic recovery in northern Uganda, said she was happy to hear the judges focus on gender-based violence. 'Looking at the magnitude of the offenses he committed, he deserved the sentencing,' she said. However, Angelo Izama, a Ugandan international crimes analyst, argued that Kwoyelo should not have been put on trial. He said that the best method to resolve Kwoyelo’s case would have been to put him under the local Matoput process. That would have led to reconciliation and forgiveness, which he said cannot be achieved by law or force of arms. 'Kwoyelo has been sort of a stand-in character for the northern Uganda conflict,' Izama said. 'He is the most visible remaining member of the LRA to be put forward to answer for the crimes of that organization. But you have to recall that the conflict in the north took place over 20 years. And the atrocities were on all sides of that conflict.' Meanwhile, LRA leader Joseph Kony remains wanted by the International Criminal Court on dozens of war crimes charges but has not been confirmed alive for years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ugandan-court-sentences-former-lra-commander-kwoyelo-to-40-years/7839514.html	2024-10-25T13:03:38-07:00	
Zelenskyy: North Korean troops are poised for deployment	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that Russia is expected to deploy North Korean soldiers to combat as early as Sunday. In a statement posted to his official X social media account, Zelenskyy said the prediction is based on military intelligence he received in a Friday briefing from armed forces Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. Zelenskyy called the move a 'clear escalation by Russia,' adding that 'the world can clearly see Russia’s true intentions: to continue the war.' Calling for a 'principled and strong response' from global leaders, Zelenskyy said, 'North Korea’s actual involvement in combat should not be met with indifference or uncertain commentary, but with tangible pressure on both Moscow and Pyongyang, to uphold the U.N. Charter and to hold them accountable for this escalation.' Responding Thursday to a Ukraine intelligence report that the North Korean troops were in Russia’s Kursk region, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was up to Moscow to decide how they might be deployed, including possibly sending them to fight on the front lines against Ukraine. He did not deny a U.S. claim that North Korea has dispatched some 3,000 troops to fight alongside Russian forces. On Friday, North Korean state broadcaster KCNA carried a statement by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Jong Gyu, who would not comment directly on reports of the deployment, but said if there were such a thing, 'I think it will be an act conforming with the regulations of international law.' Ukraine has argued North Korean participation in the war violates international law; U.S. officials earlier this week called such a deployment a major escalation. But Putin argued the West had escalated the war in Ukraine by sending NATO officers and instructors to help Kyiv defend itself against Russian aggression. Meanwhile, in an interview with Russian television Friday, Putin spoke about possible cease-fire negotiations with Ukraine, saying Russia was ready to seek compromises. He said Turkey had presented a number of peace initiatives to both Russia and Ukraine, which he claimed Ukraine has rejected. Regarding possible compromises, Putin said: 'Any outcome must be in Russia's favor. ... This outcome should be based upon the realities which are taking shape on the battlefield. Without any doubt, we are not going to make any concessions. There will be no exchange [of territory], whatsoever.' Putin blamed Ukraine for what he described as 'irrational behavior' in negotiations, saying, 'It is not possible to build any plans on this basis.' Bio lab construction In an exclusive report Friday, The Washington Post said satellite images from the past two years have shown substantial construction at a site-restricted military facility northeast of Moscow that was once a major research center for biological weapons. The report said the site has a history of experiments that included viruses that cause smallpox, Ebola and hemorrhagic fevers. The satellite imagery of the Russian site, called Sergiev Posad-6, shows construction vehicles renovating the Soviet-era laboratory and breaking ground on 10 new buildings, totaling more than 250,000 square feet, with several of them bearing hallmarks of biological labs designed to handle extremely dangerous pathogens. The report said there has been no sign such weapons are being used in the Ukraine conflict, but the construction is being closely watched by U.S. intelligence agencies and bioweapons experts. Ukraine’s Kyiv Independent reported Friday the apparent deployment of North Korean troops could be at least in part a result of Russia’s losses on the battlefield. In a report on its Facebook social media account, the Ukraine General Staff of the armed forces reported Russia has lost 685,910 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. This includes, the general staff report said, 1,630 casualties over a 24-hour period ending Friday. Ukraine has closely guarded its battlefield troop casualties, even from Western allies, but a U.S. official in September estimated Ukraine has likely seen an estimated 57,500 troops killed and 250,000 wounded, according to a report by The New York Times. Battlefield casualties are difficult to verify, and Russia has made claims that Ukrainian casualties are much higher than those indicated by Ukrainian and U.S. estimates. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-north-korean-troops-are-poised-for-deployment-/7839531.html	2024-10-25T13:00:14-07:00	
Biden apologizes for school policy that separated Native American families	LAVEEN VILLAGE, Arizona — President Joe Biden on Friday formally apologized to Native Americans for the government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a 'blot on American history' in his first presidential visit to Indian Country. 'It's a sin on our soul,' said Biden, his voice full of anger and emotion. 'Quite frankly, there's no excuse that this apology took 50 years to make.' It was a moment of both contrition and frustration as the president sought to recognize one of the 'most horrific chapters' in the national story. Biden spoke of the abuses and deaths of Native children that resulted from the federal government's policies, noting that 'while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing' and that great nations 'must know the good, the bad, the truth of who we are.' 'I formally apologize as president of United States of America for what we did,' Biden said. 'The federal Indian boarding school policy, the pain it has caused, will only be a significant mark of shame, a blot on our record history. For too long, this all happened with virtually no public attention, not written about in our history books, not taught in our schools.' Boost for Harris Democrats hope Biden's visit to the Gila River Indian Community's land on the outskirts of Phoenix's metro area will also provide a boost to Vice President Kamala Harris' turnout effort in a key battleground state. The moment gave Biden a fuller chance to spotlight his and Harris' support for tribal nations, a group that historically has favored Democrats, in a state he won just by 10,000 votes in 2020. The race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is expected to be similarly close, and both campaigns are doing whatever they can to improve turnout among bedrock supporters. 'The race is now a turnout grab,' said Mike O'Neil, a nonpartisan pollster in Arizona. 'The trend lines throughout have been remarkably steady. The question is which candidate is going to be able to turn out their voters in a race that seems to be destined to be decided by narrow margins.' Biden has been used sparingly on the campaign trail by Harris and other Democrats since he ended his reelection campaign in July. But analysts say Biden could help Harris in her appeal with Native American voters — a group that has trailed others in turnout rates. In 2020, there was a surge in voter turnout on some tribal land in Arizona as Biden beat Trump and became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996. Biden, whose presidency is winding down, had promised tribal leaders nearly two years ago that he would visit Indian Country. For decades, federal boarding schools were used to assimilate children into white society, according to the White House. Not everyone saw the apology as sufficient. 'An apology is a nice start, but it is not a true reckoning, nor is it a sufficient remedy for the long history of colonial violence,' said Chase Iron Eyes, director of the Lakota People's Law Project and Sacred Defense Fund. 973 deaths At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system over a 150-year period that ended in 1969, according to an Interior Department investigation that called for a U.S. government apology. At least 18,000 children, some as young as 4, were taken from their parents and forced to attend schools that sought to assimilate them. 'President Biden deserves credit for finally putting attention on the issue and other issues impacting the community,' said Ramona Charette Klein, 77, a boarding school survivor and an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. 'I do think that will reflect well on Vice President Harris, and I hope this momentum will continue.' Both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, met with tribal leaders in Arizona and Nevada this month. And Clinton, who has been serving as a surrogate for Harris, last week met in North Carolina with the chairman of the Lumbee Tribe. The White House says Biden and Harris have built a substantial track record with Native Americans over the last four years. The president designated the sacred Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in Nevada, and Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon in Arizona as national monuments and restored the boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. In addition, the administration has directed nearly $46 billion in federal spending to tribal nations. The money has helped bring electricity to a reservation that never had electricity, expand access to high-speed internet, improve water sanitation, build roadways and more. Biden picked former New Mexico Representative Deb Haaland to serve as his interior secretary, the first Native American to be appointed to a Cabinet position. Haaland is a member of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico. She, in turn, ordered the comprehensive review in June 2021 of the troubled legacy of the federal government's boarding school policies that led Biden to deliver the formal apology.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-apologizes-for-school-policy-that-separated-native-american-families-/7839515.html	2024-10-25T12:49:11-07:00	
North Korea eyes Russian military assistance in exchange for Ukraine troop deployment, say experts	washington — North Korea is likely anticipating Russian technical assistance to perfect its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for sending its troops to support Russia in the Ukraine war, U.S. experts say. On Wednesday, the U.S. government confirmed for the first time the presence of at least 3,000 North Korean troops in Russia. Last Friday, South Korea's intelligence agency said North Korea had sent 1,500 special forces troops to Russia for training and likely deployment for combat in the war in Ukraine. Seoul has expressed grave concerns about the development. 'North Korea will expect a generous payoff from Moscow in return for its troop contribution,' Hwang Joon-kook, South Korean ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday at a United Nations Security Council Briefing on Ukraine. 'It could be either military or financial assistance; it could be nuclear weapons-related technology.' Weapons upgrades North Korea has recently been more open about showing its nuclear and missile ambitions. State media outlets last month released photos showing leader Kim Jong Un visiting what they said was a uranium enrichment facility. The Kim regime has exported dozens of ballistic missiles and more than 18,000 containers of munitions and munitions-related material to Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. State Department. Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, told VOA Korean on Wednesday that Kim Jong Un is now in a position where he can 'leverage Russia to get much more' by deploying his own soldiers to the Ukraine war. 'As they were doing their nuclear tests, they would have discovered that some things didn't work,' Bennett said. 'I think Kim has got a lot of technology he would like to get from Russia.' Robert Peters, research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation, said sending in North Korean troops 'could be a token of goodwill on the part of Kim,' and Kim's expectation would be that 'the quid pro quo is Russian technical assistance.' 'The ultimate goal for Kim is a revitalized alliance with Russia that helps North Korea catch up its missile program and its nuclear program with those in the West,' Peters told VOA Korean Tuesday on the phone. 'I think that's part of his game.' Peters added that Kim could ask Russian President Vladimir Putin to provide technical assistance for effective miniaturization of nuclear warheads that could go on the tip of intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, targeting the United States. Sung-Yoon Lee, a fellow with the Wilson Center's Indo-Pacific Program, told VOA Korean in an email that he believes Russia likely promised 'to provide Pyongyang with sensitive nuclear technology like nuclear-powered submarines, military satellites, and ICBM reentry into the earth's atmosphere' in return for North Korea sending troops to the war in Ukraine. Economic benefits Another benefit for North Korea is that its troops might be paid in hard currency that can be exchanged internationally. 'The financial benefits from this initial deployment may seem relatively small, but they are comparatively important for North Korea,' Troy Stangarone, director of the Center for Korean History and Public Policy at Wilson Center, told VOA Korean via email Thursday. 'If Russia is compensating North Korea at the same rate as new Russian recruits, we could expect Pyongyang to earn a little less than $10 million a month from the 3,000 troops that are reported to have already been deployed.' Stangarone says that amount would be equal to about 40% of North Korea's legal exports to China over the course of a full year. China is North Korea's main trading partner, with some studies saying China makes up as much as 95% of North Korea's total trade. Robert Abrams, a retired U.S. Army four-star general who served as commander of U.S. Forces Korea from 2018 to 2021, said the deployment of North Korean soldiers will not be a military game changer for Russia. But, he said, it shows 'the depth of commitment by Kim Jong Un to be a strategic partner of Russia.' 'Russia is losing 10,000 soldiers about every 10 days, so this deployment of 10,000 North Korean soldiers will not noticeably change the outcome,' Abrams told VOA Korean via email Wednesday. 'However, this deployment of North Korean soldiers has significant symbolism for both North Korea and Russia; this is an obvious outcome of the recent North Korea-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership agreement.' Putin and Kim signed their partnership treaty in June, vowing to challenge the U.S.-led world order. The new treaty mandates Russia and North Korea to immediately provide military assistance using all available means if either of them is attacked by a third country. Putin did not deny the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia during a Thursday press conference at the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan. 'We have never doubted at all that the North Korean leadership takes our agreements seriously,' Putin said. 'What and how we will do within the framework of this article [of the agreement] is our business.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-eyes-russian-military-assistance-in-exchange-for-ukraine-troop-deployment-/7839366.html	2024-10-25T11:51:33-07:00

Climate finance to take center stage at COP29	BERLIN, Germany — Close to 200 countries are scheduled to negotiate a new climate finance target for the Global South at the U.N. Climate Change Conference, or COP29, in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November. Dubbed the 'Finance COP,' next month’s conference is expected to see focused discussions on a New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, or NCQG. It defines a new target for monetary support from historic emitters – mostly countries in the Global North – to address climate needs in poorer countries. Surging climate needs In 2009, countries including the United States and the European Union agreed to contribute $100 billion collectively each year by 2020, but an OECD report showed that they struggled to meet that goal over the years. Worse still, much of the climate finance came in the form of loans, which critics say have piled more pressure on developing countries already drowning in debt. The new negotiations come after a spate of extreme weather conditions intensified by human-caused climate change. July, for instance, witnessed the three hottest days ever recorded. Scientists said in an article on BioScience that as fossil fuel emissions reached an all-time high, the Earth is on track for 2.7 degrees Celsius warming by 2100, far above the 1.5 degrees Celsius target established in the 2015 Paris Agreement. To combat the burgeoning crisis, developing countries will now need more than $100 billion a year, with estimates ranging up to $6 trillion by 2030. Even that does not sufficiently cover measures to adapt to already inevitable climate change, according to a 2021 U.N. report. Conference host Azerbaijan in July launched the Climate Finance Action Fund with an initial goal of raising $1 billion from fossil-fuel producing countries and companies. Nations are likely to reach a compromise at the lower end of a NCQG goal, according to Irene Monasterolo, professor of climate finance at the Utrecht University. 'These results of the negotiations may not be able to address the current need for climate finance in low-income countries, which are massively affected already now by climate risk,' Monasterolo told VOA. 'The focus so far has been mostly on mitigation [reducing emissions] projects and measures, while adaptation investments are lagging behind.' Adaptation finance While adaptation finance has gone up over the years, mitigation still accounts for the majority of current climate finance, the OECD report revealed. Monasterolo said the scale of adaptation finance ultimately depends on mitigation efforts. 'We don’t see bold plans for mitigation that would be needed to achieve the 1.5 degrees Celsius target, including the Global North. We have instead some issues of policy reversal and some major economies and polluting countries like the U.S. stepping back and in Europe,' she added. 'The science is clear. To limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial times, we need to drop production, extraction, use of fossil fuels and related carbon activities and focus on renewables, and low-carbon activities should go up. But that’s not happening. In the latest geopolitical crisis, we increased our dependency on fossil fuels.' The wars in the Middle East and Russia have put energy security at risk, according to the International Energy Agency. While a record high level of clean energy came online last year, emissions from the energy sector also broke records. Another reason for low adaptation finance, Monasterolo said, is the complexity of assessing climate risks. 'We need to work on how to integrate forward-looking climate risk into investors and financial authorities’ models. Market-based approaches based on past data are a poor proxy of what could happen in the near future with ongoing climate change.' Loss and damage fund At COP28 in Dubai last year, countries agreed to set up a voluntary fund for historic emitters to pay for the damage caused by climate disasters in vulnerable developing countries. Western countries also called for large emitters like China to contribute. Negotiators are expected to continue the discussion at COP29. For now, it remains unclear whether the loss and damage fund will be included in the new NCQG, according to Karoliina Hurri, researcher at the Center on Climate Politics and Security at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. The fund 'is defined as voluntary, so it’s not based on the same categorization of developed and developing countries. … Some developed countries argue that the loss and damage fund is not part of the mandate and should be negotiated separately from this.' Looming NDCs As countries are slated to declare new and more ambitious national green goals by February 2025, COP29 is expected to be a big push. 'I am afraid we won’t see ambitious enough NDCs [national determined contributions], but I think this is really important at this COP, especially the discussion of how to ensure the [recommended] outcomes of last year’s Global Stocktake, and the discussion about transitioning away from fossil fuels,' Hurri explained. Hurri said many countries said they would lead by example to announce goals aligned with the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming goal. 'But at the same time, nations can decide for themselves what the alignment means. This clarifies how difficult it is to reach the NDC.' At COP28, countries signed a historic deal to start transitioning away from polluting fossil fuels. Hurri said, however, it remains to be seen how the phases translate into actions. 'Do we see, for example, schedules of roadmaps on how this process is planned on the national level?' Pivotal US election The U.S. election results could have a large impact on the implementation of potential negotiation results, including cooperation measures with the world’s biggest emitting nation, China, according to Hurri. 'I have not seen very detailed climate policy arguments from either of the candidates, although we know that they have very different views on climate change. … We know what happened last time during President [Donald] Trump’s term that the U.S. decreased financial contribution for climate,' she said. COP29 will also mark the first cooperation talks between the new envoys from the United States and China — John Podesta and Liu Zhenmin. They had a working group meeting in Beijing in early September, in which they agreed to host a summit on methane and non-carbon greenhouse gases during the climate conference. 'While the U.S. election might not influence the cooperation at this year’s COP, the election outcome can have an influence on the credibility of their cooperation in the long term on a high level,' Hurri said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/climate-finance-to-take-center-stage-at-cop29/7839343.html	2024-10-25T11:00:14-07:00	
Hopes for justice expire 20 years after Thailand’s Tak Bai Massacre	BANGKOK — Friday’s lapse of murder charges in Thailand against 14 people, including former police and army officers, for the deaths of 85 protesters two decades ago is raising fears of a spike in violence in the country’s long-restive south. The 14 were charged with murder and other felonies earlier this year for their alleged roles in the so-called Tak Bai Massacre on October 25, 2004, named after a district in the far south of Thailand, a predominantly Muslim and ethnic Malay part of the country. On that day 20 years ago, soldiers and police shot and killed seven people at a protest that called for the release of suspected Islamic militant collaborators in police custody. The officers also bound and stacked many more protesters several rows high inside police trucks where 78 of them died of suffocation, according to a state inquest five years later. Although the inquest found fatal flaws in the security response to the protest, authorities did not pursue the charges, and no one was ever put on trial. The courts issued arrest warrants for all 14 of those charged earlier this year, but none has been arrested. Under Thai law, anyone charged with certain serious crimes, including murder, must appear in court in person before the statute of limitations expires for a trial to proceed. Otherwise, the charges are dropped. The 14 are believed to have gone into hiding or abroad to wait for the end of the statute of limitations in their cases, which expired late Friday. For Muhammasawawee Auseng, whose older brother Abdulhadee, then 19 years old, was among those who died in the police trucks, the end of criminal liability for the accused feels like a fresh trauma. 'Since the Narathiwat provincial court issued the arrest warrants, we all hoped deep down that we could get justice from the authorities,' he told VOA. 'Now it feels like our old wounds are opening up again,' he said. 'The cases may expire, but the feelings and the pain of the villagers will not expire; they will remain in our hearts.' Auseng said the authorities’ failure to put the accused on trial reinforces feelings among many of Thailand’s Malays and Muslims that they are second-class citizens in a country where ethnic Thais and Buddhists make up the vast majority. 'All the [Tak Bai] victims and relatives are losing their faith in the authorities and their justice system. This incident was committed by government officials, yet the authorities cannot do anything to put them through the legal process,' he said. 'The Tak Bai incident proves that the authorities treat us different because we are Malay,' he said. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra issued a public apology Thursday 'on behalf of the government' to the victims and their families for what they have lost and suffered. But she said the constitution did not allow the government, as some academics had suggested it does, to extend the statute of limitations to give the police more time to arrest the accused. Police officials had said for the past several weeks that they had done everything possible to find them. But their failure to do so will add not only to impressions of racial and religious bias, but of impunity for the well-connected, said Somchai Homlaor, a senior adviser and co-founder of the Cross Cultural Foundation, a local rights group. 'That confirms the belief of the people in the south that the criminal justice system in Thailand is still under the … influence, especially if the wrongdoers are high-ranking government officials or influential people,' he told VOA. Of the 14 people charged, most of the attention landed on Pisal Wattanawongkiri, a retired general who headed the army’s southern command at the time of the 2004 protest. Pisal won an elected seat in the House of Representatives with the ruling Pheu Thai party last year, granting him legal immunity. Although Pheu Thai announced his resignation from the party and house on October 15, authorities claimed they did not know where he was. Some rights groups and analysts fear the failure to find and arrest Pisal or any of the other accused in time to take them to trial may spark a new wave in violence in Thailand’s deep south. Once the seat of a Muslim sultanate, the southern provinces of modern-day Thailand were deeded to the then-kingdom of Siam by the British in 1909. Refusing to accept the transfer, several Malay Muslim armed groups have been waging a guerrilla war against the Thai state to win back independence for the region. More than 7,000 people have died in related violence since fighting picked up in January 2004. 'Some of the … armed groups may use [the end of] this case to make some violence,' said Somchai. 'Because [of] the failure of the authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice,' he explained. 'It’s the reasons that can be used — impunity among the high-ranked officers, and the [impression that] Muslim Melayu people are just only like the second citizens.' Don Pathan, an independent security analyst who has been following the conflict for decades, says insurgent groups already have picked up the pace of attacks and bombings in recent weeks, as they usually do ahead of each anniversary of the Tak Bai protest and crackdown. 'But not as big as this [year], because this is the 20th anniversary,' he said. 'And it’s just not the number, the 20th year; it’s also about the statute of limitations expiring, so it gives them that extra reason to carry out more attacks.' The government and the largest of the armed groups, Barisan Revolusi Nasional, have been in talks over a possible cease-fire deal aimed at curbing the attacks and lifting the emergency laws most of the south of Thailand has been under since 2004. Pathan and Somchai say the dropping of the charges in the Tak Bai cases could make those talks harder if the insurgents use it as a reason to toughen their demands. They say it will also serve to keep the events of October 25, 2004, as a potent recruiting tool for armed groups looking to replenish their ranks with fresh fighters. Until Thailand learns to reckon with the events of that bloody day and get to the bottom of exactly what happened and why, Pathan said, the country will struggle to move on. 'You’re not going to heal, you’re not going to be able to move on as a nation if you can’t settle this,' he said. 'How do you put this behind you? You have to be fair, you have to be honest, and you have to do it keeping in mind … human dignity, and right now I don’t see any of that.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hopes-for-justice-expire-20-years-after-thailand-s-tak-bai-massacre/7839297.html	2024-10-25T10:47:57-07:00

Will specter of war in Ukraine overshadow Xi and Putin’s push for global reform?	Washington — The 2024 BRICS summit in Russia this week provided Moscow and Beijing with a showcase for their shared anti-West sentiment and global ambitions, but analysts say the war in Ukraine may be fracturing the 'no limits' relationship between the two countries. The location of the summit was strategically significant, given international efforts to isolate Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. 'For Russia as the host, the most important thing is to highlight that it is not isolated and still has supporters on the international stage.' said Shiau-shyang Liou, associate research fellow at the Taiwan-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. 'China is actually facing a similar predicament — it is being sanctioned by the United States, though it has not yet reached the point of military conflict. Therefore, on these issues, they share common interests and align in their direction,' Liou added. Readouts of the summit reflected the shared ambitions of China and Russia within BRICS, a grouping of 10 countries that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa but now is expanding. New members include Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Ethiopia. At the summit, Beijing and Moscow both articulated plans for economic systems separate from Western-led institutions; praised the success of BRICS countries in various development initiatives; and advanced plans to lead the network of states toward a more interconnected future. In his speech at the BRICS summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin promoted the creation of various mechanisms that would bypass traditional, Western-led systems that make his country vulnerable to Western economic sanctions. 'We believe that launching a special mechanism for consultations between BRICS countries on issues related to the World Trade Organisation will help us chart a common position on formulating more equitable rules of the game in the global economy and overhauling the international financial system,' according to a transcript of his speech released by the Kremlin. Chinese leader Xi Jinping echoed Putin’s remarks, saying the BRICS countries 'should play a leading role in the reform.' 'We must ensure that the international financial system more effectively reflects the changes in the global economic landscape,' Xi said. He also said BRICS member countries need to jointly work toward building BRICS 'into a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations and a vanguard for advancing global governance reform.' China’s and Russia’s ability to deliver meaningful results on the commitments they have made is likely to face challenges, said Ali Wyne, senior researcher at the International Crisis Group. 'The BRICS grouping is unlikely to achieve geopolitical coherence. China's relations with India are strained, as are Iran's with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, most member countries see participation in the BRICS as a means of expanding their freedom of foreign policy maneuver, not of positioning themselves against the West,' Wyne said. The shared ambitions of Beijing and Moscow may also be overshadowed by larger geopolitical priorities, the most notable being the war in Ukraine, analysts said. At the summit, China doubled down on its commitment to seeking a resolution of the war. Xi promoted the 'Friends of Peace' initiative, a collaborative effort led by China and Brazil to pursue a negotiated end to the conflict. U.S. and South Korean intelligence revealed the presence of an estimated 3,000 North Korean troops training in Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military intelligence service on Thursday put the number of North Koreans already in Russia at 12,000. The Kremlin at first dismissed reports of North Korean troop deployments, but on Thursday at the BRICS summit, Putin did not deny North Korean troops were in Russia. That deepening wartime collaboration between China’s two neighbors puts pressure on China and runs counter to its peacemaking ambitions. 'North Korea feels increasingly comfortable defying China's wishes, not only by increasing its nuclear and missile provocations in the Indo-Pacific, but also by fueling an armed conflict in a different theater at a time when Beijing seeks to portray itself as a potential peacemaker,' Wyne said. In June, Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a mutual defense treaty to strengthen military ties. North Korea also shares a similar treaty with China and is the only country to have entered a formalized agreement of this type with Beijing. 'China's challenge would be whether to fulfill its commitment to protect North Korea and potentially engage in a conflict with Ukraine. If North Korea were to enter the war, it would bring significant uncertainty to China-North Korea relations,' said Shanghai-based international relations scholar Dingli Shen. 'China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We hope that all parties will work for de-escalation and be committed to political settlement,' said Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington in a statement to VOA.

Protests erupt at release of Mozambique’s disputed election results	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Opposition supporters took to the streets of Mozambique’s capital late Thursday, burning tires and blocking key roads, to protest the announcement that ruling party presidential candidate Daniel Chapo won the October 9 election in a landslide. Police said 371 people were arrested in connection with the protests and skirmishes across the country. Dog teams, armored vehicles from the riot police and dozens of heavily armed officers, with the support of a helicopter, fought running battles with the protesters amid an intense smell of tear gas in most Maputo neighborhoods. A spokesperson for the Mozambique General Police Command, Orlando Mudumane, said people illegally led disorderly demonstrations on public roads, vandalized public and private property and looted goods from various commercial establishments. He said officers will remain on the streets to contain acts of violence and property destruction. Mudumane advised people to be wary of incendiary speeches and misinformation on social networks and other digital platforms. Thursday’s protests followed earlier demonstrations at which hundreds of people poured into the streets of Maputo and Matola to protest what they called fraudulent election results. The official results showed Frelimo party candidate Daniel Chapo winning the election with more than 70% of the vote. The runner-up, independent Venancio Mondlane, called for peaceful protests of the election results and issues such as kidnappings and police brutality. Mondlane holds Frelimo responsible for last week’s killings of two people aligned with the opposition Podemos party, lawyer Elvino Dias and party official Paulo Guambe. Mondlane called for Mozambique to come to a halt for two days, urging in a speech posted to Facebook that all institutions, whether public or private, be paralyzed in that time. Human Rights Watch researcher Zenaida Machado criticized the police actions against protestors, saying people have the right to protection when expressing their concerns even as authorities work to maintain order. 'The state, when they deploy security forces to the streets, they need to make sure that they are there not only to create the space for people to peacefully protest, but also to protect them against anything that might want to affect the protest itself,' Machado said. Observer missions from the European Union and Southern African Development Community have yet to offer a final assessment of the election. However, the EU mission said this week that some of its 179 observers were prevented from observing tabulation processes in some districts and provinces and at the national level. The EU mission also said its observers witnessed 'unjustified alteration' of election results at some polling stations. The National Electoral Commission says that all cases of alleged wrongdoing during voting and vote counting are being investigated. The official results are not final until validated by Mozambique’s Constitutional Council.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-erupt-at-release-of-mozambique-s-disputed-election-results/7839204.html	2024-10-25T09:38:44-07:00	
Chad looks to western neighbors for internet access after protracted blackout	Yaounde — Officials in Chad are stepping up efforts to connect the central African state to a regional fiber-optic network after cable breakages caused by flooding in neighboring Cameroon caused a protracted internet blackout. Authorities in the country have been unable to reestablish internet connections since the blackout began 10 days ago. The central African state lost internet access when fiber-optic cables in Cameroon, the southern neighbor via which landlocked Chad is digitally networked, saw cables washed out by flooding. Chadian officials told VOA on Friday that European Union and African Development Bank officials this week agreed to intensify efforts to get Chad hooked up to the trans-Saharan fiber-optic network via Niger, Cameroon’s neighbor to the west. Brahim Abdelkerim, secretary general of Chad's ministry of telecommunications, said that by February 2025, there will no longer be frustrations as a result of regular internet disruptions that paralyze businesses in Chad. He said Chad and Niger governments have made firm commitments to supervise the project to completion. Speaking with VOA Friday by messaging app from Chad's capital, N'djamena, Abdelkerim said Chad will lay some 500 kilometers of cable from N'djamena to the Niger border. The ADB said the EU will give 31.4 million dollars and the ADB will provide the other 55 million needed to complete the project. Chad was already projected to be a part of the trans-Saharan fiber-optic network, more than 1,500 kilometers long, that will eventually stretch through Chad, Algeria, Niger and Nigeria. The four countries say the project will create jobs and opportunities to generate income and reduce chronic rural poverty, especially among youths. Sona Jarosova, head of the EU political mission to Chad, said Friday on Chad state TV that connecting Chad to the Trans-Saharan fiber-optic network will reduce or stop regular blackouts caused by disruptions in Cameroon, which is the only country that connects landlocked Chad to the internet. She said the alternative connection will remove Chad from its present digital isolation. Jarosova said improved internet development will support the economy by improving infrastructure, trade and connectivity between North, West and Central Africa, and eventually the entire African continent. The International Telecommunications Union reports that the internet penetration rate in Africa was less than 40% in 2023, with sub-Saharan Africa — where Chad, Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon are located — suffering regular internet blackouts due to old equipment and electricity outages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-looks-to-western-neighbors-for-internet-access-after-protracted-blackout-/7839221.html	2024-10-25T09:32:31-07:00

Musk gives $44 million more to back Trump	WASHINGTON — Elon Musk gave about $44 million to his pro-Donald Trump spending group during the first half of October, federal disclosures showed on Thursday, as the billionaire stepped up his efforts for the Republican candidate in the November 5 election. The contributions, disclosed in a filing to the Federal Election Commission by Musk's America PAC group, come after a prior report showed he gave the group about $75 million over three months between July and September. America PAC, which is focused on turning out voters in closely contested states that could decide the election, also disclosed spending more than $47 million in the first half of October. The Trump campaign is broadly reliant on outside groups for canvassing voters, meaning the super PAC founded by Musk — the world's richest person — plays an outsized role in what is expected to be a razor-thin election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Separately, Trump's campaign reported spending more than $88 million on ads in the first half of the month, leaving him with $36 million in the bank for the final stretch of campaigning, according to a separate filing to the Federal Election Commission. Trump's campaign raised $16 million during the period. The Harris campaign, which has outraised and outspent Trump's campaign in recent months, reported spending more than $130 million on ads in early October. Harris' campaign raised $97 million during the first half of the month and had $119 million in the bank on October 16, according to its disclosure. Another conservative super PAC, the Sentinel Action Fund, also reported receiving $2.3 million from Musk. Musk's donations to America PAC propel him into the exclusive club of Republican mega donors, a list that also includes banking heir Timothy Mellon and casino billionaire Miriam Adelson. As part of its plan to stir support for Trump, America PAC has been giving away $1 million per day to a randomly selected signatory of its online petition, which is only open to registered voters in battleground states. The Justice Department sent a letter to America PAC warning that the giveaways may violate federal law, CNN reported on Wednesday. The petition falls into a gray area of election law, and legal experts are divided about whether Musk could be running afoul of prohibitions on paying people to register to vote. Musk named two winners, one in Michigan and one in Wisconsin, in posts on social media platform X late Thursday following the DOJ warning. America PAC has not responded to requests for comment about the letter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-gives-44-million-more-to-back-trump/7839087.html	2024-10-25T08:17:03-07:00	
IMF raises concerns about effects of Sudan conflict on neighbors	WASHINGTON — The war in Sudan is likely to cause heavy economic damage in neighboring countries, the IMF's deputy director for Africa, Catherine Pattillo, told AFP. 'What is going on there for the people in Sudan is just so heart wrenching and devastating. For all of the neighboring countries, too,' she said in an interview in Washington ahead of the publication Friday of the International Monetary Fund's regional outlook for sub-Saharan Africa. 'A number of these countries that are neighbors are also fragile countries with their own challenges,' she said. 'And then to be confronted with the refugees, the security issues, the trade issues, is very challenging for their growth.' The IMF's report predicted that the Central African Republic, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia and South Sudan could be particularly hard hit by the ongoing conflict in Sudan. For South Sudan, the situation has become particularly worrying following the loss in February of one of its main sources of income after an oil export pipeline was damaged in Sudan. The pipeline is crucial for transporting South Sudanese crude oil abroad, which is especially important given that oil accounts for around 90% of the landlocked country's exports. The war in Sudan has been raging since April 2023 between the army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, of his former deputy, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is also known as Hemedti. The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, according to the United Nations. More than 10.7 million people have been displaced across the country, and a further 2.3 million have fled to neighboring countries. The conflict has also exacerbated food insecurity; a famine was declared in July in the Zamzam camp for displaced people near the town of el-Facher, in Darfur. 'You could think of Sudan [and] also some of the security issues in the Sahelian countries, also affecting growth,' Pattillo said. 'Those are the internal conflicts.' At the same time, other 'external conflicts' such as the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine are also affecting the cost of food, fertilizer and energy, she said. The IMF noted that rising protectionism was also having a negative impact on growth in Africa at a time when trade tensions are translating into tariff hikes between the world's three most powerful trading blocs: the United States, Europe and China. The economic slowdown in developed countries and China still represents a major challenge for African countries, the IMF noted, predicting growth in sub-Saharan Africa of 4.2% next year. This is slightly better than the 3.6% growth expected this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/imf-raises-concerns-about-effects-of-sudan-conflict-on-neighbors/7839070.html	2024-10-25T08:06:27-07:00

Storm blows away from Philippines leaving 82 dead — but it may do a U-turn	MANILA — Tropical Storm Trami blew away from the northwestern Philippines on Friday, leaving at least 82 people dead in landslides and extensive flooding that forced authorities to scramble for more rescue boats to save thousands of terrified people who were trapped, some on their roofs. But the onslaught may not be over: State forecasters raised the rare possibility that the storm — the 11th and one of the deadliest to hit the Philippines this year — could make a U-turn next week as it is pushed back by high-pressure winds in the South China Sea. A Philippine provincial police chief said Friday that 49 people were killed, mostly in landslides set off by Trami in Batangas province, south of Manila. That brought the overall death toll from the storm to at least 82. Eleven other villagers remain missing in Batangas, Colonel Jacinto Malinao Jr. told The Associated Press by telephone from the lakeside town of Talisay, where he stood beside a villager whose wife and child were buried in the deep mound of mud, boulders and trees. With the use of a backhoe and shovels, police scrambled to search into 3 meters (10 feet) of mud, rocks and debris and found a part of a head and foot that apparently were those of the missing woman and child. 'He's simply devastated,' Malinao said of the villager, a fisherman. 'He's in shock and couldn't speak and we're only asking him to point to where their bedroom was located so we can dig in that part.' The storm was last tracked Friday afternoon blowing 410 kilometers (255 miles) west of the northwestern Philippine province of Ilocos Sur with sustained winds of up to 95 kilometers per hour (59 miles per hour) and gusts of up to 115 kph (78 mph). It was moving northwestward at 30 kph (19 mph) toward Vietnam, which is forecast to be lashed by Trami starting Sunday if it stays on course. The Philippine weather agency, however, said it's possible that high-pressure winds and other weather factors in the South China Sea could force the storm to turn back toward the Philippines. President Ferdinand Marcos, sounding exasperated, inquired about that prospect in an emergency meeting with Cabinet members and disaster-response officials Friday about the response to the widespread devastation. 'What is the forecast for that? Is it possible it would return?' Marcos asked. A government forecaster told him Trami could turn toward the western Philippines early next week, but it’s more likely to blow away from the Philippines again without making landfall. 'It doesn't have to make landfall for the damage to occur,' Marcos said, citing the continuing downpours set off by Trami in the Philippines. Marcos also cited another brewing storm in the Pacific Ocean that could again threaten the country. 'Oh God, it is what it is. We just have to deal with it,' Marcos said. State forecaster Jofren Habaluyas told the AP that Trami's possible U-turn has drawn interest among government weather experts in Asia, including those from Japan, which has been providing information to the Philippines to help track the storm. The 82 storm deaths included 26 villagers who died in floodwaters and landslides in hard-hit Bicol, an agricultural region and tourism destination southeast of Manila that is popular for Mayon, one of the country's 24 most-active volcanoes that has a near-perfect cone. At least 27 remain missing in several provinces, including 17 in Batangas, according to Malinao and the Office of Civil Defense. Although Trami did not strengthen into a typhoon, it dumped unusually heavy rains in some regions, including some that saw one to two months' worth of rainfall in just 24 hours, inundating communities with flash floods. Officials in Naga city, where 11 people died by drowning, and the outlying provinces of Camarines Sur and Albay pleaded for more rescue boats at the height of the onslaught to reach people trapped on the upper floors of their homes or on their roofs as floodwaters rose. In the foothills of Mayon volcano in Albay province, mud and other debris cascaded toward nearby towns as the storm hit, engulfing houses and cars in black-colored mudflows. More than 2.6 million people were affected by the deluge, with nearly 320,000 people fleeing into evacuation centers or relatives' homes, disaster-mitigation officials said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-blows-away-from-philippines-leaving-82-dead-but-it-may-do-a-u-turn/7838933.html	2024-10-25T06:32:41-07:00	
Clashes with militants in northwest Pakistan kill 14 security force members	Islamabad — Pakistani authorities said Friday that clashes with militants killed at least 14 security force officers and injured several others in a northwestern province bordering Afghanistan. The violence took place in the militancy-affected Khyber, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Khan districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, frequently ambushes military and police personnel and stages attacks against their outposts. Local security officials in Khyber said a gunfight between TTP assailants and security forces erupted Friday, resulting in the deaths of at least two personnel and injuries to three others. They also reported the killing of at least two militants. Separately, militants ambushed a police vehicle in Bannu, killing a senior police officer and his guard. The Bannu attack came just hours after authorities in nearby Dera Ismail Khan reported that at least 10 security force members were killed when heavily armed militants stormed their outpost late on Thursday, according to multiple security officials. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attacks in Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan, paying tribute to the 'martyred' security personnel, his office said in Islamabad. It did not specify the number of fatalities from these attacks, nor did it mention the deadly clash in Khyber. TTP, commonly known as the Pakistani Taliban, claimed it carried out the raid in Dera Ismail Khan in retaliation for the recent killing of one of its senior commanders, identified as Ustad Qureshi, by Pakistani security forces. The Pakistani military reported on Thursday that Qureshi was one of nine TTP members, including two suicide bombers, killed this week in an intelligence-driven operation in the Bajaur district next to the Afghan border. Pakistani officials allege that TTP operates out of sanctuaries in Afghanistan with the support of the neighboring country’s Islamist Taliban leaders. Islamabad has reported a dramatic surge in TTP-led insurgent attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban regained power in Kabul three years ago. The violence has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Pakistanis, half of them security forces, across the country in the first 10 months of this year alone. The Afghan Taliban deny allegations that the TTP or any other transnational militant groups are present on their territory, a claim disputed by recent United Nations security assessments and regional countries. 'We urge for more visible and verifiable measures in Afghanistan to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorists,' stated a joint declaration after the BRICS summit hosted by Russia this week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-with-militants-in-northwest-pakistan-kill-14-security-force-members-/7838931.html	2024-10-25T06:28:51-07:00	
Beijing gets new Catholic bishop, days after Vatican-China deal renewal	Vatican City — A new assistant Catholic bishop for Beijing was ordained on Friday, three days after the Vatican and Chinese officials extended an accord on appointments in China, the Vatican said. Bishop Matthew Zhen Xuebin, 54, was named to the role by Pope Francis, who approved his nomination within the framework of a diplomatic deal originally struck in 2018 that gives Chinese officials some input into papal appointments. Some conservative Catholics say the deal gives too much influence to China's ruling communists, who have kept a tight reign on religious practice since taking power in 1949. But the Vatican stresses that Francis retains final decision-making power and says the accord resolves a decades-long split between an underground church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association. Beijing and the Vatican announced on Tuesday that the accord, previously renewed in two-year increments, had been renewed again for a longer period of four years. Zhen will assist Bishop Joseph Li Shan, 59, in running the local Church. Zhen was appointed with right of succession, the Vatican said, meaning he will automatically replace Li at the bishop's death or resignation. The Vatican spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about why Zhen had been appointed with right of succession, a process the Vatican usually uses when an ageing bishop is expected to retire soon. Zhen's ordination occurred Friday morning at Beijing's Church of the Saviour, the Vatican news agency Fides reported. Among those taking part were Li, four other Chinese bishops, and about 650 others, the agency said. Beijing, the world's most populous city with some 22 million residents, has about 100,000 Catholics, according to Vatican statistics. Around China, there are about 5 million Catholics in a total population of 1.4 billion, the Vatican estimates.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-gets-new-catholic-bishop-days-after-vatican-china-deal-renewal-/7838891.html	2024-10-25T06:04:18-07:00

EU Commission chief promises Bosnia flood aid, support for reform on membership path	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday promised support for Bosnia as the troubled Balkan country struggles with reform needed to advance toward membership in the European Union. Von der Leyen was in Bosnia as part of a trip this week to aspiring EU member states in the Western Balkans to assure them that EU enlargement remains a priority for the 27-nation bloc. From Bosnia, von der Leyen went on to neighboring Serbia. The Western Balkans countries — Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia — are at different stages in their applications for EU membership. The countries have been frustrated by the slow pace of the process, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has propelled European leaders to push the six to join the bloc. Bosnia gained candidate status in 2022 while EU leaders in March agreed in principle to open membership negotiations, though Bosnia must still do a lot of work. 'We share the same vision for the future, a future where Bosnia-Herzegovina is a full-fledged member of the European Union,' said von der Leyen at a joint press conference with Bosnian Prime Minister Bojana Kristo. 'So, I would say, let’s continue working on that. We’ve gone a long way already, we still have a way ahead of us but I am confident that you’ll make it.' Last year EU officials offered a 6-billion-euro (about $6.5 billion) growth plan to the Western Balkan countries in an effort to double the region’s economy over the next decade and accelerate their efforts to join the bloc. That aid is contingent on reforms that would bring their economies in line with EU rules. The Commission on Wednesday approved the reform agendas of Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia following a green light from EU member states. That was a key step to allow payments under the growth plan upon completion of agreed reform steps. 'The accession process is, as you know, merit-based … we do not look at a rigid data but we look at the merits, the progress that a country is making,' said von der Leyen. 'The important thing is that we have an ambitious reform agenda, like the other five Western Balkan countries also have. We stand ready to help you to move forward.' Long after a 1992-95 ethnic war that killed more than 100,000 people and left millions homeless, Bosnia remains ethnically divided and politically deadlocked. An ethnic Serb entity — one of Bosnia's two equal parts joined by a common government — has sought to gain as much independence as possible. Upon arrival in Bosnia, von der Leyen on Thursday first went to Donja Jablanica, a village in central Bosnia that was devastated in recent floods and landslides. The disaster in early October claimed 27 lives and the small village was virtually buried in rocks from a quarry located on a hill above. Von der Leyen said the EU is sending an immediate aid package of 20 million euros ($21 million) and will also provide support for reconstruction later on.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-commission-chief-promises-bosnia-flood-aid-support-for-reform-on-membership-path-/7838850.html	2024-10-25T05:11:52-07:00	
LRA rebel commander jailed in Uganda for war crimes in landmark case	KAMPALA — Thomas Kwoyelo, a mid-level commander in the notorious Lord's Resistance Army rebel group, was sentenced to 40 years in prison in Uganda on Friday for war crimes including murder, rape, enslavement, torture and kidnap. Kwoyelo was convicted of dozens of war crimes in August, the first time an officer of his seniority had been tried by Uganda's judiciary. Founded in the late 1980s with the aim of overthrowing the government, the LRA brutalized Ugandans under the leadership of Joseph Kony for nearly 20 years as it battled the military from bases in northern Uganda. The insurgents carried out horrific acts of cruelty, including rapes, abductions, hacking off victims' limbs and lips and using crude instruments to bludgeon people to death. 'The convict played a prominent role in the planning, strategy and actual execution of the offences of extreme gravity,' Justice Duncan Gasagwa, one of the four judges, said. 'The victims have been left with lasting physical and mental pain and suffering.' Kwoyelo avoided the death sentence because he was recruited by the LRA at a young age, was not one of the top-ranking commanders, and has expressed remorse and a willingness to reconcile with the victims, Gasagwa said. Kwoyelo had denied the charges during the trial. His lawyer, Caleb Alaka, told the court he would appeal against both the verdict and the sentence. In around 2005, under military pressure, the LRA fled to the lawless jungles of South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic, where it also unleashed waves of violence against civilians. Splintered elements of the group, including Kony, are believed to still live in those areas, although attacks are now infrequent. The Ugandan military captured Kwoyelo in 2009 in northeastern Congo and his case crept through the Ugandan court system until he was convicted in August. He was found guilty on 44 charges, 31 were dismissed as duplications of others while he was acquitted on three. An arrest warrant was issued by the International Criminal Court's (ICC) against Kony in 2005, making him the court's longest standing fugitive. The LRA's original aim was to create a state based on Kony's interpretation of the Ten Commandments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lra-rebel-commander-jailed-in-uganda-for-war-crimes-in-landmark-case-/7838827.html	2024-10-25T04:53:51-07:00	
Union's rejection of Boeing offer threatens jobs at aerospace suppliers	Striking workers' rejection of planemaker Boeing's BA.N latest contract offer has created a fresh threat to operations at aerospace suppliers such as family-run Independent Forge. If the strike by more than 33,000 U.S. Boeing workers persists another month, the Orange County, California supplier might need to cut its operations from five to three days a week to save money and retain workers, president Andrew Flores said. While Independent laid off a few employees already, letting more go is not an appealing option, he said. The 22 workers who remain are critical for the company, especially when the strike eventually ends and demand for its aluminum aircraft parts rebounds. 'They are the backbone of our shop,' Flores said this week. 'Their knowledge, I can't replace that.' Wednesday's vote by 64% of Boeing's West Coast factory workers against the company's latest contract offer, further idling assembly for nearly all of the planemaker's commercial jets, has created a fresh test for suppliers such as Independent, which opened in 1975. Boeing's vast global network of suppliers that produce parts from sprawling modern factories or tiny garage workshops, was already stressed by the company's quality-and-safety crisis, which began in January after a mid-air panel blow-out on a new 737 MAX. Demand for parts has dropped, hitting suppliers after they spent heavily to meet renewed demand for planes in the post-pandemic era. How small suppliers such as Independent navigate the strike, which began on Sept. 13, is expected to affect Boeing's future ability to bring its plane production back online. More job cuts? Five Boeing suppliers interviewed by Reuters this week said continuation of the strike would cause them to furlough workers, freeze investment, or consider halting production. Boeing declined comment. Seattle-area supplier Pathfinder, which runs a project to attract young recruits to aerospace and trains them alongside its skilled workers, will likely need to lay off more employees, CEO Dave Trader said. Pathfinder, which let go one-quarter of its 54 workers last month, will also need to send more of its aerospace students back to their high schools, instead of training them in the company's factories, Trader said. Suppliers on a regular call on Thursday with Boeing supply-chain executives said they expect the strike will continue for weeks, one participant told Reuters. About 60% of the 2.21 million Americans who work in the aerospace industry have jobs directly linked to the supply chain, according to the U.S. industry group Aerospace Industries Association. Those suppliers' decisions to reduce staffing could create a vicious cycle, as they will put added strain on Boeing's efforts to restore and eventually increase 737 MAX output above a regulator-imposed cap of 38 after its factories re-open, analysts say. 'Once we get back, we have the task of restarting the factories and the supply chain, and it's much harder to turn this on than it is to turn it off,' CEO Kelly Ortberg told an analyst call on Wednesday. 'The longer it goes on, the more it could trickle back into the supply chain and cause delays there,' Southwest Airlines LUV.N Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson said of the strike on Thursday. Shares of Boeing suppliers fell on Thursday. Howmet HWM.N lost 2%. Honeywell HON.O and Spirit AeroSystems SPR.N fell 5% and 3%, respectively, following weak results. Spirit Aero, Boeing's key supplier, which has already announced the furlough of 700 workers on the 767 and 777 widebody programs for 21 days, has warned it would implement layoffs should the strike continue past November. 'It’s starting up the supply chain that is likely to be the biggest worry, especially if they have taken action to cut workers due to a lack of Boeing orders,' Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said by email. A strained supply chain, Spirit Aero's challenges and increased regulatory oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration over MAX production, means it could take up to a year from the strike's end to get 737 output back to the 38-per-month rate, Stallard said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/union-s-rejection-of-boeing-offer-threatens-jobs-at-aerospace-suppliers-/7838803.html	2024-10-25T04:33:58-07:00	
Blinken meets Lebanese PM as war rages	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday with Lebanon's prime minister to discuss Israel's strikes on the country as Washington presses the Beirut government to take charge against Hezbollah. Blinken, on his way back from a Middle East tour, met in London with Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who came in from a conference on Lebanon in Paris the day before. The two smiled before the cameras but made no remarks. The United States, Israel's main political and military ally, has stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in its month of bombing of Lebanon targeting Iranian-backed militia Hezbollah. But Blinken has also called for a quick diplomatic solution. 'We have been very clear that this cannot lead -- should not lead -- to a protracted campaign and that Israel must take the necessary steps to avoid civilian casualties and not endanger UN peacekeepers or the Lebanese Armed Forces,' Blinken said Thursday in Doha. The United States has called for Lebanon's long wobbly central government to take charge of security and for the disarmament of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite movement that effectively has its own military. Hezbollah has fired missiles at Israel in solidarity with Hamas since the Palestinian militants' October 7, 2023 attack, which triggered Israel's massive military assault in Gaza. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in a call to his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant on Wednesday voiced concern over Israeli strikes on the Lebanese army which have killed at least 11 Lebanese soldiers, according to an AFP tally of army announcements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-meets-lebanese-pm-as-war-rages/7838728.html	2024-10-25T02:46:35-07:00	
Iran's imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate sentenced to another 6 months in prison	Iranian authorities have issued an additional six-month prison sentence against Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, a group campaigning for the activist said. The Free Narges Coalition said in a statement on Thursday that Mohammadi was sentenced on Oct. 19 to an additional six months in prison on the charge of 'disobeying and resisting orders.' According to the statement, the charge was brought after Mohammadi staged a protest against the execution of another political prisoner in the women's ward of Evin Prison on Aug.6. Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003. Mohammadi, 52, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and years behind bars. She is being held at Iran's notorious Evin Prison, which houses political prisoners and those with Western ties. She already had been serving a 30-month sentence, to which 15 more months were added in January. Iran's government has not acknowledged her additional sentencing. The latest order reflects the Iranian theocracy's anger that she was awarded the Nobel prize in October 2023 for years of activism despite a decades-long government campaign targeting her. Mohammadi was a leading light for nationwide, women-led protests sparked by the death last year of a 22-year-old woman in police custody that have grown into one of the most intense challenges to Iran's theocratic government. That woman, Mahsa Amini, had been detained for allegedly not wearing her headscarf to the liking of authorities. The statement demanded Mohammadi's unconditional release, saying her health situation has deteriorated drastically during her long incarceration and she is suffering from heart disease.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-imprisoned-nobel-peace-prize-laureate-sentenced-to-another-6-months-in-prison/7838709.html	2024-10-25T02:20:12-07:00	
Israeli strike kills three journalists in south Lebanon	An Israeli strike early on Friday morning killed at least three journalists and wounded several others as they slept in guesthouses used by media in Hasbaya in southern Lebanon, Lebanon's health ministry and local media reported. Those killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and engineer Mohamed Reda of the pro-Iranian news outlet Al-Mayadeen and camera operator Wissam Qassem, who worked for Hezbollah's Al-Manar, the outlets said in separate statements. The strikes made it the deadliest day for media in a year of hostilities between the Israeli military and the Lebanese Hezbollah militia. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which in general denies deliberately attacking journalists. Five journalists had been killed in previous Israeli strikes in Lebanon during the conflict, including Reuters visual journalist Issam Abdallah. Hasbaya is a town inhabited by both Muslims and Christians. There have been attacks on its outskirts in recent weeks, but Friday's, at around 3 a.m. (midnight GMT), was the first on the town itself. 'This is a war crime,' Lebanese Information Minister Ziad Makary said. At least 18 journalists from six media outlets, including Sky News, Al-Jazeera and Lebanese broadcasters, were staying at the guesthouses. 'We heard the airplane flying very low - that's what woke us up - and then we heard the two missiles,' Muhammad Farhat, a reporter with the Lebanese outlet Al-Jadeed, told Reuters. He said several bungalows had been damaged. His footage showed overturned and damaged cars, some marked 'Press.' 'We had been reporting from there for about a month without anything happening. I don't even know how I climbed out from under the rubble,' Farhat said. Ghassan bin Jiddo, the director of Al-Mayadeen, said on the channel's X account that the attack was 'deliberate.' 'We hold the occupation (Israel) fully responsible for this war crime, in which journalist crews including the Al-Mayadeen team were targeted,' bin Jiddo said. Israel attacks Lebanese media, soldiers A day earlier, Israel had struck an office used by Al-Mayadeen in Beirut's southern suburbs. Lebanon’s health ministry said one person had been killed and five others, including a child, wounded. Beirut authorities say the Israeli military campaign has killed more than 2,500 people and displaced more than 1.2 million people, creating a humanitarian crisis. On Thursday, an Israeli strike killed three Lebanese soldiers as they tried to evacuate wounded people from the border village of Yater, the Lebanese army said. There was no comment from the Israeli military. The U.S. has said Israel should take steps to avoid civilian casualties and not endanger U.N. peacekeepers or Lebanese army troops in its attacks in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel, which has been criticized for shelling hospitals and schools, has said it targets Hamas and Hezbollah militants precisely, accusing them of using civilians as shields. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that, as of Oct. 24, its preliminary investigations showed at least 128 media workers had been killed since the start of the Gaza war, making it the deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992. Of those, 123 were Palestinian, two Israeli and three Lebanese. A month into Israel's military operation against the Iran-backed Hezbollah, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned in Doha that 'this cannot lead, should not lead, to a protracted campaign.' Blinken also said he hoped Iran was getting the message that further attacks on Israel would put its own interests at risk. Israel has vowed retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on Oct. 1. US, Israel, Qatar and Egypt try to revive ceasefire talks U.S. and Israeli negotiators will gather in Doha to prepare for new talks on a Gaza ceasefire that would also entail the release of Israeli hostages, Qatar and Washington said. Israel said David Barnea, head of the Mossad intelligence agency, would travel to Doha on Sunday to meet with CIA director William Burns and Qatar's prime minister. An Egyptian security delegation met a delegation of Hamas leaders in Cairo as part of the efforts to revive Gaza ceasefire talks, Egypt's state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV said. Hamas senior official Osama Hamdan told Al-Mayadeen there was no change in the group's position. 'The hostages held by the resistance will only return with a stop to the aggression and complete withdrawal,' Hamdan said. Blinken is on his first trip to the region since Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered conflict across the Middle East. Washington, Israel's close ally, has expressed hope that his death can provide an impetus for an end to the fighting. Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, the head of Israel's military, has said an end to the conflict with Hezbollah now looks possible as Israel has killed most of its senior commanders. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati said the onus was on Israel. 'The storm we are currently witnessing ... carries the seeds of total destruction, not only for our country, but for all human values,' he said. Hezbollah launched attacks against Israel a day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 assault on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people and resulted in another 250 being abducted, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's Gaza offensive has killed nearly 43,000 people, according to Gaza authorities, and laid waste to the territory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strike-kills-three-journalists-in-south-lebanon/7838701.html	2024-10-25T01:55:04-07:00	
Indonesia's new president trains cabinet at military-style camp	Indonesia's newly inaugurated President Prabowo Subianto hosted his cabinet Friday at an army academy retreat in the mountains where ministers dressed in camouflage fatigues, stayed in tents and were ordered to march. The 73-year-old former general became leader of the world's fourth most populous nation on Sunday, pledging to bolster Indonesia's defenses and fight corruption. Prabowo, accused of rights abuses under dictator Suharto in the late 1990s, ordered the retreat in Magelang, located in the mountains of Central Java, to drill ministers and unite them before leading the next government. 'The activity started with exercise together, led by coaches from the military academy in Magelang. After a 30-minute exercise, the agenda continued with a march training,' said presidential spokesman Hasan Nasbi. 'What's surprising is when the cabinet members arrived on the field, President Prabowo Subianto was the first to arrive. President Prabowo was giving an example as a disciplined leader.' Images on social media showed Prabowo and his ministers dressed in camouflage military gear. 'We must move in sync with the same goal. The government does not work alone, we have to work as a team,' Prabowo told the ministers, according to state news agency Antara. Erick Thohir, the state-owned enterprises minister and former chairman of Inter Milan football club, posted videos from the academy and the military plane that flew the cabinet to the area. 'Learning to create content from the experts,' he wrote on Instagram, showing himself laughing with other ministers. Indonesian celebrity Raffi Ahmad, who was announced as one of Prabowo's presidential envoys, posted to 76 million followers that he was headed to the military academy where the new president wanted 'to create good teamwork'. Rights advocates have raised concerns that Prabowo and key allies like Defense Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin -- also implicated in rights abuses under Suharto -- could strengthen the role of the military in the secular democracy of around 280 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-new-president-trains-cabinet-at-military-style-camp/7838699.html	2024-10-25T01:48:20-07:00	
Taiwan president 'won't yield an inch' in defense of island's territory	Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said Friday the island will not cede an inch of its territory, as China maintains military pressure on Taipei to accept its claim of sovereignty. Lai made the remarks during a visit to the Kinmen islands off China for the 75th anniversary of a victory over communist forces in the Battle of Guningtou. It followed a fortnight of intense military activity in the Taiwan Strait -- the sensitive waterway that separates China and Taiwan -- with troops from both sides holding drills. '(We) will not yield an inch of ground in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu to firmly defend our homeland,' Lai said in a speech, referring to the islands controlled by Taipei. 'The Battle of Guningtou lets us understand that democracy and freedom should not be taken for granted, but require the joint efforts of generations to defend them,' Lai said. Without naming China, Lai insisted that 'any external forces' would not be allowed to change the future of the islands. China's Communist Party has never ruled democratic Taiwan, but Beijing claims the island as part of its territory and has said it will never renounce the use of force to bring it under its control. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian brushed aside Lai's comments, insisting that China and Taiwan 'will and must be unified in the end'. The dispute between Beijing and Taipei dates back to a civil war between Mao Zedong's communist fighters and Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist forces, which fled to Taiwan in 1949 following their defeat. The nationalists scored a key victory over the communists in the Battle of Guningtou on the Kinmen islands. Lai, who took power in May and has been more outspoken than his predecessor in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, earlier attended a somber ceremony for the battle and shook hands with veterans. In his speech, Lai said Taiwan's 'determination to defend our national sovereignty' and efforts 'to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait' were unchanged. He repeated his hope that China and Taiwan will 'conduct dialogue and exchanges with parity, dignity and in a healthy and orderly manner'. Beijing severed high-level communications with Taipei in 2016 and has since ramped up military and political pressure on the self-ruled island. China's large-scale war games around Taiwan on October 14 were followed by live-fire drills near the island on Tuesday, and the transiting of a Chinese aircraft carrier group through the Taiwan Strait a day later. Taiwanese troops conducted live-fire drills on Penghu island in the waterway on Thursday, days after a US and a Canadian warship sailed through the narrow passage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-president-won-t-yield-an-inch-in-defense-of-island-s-territory/7838697.html	2024-10-25T01:44:30-07:00	
Germany, India look to boost ties on defense, green energy	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wants to deepen defense ties with New Delhi and bring the two countries' militaries closer, he said on Friday, after meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Germany has not traditionally had close defense ties with India, but is now pitching to join the latter's effort to wean its arms base from decades of dependence on Russia, at a time when the West seeks to counter China's growing influence. 'Our overall message is clear, we need more co-operation, not less,' Scholz said. 'At our inter-governmental consultations with India, we also want to deepen co-operation in defense and agree to bring our militaries together.' Scholz, accompanied by most of his cabinet, is leading a high-level delegation to New Delhi, betting that greater access to the vast Indian market can reduce Germany's reliance on China. German Thyssenkrupp is one of two bidders to have partnered with Indian firms to build six conventional submarines in India, in a deal estimated to be worth $5 billion. The Indian Navy is expected to pick between the German company or Spain's Navantia soon. New Delhi and Berlin are working on renewable energy projects, Modi said, among many possible investments in transport infrastructure. 'India is completely transforming its physical infrastructure,' Modi told the Asia-Pacific conference of German business in the Indian capital, attended by Scholz. 'Record investments are being made. This offers many possibilities for German and Indo-Pacific region companies.' In 2022 Germany pledged 10 billion euros to help India achieve its climate goals. German state lender KfW's unit DEG, which focuses on the private sector, plans to more than double investment in India to $1 billion over the next few years, focusing on renewable energy and infrastructure, an official, Jochen von Frowein, has said. India-EU FTA Scholz reiterated his economy minister's push for swift progress on talks for a free-trade pact between India and the European Union. 'I am sure that if we work on this together, prime minister, this could happen in months rather than years,' Scholz said. Earlier, Trade Minister Piyush Goyal warned that India would be unable to strike such a deal if the bloc insisted on getting access to the Asian giant's dairy industry. A trade deal could be swiftly reached if sensitivities were respected on both sides, Goyal told the conference, following Thursday's comments by German Economy Minister Robert Habeck that agriculture was the talks' 'most problematic' area, and suggesting that they first tackle the industrial sector. Progress has been slow on the talks, initially targeted to be wrapped up by the end of 2023, with India blaming the EU for what it called 'irrational' standards, as one reason.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-india-look-to-boost-ties-on-defense-green-energy/7838696.html	2024-10-25T01:41:14-07:00	
Russia targets Kyiv in overnight drone attack	Russia sent two waves of drones at the Ukrainian capital overnight in its 15th air attack on Kyiv this month, city officials said on Friday. More than a dozen drones were downed over the city during the strike, which lasted around four hours, city military administrator Serhiy Popko said on Telegram. He added that authorities had not received any reports of injuries and that debris had ignited a fire that was later extinguished. Reuters correspondents reported hearing multiple explosions early on Friday. Overall, Ukrainian air defenses destroyed 36 out of 63 drones launched overnight by Russia over various parts of Ukraine, Kyiv's air force said. Most were downed over the Kyiv and southern Odesa regions, it added, while another 16 were 'locationally lost.' Russia has denied targeting civilians in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022, but has regularly fired missiles and drones at towns and cities behind the front line.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-targets-kyiv-in-overnight-drone-attack/7838694.html	2024-10-25T01:38:13-07:00	
Iran's aviation woes compounded by latest EU sanctions	Iranian photographer Tannaz was on her way to Tehran's airport when European sanctions on flag carrier Iran Air forced her to return home, unable to make it to work in Paris. It was within hours of the European Union announcing measures last week against prominent Iranian officials and entities, including airlines, accused of involvement in the transfer of missiles and drones for Russia to use in its war against Ukraine. Tehran has consistently said such accusations were baseless, but with Western governments unconvinced, the latest sanctions went ahead, dealing a blow to Iran's already embattled airline industry. Unable to make it to her photoshoot in Paris as Iran Air had grounded all Europe-bound flights over the sanctions, Tannaz was left grappling with the effect on her business, uncertain how she may keep working abroad under the new restrictions. 'Considering the current situation and higher flight price options, I think I will lose many customers,' said the 37-year-old who gave her first name only, fearing repercussions. With no other Iranian airline serving European destinations, any alternative to the canceled Iran Air route would likely cost her much more and include a layover, increasing travel time. Many Western and other international airlines had already suspended their Iran services, citing heightened tensions and the risk of regional conflict since the Gaza war broke out more than a year ago. Host of challenges Despite having largely avoided being drawn into the conflict, Iran backs Palestinian group Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others, and whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the war, and has launched two direct attacks on Israel. The latest missile attack earlier this month, in response to the killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards general, prompted vows of retaliation from Israel, again heightening fears of a broader conflagration that could disrupt air traffic. Iran Air, far cheaper than its foreign competition, was 'the only airline that flew to Europe in our country', said Maghsoud Asadi Samani of the national airline association. 'With the new European Union sanctions against Iran Air, no Iranian aircraft will fly to Europe,' news agency ILNA quoted Samani as saying. Earlier Western sanctions on Iran, including those reimposed after the United States withdrew in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal, have taken a toll, too. They contributed to soaring inflation, slashing Iranians' purchasing power, but also heavily restricted the acquisition of aircraft and spare parts, and limited access to maintenance services. 'A significant number of planes in Iran have accordingly been grounded' for years, said economist Danial Rahmat. Aging aircraft fleets have worsened poor safety standards, part of a host of challenges Iran's aviation sector has long grappled with. Economist Said Leylaz said that while sanctions have had a serious impact, airlines' woes were rooted in mismanagement and corruption. Going 'where we're not sanctioned' But Iranians have only a few alternatives. Rahmat said that now, they may have to primarily rely on flights via neighboring countries to reach Europe and other parts of the world. Not only would it 'impose higher costs and longer travel hours on Iranian passengers, but it would also provide an opportunity for airlines from these countries to acquire a larger market share' at the expense of Iranian firms, said Rahmat. Iran Air still flies to several regional destinations as well as some in Asia. Another company, Mahan Air, goes to Moscow and Beijing several times a week. Shortly after the latest EU sanctions were announced on October 14, Iran Air set up a daily route to Istanbul 'to facilitate travel to Europe and reduce travelers' worries,' news agency ISNA reported. Leylaz said that the sanctions would likely boost Iran's ties with non-Western allies like China. The demand for flights to east Asia 'and outside the European Union... to places where we are not sanctioned is very high,' he added. President Masoud Pezeshkian has made easing Iran's economic isolation a key objective, but indirect talks with the United States that could have helped have been suspended over the regional conflict, according to Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. For Tannaz, the photographer, the ability to go abroad is not just a work issue but also a reflection of the state of the country. 'I just wish we could live a normal life,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-aviation-woes-compounded-by-latest-eu-sanctions/7838691.html	2024-10-25T01:34:16-07:00	
Vote-weary Bulgarians face seventh general election in just over 3 years	Bulgarians will cast ballots on Sunday in the seventh general elections in just over three years as the country faces growing political instability that might further enhance the popularity of pro-Russian and far-right groups. Of the six elections since 2021, only two have produced an elected government, but both coalitions collapsed after trying to introduce reforms, take on graft, and reduce reliance on Russia. There was no clear winner in the latest vote, held in June, and the seven groups elected to the fragmented legislature were unable to put together a viable coalition. Observers suggest that the coming vote will produce more of the same and that chances for an immediate end of the political stalemate are low. Pollsters predict that voter fatigue and disillusionment with the political system will result in low turnout and another fractured parliament where populist and pro-Russian groups could increase their representation. A record low turnout is expected and at the same time a high number of votes which have not been cast freely, said prominent analyst Stoyana Georgieva. These include instances where parties have paid for votes in cash but also where local authorities or corporations have put pressure on voters to cast their ballots in a certain way. Georgieva said it was possible that the main pro-Russia party in Bulgaria, Vazrazhdane, would emerge as the second-largest group in parliament. The far-right, ultra-nationalist and populist party demands that Bulgaria lift sanctions against Russia, stop helping Ukraine, and hold a referendum on its membership in NATO. The Balkan country of 6.7 million has been gripped by political instability since 2020, when nationwide protests erupted against corrupt politicians that had allowed oligarchs to take control of state institutions. Bulgaria is one of the poorest and most corrupt European Union member states. Attempts to fight graft are an uphill battle against an unreformed judiciary widely accused of serving the interests of politicians. Georgieva said she does not expect the next parliament to produce a widely acceptable compromise. 'At best, it could be a compromise on the edge of the least evil in Bulgaria. In this turbulent situation in the region — with the war in Ukraine, the war in the Middle East — both conflicts are very close to Bulgaria and Bulgaria is very vulnerable,' she told The Associated Press. According to Georgieva, three main groups of parties will enter the next Parliament. 'The first group are the kleptocratic parties led by the until recently ruling GERB, which is also the first political force whose leader and former prime minister is responsible for the implementation of a corrupt model in Bulgaria,' Georgieva said referring to former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov. 'The second group … are parties that in some honest way try to defend the causes of justice and liberal democracy; and a third group of parties that are openly pro-Putin.' It is very likely, said Georgieva, that after these elections some kind of government will be formed between the democrats and the kleptocratic parties that still hold pro-European and pro-Ukraine positions. While the successive elections since 2020 have produced broadly similar results, the current election will add some changes to the political landscape. Two of the oldest parties — the Socialists and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms — have been seriously shaken by internal conflicts. The MRF, which traditionally represented the ethnic Turkish vote, recently split into two rival factions, one around party founder Ahmed Dogan, and the other behind U.S.-sanctioned businessman and media tycoon Delyan Peevski.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vote-weary-bulgarians-face-seventh-general-election-in-just-over-3-years/7838682.html	2024-10-25T01:15:36-07:00	
2 Indian soldiers, 2 civilian porters killed in alleged rebel ambush in Kashmir	Two Indian army soldiers and their two civilian porters were killed in a rebel ambush in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Friday. Police said rebels sprayed bullets at an army vehicle carrying soldiers close to the highly militarized line of control near the resort town of Gulmarg on Thursday night. The de facto frontier divides the disputed Kashmir between India and Pakistan, which they both claim it in its entirety. Two soldiers and two civilians working as porters with the Indian military were killed and three other soldiers were wounded, police said. The military said it was a brief firefight and gave no other details. There was no independent confirmation of the incident. On Sunday, gunmen fatally shot at least seven people and injured five others working on a strategic tunnel project near another resort town of Sonamarg. Police blamed militants fighting against Indian rule for decades for the attack. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-soldiers-2-civilian-porters-killed-in-alleged-rebel-ambush-in-kashmir/7838681.html	2024-10-25T01:10:18-07:00	
King Charles tells summit past can't be changed as leaders ask Britain to reckon with slavery	King Charles III told a summit of Commonwealth countries in Samoa on Friday that the past could not be changed as he indirectly acknowledged calls from some of Britain's former colonies for a reckoning over its role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The British royal understood 'the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate,' he told leaders in Apia. But Charles stopped short of mentioning financial reparations that some leaders at the event have urged and instead exhorted them to find the 'right language' and an understanding of history 'to guide us towards making the right choices in future where inequality exists.' 'None of us can change the past but we can commit with all our hearts to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right the inequalities that endure,' said Charles, who is attending his first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, or CHOGM, as Britain's head of state. His remarks at the summit's official opening ceremony echoed comments a day earlier by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that the meeting should avoid becoming mired in the past and 'very, very long endless discussions about reparations.' The U.K. leader dismissed calls from Caribbean countries for leaders at the biennial event to explicitly discuss redress for Britain's role in the slave trade and mention the matter in its final joint statement. But Britain's handling of its involvement in the trans-Atlantic slave trade is seen by many observers as a litmus test for the Commonwealth's adaptation to a modern-day world, as other European nations and some British institutions have started to own up to their role in the trade. 'I think the time has come for this to be taken seriously,' said Jacqueline McKenzie, a partner at London law firm Leigh Day. 'Nobody expects people to pay every single penny for what happened. But I think there needs to be negotiations.' Such a policy would be costly and divisive at home, McKenzie said. The U.K. has never formally apologized for its role in the trade, in which millions of African citizens were kidnapped and transported to plantations in the Caribbean and Americas over several centuries, enriching many individuals and companies. Studies estimate Britain would owe between hundreds of millions and trillions of dollars in compensation to descendants of slaves. The Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis on Thursday said he wanted a 'frank' discussion with Starmer about the matter and would seek mention of the reparations issue in the leaders' final statement at the event. All three candidates to be the next Commonwealth Secretary-General — from Gambia, Ghana and Lesotho — have endorsed policies of reparatory justice for slavery. Starmer said Thursday in remarks to reporters that the matter would not be on the summit's agenda. But Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland told The Associated Press in an interview that leaders 'will speak about absolutely anything they want to speak about' at an all-day private meeting scheduled for Saturday. King Charles said in Friday's speech that nothing would right inequality 'more decisively than to champion the principle that our Commonwealth is one of genuine opportunity for all.' The monarch urged leaders to 'choose within our Commonwealth family the language of community and respect, and reject the language of division.' He has expressed 'sorrow' over slavery at a CHOGM summit before, in 2022, and last year endorsed a probe into the monarchy's ties to the industry. Charles — who is battling cancer — and his wife, Queen Camilla, will return to Britain tomorrow after visiting Samoa and Australia — where his presence prompted a lawmaker's protest over his country's colonial legacy. He acknowledged Friday that the Commonwealth had mattered 'a great deal' his late mother Queen Elizabeth II, who was seen as a unifying figure among the body's at times disparate and divergent states. The row over reparations threatened to overshadow a summit that Pacific leaders — and the Commonwealth secretariat — hoped would focus squarely on the ruinous effects of climate change. 'We are well past believing it is a problem for the future since it is already undermining the development we have long fought for,' the king said Friday. 'This year alone we have seen terrifying storms in the Caribbean, devastating flooding in East Africa and catastrophic wildfires in Canada. Lives, livelihood and human rights are at-risk across the Commonwealth.' Charles offered 'every encouragement for action with unequivocal determination to arrest rising temperatures' by cutting emissions, building resilience, and conserving and restoring nature on land and at sea, he said. Samoa is the first Pacific Island nation to host the event, and Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa said in a speech Friday that it was 'a great opportunity for all to experience our lived reality, especially with climate change,' which was 'the greatest threat to the survival and security of our Pacific people.' Two dozen small island nations are among CHOGM's 56 member states, among them the world's most imperiled by rising seas. Her remarks came as the United Nations released a stark new report warning that the world was on pace for significantly more warming than expected without immediate climate action. The population of the member nations of the 75-year-old Commonwealth organization totals 2.7 billion people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/king-charles-tells-summit-past-can-t-be-changed-as-leaders-ask-britain-to-reckon-with-slavery/7838678.html	2024-10-25T01:03:29-07:00	
Gangs in Haiti open fire on UN helicopter as violence surges	Gangs on Thursday opened fire and hit a U.N. helicopter, forcing it to land in Port-au-Prince in the latest attack in Haiti's capital as violence surges once again. No one was injured as several rounds of gunfire hit the helicopter that was carrying three crew members and 15 passengers, according to a U.N. source who was not authorized to confirm the incident. The helicopter, which had departed from Port-au-Prince before it was attacked, landed safely, the source said. The attack comes five months after Haiti's main international airport reopened following coordinated gang attacks that forced it to close for nearly three months. The violence has spilled to nearby areas including Arcahaie, where some 50 suspected gang members died this week after attacking the coastal town located just northwest of the capital. Among the dead are at least a dozen gunmen who drowned after their boat capsized, a government official said Thursday. While the majority were killed by police, a group of gunmen drowned on Wednesday after their boat hit the reef as they ferried ammunition to gangs attacking the town of Arcahaie, said Wilner Réné from Haiti’s Civil Protection Agency. He told Radio Caraïbes that the attack began on Monday, with gunmen burning homes and cars across Arcahaie. When the gangs ran out of ammunition, they hid in nearby areas and were ferreted out by residents and police, he said. The attack is still ongoing, and Réné warned that officers on the scene urgently need reinforcements from soldiers and special police units. The attack is blamed on a gang coalition called Viv Ansanm, which also has targeted communities in Port-au-Prince in recent days. Those attacks have displaced more than 10,000 people in the capital in just one week, according to a report released Thursday by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. More than half of those left homeless crowded into 14 makeshift shelters, including schools. The remainder are temporarily staying with relatives. The spike in gang violence comes just months after a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police began with the aim of quelling a surge in violence from gangs, who control more than 80% of Port-au-Prince. More than 700,000 people have been left homeless, and thousands have been killed. The U.S. government and top Haitian officials have warned that the Kenyan-led mission lacks personnel and funding and have asked that it be replaced with a U.N.-peacekeeping mission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gangs-in-haiti-open-fire-on-un-helicopter-as-violence-surges/7838676.html	2024-10-25T00:57:58-07:00	
Four astronauts return to Earth after being delayed by Boeing's capsule trouble, Hurricane Milton	Four astronauts returned to Earth on Friday after a nearly eight-month space station stay extended by Boeing's capsule trouble and Hurricane Milton. A SpaceX capsule carrying the crew parachuted before dawn into the Gulf of Mexico just off the Florida coast after undocking from the International Space Station mid-week. The three Americans and one Russian should have been back two months ago. But their homecoming was stalled by problems with Boeing’s new Starliner astronaut capsule, which came back empty in September because of safety concerns. Then Hurricane Milton interfered, followed by another two weeks of high wind and rough seas. SpaceX launched the four — NASA's Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Russia's Alexander Grebenkin — in March. Barratt, the only space veteran going into the mission, acknowledged the support teams back home that had 'to replan, retool and kind of redo everything right along with us ... and helped us to roll with all those punches.' Their replacements are the two Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose own mission went from eight days to eight months, and two astronauts launched by SpaceX four weeks ago. Those four will remain up there until February. The space station is now back to its normal crew size of seven — four Americans and three Russians — after months of overflow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-astronauts-return-to-earth-after-being-delayed-by-boeing-s-capsule-trouble-hurricane-milton/7838673.html	2024-10-25T00:52:08-07:00	
India-China deal raises questions about US Indo-Pacific strategy	NEW DELHI — This week's movement toward rapprochement between the leaders of China and India is raising questions about New Delhi's commitment to the Quad, the loose four-nation alliance widely seen as a U.S.-led bid to counter Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific. India's participation in the grouping, which also includes Japan and Australia and is formally known as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, has been at least partly driven by a vexing border dispute that has seen repeated clashes between Chinese and Indian troops along their Himalayan border. Presidents Narendra Modi of India and Xi Jinping of China agreed Wednesday on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia to reduce their differences and jointly work out a plan for patrolling the border. The agreement is expected to result in closer political and economic ties. 'The thaw in India-China relations is a boon to both countries. This is particularly significant for China because India may now be less inclined to confront Beijing as part of Quad,' Zhiqun Zhu, professor of political science and international affairs at Bucknell University, told VOA. 'In this sense, the effectiveness of Quad would be diluted with a less enthusiastic India.' India and China share certain common interests as the two largest developing nations. China was India's biggest trade partner last year, though there are signs that the U.S. might take its place this year. 'This suggests that the U.S. may wish to push forward its Indo-Pacific strategy without relying too heavily on support from India,' Zhu said. The Quad has served as an important element in the American effort to establish a network of alliances and partnerships to counter China's rising economic and military power, marked by its aggressive behavior in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. 'By remaining relatively informal, the Quad can quietly achieve many of the functions performed by NATO, up to and including military contingency planning,' wrote James Jay Carafano, a security affairs expert, on the website of the Liechtenstein-based think tank Geopolitical Intelligence Services AG. China's state-run newspaper Global Times described the improved China-India relationship as a response to U.S. and Western European efforts to reduce their economic reliance on China, a process sometimes described as 'decoupling.' 'In the context of the US 'decoupling' strategy, the strengthened cooperation between China and India takes on even greater significance,' the paper said in an editorial published Thursday. 'The pressures from the US 'decoupling' strategy and technological restrictions have heightened regional tensions and increased geopolitical risks for both nations.' The editorial also said that the potential geopolitical shift has already generated market optimism. 'It's based on the recognition of their complementary strengths and the vast opportunities for collaboration across diverse sectors, including manufacturing, infrastructure and sustainable development.' Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether the border agreement will be sustained in the face of decades-old differences between the world's two most-populous countries. They fought a war in 1962 and were engaged in a border clash in 2020 in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died. There is some concern in India about whether China will in fact pull back troops in the disputed border areas and implement the agreement on the ground. India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said Thursday that 'agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected' and 'disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-china-deal-raises-questions-about-us-indo-pacific-strategy-/7838623.html	2024-10-24T20:38:52-07:00

Blinken shuttles around Mideast on peace quest	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with key negotiators Thursday to discuss a Mideast cease-fire during a stop in the negotiating hub of Qatar. The parties have spent months trying to broker an end to hostilities in Gaza and Lebanon and bring home about 100 hostages believed to still be held in Gaza. VOA White House correspondent Anita Powell has the story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-shuttles-around-mideast-on-peace-quest/7838613.html	2024-10-24T20:00:28-07:00	
White House pushes for de-escalation in Mideast, warns North Korea for aiding Russia	The Biden administration continues to push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and de-escalation between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. In Europe, the administration has revealed intelligence that North Korean troops are being trained in Russia to help its war efforts. VOA White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara spoke with White House national security communications adviser John Kirby on the latest developments in the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: [U.S.] Secretary [of State] Antony Blinken today warned Israel against a protracted campaign in Lebanon. He warned Israel to avoid civilian casualties, not to endanger U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army. The only way Israel can do that is by operating a targeted campaign. Is it operating a targeted campaign? White House national security communications adviser John Kirby: We would like to see no civilian casualties and no damage to civilian infrastructure to the maximum extent possible. We have told the Israelis that we don't support near daily strikes in densely populated areas, and that's part of the message that [Blinken] delivered when he was there. We believe that there's still a diplomatic path to be found here to bring this conflict with Hezbollah and Lebanon to a close. That was one of the reasons that Secretary Blinken traveled there. VOA: Do you support Israeli demands for an expanded U.N. peacekeeping force to include north of the Litani River? Kirby: I'm not going to get into any specific proposals one way or the other. I don't think we're at that point right now. … What we support is de-escalation. What we support is minimization of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. We also continue to support Israel's right to defend itself. VOA: What about Israel's efforts to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure in Lebanon? How far can you accept the cost of that? Kirby: Look, they have done an extraordinary amount of work towards already dismantling Hezbollah's capability, including the killing of [Hassan Nasrallah], their leader. Hezbollah is not Hamas. They are in many ways superior in terms of military capability and resources. So, it's a different kind of a fight. It's a different kind of enemy that they face. And I would remind that even just in the last 24 hours, more than 100 rockets and drones [were] launched by Hezbollah towards Israeli citizens who are just trying to live their lives on that side of the Blue Line, as well. So, it remains a viable threat to the Israeli people, and we're going to continue to talk to the Israelis about how they go after that threat, because how they do that matters significantly. VOA: Ten days ago, the administration set a 30-day deadline for Israel to improve Palestinian access to aid. Can you update us on the progress? Kirby: There has been some progress, and as you heard Secretary Blinken say during his travels, more needs to be done. But there has been an increase of trucks flowing into North Gaza; specifically, the Erez Crossing is back open. We want to see more. VOA: Israel announced that Mossad chief David Barnea will meet with CIA Director Bill Burns and the Qatari prime minister in Doha. Is there anything about that meeting that you can tell us? Kirby: Without talking to the CIA director's travel or meetings, I won't do that. But you saw the prime minister already announced that there's another meeting in Doha of negotiators, and we're grateful to see this progress continue. We're grateful to see yet another meeting here, and we're hopeful that now, with Mr. Sinwar gone, Hamas might be more willing to sit down and negotiate in good faith and come up with a solution that gets a cease-fire of at least some duration, and gets those hostages home with their families where they belong, as well as to your earlier question, gives us a pause in the fighting that can help us all work towards a more dramatic increase in humanitarian assistance. I'm not suggesting that more can't be done now. Even while Gaza remains an active combat zone, more can be done, more should be done. But if you can end the fighting, then you can definitely make it easier to get humanitarian assistance. VOA: Does the administration see [Yahya Sinwar's brother] Mohamed Sinwar as somebody with influence on the negotiations? Kirby: I think it's unclear right now where the leadership of Hamas goes, and I would just say that we're watching this very, very closely, as you might imagine, monitoring it. Regardless of how Hamas tries to fill the vacuum left by Sinwar, they have an opportunity before them right now to help end this war, to get those hostages home and to do the right thing. VOA: Let's move on to North Korea and Russia. [Russian President] Vladimir Putin appears to have implicitly acknowledged what you laid out yesterday, that North Korean troops are in Russia to help their war efforts. How do you see this? Kirby: We see it the same way as we laid out yesterday. We know that there are at least several thousand North Korean soldiers in three military training bases in eastern Russia. Now, exactly what they're being trained to do, we don't know. Whether and how they'll be deployed in this war against Ukraine, we don't know that either. But it is a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that, I would remind you, Russia themselves signed up to. The procurement of arms and ammunition from North Korea is a violation of U.N. Security Council existing resolutions that Russia signed up to. We're going to watch this very, very closely. VOA: What is the geopolitical implication for Kim Jong Un now that he's willing to send his troops to die for Putin? Are you concerned that in return, Russia could help North Korea improve the reach of their ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles] to hit American cities, for example? Kirby: That's what we're watching closely to see. We don't know exactly what Mr. Kim thinks he's getting out of this arrangement. And it's worrisome. As you heard the secretary of defense say the other day, this potential move here by the North Koreans to put soldiers on the ground, literally skin in the game when it comes to fighting Ukraine, is not only going to have implications in Ukraine and on that battlefield, but it's going to have implications in the Indo-Pacific. What we don't know right now is exactly what that looks like. What does Kim think he's getting out of this? It is possible that there could be some provision by Russia to enhance and improve North Korean military capabilities? Again, that would just further destabilize a very tense region. VOA: You said these North Korean soldiers are legitimate military targets. But would you consider taking direct military action against them as the head of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Mike Turner, suggested? Kirby: The United States is not directly involved in combat operations in or around Ukraine. The president has been clear about that. We are providing Ukraine with the kinds of tools, capabilities and weapons that they need to defend themselves. And when we say they're legitimate military targets, these North Korean soldiers, we mean they would become legitimate military targets of the Ukrainian Armed Forces should they be involved in operations against Ukraine. VOA: China has said that they have no information on these North Korean troops. Do you believe them? Kirby: I'll let the Chinese speak to what they see or they don't see. What I said yesterday stands today. We're going to certainly be communicating with our PRC [People's Republic of China] counterparts about this. VOA: Last month you also confirmed that Iran transferred shipments of domestic missiles to Russia. Now we have these North Korean troops fighting for Russia. What is your assessment of this trilateral cooperation? Kirby: Number one, it certainly shows Mr. Putin's increasing desperation, and quite frankly, his weakness, that he has to reach out to the likes of Kim Jong Un and the supreme leader in Tehran for assistance to fight Ukraine. Clearly, he's under a lot of military pressure. We know he's losing 1,200 soldiers a day. He suffered more than 530,000 casualties in the time he's been fighting in Ukraine. So, he's clearly under pressure, and he's not ... being honest with the Russian people about what he's doing and what he's losing and how bloody and lethal this war has been on his own armed forces. Number two, I think it certainly speaks to worrisome defense relationships between these countries that are now growing and deepening. They're worrying not just because of what might be the effects in Ukraine, they're worrying because of what might be the effects in other parts of the world. You and I were just talking about what Kim Jong Un might be getting out of this. Let's talk about Iran, because Iran, certainly we know, is interested in advanced aviation capabilities, for instance, from Russia. Now, again, I don't know that we've seen it all consummated yet, but Iran being able to benefit from Russian military technology is also not good for the Middle East region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-pushes-for-de-escalation-in-mideast-warns-north-korea-for-aiding-russia/7838604.html	2024-10-24T19:23:49-07:00	
Ship owner, manager in US bridge collapse agree to pay $102M for cleanup	washington — The owner and manager of the cargo ship that caused the deadly Baltimore bridge collapse have agreed to pay more than $102 million in cleanup costs to settle a lawsuit brought by the Justice Department, officials said Thursday. The settlement does not cover any damages for rebuilding the bridge, officials said in a news release announcing the agreement. That construction project could cost close to $2 billion. The state of Maryland has filed its own claim seeking those damages, among others. The settlement comes a month after the Justice Department sued the ship's owner, Grace Ocean Private Ltd., and manager, Synergy Marine Group, both based in Singapore, seeking to recover funds from the cleanup. The Justice Department alleged that the electrical and mechanical systems on the ship, the Dali, were improperly maintained, causing it to lose power and veer off course before striking a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. The ship was leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. Six men on a road crew, who were filling potholes during an overnight shift, fell to their deaths. Cleanup crews worked around the clock searching for bodies and removing thousands of tons of mangled steel and smashed concrete from the bottom of the Patapsco River. The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with collapsed steel trusses draped across the ship's damaged bow. 'This resolution ensures that the costs of the federal government's cleanup efforts in the Fort McHenry Channel are borne by Grace Ocean and Synergy and not the American taxpayer,' Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said in a statement. The collapse snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore and put many local longshoremen out of work before the channel was fully opened in June. It interrupted East Coast shipping routes as the port is one of the busiest in the country, especially for cars and farm equipment. Grace Ocean and Synergy filed a court petition just days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case in history. Court records show attorneys for both parties said in a joint filing Thursday that they had reached a settlement agreement and requested dismissal of the Justice Department's claim, which sought $103 million in cleanup costs. The claim is one of many filed in an expansive liability case that will ultimately determine how much the ship's owner and manager will owe for their role in causing the disaster. The other claims are still unresolved. They've been filed on behalf of the victims' families, companies whose business has suffered as a result of the collapse, municipal entities and more.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ship-owner-manager-in-us-bridge-collapse-agree-to-pay-102m-for-cleanup-/7838589.html	2024-10-24T18:51:31-07:00	
Blinken shuttles around Mideast on peace quest	washington — Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with key negotiators Thursday during a frenetic four-day exercise in Middle East shuttle diplomacy that aims to relaunch talks to pull the grinding war in Gaza to a close. On Thursday, he announced $135 million in additional U.S. aid for Palestinian civilians. He also reiterated President Joe Biden's stance that the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week by Israeli forces was a reasonable stopping point to this brutal conflict sparked on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants stormed the Israeli border, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. 'Israel has accomplished the strategic goals that it set out for itself: making sure that October 7th and the horrors can never happen again by effectively dismantling the military organization of Hamas,' Blinken said, speaking from Doha, Qatar. 'It has succeeded in doing that and bringing to justice its leaders, those who perpetrated the horrors of October 7th, notably Sinwar,' he added. 'Now that that's been accomplished, this is a moment to work to end this war, to make sure all the hostages are home and to build a better future for people in Gaza.' Qatar's leader and top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who serves as both prime minister and foreign minister, appeared with Blinken. He said negotiators had reengaged with Hamas. But he went on to paint a murky picture of the future. 'Regarding our communication with Hamas and the leadership after Sinwar — yes, we reengaged with them,' he said. 'We've been in an engagement with representatives from the political office in Doha. We had some meetings with them the last couple of days. I believe that until now, there is no clarity what will be the way forward or the clear position.' Not much optimism Analysts aren't hopeful that this fire can be doused, especially after Israel began targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing its leader. The U.S. considers Hezbollah and Hamas terrorist organizations. 'To be entirely honest, it's not entirely clear why Tony Blinken is making another trip to the region,' said Gerald Feierstein, director of the Arabian Peninsula Affairs Program at the Middle East Institute. 'There doesn't seem to be any particular prospect that he's going to achieve anything new or different than the last 10 times that he's been out there,' he told VOA. A top U.S. Muslim rights advocacy group pointed to what he said were two stumbling blocks to a deal: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's top supporter, Biden. 'Mr. Netanyahu, for political and ideological reasons, has no interest in agreeing to a permanent cease-fire that frees all the hostages, pulls all Israeli troops out of Gaza and ends the war once and for all,' Edward Ahmed Mitchell, deputy director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told VOA. 'The only way to force him to do it is to withhold the weapons. So, I do not expect Mr. Blinken's trip to succeed without that missing element.' These delicate diplomatic moves are happening well over the heads of the people who have to live through this on both sides of this bristling border. On Thursday in central Gaza, at least 17 Palestinians — among them, children — were killed in an Israeli strike on a school where displaced people were taking shelter. And on Thursday in Jerusalem, hundreds of protesters marched to demand the release of Israeli hostages who were abducted on October 7, 2023.

G7 is finalizing $50B loan to Ukraine	A $50 billion loan to Ukraine from the G7 major industrialized nations is moving forward after months of negotiations, with countries announcing their contributions to the package this week. The loan package is aimed at providing Ukraine with an economic lifeline from $280 billion worth of Russian assets frozen since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. According to the plan, the loan will be repaid with interest accumulating on the frozen Russian assets rather than confiscating the frozen assets themselves. This 'creative' solution is intended to provide Ukraine with the economic assistance it urgently needs 'without burdening American taxpayers,' U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that 'these loans will support the people of Ukraine as they defend and rebuild their country. And our efforts make it clear: Tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause.' 'This will really support us,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement thanking allies for the decision. The United States will contribute $20 billion to the loan, while Canada and Britain announced contributions of $3.7 billion and $2.94 billion, respectively. The European Parliament on Tuesday approved a European Union decision to provide up to $38 billion as part of the loan. While the details of the loan are still being worked out, donors announced the funding will cover Ukraine’s economic and defense needs. U.S. deputy national security adviser Daleep Singh told reporters if the U.S. Congress approves the loan contribution, the Biden administration plans to allocate half of the $20 billion to support Ukraine’s economy and the other half for defense support. The United Kingdom's $2.94 billion is to be used solely for Ukraine’s military, British Defense Minister John Healey announced this week. 'With this decision, Ukraine is confident that it will have money to fully fund the critically important expenditures next year, including wages to teachers, doctors, pensions,' Roman Kachur, alternate executive director for Ukraine at the World Bank, told VOA. According to the International Monetary Fund, the loan is crucial if Ukraine is to meet its financing needs. 'We have talked with [the] Ukrainian government about the ways to close the financing gap, which has opened up because the war takes longer than everybody expected and therefore more budget financing will be needed,' Alfred Kammer, director of the IMF’s European Department, told VOA. The fund, which has a four-year program for Ukraine, expects the multiyear financing through the loan will help the country cover a financing gap that now exceeds $150 billion, Kammer added. Washington economist Anders Aslund called the loan plan 'excellent,' posting on X: 'Finally, Ukraine is about to get relevant financial support.' The G7 decision has been criticized for falling short of an outright seizure of the frozen Russian assets. 'I don’t think we should be celebrating this as Ukraine is not going to get the underlying $330bn,' economist Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management said in an email to VOA. Ash blamed 'the vested interests in Europe' for blocking a decision to seize the assets. The plan to divide funding from the loan between economic and military support worries some observers in Ukraine. 'Previously, the discussion was that the funding will go to fund economic stability. Now, we are under the impression that the funding will also be used for defense support,' Oleksandra Betliy, chief researcher at the Institute of Economic Research in Kyiv, told VOA. 'This is fine for the next year, where the budget deficit is $38 billion, but the issue is with the 2026 budget.' She added that Ukraine’s funding needs will remain high for years to come. 'Even if 2026 will be victorious, we will further need to fund the military for it to be strong, and social payments will be even higher than today,' she said. To ensure transparency and accountability, funding from the loan will be distributed via an intermediary fund set up by the World Bank, which according to Singh is 'subject to robust accountability and transparency measures.' Kachur agreed, saying the World Bank’s control over the funding will eliminate any perception of misuse. In addition, according to Ukrainian officials, the money will not be repurposed once it is in the World Bank’s fund. 'Even if there is a change in the political will, this funding will still remain available to Ukraine and will be transferred only to Ukraine,' Kachur said. The details of the loan package have not yet been finalized. G7 finance ministers plan to discuss the loan on the margins of this week’s annual IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-is-finalizing-50-billion-loan-to-ukraine/7838231.html	2024-10-24T16:56:27-07:00	
Putin tells BRICS leaders that Middle East on brink of full-scale war	kazan, russia — Russian President Vladimir Putin told BRICS leaders on Thursday that the Middle East was on the brink of a full-scale war after a sharp rise in tension between Israel and Iran, though the Kremlin chief also faced calls to end the war in Ukraine. The BRICS summit, attended by more than 20 leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan, has shown the depth of Russia's relations beyond the Western world. Much discussion at the summit in the Russian city of Kazan was dedicated to the war in Ukraine and the violence in the Middle East, though there were no sign that anything specific would be done to end either conflict. 'The degree of confrontation between Israel and Iran has sharply increased. All this resembles a chain reaction and puts the entire Middle East on the brink of a full-scale war,' Putin, sitting beside Chinese President Xi Jinping, said. Xi, speaking after Putin, said that China wanted a political settlement in Ukraine, and suggested joint efforts by Beijing and Brasilia offered the best chance of peace. 'We need to work for an early de-escalation of the situation and pave the way for a political settlement,' Xi said. On the Middle East, Xi said that there should be a comprehensive cease-fire in Gaza, a halt to the spread of war in Lebanon, and a return to the two-state solution under which states for both Israel and Palestine would be established. Flames of war Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian criticized international organizations, particularly the United Nations, for failing to end the conflict. 'The flames of war continue to rage in the Gaza Strip and cities of Lebanon, and international institutions, particularly the U.N. Security Council as a driver of international peace and security, lack the necessary effectiveness to extinguish the fire of this crisis,' Pezeshkian told the BRICS. Putin said that unless Palestinians got their state, they would feel the burden of 'historical injustice' and the region would remain in 'an atmosphere of permanent crisis with inevitable relapses of large-scale violence.' In their summit declaration, BRICS leaders called for the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state within the borders of 1967. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attended the summit. At one of the BRICS+ meetings on Thursday, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar sat in for Modi who also missed one of the group photographs. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he could not travel to Russia due to a head injury. China, which together with India buys about 90% of Russia's oil, supported more Global South countries joining the BRICS grouping in various formats, Xi said. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who was criticized by Kyiv for attending the meeting in Russia, said peace was needed in Gaza, Lebanon, Sudan and Ukraine. 'We need peace in Ukraine,' Guterres told the BRICS+ meeting that was chaired by Putin. 'A just peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and U.N. General Assembly resolutions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-tells-brics-leaders-that-middle-east-on-brink-of-full-scale-war/7838163.html	2024-10-24T15:04:28-07:00	
Iran's Pezeshkian slams UN failure to 'extinguish' regional crisis	Kazan, Russia — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Thursday condemned the 15-nation U.N. Security Council for failing to tackle the Middle East conflict. 'The fire of war is still raging in the Palestinian Gaza Strip and Lebanese cities,' Pezeshkian told leaders from emerging economies at the BRICS summit in Russia. 'And international institutions ... topped by the United Nations Security Council — who are drivers of international peace and security — lack the necessary efficiency to extinguish the fire of this crisis.' Pezeshkian condemned Israel for violating 'the red lines' of different states and 'producing a new wave of violence and terror.' Since the start of the war in Gaza, the Islamic republic has criticized the U.N. body for being inactive and ineffective in ending conflict in the Middle East. Iran is engaged in an intense diplomatic campaign to establish cease-fires in both Gaza and Lebanon. The efforts are also aimed at preventing the conflict from expanding across the region after Israel's threat to retaliate to an attack by Iran on October 1. Tehran said the attack was in response to Israeli strikes in Lebanon, which killed an Iranian general and the head of the Lebanese Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, late September. Iran supports Hezbollah and the Palestinian movement Hamas, whose militant groups are fighting Israel. 'Defeating its purpose' For his part, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Esmaeil Baghaei, turned to social media to criticize the U.N. for turning 'into a frustratingly dysfunctional platform.' He said the U.N. was 'sadly defeating its purpose' because the United States' 'unconditional support for [the] occupying regime' — Israel — 'has so emboldened the regime as to expand its aggressions and atrocities across the region,' he posted on social media platform X. The U.S. is one of the five permanent Security Council members with powers to block its decisions. Earlier in October, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi accused the United States of obstructing the Security Council over the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. '[The] inaction of the U.N. Security Council due to the obstruction of the United States [is] a disaster,' he said. Iran does not recognize the state of Israel and has made support for Palestinian cause one of the pillars of its foreign policy since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The Security Council is composed of five permanent members with veto powers - China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. — and 10 nonpermanent members elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. The current nonpermanent members are Algeria, Ecuador, Guyana, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia and Switzerland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-pezeshkian-slams-un-failure-to-extinguish-regional-crisis/7838162.html	2024-10-24T14:35:18-07:00	
Biden administration approves Nevada lithium mine	The U.S. Interior Department on Thursday gave final approval to ioneer's Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine in Nevada, the first domestic source of the battery metal to be permitted by President Joe Biden's administration and one that will become a key supplier to Ford and other electric vehicle manufacturers. Shares of the Australia-based critical minerals miner jumped more than 20% in New York trading on Thursday afternoon before easing down. The approval ends a more-than six-year review process during which regulators, ioneer and conservationists tussled over the fate of a rare flower found at the mine site, a tension that exposed the sometimes competing priorities between climate change mitigation efforts and biodiversity protection. The permit, which had been expected by the end of the year, comes amid a flurry of recent moves by Biden officials to support critical minerals production and offset China's market dominance. It also unlocks a $700 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, as well as a $490 million equity investment from Sibanye Stillwater to fund the project. 'This is a science-based decision,' Laura Daniel-Davis, the Interior Department's acting deputy secretary, told Reuters. 'We're trying to send a signal that there's no topic with greater importance than addressing climate change.' The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which is controlled by the Interior Department, on Thursday issued the Rhyolite Ridge project's record of decision — essentially the mine's permit — and said the project will 'include significant protections for the local ecosystem' and help create hundreds of jobs in the rural region. The project, roughly 362 kilometers north of Las Vegas, Nevada, contains enough lithium to power roughly 370,000 electric vehicles each year. Construction is slated to begin next year, with production commencing by 2028, a timeline that would make Rhyolite Ridge one of the largest U.S. lithium producers alongside Albemarle and Lithium Americas. The U.S. Geological Survey has labeled lithium a critical mineral vital for the U.S. economy and national security. 'We're proud to be the first U.S. lithium mine permitted by the Biden administration,' James Calaway, ioneer's chairman, told Reuters. The project will extract lithium as well as boron, a chemical used to make ceramics and soaps, from a clay-like deposit. The lithium will be processed on site into two main derivatives used to make batteries, and the company said it plans to recycle half of all the water used at the site, higher than the industry average. Ford and a joint venture between Toyota and Panasonic have agreed to buy lithium from the mine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-approves-nevada-lithium-mine-/7838129.html	2024-10-24T14:25:14-07:00	
Georgia’s parliamentary vote poses choice between West, East	Tbilisi, Georgia — With Georgia set to hold parliamentary elections Saturday, Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi’s main thoroughfare, was filled with buses and minibuses Wednesday evening, transporting supporters of the ruling Georgian Dream party from across the country. The rally drew an estimated 150,000 people, largely composed of regional government employees. Rally attendees interviewed by Voice of America’s Georgian Service echoed the ruling party's talking points, including the claim that Georgia is being dragged into the Russia-Ukraine war and the alleged influence of foreign agents on Georgian politics. 'I'm here because I want my homeland to survive,' said one government supporter. 'I came because I want this country to be led by a patriotic party, not by agents of America,' said another participant. 'America is now pushing an LGBT agenda — it's become a pseudo-liberal state,' said a third rally attendee, Omar, repeating rhetoric frequently heard from Georgian Dream. Opposition rally The pro-government rally followed an opposition demonstration held Sunday, when thousands were in the streets of Tbilisi for a 'European March' supporting closer ties with the West. Participants in that march told VOA they saw it as a way to resist a slide back under Russian influence for the country. 'For me, Georgia's European future is important — to be a democratic country, tolerant, free and advanced, with Western friends,' said Tiko Nadirashvili. 'This is the choice of the Georgian people.' 'I am here to show my friends that we are winning this, because the [ruling] Georgian Dream [party] already knows it’s losing,' another attendee told VOA. Georgia’s opposition is made up of four key forces. At the forefront is the United National Movement, or UNM, accompanied by its splinter group, the Coalition for Change. The other major players include the Strong Georgia coalition and For Georgia, led by former Georgian Dream Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia. The opposition’s electoral campaign has focused on the theme of European integration, warning against threats to Georgia’s Western aspirations. While it has highlighted economic issues, critics argue that its rhetoric often veers toward populism and lacks substantial policy proposals. For its part, Georgian Dream’s election campaign has framed its opponents inside Georgia and critics among Western governments as a 'global war party' conspiring to pull Georgia into the Russia-Ukraine conflict — a conspiracy theory crafted to exploit fears of another war. Russians remain Georgia, which has faced two conflicts with Russia since the 1990s, still lives with Russian troops occupying 20% of its territory. 'Georgian Dream relies on the narrative that without them, there will be Russian bombs and war, and that they are the only ones maintaining peace,' said Levan Ramishvili, a professor at Tbilisi's Free University. 'This perception of a weakened West fuels anti-liberal forces within countries like Georgia and elsewhere.' 'It's not disinformation that has caused these attitudes, but rather the yearslong war in Ukraine with no clear end in sight,' Ramishvili added. 'There's no clear vision from the West, be it from the Biden administration or the Republicans. 'This lack of clarity makes the perception of a weakened West more pervasive, with leaders like [Georgian Dream founder and former Prime Minister Bidzina] Ivanishvili confidently stating that they will simply endure, and the West will eventually cave.' Georgian Dream, seeking to hold on to power for a fourth term, has put up posters across the country juxtaposing images of war-torn Ukrainian cities with peaceful Georgian landscapes, accompanied by the slogans 'No to war' and 'Choose peace.' The implication is clear: A vote against Georgian Dream is a vote for war. 'Georgian Dream is trying to frame this election as a choice between war and peace, rather than between the West and Russia,' said Shota Utiashvili of the Rondeli Foundation, a Tbilisi think tank. 'The entire election campaign is centered around cultivating a culture of fear — fear of war, fear of difference, fear of modernization and fear of the West.' The ruling party's tactics also extend to cultural identity. Georgian Dream has enacted legislation targeting 'LGBT propaganda,' arguing that it protects Georgia's traditional values from Western influence. By aligning with the powerful Georgian Orthodox Church and conservative, pro-Russian groups, the government positions itself as the defender of tradition. 'Georgian Dream has essentially replicated Russia’s homophobic legislation — not only copied its content, but also deployed similar propaganda tactics to sway conservative voters and influence election outcomes,' said Giorgi Tabagari, a gay rights activist. 'None of the issues addressed in the legislation reflect the actual priorities of Georgian voters,' he added. 'Some of the homophobic narratives that Georgian Dream has been using throughout the election campaign are rather out of touch with Georgian reality and mirror cultural debates in the West without any local context.' Critics compare Georgian Dream's tactics to those of the Kremlin. Earlier this year, Georgian Dream passed a controversial 'foreign agent' law, requiring nongovernmental organizations and media outlets receiving foreign funding to register as 'agents of foreign influence.' Critics say this law mirrors Russian tactics to suppress dissent and bring civil society under tighter government control. The law’s passage sparked mass protests, which were met by government crackdowns, which drew Western condemnation and U.S. sanctions on several Georgian officials. 'There has been a surge in anti-Western and Euroskeptic narratives, which were previously spread by anonymous actors but are now being openly promoted by the ruling party,' said Nino Dolidze, who heads the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy, or ISFED, a Georgian NGO. 'At the same time, we are witnessing a broader anti-Western narrative, accompanied by increased interference from Russia in Georgia's information space,' she said. 'This includes public statements from Russian leaders and coordinated disinformation efforts on social networks, driven by Russian accounts, trolls and bots.' Voter fears According to Dolidze, the parliamentary election campaign has been marred by allegations of voter intimidation, vote-buying and misuse of state resources. Georgian Dream proxies reportedly have threatened legal consequences for those who vote for the opposition. Many Georgians, particularly those in rural areas reliant on public sector jobs or social assistance, fear losing their livelihoods if they don’t back the ruling party. 'They are telling us that they are frightened and afraid of losing income. Of course, it is creating problems in terms of a free vote, as you can imagine how it affects the free will of voters,' Dolidze said. Speaking with VOA at Wednesday’s pro-government rally in Tbilisi, Archil Talakvadze, a member of the Georgian Dream faction in the country’s parliament, said that, given Russia’s occupation of the breakaway Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the Georgian people 'have done their utmost to support Ukraine' and 'stand firmly in favor of genuine peace.' Georgia’s opposition, he said, 'lacks faith' in winning through democratic elections, 'leading them to discredit the electoral process and use any opportunity to destabilize the country.' 'We will not allow any risks that could drag Georgia into another war, where our soldiers and civilians could lose their lives in an unequal fight,' Talakvadze told VOA. 'Instead, we will protect the future of our country through peace, security and European integration.' While Georgian Dream promotes itself as the only guarantor of peace, the opposition argues that a Georgian Dream election win would be a victory for Russia, and it insists the ruling party will not prevail. 'Georgian Dream will not be able to subvert the voice of Georgian people at the ballot box through false constructs on war and peace that are based entirely on Russian propaganda narratives,' Tina Bokuchava, head of the United National Movement party, told VOA. The opposition, however, remains disconnected from voters. Polls show that 61% of Georgians feel none of the existing political parties represent them, and 72% want new political actors. Still, many observers say Georgians see the election as a chance to vote against the ruling party, not for the opposition. 'In reality, [if it loses] Georgian Dream will defeat themselves; it won't be the opposition that brings them down,' said Ramishvili of Tbilisi's Free University. 'Georgian Dream will commit political suicide, because in Georgia, anti-Russian sentiment is a part of our national identity, along with European and pro-Western views. As a result, when Georgian Dream openly launched an anti-Western campaign, they lost the support of voters who want both peace and Europe.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-s-parliamentary-vote-poses-choice-between-west-east/7838136.html	2024-10-24T14:23:12-07:00	
More than 10,000 Haitians flee gang attacks in past week, UN says	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — More than 10,000 people in Haiti have been internally displaced in the last week as armed gangs operating in and around the capital, Port-au-Prince, ramp up attacks on areas they do not yet control, according to U.N. migration agency estimates on Thursday. The agency had said at the start of September that more than 700,000 people were internally displaced across the Caribbean nation, nearly double the figure six months earlier. Gangs have in the last week been ramping up attacks on a number of towns outside the capital, where much of the city and its suburbs are under the control of various violent armed groups united under a common alliance known as Viv Ansanm. The conflict is fueling famine-level hunger in parts of the population as gangs take over farmlands and block off transport routes, while people forced to flee their homes — often to host families or makeshift camps — can no longer depend on steady income to afford food. While the United Nations authorized an international force to help Haiti's police take back control from the gangs, the mission has been poorly resourced and has produced scant results. Haiti's leadership has requested the force be converted to a formal peacekeeping mission to shore up resources, an initiative that was blocked last month by China and Russia. Gangs who previously targeted national police, civilian self-defense groups and state infrastructure also have begun targeting foreign vehicles. The U.S. Embassy in Haiti told Reuters that on Monday two of its armored vehicles had been targeted by gang gunfire. One was hit by multiple rounds, although no one was hurt or injured. A U.N. helicopter with 18 people on board was also shot at and hit with multiple rounds on Thursday, although no one was injured, the Miami Herald reported. The U.N.'s Haiti office did not immediately respond to a request for more information.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-10-000-haitians-flee-gang-attacks-in-past-week-un-says/7838133.html	2024-10-24T14:10:23-07:00	
How Afghan, Pakistani clerics battle polio vaccine misinformation	Maulana Tayyab Qureshi, the top cleric in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, has seen up close the devastating effects of polio. Two of his own kin were once paralyzed, victims of a scourge that has been vanquished worldwide yet refuses to go away from Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. 'Had their parents not neglected [to have their children vaccinated], their children wouldn’t be disabled today,' Qureshi said of his relatives. As the chief khateeb, or Friday prayer leader, of the northwestern province, Qureshi preaches this message at every opportunity — Friday sermons at his 17th century Mahabat Khan Mosque in Peshawar, Eid prayers when upward of 40,000 people congregate, meetings with village elders. 'I’m very clear cut: I tell them, it’s free. It doesn’t cost you anything. Why don’t you take it seriously?' Qureshi said in an interview with VOA. Qureshi is not the only Pakistani cleric advocating vaccination. Several renowned scholars have issued decrees in its support, with a notable shift in attitudes. Vaccine hesitancy, an intractable obstacle to eradicating polio, has waned, he said. A once infamous bastion of vaccine resistance outside Peshawar has now embraced immunization. 'The fatwas have had a great impact,' Qureshi said. Yet, as Pakistan and Afghanistan seek to eradicate polio, misinformation remains a key hurdle. While immunization rates are generally high in both countries, pockets of resistance persist along the border, jeopardizing eradication efforts. To counter vaccine misinformation, public health officials increasingly have turned to influential clerics like Qureshi. As the trusted voices within their communities, these religious leaders play a crucial role in dispelling harmful myths and misconceptions about vaccines, experts say. 'The best way to fight through this is empowering trusted voices in communities to push back on it and provide real information,' said Kai Ruggeri, a Columbia University health policy professor who has written about vaccine disinformation. The stakes are high. Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only countries where polio remains endemic. And as World Polio Day arrives this year, there are renewed concerns over their ability to eliminate the disease. The neighboring countries were once on the brink of going polio-free. But persistent insecurity coupled with cross-border movements has fueled a resurgence. Pakistan has recorded 40 cases and Afghanistan at least 20, this year. This marks a significant increase from the six cases each reported last year. A setback came last month when more than 1 million Pakistani children missed vaccinations, and Afghanistan’s Taliban briefly suspended immunization campaigns. Oliver Rosenbauer, a spokesman for WHO’s polio eradication program in Geneva, noted that misinformation is not the only obstacle to eliminating polio; a lack of infrastructure, insecurity and population density also contribute. 'The important point is the polio virus doesn't care why a child is not vaccinated,' Rosenbauer said in an interview. 'It’s very, very good at finding that unvaccinated child.' Polio, a crippling disease that can lead to paralysis and death, has long been eradicated globally thanks to universal immunization efforts. For most people around the world, polio is a distant memory or even a relic of history. But in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the disease remains a stark reality despite significant progress in recent decades. Its scars are visible to those who look, Rosenbauer said. 'It’s a disease that parents still see,' he said. 'If you walk around Karachi or Kabul, you’ll still see people with polio on the streets.' This 'respect for the disease' explains why vaccine hesitancy remains around 1.5% in Afghanistan and Pakistan, significantly lower than many Western countries. Yet in densely populated areas, such as the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan, lingering resistance can prevent efforts to eradicate the virus. Leading the charge against the vaccine, militants on both sides of the border have waged violent attacks on polio workers and their escorts. Their claim that the vaccine program violates Islamic law and is used for surveillance has fueled resistance. Hundreds have been killed in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. In January, at least five policemen were killed and more than a dozen injured in a major attack on polio teams and security personnel in northwestern Pakistan. According to the Emergency Operations Center in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, militants have carried out 21 attacks against polio teams and security escorts in Pakistan this year. Mainstream clerics have pushed back. In 2019, prominent Islamic scholars from Afghanistan and Pakistan declared the polio vaccine safe and Sharia-compliant. They stressed the 'moral duty' of parents to have their children vaccinated. In 2022, the al-Azhar University, the Sunni Muslim world’s most prestigious institution of religious education, warned against decrees banning the polio vaccine in Pakistan. Last month, nearly 200 renowned religious scholars in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa declared support for polio vaccination. Qureshi, the chief khateeb of KP, was among them. The scholars 'took a strong stand not only regarding the polio vaccine but all health measures by the ministry of health,' Qureshi said. Across the border, Taliban health officials are waging their own campaign against vaccine misinformation even as attacks on health workers, often claimed by ISIS, have persisted. Ehsanul Haq Hanafi, a cleric and senior official in the health ministry, understands the clergy’s influence in Afghan society. 'People listen to the ulema and accept what they say,' Hanafi said in an interview with VOA. Among the myriad misconceptions about the vaccine, he said, some Afghans believe it corrupts morals or causes sterility. Others think it can accelerate puberty, he said. 'This is unscientific and baseless disinformation,' he said. To combat this, Hanafi travels around the country to meet with locals and mullahs to convince the skeptics. While some clerics remain opposed, most accept the vaccine once its benefits are explained, he said. 'We can’t convince 100% of the people, but 80% agree with us and have their children vaccinated,' Hanafi said. VOA’s Ihsan M. Khan contributed to this article.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-afghan-and-pakistani-clerics-are-battling-polio-vaccine-misinformation-/7838106.html	2024-10-24T13:40:46-07:00	
Nigeria drops charges against U.S. executive in money laundering case	Nigeria has released on humanitarian grounds an American citizen held for the past eight months on cryptocurrency money laundering accusations. 'I am pleased that American citizen and former U.S. law enforcement official Tigran Gambaryan has been released on humanitarian grounds by the Nigerian Government and is on his way back to the United States so that he can receive needed medical attention,' U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. 'I am grateful to my Nigerian colleagues and partners for the productive discussions that have resulted in this step and look forward to working closely with them on the many areas of cooperation and collaboration critical to the bilateral partnership between our two countries.' Gambaryan was the chief compliance officer for Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. Nigeria accused Gambaryan and Binance of using Binance's platform to launder as much as $35 million, something Gambaryan and Binance have denied. Earlier this week, a prosecuting lawyer with Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission told Nigeria's Federal High Court that the government was ending the case against Gambaryan after 'taking into consideration some critical international and diplomatic reasons.' Gambaryan's health declined in the months following his arrest. Reuters reports that his wife, Yuki, was concerned that his deteriorating condition could 'leave permanent damage and affect his ability to walk.' Binance is facing additional charges, including suspicion of tax evasion and operating without a license. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-drops-charges-against-american-executive-in-money-laundering-scheme-/7838057.html	2024-10-24T13:11:14-07:00

Moldovan president says bribery affected election, pledges run-off vote	CHISINAU, Moldova — Moldova's pro-European president said on Thursday that mass bribery had affected a presidential election and a referendum on joining the European Union. However, Maia Sandu vowed to press on with a Nov. 3 runoff vote to win a second term, instead of ordering a new election. Sandu issued her pledge, saying it was up to the people to determine Moldova's future, after police said pro-Russian fugitive businessman Ilan Shor had channeled $39 million to voters in September and October. Moldovan authorities have said the campaign for last Sunday's dual poll was overshadowed by a massive Russia-linked election-meddling scheme aimed at defeating the pro-Europe side. 'Without the buying of votes, the outcome today would have been different. We would have had a convincing victory in the presidential election and the referendum!' Sandu wrote on social media. She said she had rejected suggestions of ordering a rerun of the ex-Soviet republic's election as 'no one has the right to deny our citizens a mass, sincere and free expression of their will.' 'Let's go forward to the second round. We count strictly on our people as has always been the case when the fate of the country was on the line,' she said. It was up to the judiciary to 'wake up' and tackle the issue of bribery, she added. Sandu came in first in the presidential election but failed to secure 50% of votes and now faces a runoff against former prosecutor-general Alexandr Stoianoglo, who is backed by a traditionally pro-Russian party. Sandu has singled out Russia as one of the biggest threats facing Moldova and made EU integration the cornerstone of her administration. In the referendum, a surprisingly slim majority compared with opinion polls, 50.46% of voters, supported EU accession. The police have accused Shor of an attempt to bribe 130,000 voters. He denies wrongdoing, and the Kremlin has denied interfering. It questioned the vote count, in which votes from Moldovans abroad pushed the 'yes' vote over 50%. Moldova's police chief, Viorel Cernauteanu, told a briefing on Thursday that Shor used Russia's Promsvyazbank to transfer $24 million in October, in addition to $15 million channeled in September, to pay off voters. During the campaign, Shor openly offered to pay Moldovans to persuade others to vote 'no' in the referendum and to support a specific candidate, who he did not name publicly. He launched a bot on the Telegram messaging platform for this means. Cernauteanu said the police had blocked 97 chatbots before the vote explaining to people how to use the Promsvyazbank banking app and get the money. On Monday, Sandu called the campaign 'an unfair fight' and claimed victory in the referendum designed to enshrine Moldova's EU path in the constitution. She said there was 'clear evidence' that criminal groups backed by 'foreign forces hostile to our national interests' had aimed to buy off 300,000 votes. Moscow has denounced the vote as not free. On Wednesday, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the United States and European Union had meddled in the campaign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovan-president-says-bribery-affected-election-pledges-run-off-vote/7838005.html	2024-10-24T12:16:21-07:00	
Fewer Americans trust the news; the question is why	Polls show that Americans’ trust in news reporting is at an all-time low. And while the decline has many causes, it reflects both the changing media landscape and the values of media consumers. Nearly 250 years since the principle was enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, a majority of Americans still agree that a free press is crucial to a democratic society, according to polling by the Pew Research Center. But how they feel about the existing press is a different matter. The same polls show that only one-third of Americans believes the country’s media report the news objectively. And a September Gallup poll reveals that Americans’ overall trust in mass media has declined to an all-time low of 32%. Much of the narrative around declining faith in media has been shaped by political partisanship. The last time that America saw such low levels of media confidence was in 2016, when Donald Trump amplified longstanding conservative complaints about liberal media bias by attacking critical coverage of his presidential campaign as 'fake news.' Accordingly, self-identified Republicans report less trust in media, reaching a low of 11% compared with 58% for Democrats. However, partisan trends don’t capture the whole picture. While partisan divergence in media confidence significantly widened during the presidency of Republican George W. Bush, overall trust in media institutions has been declining for supporters of both parties as well as independents since Gallup first began tracking it in the 1970s. The rise of partisan cable news networks in the 1990s and digital news, along with social media in the 2000s, has reflected and exacerbated this trend. And dissatisfaction with perceived bias in coverage of conflicts such as the Iraq War or Israel's invasion of Gaza has also reduced trust in traditional news sources among left-leaning Americans, often driving them toward unreliable alternative sources. As Americans lose trust in traditional media, they also engage less with it. While over half of adults in the U.S. now report getting their news from social media, audiences and advertising revenue have shrunk when it comes to newspapers and TV news. In fact, part of the story behind declining trust in media is Americans across the political spectrum becoming less interested in news overall. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are experiencing news fatigue while 38% report that they follow the news closely, compared with 51% in 2016. Do Americans want independent journalism? The simultaneous loss of trust and interest in news media has raised questions beyond simple accusations of partisan bias. While criticism of the media often focuses on whether the core principles of independent journalism are being upheld, the principles themselves may not be popular. A recent study by the Media Insight Project found that common journalistic values such as amplifying marginalized voices, holding power to account or increasing public transparency do not enjoy majority support. In fact, such values may not be as integral to journalism as is commonly believed. As Columbia University journalism professor Michael Schudson writes, the modern idea of journalism as an independent investigative force and a check on government power has been a fairly recent development. And amid today’s rapid social, political and technological changes, the role that people expect journalism to play in society may once again be shifting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fewer-americans-trust-the-news-the-question-is-why/7837953.html	2024-10-24T11:45:15-07:00	
Zambian president fires 3 constitutional court judges	LUSAKA, ZAMBIA — Critics are accusing Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema of interference after he fired three constitutional court judges on Sunday over a 2016 ruling that favored a political opponent. Hichilema fired the judges on the recommendation of a judicial commission that enforces a code of conduct for judges. Hichilema alleged that the judges engaged in misconduct over a ruling they made when he was opposition leader in 2016. Back then, Hichilema had run for president but lost to a sworn rival, Edgar Lungu. Hichilema contested the outcome. Judges Mungeni Mulenga, Palan Musonda and Annie Sitali rejected the legal challenge. The now-dismissed judges also issued a ruling allowing Lungu to run again in 2021, despite his having served twice as president. Lungu was president from 2015 to 2016, then served a full term from 2016 to 2021. Zambian presidents are limited to serving two five-year terms. The decision to fire the judges sparked controversy as it comes ahead of the 2026 general elections. Hichilema and Lungu are expected to face each other for a fourth time. Laura Miti, a human rights activist and political commentator, told VOA the president’s decision to fire the judges raises questions as to why he waited until now to act. Miti said disciplinary action should have been taken much earlier to avoid accusations of interference in the judicial system. 'The position people are taking depends on their political leanings,' she said. 'There are those who say it’s legal, the president has not broken any rules or any laws in firing these judges. 'On the other hand, there are those like myself who feel that because he is the person against whom this judgment went, using executive powers for what is [his] personal interest, is problematic,' Miti said. During an interview with the state broadcaster, former Zambian Vice President Nevers Mumba defended the dismissals of the constitutional court judges. 'None of us is exempted from scrutiny, and if we see that some people have questions that they must answer, I think that the president has the responsibility to release that information,' Mumba said. But Makebi Zulu, who is Lungu‘s lawyer, condemned the firing of the judges, describing it as illegal. 'The executive cannot be seen to be wanting to correct judgments of the courts,' Zulu said. 'They have no such jurisdiction because our legal system is created in such a way that there has to be consistency in the decisions that are being made. Decisions have to be consistent for the purposes of inspiring hope, inspiring trust in our judicial system.' In an interview with VOA, presidential aide Clayson Hamasaka defended the dismissal of the judges, citing constitutional powers granted to the president. The judges have not yet commented on the matter publicly. Zambia‘s chief government spokesperson, Cornelius Mweetwa, told VOA that while the judiciary in Zambia enjoys a measure of independence, such autonomy comes with limits. 'The president is acting within the precincts of the law because the constitution provides that upon recommendation from the Judicial Complaints Commission, the president shall remove the judges,' he said. 'That is exactly what he has done. It is upholding the rule of law and nothing to do with undermining judicial independence.' Zambia's Judicial Complaints Commission enforces the code of conduct for judges. Under Zambia's constitution, all judges, including the chief justice, are appointed by the president upon the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission and with the approval of the National Assembly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zambian-president-fires-3-constitutional-court-judges/7837785.html	2024-10-24T10:04:19-07:00

US military, intelligence agencies ordered to embrace AI	washington — The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have new marching orders — to more quickly embrace and deploy artificial intelligence as a matter of national security. U.S. President Joe Biden signed the directive, part of a new national security memorandum, on Thursday. The goal is to make sure the United States remains a leader in AI technology while also aiming to prevent the country from falling victim to AI tools wielded by adversaries like China. The memo, which calls AI 'an era-defining technology' also lays out guidelines that the White House says are designed to prevent the use of AI to harm civil liberties or human rights. The new rules will 'ensure that our national security agencies are adopting these technologies in ways that align with our values,' a senior administration official told reporters, speaking about the memo on the condition of anonymity before its official release. The official added that a failure to more quickly adopt AI 'could put us at risk of a strategic surprise by our rivals.' 'Because countries like China recognize similar opportunities to modernize and revolutionize their own military and intelligence capabilities using artificial intelligence, it's particularly imperative that we accelerate our national security community's adoption and use of cutting-edge AI,' the official said. The new guidelines build on an executive order issued last year, which directed all U.S. government agencies to craft policies for how they intend to use AI. They also seek to address issues that could hamper Washington’s ability to more quickly incorporate AI into national security systems. Provisions outlined in the memo call for a range of actions to protect the supply chains the produce advanced computer chips that are critical for AI systems. It also calls for additional actions to combat economic espionage that would allow U.S. adversaries or non-U.S. companies from stealing critical innovations. 'We have to get this right, because there is probably no other technology that will be more critical to our national security in the years ahead,' said White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, addressing an audience at the National Defense University in Washington on Thursday. 'The stakes are high,' he said. 'If we don't act more intentionally to seize our advantages, if we don't deploy AI more quickly and more comprehensively to strengthen our national security, we risk squandering our hard-earned lead. 'We could have the best team but lose because we didn't put it on the field,' he added. Although the memo prioritizes the implementation of AI technologies to safeguard U.S. interests, it also directs officials to work with allies and others to create a stable framework for use of AI technologies across the globe. 'A big part of the national security memorandum is actually setting out some basic principles,' Sullivan said, citing ongoing talks with the G-7 and AI-related resolutions at the United Nations. 'We need to ensure that people around the world are able to seize the benefits and mitigate the risks,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-intelligence-agencies-ordered-to-embrace-ai-/7837756.html	2024-10-24T09:40:15-07:00	
Blinken announces $135 million in additional US aid for Palestinians	WASHINGTON — In a latest diplomatic push to end the conflicts in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that negotiators will meet 'in the coming days.' He also announced $135 million in additional U.S. aid for Palestinian civilians. 'In referring to negotiators coming back together, that was referring specifically to negotiations on the return of hostages and a cease-fire for Gaza, and that is the entire focus of their work. Separate from that is work that we're doing, also very intensely, on Lebanon to reach a diplomatic resolution,' Blinken said during a press conference in Doha alongside Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. The United States is in discussions with regional counterparts on a plan that allows Israel to withdraw from Gaza, ensures that Hamas cannot reconstitute and supports the Palestinian people in governing, securing and rebuilding Gaza. More humanitarian aid 'Today, we're announcing an additional $135 million in humanitarian assistance, water, sanitation, maternal health for Palestinians in Gaza, in the West Bank, as well as in the region,' Blinken said. He emphasized the urgency of addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, noting the extraordinary challenges faced daily by people there. 'That's all the more urgent with winter approaching,' Blinken said. This announcement brings total U.S. humanitarian aid to more than $1.2 billion since Oct. 7 of last year. Meanwhile, France hosted an international conference Thursday in Paris to raise funds to help those affected by the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. France announced a pledge of $108 million, while Germany said it is contributing $103 million for aid in Lebanon. Cease-fire talks It remains unclear whether Hamas is prepared to engage in the upcoming cease-fire talks after the death of its leader, Yahya Sinwar. Al Thani told reporters, 'We are closely coordinated with Egypt on any kind of initiatives that will emerge on the table. Today, there [is] an ongoing discussion between Egypt and Hamas. We hope that these discussions will yield to something positive. And the discussion that will come afterward, it will be a follow-up for that.' Al Thani added that U.S. negotiators will meet soon with Israeli counterparts in Doha to attempt a breakthrough. After holding talks in Israel and Saudi Arabia this week, Blinken met Thursday with Al Thani ahead of discussions with Arab officials on Friday in London. Earlier this week, a report by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development painted a grim picture of the economic impact of the Israeli military operation in Gaza from October 2023 to May 2024. The report said that even if the war were to end tomorrow and Gaza returned to its preconflict conditions, it could still take 350 years for Gaza's devastated economy to recover to its already-fragile prewar state. ‘Generals’ Plan’ On Thursday, Blinken renewed the United States' opposition to any Israeli reoccupation of post-war Gaza and 'fully and fundamentally' rejected the so-called Generals’ Plan, a proposal by retired Israeli generals allegedly aimed at blocking humanitarian aid to northern Gaza to starve out Hamas terrorists. Blinken also said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured him during their meetings that this is not the policy of the Israeli government. 'The government of Israel says that it is not the policy of Israel,' Blinken told reporters. In a video message to the Paris aid conference, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate cease-fire and urged meaningful steps toward full implementation of Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701, which call for the long-term disarmament of Hezbollah and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. Guterres noted that more than 1.2 million people have been displaced or affected in Lebanon. 'I call on Lebanon's leaders to take resolute steps toward ensuring fully functional state institutions to address the country's pressing political and security challenges,' Guterres said. On the battlefields Israel’s military said Thursday it conducted a new round of airstrikes against Hezbollah weapons production sites in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanon’s military said three of its soldiers were killed in an Israeli strike while they were conducting a rescue operation near the village of Yater in southern Lebanon. Israel has said its fight is with Iran-backed Hezbollah, not Lebanon, in a conflict that has raised fears of wider regional hostilities. Medics in Gaza said an Israeli strike hit a school that was being used as a shelter in Nuseirat, killing at least 16 people. On another front Thursday, Syria’s Defense Ministry said Israeli airstrikes hit Damascus, killing at least one soldier and injuring seven other people. Israel rarely comments on strikes against targets in Syria, but it has hit Iran-linked targets there for years as part of a campaign to halt weapons transfers to Hezbollah and disrupt Iranian proxies. The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on southern Israel, during which the militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 people as hostages. Hamas is still holding about 100 hostages, with a third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 42,847 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, with Israel saying that the death toll includes several thousand Hamas militants. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations.

Paris donors conference raises millions in humanitarian aid for Lebanon	Paris — A Lebanon donors’ conference in Paris on Thursday has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for the war-battered country — but ending the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah that has devastated the country seems unlikely anytime soon. The pledges rolled in at the Paris conference. Early on, both Germany and France earmarked around $100 million apiece for Lebanon. The funds will support humanitarian aid in the country, where fighting sparked by Hezbollah’s rocket attacks on Israel has killed hundreds and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Conference host, French President Emmanuel Macron, said families need shelter, children need nourishment and schooling, the wounded need care. Solutions must be found quickly, he said, especially to avoid further population displacements, which could create new divisions in the country. Acting Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati wanted more. 'What we as Lebanese expect from the international community is the following: solidarity and cease-fire,' he said. 'Lebanon calls on the international community to come together and support efforts that will end the ongoing aggressions and enforce an immediate cease-fire.' But experts doubt there will be a swift ending to the conflict. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken did not attend the Paris conference. He was in the Middle East, although Washington sent a lower-level delegation. Israel and Iran were not invited. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu earlier warned that Lebanon could descend into civil war. But analyst Antoine Basbous told Europe 1 radio that the more likely scenario was Lebanon descending into chaos. Former colonial power France hopes parties in Lebanon will move on electing a new president, after a two-year power gap. The Paris meeting additionally aimed to find ways to support the Lebanese army and the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country, which includes a large number of European troops. Both the army and the peacekeeping mission say they have come under attack by Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paris-donors-conference-raises-millions-in-humanitarian-aid-for-lebanon/7837715.html	2024-10-24T09:23:36-07:00	
US targets Sudan weapons procurement director with sanctions	Washington — The United States imposed sanctions on Thursday against Mirghani Idris Suleiman, a leading figure in the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) efforts to get weapons for the war against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the Treasury Department said in a statement. As director of Defense Industries Systems (DIS), the Sudanese army's primary weapons procurement arm, 'Idris has been at the center of weapons deals that have fueled the brutality and scale of the war,' the statement said. 'Today’s action underscores the essential role that key individuals like Mirghani Idris Suleiman have played in procuring weapons, perpetuating violence, and prolonging the fighting in Sudan,' said Bradley Smith, acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. DIS was sanctioned last year by Treasury. Sudan's army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The RSF has seized control of large parts of Sudan in a conflict with the army that the United Nations says has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The war has displaced more than 10 million people, driven parts of the country to extreme hunger or famine, and drawn in foreign powers that have given both sides material support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-targets-sudan-weapons-procurement-director-with-sanctions/7837682.html	2024-10-24T09:02:14-07:00	
Africa Football Business Summit explores strategies to boost sports development	Nairobi, Kenya — Kenya is hosting the Africa Football Business Summit to boost football and sports development across the continent. The summit focuses on ways African countries can benefit from the game’s ever-increasing popularity. The meeting comes as East African nations prepare to host the African Cup of Nations in 2027, while Morocco will co-host the 2030 World Cup. In recent international football tournaments, African teams have enjoyed unprecedented success. At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, an African team, Morocco, reached the semi-final for the first time. Experts attribute that success not only to talent and hard work but also to significant investment at the community level to nurture talent and produce more quality players. The Football Foundation for Africa, an organization that promotes investment in the sport, has brought together government officials, league representatives, and experts from Europe and Brazil to help Africa grow its football programs and reaping the benefits of the sport’s popularity. The founder, Brian Wesaala, told the gathering that Africa needs to take the game seriously since it can lead to economic prosperity. 'It’s high time football started to make social and economic sense, especially for the African continent,' he said. 'We keep boosting our talent, we keep boosting our youth but when we look at football as an industry, do we really have an agenda as Africa? It's high time that we took up ownership of these conversations and made it ours in order for us to progress as a continent.' The chairperson of the foundation, Mohamed Shidiye, said there is a need to bring the game closer to communities. He believes it can keep children on the right path. 'We are trying to connect the dots in the entire globe to make sure that youth, wherever they are, are able to play football, pull them out of drug menace and make them mentally and physically fit, so that they become a very responsible citizen,' he said. Speaking this week at a meeting of the Confederation of African Football, or CAF, in Ethiopia, the president of world football governing body FIFA called on African countries to invest in young talent. Giovanni Vincenzo Infantino said he wants to see African teams win international tournaments. Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda are set to host the African Cup of Nations in 2027, and government officials and stakeholders have been conducting a series of meetings to attract investors and learn how they can win financially from the tournament in the long term. The chief commercial officer of the Uganda Premier League, Jovin Matovu, says East African countries will work to maximize revenue sources such as ticket sales, broadcast media deals and commercial sponsorships. 'We’ve got an opportunity as East Africa to host the biggest football competition in the region,' he said. 'It's time to justify to the investors if you put this much here, this is what you are getting in return. We are preparing the fans, our clubs, the media, the corporate companies for the entire value chain to see where to invest and how to get a return that can be sustained.' In six years, Morocco co-hosts the World Cup along with Portugal and Spain. Football authorities there hope not only for a repeat of the on-field success seen in 2022, but also the financial benefits that can come from hosting the world’s most popular sporting event.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-football-business-summit-explores-strategies-to-boost-sports-development/7837666.html	2024-10-24T08:48:47-07:00	
Canada slashes immigration as public concern rises	Ottawa — Canada said Thursday it was significantly curbing immigration targets in an effort to 'pause population growth,' a shift that comes as public support for immigration declines. The announcement comes after the Canadian population surged to 41 million, a rise largely fueled by an unprecedented wave of new arrivals. The immigration ministry had previously planned to let 500,000 new permanent residents settle in the country in 2025 and 2026. But the new targets were revised down to 395,000 next year and 380,000 for 2026. It set the 2027 target at 365,000. The immigration ministry said the plan's goal was to 'pause population growth in the short term to achieve well-managed, sustainable growth in the long term.' 'While it's clear our economy needs newcomers, we see the pressures facing our country, and we must adapt our policies accordingly,' Immigration Minister Marc Miller said in the statement. The ministry said the plan also aims to ease pressure on housing, with Canadians consistently ranking the cost of renting or owning a home as a top concern. The ministry credited an immigration surge with helping the Canadian economy emerge from the COVID pandemic without entering a recession. A survey last month from the Environics Institute on public attitudes toward immigration found that 'for the first time in a quarter century, a clear majority of Canadians say there is too much immigration.' Fifty-eight percent of Canadians believe the country takes in too many immigrants, up 14 percentage points from 2023, the survey found.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-slashes-immigration-as-public-concern-rises-/7837667.html	2024-10-24T08:42:04-07:00	
Ruling party candidate wins presidential vote in Mozambique	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Mozambique's ruling party candidate, Daniel Chapo, was declared the winner of the country's presidential election Thursday amid claims of rigging by the opposition. According to the national election commission, Chapo won 70.7% of the national vote, followed by independent candidate Venancio Mondlane with 20.2%. The candidate of the opposition party Renamo, Ossufo Momade, came third with 5.8%. The results of the October 9 election mean the governing Front for the Liberation of Mozambique party, or Frelimo, has extended its 49 years in power since the southern African country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. It then fought a bloody 15-year civil war against rebel group Renamo, which later became the main opposition party and contested this election. Frelimo has often been accused of rigging elections, which it has consistently denied. Current President Filipe Nyusi of Frelimo is stepping down after serving the maximum two terms allowed. The EU's observer mission said this week that some of its election observers had been prevented from monitoring counting in some areas and there was an 'unjustified alteration' of results at some polling stations. Opposition parties have alleged there was fraud since the day of the election. The country of around 33 million people has been on edge since two senior opposition figures, including a lawyer involved in a possible legal challenge of the election results, were killed last week when gunmen ambushed them and riddled their car with bullets. Police also quelled demonstrations by opposition supporters this week, dispersing them by firing tear gas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ruling-party-candidate-wins-presidential-vote-in-mozambique/7837618.html	2024-10-24T08:13:47-07:00	
India, China move to stabilize ties, but mistrust lingers	A bilateral meeting between the Indian and Chinese leaders held Wednesday on the sidelines of the BRICS summit is expected to pave the way for improving political and economic ties damaged by a border standoff four years ago. Analysts say lingering mistrust in India could hamper quick normalization.

Former Pakistan PM Khan's wife released from prison	Islamabad — Pakistani authorities released the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan from prison Thursday, nearly nine months after the couple was sentenced on corruption allegations. Former first lady Bushra Bibi was allowed to leave the Adiala jail near Islamabad a day after a federal high court approved her bail application. Leaders of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party said Bibi traveled to her residence on the outskirts of the Pakistani capital after her release. 'Welcome back Bushra Bibi!' wrote the PTI on its social media platform X. Khan, 72, and Bibi were sentenced to 14 years in January on accusations of illegally retaining and selling state gifts received during his time in office from 2018 to 2022. They were later convicted and received additional sentences in several other cases, including charges of illegal marriage. However, appeals courts overturned or suspended all convictions and sentences in the months that followed, but Pakistani authorities refused to release the couple, instead announcing new charges against them in July related to fresh allegations of selling state gifts worth more than half a million dollars. Khan denies any wrongdoing and rejects all the more than 150 lawsuits as political victimization by the country’s military-backed government to keep him from returning to national politics, charges his successors and military officials denied. The cricket star-turned-prime minister was ousted from power through an opposition parliamentary vote of no-confidence 18 months ago before being imprisoned in August 2023. The legal battles and subsequent convictions have barred Khan from pursuing public office. His party was banned from participating in the national election in February. Khan maintains that the vote was rigged to prevent his party from winning the vote and allowing his rivals to form a coalition government with the help of the military. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and military officials reject the allegations. Appeal by US lawmakers Meanwhile, Pakistan on Thursday criticized a letter sent to President Joe Biden by more than 60 Democratic lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives, urging him to secure the release of Khan and all other political prisoners. 'The United States and Pakistan have a long-standing cooperative relationship,' Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch told her weekly news conference in Islamabad. 'However, interference in our internal affairs through letters like this is not acceptable and undermines diplomatic decorum,' she added. Baloch made her comments after the group of U.S. Congress members expressed their concerns to Biden about Khan’s incarceration and the alleged widespread human rights abuses in Pakistan. 'At a minimum, we ask your administration to urgently secure the guarantees from the Pakistani government for Khan's safety and well-being and urge U.S. Embassy officials to visit him in prison,' the letter to Biden read. It described Khan as a political leader 'with widespread support in the country.' The letter noted that in February, the Pakistani parliamentary elections saw a historic level of irregularities, including widespread electoral fraud, state-led efforts to disenfranchise voters, and the arrest and detention of political leaders, journalists, and activists. 'More broadly, developments since the February vote point to a clear turn towards authoritarianism in the country,' the letter said. '… Simply put, Pakistan's current system amounts to 'military rule with civilian facade,' stated the letter written by Representative Greg Casar and co-leaders of the group, Representatives Jim McGovern and Summer Lee. Pakistan’s military has staged three coups and placed the country under more than three decades of dictatorial rule since it gained independence in 1947. The powerful security institution and its intelligence units are persistently accused of meddling in national politics and orchestrating the making or breaking of elected governments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-pakistan-pm-khan-wife-released-from-prison/7837527.html	2024-10-24T07:38:04-07:00	
Venezuelan opposition figures win EU's top rights Sakharov prize	Strasbourg, France — The EU parliament awarded the bloc's top rights Sakharov prize on Thursday to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado and her ally, former presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia. They won the prestigious award for their fight for democracy under President Nicolas Maduro's iron-fisted rule. Machado, 57, played a key role in Venezuela's presidential election in July. Although the authorities proclaimed Maduro the winner, the opposition believes its candidate Gonzalez Urrutia won. Gonzalez Urrutia, 75, went into exile in Spain in September. European Parliament chief Roberta Metsola said the two figures represented 'all Venezuelans inside and outside the country fighting to restore freedom and democracy', as she announced the award in the parliament in Strasbourg, France. 'Edmundo and Maria have continued to fight for the fair, free and peaceful transition of power and have fearlessly upheld those values that millions of Venezuelans and this parliament hold so dear: justice, democracy and the rule of law,' Metsola added. 'This parliament stands with the people of Venezuela and with Maria and Edmundo in their struggle for the democratic future of their country,' Metsola said. 'We are confident that Venezuela and democracy, will ultimately prevail,' she added. There will be an award ceremony in Strasbourg in December. The winner receives a $54,000 prize. Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia were named for the award by the center-right European People's Party, the largest political grouping in the EU parliament. The two other finalists were jailed Azerbaijani activist Gubad Ibadoghlu -- backed by the Greens -- and Israeli and Palestinian organizations working together for peace, proposed by the Socialists and Democrats group. Metsola paid tribute to the finalists, saying they 'all are bravely standing up for human rights and for freedom of thought in the face of unimaginable challenges'. She said that the health of Ibadoghlu — under house arrest — was 'currently deteriorating significantly' and called on 'Azerbaijani authorities to drop all charges against Doctor Ibadoghlu and lift his travel ban'. Far-right lawmakers had nominated US tech billionaire Elon Musk as a champion of 'free speech', but their eyebrow-raising choice was not accepted. Named after Soviet physicist and political dissident Andrei Sakharov, previous recipients of the award include South Africa's Nelson Mandela and late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. For Machado, it is her second prize in as many months as she won the top European rights prize awarded by the Council of Europe, which is not an EU institution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuelan-opposition-figures-win-eu-top-rights-sakharov-prize/7837115.html	2024-10-24T05:37:42-07:00	
Still without any opposition, Uzbekistan votes for parliament	Tashkent, Uzbekistan — A country that appeared to promise genuine political opposition during a parliamentary election campaign five years ago is about to vote again on Sunday — still without any. Uzbekistan's dissidents persist in efforts to register their parties despite repeated rejections. And America’s top diplomat in Tashkent continues to encourage the country to stay on the course of reforms. But for many Uzbeks, real democracy remains a remote and not particularly appealing prospect. 'What is an independent parliament? What is democracy? We have never had either,' said Matluba Boltayeva, an entrepreneur in Andijan, eastern Uzbekistan. Boltayeva told VOA it is more important to her that she can now visit relatives in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, which became possible after the government of Uzbekistan’s president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, increased crossing points and expanded commercial opportunities. 'I don’t care about the members of the Oliy Majlis,' she added, referring to the Uzbek parliament. 'I don’t want any political change, and certainly no opposition.' Boltayeva’s sentiments resonate with many in Uzbekistan. During VOA’s travels around the country, residents frequently expressed low expectations of their legislators. Many believe that the country’s laws are made and enforced solely by the president. A popular blogger, known for discussing rural issues and who ran for local office in 2019, now fears revealing his name to share this opinion: 'We deserve this regime. People want a strongman as a leader, taking care of our basic needs. They don’t want to complicate things.' His views reflect the widespread cynicism about democracy VOA heard in several cities and villages. 'Our people look at democracies like those in America, India, Kyrgyzstan and Georgia and wonder, ‘Why would we want that chaos?’ There isn’t enough desire, if any, for political or ideological contest here, which to people means disagreement and disorder.' Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East have also shaped Uzbek perceptions, reinforcing the value of independence and stability — key election themes echoed by the five political parties, all supporting President Mirziyoyev and his policies. Alisher Qodirov, head of the National Revival Democratic Party, who in 2019 pledged to turn his faction into an opposition, later told VOA, 'How can we oppose the administration when it’s doing exactly what we advocate — economic reforms, investing in education, health care, and infrastructure, while also promoting our national values?' While Qodirov and others contend that the parliament is relevant, social media users often disagree. They refer to the parties as 'puppets,' accusing them of merely promoting the state’s agenda rather than offering solutions. In an interview with VOA, U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan Jonathan Henick praised recent televised debates but noted that the parliament lacks transparency. 'We need to see more of that because, for the parliament to fulfill its potential in the Uzbek system, it needs to be empowered and communicate its role to the public,' Henick said. The U.S. government does not support any specific political party, he says, 'but we do support the registration of opposition parties in Uzbekistan. I think the Uzbek people, the voters, deserve as much choice as they can get.' Both the U.S. and Uzbekistan are members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, whose Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR, has deployed an election observation mission, with 14 international experts, 26 long-term and 300 short-term observers. OSCE/ODIHR has previously monitored 10 elections and referenda in Uzbekistan, none of which was deemed free or fair. Its consistent recommendation has been to create space for political competition. 'People will feel more vested in the system if their representatives — the ones that speak to them and get their votes — are represented in parliament,' said Henick. The administration deserves credit for its reforms so far, he told VOA. 'But I’ve also been candid about where things fall short.' Henick cited the U.S. State Department’s critical reports on human rights, which point out problematic areas in Uzbekistan. 'We see this government as a partner,' he said, underlining that Washington values its strategic ties with Tashkent. Henick works closely with President Mirziyoyev’s office, now largely run by his eldest daughter, Saida Mirziyoyeva, whom he described as 'a productive and capable interlocutor.' 'I don't presume to judge or cast judgment on the president here regarding whom he chooses as his advisers. That is up to him,' said Henick, who also spoke positively about Western-educated ministers, regarding them as strong advocates for reform. Like Henick, many Uzbeks argue that their society is undergoing a transition. They now expect more from their government, especially local authorities. While the media environment is less vibrant compared to 2017–2021, the initial reform period, journalists and bloggers say they still push for public discourse on key issues. Henick observes that civil society groups struggle to register because officials do not view them as partners in delivering public services. However, he assesses the impact of bloggers and grassroots activists as evidence Uzbekistan will shape its own democracy. 'If we are truthful in our desire to support that democratic development, we shouldn't be trying to impose a model from the outside. We should be working with the individuals and organizations already here in Uzbekistan,' Henick said. Khidirnazar Allakulov, who has been trying to register a political party since 2021, firmly believes Uzbekistan needs and deserves real opposition. Nearing 70 and with his activist son in prison, Allakulov said he is 'committed to fighting authoritarianism.' He claims to have thousands of supporters 'despite arrests and repression' and rejects the popular skepticism about democracy. 'I wouldn’t push for change if I thought our people had no faith in freedom and justice, which are essential for stability. Uzbekistan aspires to have all these things. But we also know that fear rules,' he said. Allakulov believes the main reason authorities block his party’s registration is its opposition to 'one-man rule and nepotism.' He believes Uzbekistan deserves better governance — not through a coup, but through democratic elections. Recently renaming his group the 'Liberator Nation Party,' Allakulov talks with the international community, including OSCE/ODIHR, but insists that no outside influence should interfere with the registration process. Authorities maintain that Allakulov’s party has failed to meet the registration requirements, including securing the necessary 20,000 signatures. 'We won’t know the impact of political competition until we see it,' said Jasur Muminov, a graduate student in Tashkent. 'How we get there, I don’t know. But knowing our state, I predict two scenarios: either the government will introduce its fake ‘opposition party’ to show the world ‘democratic progress,’ or we’ll continue without any. But I’ll be voting on October 27.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/still-without-any-opposition-uzbekistan-votes-for-parliament-/7837071.html	2024-10-24T04:49:57-07:00	
Melodic greeting between women in Burundi is at risk of being lost	NGOZI, Burundi — The hug between the two women looked like it would last forever. A spirited 85-year-old had embraced a younger woman she hadn’t seen for months, and she chanted a number of questions in the peculiar yodeling routine of her ancestors. How are you? How is your husband? How are the kids? How are your cows? Are you on good terms with your neighbors? And so on. Prudencienne Namukobwa paused in the melody to allow the younger woman's rhythmic affirmation, a pattern she has mastered over the decades. 'Ego,' Emelyne Nzeyimana replied over and over in the local Kirundi language. 'Yes.' A group of neighbors watched in amazement. Many were seeing their first performance of the traditional form of musical greeting, known to Burundians as akazehe. It is performed exclusively by women on a range of occasions. But akazehe is fading, despite its unique status in this central African country that is better known for its world-famous percussionists. That's according to cultural officials, teachers and others who say the practice is worth preserving. They cited the threat from public health measures that discourage unnecessary contact during disease outbreaks, in addition to the perceived failure to promote akazehe among school-going youth. Among young Burundians, it is hard to find people who know what akazehe means and even harder to find someone who can perform it. 'At a certain time, unfortunately, it was abandoned,' said Sandrine Kitonze, a culture adviser in the office of the governor of Ngozi province. She said akazehe and its minutes-long embrace 'made you feel that the person who greets you loves you.' Some academics have noted akazehe’s potential role in fostering social cohesion in Burundi, which is now largely peaceful after a period of deadly civil war followed by political instability. Annonciate Baragahorana, a teacher in the province of Bujumbura, which includes the commercial capital, told The Associated Press that while she was not born in a place where akazehe was widely practiced, she was astonished as a young girl when women embraced and addressed her in the polyphonic way during visits to other regions. 'The women who often did this lived in the central plateau provinces. When we went there during the holidays, a woman from the interior of the country kissed you strongly while wishing you wonders and she hugged you for a long time,' she said with a chuckle. 'I wanted her to finish quickly, even if it was sweet words to hear.' Baragahorana said she feared 'tenderness in social relationships will disappear' among Burundians amid threats from contagious diseases such as COVID-19 and mpox. 'People greet each other from a distance for fear of contaminating each other,' she said. 'This will contribute enormously to the demise of akazehe.' In Ngozi, a hilly province in Burundi’s north, akazehe remains familiar to some locals, and women such as Namukobwa are impressive at performing it. She lives in a decaying house set in the side of a verdant hill. One recent morning, she was sitting on a mat outside when she glimpsed Nzeyimana, the visiting daughter of a former neighbor. She overcame her bad hip to rise and welcome the woman, whom she addressed as if she were her biological daughter. 'I felt that the first love she had when I was just a girl is kept until now,' said Nzeyimana, a broadcaster in Ngozi. 'This means that I am still her daughter.' Akazehe can seem like a race to perfect accord, a search for harmony, in the interwoven vocalizations. While most questions are routine, some can be unexpected. Nzeyimana said afterward that she had been anxious over possibly facing a question for which she was not ready with a positive response. There was none. Serena Facci, an Italian scholar at the University of Rome Tor Vergata who has written about akazehe, said that even by 1993, when she went to Burundi for research in ethnomusicology, 'this beautiful female greeting wasn't very common in the ordinary life.' Its continuing disappearance could be due to changing lifestyles, she said. A custom such as akazehe should be preserved at all costs because of its role in protecting families, said Isaac Nikobiba, an anthropologist in Bujumbura. Among communities that practiced it, women could alert mother figures to any turbulence at home, triggering supportive measures from the extended family, he said. Nikobiba called the potential disappearance of akazehe symptomatic of wider cultural losses stemming from modernization. 'Normally, before starting a home in traditional Burundi, the girl would first receive advice from her paternal aunt who would tell her, ‘I will come to greet you after a certain time. If you notice an anomaly in the home, you will have to tell me everything,’' he said. 'In short, if she does not find someone to whom she can confide her marital intimacies, she spends all the time in a very bad psychological atmosphere.' Floride Ntakirutimana was among the small group of women who gathered to witness the spectacle of Namukobwa greeting Nzeyimana. She said she grew up in a farming community where no mother could perform akazehe, and only heard of it through radio programs. The exchange she watched left her feeling she wanted to learn akazehe herself. 'I feel better, and I saw that it was good,' Ntakirutimana said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/melodic-greeting-between-women-in-burundi-is-at-risk-of-being-lost-/7837026.html	2024-10-24T04:05:00-07:00	
BRICS meeting highlights geopolitical aspirations, rivalries with West	NEW DELHI — While U.S. officials express the view that the BRICS grouping meeting in the Russian city of Kazan is not evolving into a geopolitical rival, analysts say BRICS members are working on issues that could eventually concern the Western world. Among the topics discussed between members Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are ways to establish an alternative payment system that would not be dependent on the U.S. dollar, a BRICS digital currency and an alternative to Western financial institutions like the International Monetary fund. China, Russia and Iran – countries that face severe trade restrictions imposed by the United States – have been particularly keen about advancing BRICS’ stated goals. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi indicated at the BRICS meeting that he was equally interested. 'We welcome efforts to increase financial integration among BRICS countries. Trade in local currencies and smooth cross-border payments will strengthen our economic cooperation,' Modi said. Russian State Duma Speaker Vyachaslav Volodin, writing ahead of the two-day meeting on the cloud-based messaging app Telegram, said the BRICS’ priorities reflect the divide between the West and the South. 'The time of the hegemony of Washington and Brussels is passing. Countries choose the path of equal dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation in the interests of people, and not to please the US and its minions,' he said. U.S. officials say they are not concerned. 'We're not looking at BRICS evolving into some kind of geopolitical rival. That’s not how we look at it ... to the U.S. or anyone else,' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday at a press briefing. Meanwhile, India’s Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met Wednesday on the sidelines of the BRICS meeting, signaling a thaw in relations between the two sometimes-adversarial nations that some analysts suggest could have geopolitical implications. Two days before the BRICS meeting, Indian and Chinese officials agreed to resolve the vexing issue of their militaries patrolling along the India-China border. The goal is to ensure that both sides pull back troops from advanced positions in disputed areas and return to the situation that existed before the last border conflict in 2020. 'We welcome the consensus reached on the issues that have arisen in the last 4 years along the border. It should be our priority to ensure there is peace and stability along our border,' Modi told Xi during the initial minutes of the meeting, which was telecast live. Xi responded saying that the rapprochement was 'in the fundamental interests of both countries.' Analysts are trying to gauge what prompted India to seek rapprochement with Beijing when it is closely tied to U.S.-led arrangements meant to counter China’s influence. India plays a key role in the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy and the Washington-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) involving Japan, India, Australia and the United States. China views the QUAD, which regularly holds exercises among the militaries of the four member countries, as a group bent on hurting its interests. 'Being a part of the QUAD is not helping India, which needs support in countering China’s military challenge in the Himalayan Mountain region. Besides, the U.S. is developing a relationship with Pakistan, which is against India’s interest,' P. Stobdan, former Indian diplomat and author, told VOA. The Chinese media quoted Lin Minwang, a professor at the Institute of Strategic Studies and International Security in Fudan University, as saying that India is seeking reconciliation with China because the United States has not supported its efforts to develop its manufacturing sector. 'India's policy that aims at decoupling from China has failed to attract meaningful support from the U.S.-led West to help 'Made in India' and the country's modernization and industrialization,' Lin said. 'This proves that India can't profit from being hostile to or decoupling from China, and it is even making it difficult for India to realize its own development,' he added. Some experts believe the United States would not be surprised at the turn of events. 'The U.S. knew all along that India and China would connect at some point. There are strong political and economic reasons for them to engage with each other,' said Manoranjan Mohanty, a China expert based in New Delhi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brics-meeting-highlights-geopolitical-aspirations-rivalries-with-west/7836994.html	2024-10-24T03:24:11-07:00	
Indonesia says Chinese vessel twice driven away after disrupting energy survey	JAKARTA, Indonesia — A Chinese coast guard vessel was driven out of Indonesia's waters for a second time this week after it initially disrupted a survey by state energy firm Pertamina in the South China Sea, Indonesia's maritime security agency said on Thursday. While Chinese coast guard vessels have been spotted numerous times in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone, the most recent incidents came just days after Prabowo Subianto took over Indonesia's presidency. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea via a 'nine-dash line' on its maps that cuts into the EEZs of Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2016 said China's claim has no basis under international law, a ruling Beijing does not recognize. The incidents took place off Indonesia Natuna islands, roughly 1,500 km from China's Hainan island. The exact locations were not immediately clear. The Chinese vessel on Monday insisted the area was China's jurisdiction, Indonesia's maritime security agency, known as Bakamla, said in a statement. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'Bakamla will keep patrolling and intensively monitoring the waters of North Natuna to ensure seismic data gathering can go without disruption to Indonesia’s sovereignty,' the agency said on Monday. On Thursday, it said the Chinese vessel returned but was intercepted and again driven out. It did not provide details on what the ship was doing. China asserts its claim of sovereignty via an armada of coast guard ships deployed throughout the South China Sea, some of which are accused by its neighbors of aggressive conduct and of trying to disrupt energy and fisheries activities. China typically says its coast guard operates lawfully to deter territorial infringements in what are its waters. In 2021 vessels from Indonesia and China shadowed each other for months near a submersible oil rig that had been performing well appraisals in the Natuna Sea. China at the time urged Indonesia to stop drilling in what was its territory. The latest incidents came as Indonesia's new defense minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, met Thursday with the Chinese ambassador in Jakarta. The defense ministry in a statement said Sjafrie expected to boost defense cooperation with China, including joint exercises. It made no mention of this week's maritime incidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-says-chinese-vessel-twice-driven-away-after-disrupting-energy-survey/7836971.html	2024-10-24T02:51:27-07:00	
Blinken meets with Qatari officials in push to resolve conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Thursday with Qatar’s ruling emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani as part of a tour of the region in which Blinken has focused discussions on ending the conflicts in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Blinken is also meeting Thursday with Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed Al Thani ahead of talks with Arab officials Friday in London. While one of Blinken’s agenda items has been to seek an increase in humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza, France hosted an international conference Thursday in Paris to raise funds to help those affected by the war between Israel and Hamas in Lebanon. Israel’s military said Thursday it conducted a new round of airstrikes against Hezbollah weapons production sites in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanon’s military said three of its soldiers were killed in an Israeli strike while they were conducting a rescue operation near the village of Yater in southern Lebanon. Israel has said its fight is with Iran-backed Hezbollah, not Lebanon, in a conflict that has raised fears of wider regional hostilities. On another front Thursday, Syria’s defense ministry said Israeli airstrikes hit Damascus, killing at least one soldier and injuring seven other people. Israel rarely comments on strikes against targets in Syria, but it has hit Iran-linked targets there for years as part of a campaign to halt weapons transfers to Hezbollah and disrupt Iranian proxies. Blinken’s tour has included stops in Israel and Saudi Arabia where he discussed the importance of halting the fighting in Gaza and securing the release of hostages still being held there by Iran-backed Hamas. The top U.S. diplomat has also looked to the eventual end of the conflict, focusing part of his talks with officials on security, governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The war in Gaza began with the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on southern Israel, during which the militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 people as hostages. Hamas is still holding about 100 hostages, with a third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 42,700 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, with Israel saying that the death toll includes several thousand Hamas militants. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-meets-with-qatari-officials-in-push-to-resolve-conflicts-in-gaza-lebanon/7836967.html	2024-10-24T02:37:37-07:00	
Boeing strike barrels on as workers reject wage deal	SEATTLE — Boeing factory workers voted to reject a contract offer and continue a more than five-week strike on Wednesday, in a blow to new CEO Kelly Ortberg's plan to shore up the finances of the struggling planemaker. The vote was 64% in opposition to the deal, which offered a 35% rise in wages over four years, in a major setback for Ortberg who took the top job in August on a pledge to work more closely with factory workers than his predecessors. The rejection of Boeing's offer, which comes after 95% of workers voted against a first contract last month, reflects years of resentment from workers who felt cheated by the company in talks a decade ago and deepens a financial crisis. After the vote, union leaders said they were ready to immediately resume negotiations with Boeing on the first major negotiation since 2014, when the company used the threat of moving production of the new version of the 777 out of the region to push through a deal that ended traditional pensions. The union has been seeking a 40% pay rise and the return of the defined-benefit pension. Boeing factory workers were also venting frustration after a decade when their wages have lagged inflation and critics have complained that the planemaker spent tens of billions of dollars on share buybacks and paid out record executive bonuses. 'This membership has gone through a lot … there are some deep wounds,' the union's lead contract negotiator Jon Holden told reporters after the vote. 'I want to get back to the table. Boeing needs to come to the table as well. Hopefully, we can have some fruitful discussions with the company, and Mr. Ortberg, to try and resolve this.' Boeing declined comment on the vote. Some 33,000 machinists downed tools in Boeing's West Coast factories on Sept. 13, halting production of the best-selling 737 MAX as well as 767 and 777 wide-body programs. Time is running out for Boeing, historically the largest U.S. exporter, and its biggest union to reach a deal before the busy political period surrounding the presidential election on Nov. 5. With Boeing and IAM at a stalemate earlier this month, acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Julie Su had helped get the latest offer presented for a vote after attending in-person talks with both parties in Seattle last week. Holden said after the union vote that he would reach out to the White House to see if the union could get more assistance negotiating with Boeing. 'After the first contract offer was rejected, the honeymoon was over on the labor reset. This further validates that,' said Scott Hamilton, an aviation consultant. 'It's bad news for everybody - Boeing, labor, suppliers, customers, even the national economy.' Boeing is the largest customer for a U.S. aerospace supply chain already facing critical financial pressure. Fuselage supplier Spirit AeroSystems warned that if the strike continued beyond the end of November, there would be layoffs and more drastic furloughs. The company, which is in the process of being taken over by Boeing, has already announced a 21-day furlough for 700 workers. 'Defining moment' Boeing has announced plans to cut 17,000 jobs and is closing in on a plan to raise up to $15 billion from investors to help preserve its investment grade credit rating, while some airlines have had to trim schedules due to aircraft delivery delays. Ortberg warned on Wednesday there was no quick fix for the ailing planemaker. In a quarterly earnings call, Boeing forecast it would burn cash through 2025. Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said after the vote that the decision to prolong the strike could worsen the expected drain on cash. The specter of a quality crisis from a January mid-air panel blowout hangs over Boeing. Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said this was now the 'defining moment' of Ortberg's short tenure and he needed to get a deal across the line soon. 'There's a feeling that he hasn't handled this as well as he might have,' Aboulafia said. 'They've (Boeing) got to get this done, and they're in a position of weakness.' The rejection from workers on Wednesday was the second in a formal vote after the offer of a 25% pay rise over four years was rejected last month, leading to the strike. Many comments on social media and from workers outside voting stations had cast doubt on a deal. 'We're ready to go back on strike until we get a better deal,' Irina Briones, 25, said after the vote. 'They took a bunch of numbers and moved them around to make them look like they're giving us more than they were,' said Josh Hajek, 42, who has worked six years at Boeing on wing assembly. Voting figures showed the two sides getting closer to a deal but still a solid majority in favor of prolonging the strike. Before the vote, Terrin Spotwood, a 20-year-old machinist in 737 wing assembly, said he planned to approve the contract because the offer was 'good, but not great.' He said several coworkers planned the same because they 'can't really afford to say no to this contract. They have to go back to work.' Even so, many workers are still angry about the last deal signed a decade ago. 'We're going to get what we want this time. We have better legs to stand on this time than Boeing,' said Donovan Evans, 30, who works in the 767 jet factory outside Seattle.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-strike-barrels-on-as-workers-reject-wage-deal/7836963.html	2024-10-24T02:19:04-07:00	
New evidence China, Russia and Iran targeting US elections	WASHINGTON — There is new evidence China, Iran and Russia are aggressively expanding their efforts to influence American voters to potentially sway the result of the upcoming U.S. elections. Two threat intelligence reports Wednesday, one from software giant Microsoft and the other from the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, detail growing activity by cyber actors linked to each country — all aiming to impact U.S. public perceptions with less than two weeks before voters go to the polls. The biggest change, according to Microsoft, comes from Chinese-linked actors known to researchers as Spamouflage or Taizi Flood. 'Chinese influence operations have recently taken a new turn, shifting focus to several down-ballot candidates and members of Congress,' Microsoft said, noting that starting in September, China has targeted at least four prominent Republican lawmakers, all of whom are known critics of the government in Beijing. Most recently, the Chinese-linked accounts targeted Texas Republican Michael McCaul, accusing the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee of 'abusing power for personal gain.' Late last month, other Spamouflage began going after Tennessee Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, Microsoft said. And earlier this month, the same effort began promoting Blackburn’s opponent in the November 5 election. Other targets include Alabama Republican Representative Barry Moore, who was subjected to content criticizing his support for Israel, and the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Marco Rubio, who was accused of corruption. The Chinese Embassy in Washington rejected the allegations in the Microsoft report. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ domestic affairs,' embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told VOA Wednesday, echoing previous Chinese denials. 'Such allegations are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes,' he added. U.S. lawmakers, however, said they were not surprised by the uptick in malign activity. 'The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] cannot stand anyone who supports and gives a voice to those they oppress; their response is to sanction and attack,' McCaul said in a statement to VOA. 'I consider it a badge of honor when the CCP — a leading abuser of human rights, censor of free speech, and oppressor of its own people — takes issue with my work,' he said. Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for the Chinese influence efforts to 'be taken very seriously.' 'China is becoming increasingly more aggressive,' Rubio said in a statement to VOA. 'China’s goal is to shape American opinion on critical issues and target specific candidates, especially those they view as anti-China.' Growing threats The reports from Microsoft and Recorded Future warn Beijing is not alone. Specifically, the reports caution the Russian-linked cyber actors, known to researchers as Storm-1679 or Operation Overload, have increased their pace of operations over the past month and a half and are showing signs that more influence operations are on the way. 'Operation Overload is very likely to ramp up its activities,' said the Recorded Future report. Recorded Future said many of the Russian efforts, of late, have sought to provoke anger toward the LGBTQ+ community 'using disinformation to perpetuate discriminatory beliefs around transgender individuals, perceived behavioral issues, gender transition and reassignment surgeries, and pharmaceutical treatments.' Other influence operations, the report said, are making use of AI-generated voiceovers to emulate the style of U.S. broadcast journalists. Microsoft said the Russian cyber actors also have found ways to reach additional U.S. voters by shifting much of the content from the Telegram social media platform to X. 'Storm-1679 videos posted to X received higher levels of engagement,' Microsoft said. Microsoft researchers also warned there are signs Iran is also ramping up its election interference efforts. The Microsoft report says that in one instance, less than two weeks ago, 'an online persona operated by Iran began falsely posing as an American and called on Americans to boycott the elections due to both candidates’ support for Israel’s military operations.' Russia and Iran, like China, have repeatedly denied any involvement in efforts to meddle with the U.S. election. But the new findings from Microsoft and Recorded Future align with assessments from U.S. intelligence officials. 'Foreign actors — particularly Russia, Iran and China — remain intent on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans’ confidence in the U.S. democratic system consistent with what they perceive to be in their interests,' according to a declassified assessment issued Tuesday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. U.S. intelligence officials have previously said Russia has been working to boost the chances of former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump, while Iran has been working to hurt Trump’s reelection bid and instead buoy the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. And while there is little evidence to suggest China has sought to affect the U.S. presidential race, intelligence officials have said Beijing has been focusing its efforts on congressional and state and local candidates perceived to be promoting policies detrimental to Beijing's interests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-evidence-china-russia-and-iran-targeting-us-elections/7836957.html	2024-10-24T02:08:40-07:00	
AI decodes oinks and grunts to keep pigs happy in Danish study	VIPPEROD, Denmark — European scientists have developed an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of interpreting pig sounds, aiming to create a tool that can help farmers improve animal welfare. The algorithm could potentially alert farmers to negative emotions in pigs, thereby improving their well-being, according to Elodie Mandel-Briefer, a behavioral biologist at University of Copenhagen who is co-leading the study. The scientists, from universities in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, France, Norway and the Czech Republic, used thousands of recorded pig sounds in different scenarios, including play, isolation and competition for food, to find that grunts, oinks, and squeals reveal positive or negative emotions. While many farmers already have a good understanding of the well-being of their animals by watching them in the pig pen, existing tools mostly measure their physical condition, said Mandel-Briefer. 'Emotions of animals are central to their welfare, but we don't measure it much on farms,' she said. The algorithm demonstrated that pigs kept in outdoor, free-range or organic farms with the ability to roam and dig in the dirt produced fewer stress calls than conventionally raised pigs. The researchers believe that this method, once fully developed, could also be used to label farms, helping consumers make informed choices. 'Once we have the tool working, farmers can have an app on their phone that can translate what their pigs are saying in terms of emotions,' Mandel-Briefer said. Short grunts typically indicate positive emotions, while long grunts often signal discomfort, such as when pigs push each other by the trough. High-frequency sounds like screams or squeals usually mean the pigs are stressed, for instance, when they are in pain, fight, or are separated from each other. The scientists used these findings to create an algorithm that employs AI. 'Artificial intelligence really helps us to both process the huge amount of sounds that we get, but also to classify them automatically,' Mandel-Briefer said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-decodes-oinks-and-grunts-to-keep-pigs-happy-in-danish-study/7836947.html	2024-10-24T01:40:39-07:00	
Tropical Storm Trami wreaks havoc in the Philippines, at least 26 dead	Manila, Philippines — Tropical Storm Trami has killed at least 26 people and forced more than 150,000 to flee their homes in the Philippines, officials said on Thursday, as it made landfall on the northeastern coast. Trami, locally known as severe tropical storm Kristine, dumped heavy to torrential rain on the main island of Luzon triggering widespread flooding and landslides. With maximum sustained winds of 95 kph, the storm was moving westward across the mountainous northern region of Cordillera towards the South China Sea, the state weather agency said in its 11 a.m. weather bulletin. It warned of heavy to intense rainfall, flooding, landslides and storm surges for some northern provinces. Most of the deaths from the storm over the past few days were due to drowning and landslides in the central Bicol region, including Naga city where 14 were reported dead on Thursday, officials said. Trami made landfall in the northeastern town of Divilacan in Isabela province. The town's disaster chief, Ezikiel Chavez, said no fatalities had been reported. The government ordered businesses and schools in the path of the storm to close in anticipation of heavy rain and floods. Over 163,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centers, the civil defense office said, most of whom were in Bicol as residents fled their homes after floodwaters reached as high as the roofs of bungalow houses. The civil aviation regulator said on Thursday at least a dozen flights across the country had been cancelled due to the storm. The central bank cancelled foreign exchange trading and monetary operations for a second straight day. The Philippines typically records an average of 20 tropical storms annually, often resulting in heavy rains, strong winds, and deadly landslides.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-trami-wreaks-havoc-in-the-philippines-at-least-26-dead/7836920.html	2024-10-23T23:43:38-07:00	
Japan's rising ramen prices give election voters food for thought	TOKYO — Taisei Hikage is fighting a losing battle at his Tokyo ramen shop - not to attract customers, but to keep a lid on the price he charges for Japan's national comfort food in the face of an incessant rise in ingredient and fuel costs. Since opening his shop in the west of the capital a year and a half ago, Hikage, 26, has raised menu prices three times but still struggles with rising costs. His top-selling 'Special Ramen' is up 47%, selling for 1,250 yen ($8). 'Traditionally ramen shops were supposed to offer something cheap and tasty,' Hikage said between stirring big pots of broth and blanching noodles. 'It's no longer cheap food for the masses.' The problems facing ramen vendors - a record number of shop operators are set to go bankrupt this year - reflect a cost-of-living crunch that has become a top issue for voters in Japan's general election on Sunday. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, a self-described ramen fanatic, and opposition parties have pledged various measures to offset rising costs for businesses and households. Those efforts to control rising prices, in a land emerging from decades of deflation, could tip an election where opinion polls show the LDP - which has ruled Japan for almost all of the post-war era - might lose its parliamentary majority. Hikage, who said he will be too busy working in his restaurant to vote, hopes the victors will consider introducing subsidies to offset rising costs. His award-winning noodles remain in demand despite the repeated price hikes, with long queues in front of his shop day and night. Some of his competitors are not faring so well: 49 ramen shop operators with debts of at least 10 million yen filed for bankruptcy in the first seven months of the year, on track to exceed the 2020 record of 54 bankruptcies, according to credit research firm Teikoku Databank. 'Weeded out' Hikage prides himself on using mostly domestic ingredients, but many ramen restaurants rely heavily on imported materials, like the flour to make noodles. Japan's import costs have risen as the yen has sunk. The currency hit a 34-year low against the dollar this year and has struggled to regain ground. Also boosting costs for ramen shops are higher energy and grain prices, triggered by Russia's war in Ukraine, as well as rising labor costs. The plight of Japan's ramen shops illustrates a larger trend, as companies that fail to adjust to the era of inflation go under. Nationwide bankruptcies in the six months to September jumped 18.6% from the same period last year to 4,990 cases, with a record number caused by inflation, said Teikoku Databank. 'Just like ramen shops, companies offering goods and services that are in demand are transferring costs to product prices and seeing their sales grow. Those struggling to pass on higher costs are being weeded out,' said Dai-ichi Life Research Institute's executive chief economist Toshihiro Nagahama. But Nagahama said politicians' tendency to dish out support measures to win votes may be counterproductive in the long term. 'If too many 'zombie' firms, or companies that cannot raise productivity or wages, are kept alive, they could be a drag on the Japanese economy,' he said. For now, Hikage said he will focus on serving quality dishes and hopes the election can bring some kind of positive change. 'Our task now is to endure this and focus on offering something delicious, with our heads bowed to customers,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-rising-ramen-prices-give-election-voters-food-for-thought/7836917.html	2024-10-23T23:32:10-07:00	
Detained Cambodian journalist seeks bail after apologizing for 'harmful' posts	An award-winning Cambodian journalist detained on charges of inciting social unrest sought bail on Thursday, his lawyer said, a day after the government released a video of the investigative reporter apologizing. Mech Dara, who is known for exposing corruption and human trafficking through his reporting, has been in pre-trial detention since Oct. 1, and faces up to two years in prison. His arrest has drawn concern from rights groups and the U.S. government. In its Oct. 1 decision, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court said Dara, who has worked for local and international media, had posted 'provocative' and 'false' messages and pictures about a rock quarry on a sacred mountain. Dara's lawyer, Duch Piseth, said the bail request had been made but it was too early to say if the charges would be dropped. 'We are just waiting for his release,' he said On Wednesday, Cambodia's information minister shared with journalists a video of Dara wearing prison garb and apologizing. It was accompanied by images of a handwritten three-page letter the minister said was from the journalist. 'In all the messages that I posted, I conveyed false information that affected the leaders and the country's reputation. I sincerely apologize for my mistakes and promise to stop sharing such harmful content,' Dara said in the video. Dara received a hero award last year from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, recognizing his work exposing the existence of massive scam compounds staffed mostly by trafficked workers in Cambodia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/detained-cambodian-journalist-seeks-bail-after-apologizing-for-harmful-posts/7836916.html	2024-10-23T23:22:32-07:00	
Russian drones target Kyiv region	Officials in Ukraine’s capital said Thursday that Russia attacked the region with about a dozen aerial drones overnight. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said Ukraine’s air defenses shot down all of the drones and that there were no reports of casualties or damage. In the Mykolaiv region in southern Ukraine, Governor Vitalii Kim said on Telegram the military shot down three Russian drones. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed seven Ukrainian aerial drones, including four over the Kursk region and three over the Black Sea. Officials in Russia’s Bryansk region also reported several drones were shot down there overnight. North Korean troops The United States said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops were dispatched to Russia earlier this month and are being trained there, possibly to fight alongside Moscow’s troops in their war against Ukraine. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters that what Pyongyang’s soldiers are doing in Russia is 'left to be seen.' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. is 'working closely with our allies and partners to gain a full understanding of the situation.' Kirby said the North Korean troops traveled by ship between early October and mid-month from its Wonsan naval port to Vladivostok in Russia. Then, he said, the North Korean troops were dispatched to multiple military training sites in eastern Russia. 'We do not yet know whether these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military' in Ukraine, but the possibility is 'certainly a high concern,' Kirby said. 'We have briefed the Ukrainian government on our understanding of this situation, and we're certainly consulting closely with other allies, partners and countries in the region on the implications of such a dramatic group move, and on how we might respond,' Kirby said. 'For the time being, we will continue to monitor the situation closely, but let's be clear: If North Korean soldiers do enter into combat, this development will demonstrate Russia's growing desperation in its war against Ukraine,' Kirby added. 'Russia is suffering extraordinary casualties on the battlefield every single day, but President [Vladimir] Putin appears intent on continuing this war,' Kirby said. 'If Russia is indeed forced to turn to North Korea for manpower, if we assign a weakness, not strength, it would also demonstrate an unprecedented level of direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea with security implications in Europe, as well as the Indo-Pacific,' he said. Kirby said Russia's cooperation with the North Korean military would violate multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibiting the procurement of arms from North Korea and military arms training. China, one of the five permanent members of the Security Council and a close ally of North Korea, was asked by VOA about its view of the U.S., South Korean, Ukrainian and NATO intelligence confirming the presence of North Korean troops in eastern Russia and the possible implications. 'China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We hope that all parties will work for de-escalation and be committed to political settlement,' Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu, said in a statement. Defense chief Austin cited a 'strengthened relationship' between Russia and North Korea, noting that North Korea has provided weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. 'If they're co-belligerents, if their intention is to participate in this war on Russia's behalf, that is a very, very serious issue, and it will have impacts not only in Europe; it will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well,' Austin said. Austin also highlighted Russian casualties in the war it launched with a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, saying the North Korea development is an indication that Putin 'may be in even more trouble than most people realize.' Austin’s assessment was quickly backed up by NATO officials, who are awaiting additional briefings from South Korea, which went public with its intelligence on the North Korean troop movements last week. 'We are actively consulting within the Alliance on this matter,' NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said, adding, 'If these troops are destined to fight in Ukraine, it would mark a significant escalation in North Korea’s support for Russia’s illegal war and yet another sign of Russia’s significant losses on the front lines.' VOA national security correspondent Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.

Commonwealth nations to discuss slavery reparations, climate change	APIA, SAMOA — The leaders of the Commonwealth group of nations will meet at a welcome banquet in Samoa in the South Pacific on Thursday, with climate change and reparations for Britain's role in the transatlantic slave trade on the agenda of summit discussions. Leaders and officials from 56 countries with roots in Britain's empire, as well as Britain's King Charles, are in the small island nation and attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which began Monday. The countries' foreign ministers also began a day of discussions on Thursday. More than half of the Commonwealth's members are small states, many of which are low-lying island nations at risk from rising sea levels due to climate change. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said ocean temperatures are rising in the Pacific Islands at three times the rate worldwide, and its population is 'uniquely exposed' to the impact of rising sea levels. 'Climate change is an existential threat. It is the number one national security threat. It is the number one economic threat to the peoples of the Pacific and to many members of the Commonwealth,' Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong told a news conference after a meeting with counterparts. A number of African countries, including Zambia, warned the meeting about the escalating impacts of climate change, including the effects on food security, she added. On Thursday, Charles will be shown the impact of rising sea levels that are forcing people to move inland, a Samoan chief said. Island leaders are expected to issue a declaration on ocean protection at the summit, with climate change being a central topic of discussion. Reparations push Also on the agenda is a push for Britain to pay reparations for transatlantic slavery, a long-standing issue that has recently been gaining momentum worldwide, particularly those part of the Caribbean Community and more recently the African Union. British Prime Minister Kier Starmer said on Monday the UK will not bring the issue of reparations for historical transatlantic slavery to the table at the summit, but is open to engage with leaders who want to discuss it. CARICOM has set up a commission to seek reparations from former colonial powers such as the UK, France and Portugal. Those opposed to paying reparations say countries shouldn't be held responsible for historical wrongs, while those in favor say the legacy of slavery has resulted in persistent and vast racial inequalities today. A CARICOM source familiar with the matter told Reuters CHOGM presents an 'important opportunity' for dialogue on reparations and the region will be tabling the issue there. 'It is a priority for many of the Commonwealth's member countries and whenever those affected by atrocities ask to talk, there should always be a willingness to sit down and listen,' said Kingsley Abbott, director of the University of London's Institute of Commonwealth Studies, who is attending the summit. From the 15th to the 19th century, at least 12.5 million Africans were kidnapped and forcibly transported by European ships and merchants and sold into slavery. Those who survived the brutal voyage ended up toiling on plantations under inhumane conditions in the Americas, mostly in Brazil and the Caribbean, while others profited from their labor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/commonwealth-nations-to-discuss-slavery-reparations-climate-change/7836906.html	2024-10-23T22:03:57-07:00	
China space plan highlights commitment to space exploration, analysts say	Chinese officials recently released a 25-year space exploration plan that details five major scientific themes and 17 priority areas for scientific breakthroughs with one goal: to make China a world leader in space by 2050 and a key competitor with the U.S. in space, for decades to come. Last week, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China National Space Administration, and the China Manned Space Agency jointly released a space exploration plan for 2024 through 2050. It includes searching for extraterrestrial life, exploring Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, sending space crews to the moon and building an international lunar research station by 2025. Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the plan highlights China’s long-term commitment and answers some lingering questions as well. 'I think a lot of experts have wondered if China would continue to invest in space, particularly in science and exploration, given a lot of economic uncertainties in China … but this is a sign that they're committed,' Swope said. The plan reinforces a 'commitment to really look at space science and exploration in the long term and not just short term,' he added. The plan outlines Beijing’s goal to send astronauts to the moon by 2030, obtain and retrieve the first samples from Mars and successfully complete a mission to the Jupiter system in the next few years. It also outlines three phases of development, each with specific goals in terms of space exploration and key scientific discoveries. The extensive plan is not only a statement that Beijing can compete with the U.S. in high-tech industries, it is also a way of boosting national pride, analysts say. 'Space in particular has a huge public awareness, public pride,' says Nicholas Eftimiades, a retired senior intelligence officer and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. 'It emboldens the Chinese people, gives them a strong sense of nationalism and superiority, and that's what the main focus of the Bejing government is.' Swope agrees. 'I think it's [China’s long-term space plan] a manifestation of China's interest and desire from a national prestige and honor standpoint to really show that it's a player on the international stage up there with the United States,' he said. Antonia Hmaidi, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told VOA in an email response that, 'China’s space focus goes back to the 1960,' and that 'China has also been very successful at meeting its own goals and timelines.' In recent years China has carried out several successful space science missions including Chang’e-4, which marked the world’s first soft landing and roving on the far side of the moon, Change’e-5, a mission that returned a sample from the moon back to Beijing for the first time, and Tianwen-1, a space mission that resulted in Chinese spacecraft leaving imprints on Mars. In addition, to these space missions, Bejing has implemented several programs aimed at increasing scientific discovery relating to space, particularly through the launch of several space satellites. Since 2011, China has developed and launched scientific satellites including Dark Matter Particle Explorer, Quantum Experiments at Space Scale, Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, and the Einstein Probe. While China continues to make progress with space exploration and scientific discovery, according to Swope, there is still a way to go before it catches up to the United States. 'China is undeniably the number 2 space power in the world today, behind the United States,' he said. 'The United States is still by far the most important in a lot of measures and metrics, including in science and exploration.' Eftimiades said one key reason the United States has maintained its lead in the space race is the success of Washington’s private, commercial aerospace companies. 'The U.S. private industry has got the jump on China,' Eftimiades said. 'There's no type of industrial control, industrial plan. In fact, Congress and administration shy away from that completely.' Unlike the United States, large space entities in China are often state-owned, such as the China Aerospace Cooperation, Eftimiades said. He adds that one advantage of China’s space entities being state-owned is the ability for the Chinese government to 'direct their industries toward specific objectives.' At the same time, having bureaucracy involved with state-owned enterprises leads to less 'cutting-edge technology.' This year, China has focused on growing its space presence relative to the U.S. by conducting more orbital launches. Beijing planned to conduct 100 orbital launches this year, according to the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, which was to conduct 70 of them. However, as of October 15, China had completed 48 orbital launches. Last week, SpaceX announced it had launched its 100th rocket of the year and had another liftoff just hours later. The private company is aiming for 148 launches this year. Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense implemented its first Commercial Space Integration Strategy, which outlined the department’s efforts to take technologies produced in the private sector and apply their uses for U.S. national security purposes. In a statement released relating to the U.S. strategic plan, the Department of Defense explained its strategy to work closely with private and commercial sector space companies that are known to be innovative and have scalable production. According to the statement, officials say 'the strategy is based on the premise that the commercial space sector's innovative capabilities, scalable production and rapid technology refresh rates provide pathways to enhance the resilience of DOD space capabilities and strengthen deterrence.' Many space technologies have military applications, Swope said. 'A lot of things that are done in space have a dual use, so [space technologies] may be primarily used for scientific purposes, but also could be used to design and build and test some type of weapons technology,' Swope said. Hmaidi says China’s newest space plan stands out for what it doesn’t have. 'The most interesting and striking part about China’s newest space plan to me was the narrow focus on basic science over military goals,' she told VOA in an email. 'However, we know from open-source research that China is also very active in military space development.' 'This plan contains only one part of China’s space planning, namely the part that is unlikely to have direct military utility, while not mentioning other missions with direct military utility like its low-earth orbit internet program,' Hmaidi explained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-space-plan-highlights-commitment-to-space-exploration-analysts-say/7836873.html	2024-10-23T19:55:53-07:00	
In Pakistan, polio workers persist despite perils	Islamabad, Pakistan — Pakistan's fight to eradicate polio is marked with hopeful highs and disappointing lows. As the global community marks World Polio Day on October 24, the nuclear-armed nation faces a staggering 39 cases so far this year, compared to six in 2023 and 20 the year before. In 2021, the South Asian nation briefly seemed on track to eradicating the paralytic virus, with just one reported case the entire year. Going door to door to vaccinate children 5 years old and younger against the poliovirus is a perilous task in Pakistan. Fozia Kalwar became a vaccinator three years ago. A resident of Pakistan's southern Sindh province, the 35-year-old widow took the part-time job because she needed the money. Kalwar makes less than $50 for a week of grueling work during vaccination drives. It is not nearly enough to feed her four children. And the reward is small, she said, for a job that comes with serious security risks. 'I feel very scared, but then I wonder how I will feed my children if I don't work,' Kalwar told VOA. She works in a dangerous part of Sindh, where armed bandits rob people in broad daylight. Still, it was the report of a sexual assault on a fellow polio worker last month that deeply disturbed her, she said. The victim, who lived a few streets away from Kalwar, was allegedly gang-raped by three men while in the field. Attacks on polio workers in Pakistan are largely limited to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Militants in the northern province often target polio teams, accusing them of partaking in a 'Western conspiracy' to render children infertile through the vaccine. They also claim the vaccine has pork-based ingredients that are forbidden for Muslims to consume. This year in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, at least two vaccinators were killed and four wounded, while seven policemen providing security to polio teams died and 30 suffered injuries in four attacks. However, news of the alleged sexual assault in Sindh shocked many. After the incident, Kalwar said, many people in her area suggested shutting down the polio program. 'They said, 'It is saving our children, but what about our women?'' Kalwar told VOA. Watch related video by Murtaza Zehri and Abu Baker Alizai: Lack of trust Despite years of expensive awareness campaigns, many Pakistanis believe anti-vaccine propaganda and refuse the oral vaccine for their children. Lack of trust in the health care system drives others to shut the door on vaccinators. 'In posh areas where there are educated people with more awareness, they don't trust us much,' said Fiza Bibi, a supervisor for community health workers. 'They are very sensitive about their kids. They refuse the vaccine more often for their children,' said Bibi, who works in Karachi, the capital of Sindh. 'Even if they vaccinate their kids later, for us, the child is counted among refusals.' Sindh, Pakistan's southern and second most populated province, detected 12 polio cases this year, behind Balochistan, where 20 cases emerged. Karachi is home to eight districts considered high risk for the spread of the poliovirus. Experts blame overpopulation, poor hygiene and migration from across the country to the economic hub. Health officials say the challenging demographic landscape of Karachi complicates eradicating polio in the province. Sindh fared worse this year in case tally than Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the north, which shares a long, busy border with Afghanistan. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries still grappling with the naturally occurring wild poliovirus. Afghanistan has detected 18 cases this year. Future outlook A nation of over 240 million people, Pakistan is gearing to launch a countrywide polio campaign from October 28. The drive will target 45 million children. According to Pakistan's polio eradication program, cases of the paralytic disease may rise. 'Given the widespread virus presence and its intensity of circulation, more cases are expected to emerge alongside environmental detections during next couple of months,' a program document explains. There is also some good news. The variants of the virus present in Pakistan have dropped from 11 in 2019 to two in 2024, according to the official report. 'This decline underscores the impact of targeted vaccination efforts and enhanced surveillance,' the document said. 'We should not be demoralized by the rising case numbers. We must keep up our efforts,' said Bibi. The 21-year-old was among three health workers chosen from across Pakistan to meet Bill Gates in June. The co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation visited Pakistan to discuss polio, among other issues, with top officials. Working in Sindh near Jacobabad, one of the hottest cities on the planet in the summer, Kalwar has a strategy to make sure no child misses the vaccine in the upcoming drive. 'In our areas, we now keep a register with every child's name in it so that no one is left out,' she said. 'When we visit, we ask about each child by name.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-pakistan-polio-workers-persist-despite-perils/7836830.html	2024-10-23T19:37:28-07:00	
China backs Russia-proposed BRICS payment system	WASHINGTON — Gathered Wednesday at a summit in the Russian city of Kazan, the members of BRICS adopted a joint declaration calling for the creation of an independent payment system based on their national currencies, a move in response to what they regard as illegal sanctions that are damaging the global economy. BRICS member countries, which account for about 35% of the global economy, issued the Kazan Declaration, which calls for the 'elimination' of 'unilateral economic sanctions and secondary sanctions that are contrary to international law.' The BRICS membership includes the initial five — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — and expanded when several countries joined this year, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates. Expressing concerns over 'unilateral coercive' sanctions that have 'disruptive effects' on the world economy, the BRICS members agreed to examine the 'establishment of an independent cross-border settlement and depository infrastructure, BRICS Clear.' In supporting 'inclusive cross-border payment instruments,' they encouraged the 'use of local currencies in financial transactions between BRICS countries and their trading partners.' Edward Fishman, senior research scholar at Columbia University and author of the forthcoming book 'Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare,' said, 'The BRICS have finally found a unifying mission: circumventing American financial dominance.' 'For BRICS members under U.S. sanctions, namely Russia and Iran, this mission is already a top national priority,' he said. 'Others such as China see it as a handy way to insulate themselves from potential sanctions in the future.' Fishman said the United States should take BRICS initiatives 'seriously and move to further solidify the dollar's advantages' as they 'could well bear fruit over the next decade,' although 'it's unlikely that any of these initiatives will make a dent in the dollar's global role in the near future.' Circumventing US dollar In his speech at the summit Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said 'the reform of the international financial architecture' is 'pressing,' and he called for 'the connectivity' of financial infrastructure among BRICS members and the expansion of the New Development Bank, or NDB. Headquartered in Shanghai, the NDB was established by the initial five BRICS members in 2015. It serves as an alternative financial institution to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Tom Keatinge, the founding director of the Center for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute, said China would be inclined to join the new financial system that Russia is advocating. He said Beijing's reasons are twofold: 'to influence its design to ensure it can benefit' and 'to add to its desire to provide counterbalance to the historically unipolar financial system dominated by the United States.' Keatinge added, however, that the new infrastructure would not be able to easily replicate 'the stability, liquidity and convertibility of the U.S. dollar' that a number of other existing bilateral and multilateral payment systems experience. VOA asked the Chinese Embassy in Washington whether and why Beijing is interested in joining and using the proposed BRICS financial system but did not get a reply. Citing unnamed experts, China's state-run Global Times on October 17 said an alternative payment system 'may help reduce excessive reliance on the U.S. dollar.' Sanctions evasion BRICS' efforts to increase the use of local currencies are seen as a bid to challenge the global financial system dominated by the U.S. dollar, which accounts for 90% of all currency trading and more than half of international payments. At the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, 'The dollar is being used as a weapon.' He also said the increased use of BRICS national currencies for transactions will 'minimize geopolitical risks.' During a meeting with Putin at the summit on Tuesday, NDB President Dilma Rousseff said the bank was committed to financing the countries of the Global South in their national currencies. Russian state development corporation and investment company VER.RF signed agreements with China and South Africa to extend credit lines in national currencies, Russian news agency TASS reported on Wednesday. BRICS Clear, the international payment and deposit platform to ensure increased circulation of national currencies, was proposed by Russia ahead of the summit. The Russian Financial Ministry, central bank and consulting firm Yakov and Partners earlier in October issued a document proposing BRICS Clear as a platform that would utilize national depository systems 'independent of third-party influence.' Also ahead of the summit, a new cross-border payment system called BRICS Pay was introduced at the BRICS Business Forum held in Moscow on October 17 and 18. A statement released Tuesday by the American Action Forum, citing an analysis by Jacob Jensen, a data analyst at the think tank, said there are concerns that BRICS Pay would allow participating countries to 'circumvent USD as a payment intermediary by replacing it with blockchain technology and an alternative to the SWIFT financial payment system.' Several Russian banks were banned from the SWIFT messaging system that facilitates global financial transfers shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskovsaid on Wednesday that the BRICS is not trying to create a system as an alternative to SWIFT, according to Russian TASS. Despite BRICS' efforts, no country using an alternative system like BRICS Pay will be immune from sanctions, as such a payment system can be subject to sanctions, said David Asher, a Hudson Institute senior fellow who advised the U.S. government over several years on sanctions evasion schemes. Ultimately, Asher said, national and digital currencies will end up being swapped into U.S. dollars at the Clearing House Automated Transfer System based in Hong Kong, which he believes should be sanctioned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-backs-russia-proposed-brics-payment-system-/7836865.html	2024-10-23T19:19:29-07:00	
Ukrainians reflect on Zelenskyy’s victory plan	Kyiv’s victory plan, presented this month by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has already received assessments from the country’s Western partners. But what do Ukrainian civilians and experts think about it?

Analysis: China, Russia, North Korea and Iran described as new ‘Axis of Evil’ by some	WASHINGTON — U.S. officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the emerging partnership among China, Russia, Iran and North Korea – a bloc being talked about by some in Washington as a new 'axis of evil.' Those worries got a major boost on Wednesday with confirmation by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a trip to Rome that North Korean troops are now present in Russia, presumably preparing to participate in Moscow’s war on Ukraine. Just days earlier, Russia was a participant in naval drills hosted by Iran. China, North Korea and Iran all have supported Russia's war machine in different ways during its war on Ukraine. Iran has provided missiles and drones. North Korea has sent artillery shells. And China has provided dual-use technology and industrial products, including semiconductors and drone engines. 'We've seen the emergence of Axis of Evil back in the late 1930s, 1938, 1939. We saw what the world did at that particular point to come together,' said Republican congressman Rob Wittman, vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during an online discussion last month hosted by the Center for a New American Security. 'We find ourselves at that same crossroads today where we have nations that do not believe in the same things that we believe in, do not believe in the rule of law, do not believe in protecting the rights and dignity of human beings.' In 2002, former U.S. President George W. Bush used the term 'axis of evil' in his State of the Union address to describe countries supporting terrorism, such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq. More recently, it is being applied in Washington to describe China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken describes these four countries as revisionist powers. He wrote that a fierce competition to define a new era of international affairs is under way, and a few countries are determined to change the basic principles of the international system. 'While these countries are not an axis, and the administration has been clear that it does not seek bloc confrontation, choices these revisionist powers are making mean we need to act decisively to prevent that outcome,' Blinken wrote in the November/December issue of the publication Foreign Affairs. Wittman does use the term 'Axis of Evil' and said the countries involved are more capable of destabilizing the world than were Nazi Germany and its allies in 1939, especially as they cooperate and share technology at all levels. 'So, as you look at drones that have been taken out in Ukraine, you find Chinese printed circuit boards in there, Chinese systems on board those drones,' Wittman told VOA. 'You also see the arms that are being fired into Ukraine from Russian artillery pieces are being manufactured in North Korea. You see the drones that are being used by Russians in the battle space there are being manufactured by Iran.' He also said the new partnership is learning from the Ukrainian war at a rate that keeps pace with the times, gaining capabilities that cannot be achieved in normal testing and development processes in a peaceful environment. 'The biggest difference in the 2024 Axis of Evil is that at least three of the four countries are in expansionist mode,' wrote Merrill Matthews, resident scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation earlier this year. 'They want much more land and power. And they are coordinating their efforts to benefit each country’s goals. It’s a very dangerous development.' Matthews told VOA this group is working to create a largely self-sufficient economic zone — out of both necessity and desire — that does not rely on Western economies for survival. Christopher S. Chivvis, a senior fellow and director of the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told VOA that China is key to the strength of the four-way relationship. 'If China were not part of this four, it would look like three countries that are highly isolated from the world cooperating with each other. We would have much less to worry about. It's China's participation in this grouping that is really has the potential to make it very problematic for the United States,' he said. Chivvis added that the four countries can use a crisis in one region to launch a war, coordinate actions, or create chaos in another. For example, Chivvis lays out a more extreme version of this scenario in his recent report — were China to attempt a military operation against Taiwan, Russia might seek to take advantage of the strain on U.S. resources with an even more aggressive military campaign in Ukraine or even with an incursion into NATO territory. Similarly, a major escalation with Iran in the Middle East that draws in more U.S. naval and air forces could also embolden China to take a more aggressive approach to Taiwan. 'It would be difficult for these four countries to sign a formal treaty that would commit them to doing that kind of thing, but you can see it emerging spontaneously or organically out of a crisis situation,' Chivvis said. And a crisis in one region can spill over to another part of the world. 'If you look at, for example, the Gulf Arab states, they're critical energy suppliers to both China and Taiwan,' said Michael Singh, managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'If you look at Iran, Iran has the capabilities we've seen through proxies like the Houthis to disrupt international waterways. So, to think that a conflict over Taiwan will be restricted to the Indo-Pacific is, I think at this stage, simply naive and ignoring.' Blinken describes the relationship among the four countries as 'largely transactional,' adding that their cooperation 'entails tradeoffs and risks that each may find more distasteful over time.' 'And yet all four revisionists share an abiding commitment to the overarching objective of challenging the United States and the international system,' Blinken wrote. 'That will continue to drive their cooperation, especially as the United States and other countries stand up to their revisionism.'

US lawmakers label Pakistan's governance 'military rule with civilian facade'	Islamabad, Pakistan — More than 60 members of Congress wrote to President Joe Biden on Wednesday, urging his intervention 'to secure the release of political prisoners' in Pakistan, including former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The letter stated that in February, the Pakistani parliamentary elections saw a historic level of irregularities, including widespread electoral fraud, state-led efforts to disenfranchise voters, and the arrest and detention of political leaders, journalists and activists. The U.S. lawmakers echoed calls for Khan's immediate release and an end to the widespread arbitrary detention of supporters of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Party. 'At a minimum, we ask your administration to urgently secure the guarantees from the Pakistani government for Khan's safety and well-being and urge U.S. Embassy officials to visit him in prison,' the letter to Biden read. The American lawmakers expressed their concern about what they denounced as the 'ongoing widespread human rights violations' in Pakistan following the country's parliamentary elections. 'More broadly, developments since the February vote point to a clear turn towards authoritarianism in the country,' the letter said. '… Simply put, Pakistan's current system amounts to 'military rule with civilian facade.' ' The representatives noted that the Pakistani government also has intensified its crackdown on social media and the internet as part of a broader effort to suppress political activism and pressure journalists. The letter was written by Representative Greg Casar; Representatives Jim McGovern and Summer Lee are co-leaders of the group. The letter describes Khan, 72, as a political leader in Pakistan 'with widespread support in the country.' There was no immediate reaction to the letter from the White House, nor have Pakistani officials commented on it. Khan has been imprisoned since August 2023 on multiple allegations, including corruption and inciting violence against military facilities. He denies any wrongdoing. In June, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 368-7 to urge 'the full and independent investigation of claims of interference or irregularities' in the February polls in Pakistan. Islamabad strongly objected to the resolution, saying it 'stems from an incomplete understanding of the political situation and electoral process' in the South Asian nation. Khan, the cricket star-turned-prime minister, was ousted from power in 2022 through an opposition parliamentary vote of no confidence. The move, which the deposed leader rejected as illegal, led to unprecedented political turmoil in nuclear-armed Pakistan, a country of more than 240 million people. The deposed leader accused the military of orchestrating his removal and initiated numerous lawsuits subsequently. The legal challenges, which Khan rejects as politically motivated, have prevented him from pursuing public office. His party was also subjected to a state crackdown and eventually prohibited from participating in the February election. Khan and independent critics maintain the vote was rigged to allow pro-military parties to secure victory, allegations Sharif and military officials denied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-label-pakistan-s-governance-military-rule-with-civilian-facade-/7836522.html	2024-10-23T18:06:36-07:00	
US Justice Department warns Musk's super PAC over $1 million giveaways	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department has sent a letter to Elon Musk's super PAC warning that the billionaire Tesla CEO's $1 million giveaways may violate federal law, several media organizations reported on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter. A letter from the department's public integrity section, which investigates potential election-related law violations, went to the PAC. The Justice Department and Musk's America PAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. South African-born Musk, who has thrown his support behind Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ahead of the November 5 election, announced on Saturday while speaking before a crowd in Pennsylvania that he was giving away $1 million each day until Election Day to someone who signs his online petition supporting the U.S. Constitution. He handed $1 million checks to two separate people over the weekend — one to a man in Harrisburg on Saturday and another to a woman in Pittsburgh on Sunday. Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world's richest person, so far has supplied at least $75 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures, making the group a crucial part of Trump's bid to regain the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-warns-musk-s-super-pac-over-1-million-giveaways/7836813.html	2024-10-23T17:03:54-07:00	
Humanitarian aid workers face 'increasingly difficult' conditions	The president of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has announced the establishment of the Red Family Fund to honor humanitarian aid workers who have died in the line of duty. Kate Forbes told the organization's general assembly in Geneva that aid workers find themselves working under 'increasingly difficult' conditions that include not only an escalation in conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere but also a decrease in observance of international law. 'Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid,' Forbes said. So far this year, 30 of the group's 16 million humanitarian aid workers worldwide have died in the line of duty, she said. 'The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission,' the IFRC president said. She described each loss as a deep wound but said the deaths would not weaken the organization's 'resolve to directly address these crises.' Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the gathering that humanitarian workers find themselves doing their jobs across the globe amid a world shaped by 'armed conflicts and political turmoil.' The Red Family Fund, according to the IFRC's website, honors volunteers and staff from the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies 'who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.' 'This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,' Forbes said. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/humanitarian-aid-workers-face-increasingly-difficult-conditions-/7836527.html	2024-10-23T16:37:17-07:00	
Pakistan's weapons programs face scrutiny after US curbs	islamabad — The latest U.S.-imposed restrictions on entities supporting Pakistan's defense programs may hinder Islamabad's future efforts to acquire sensitive defense technologies and its collaboration with China but are unlikely to affect Pakistan’s weapons development for now, experts say. Sixteen Pakistani firms were among 26 international companies added this week to a U.S, 'entities list,' making them ineligible to acquire U.S. items and technology without government authorization. Companies or individuals can be placed on the list if they are 'involved or pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States,' according to a U.S. Commerce Department statement. Nine of the 16 Pakistani companies added to the blacklist this week were accused of being front companies for a previously sanctioned company, Advanced Engineering Research Organization, deemed responsible for the country's cruise missile and strategic drone programs. The remaining seven entities were added for contributions to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, the Commerce Department statement said. Other companies added to the list this week were accused of procuring U.S.-made items with military applications for China, Iran, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Defense analysts told VOA that addition to the list is unlikely to slow Pakistan’s missile program, which has continued despite multiple rounds of U.S. curbs on entities supporting it. 'It will not make a difference to Pakistan,' said Pakistani defense analyst Salman Javed, who acknowledged that the country relies on the United States for other defense technology needs. 'I believe Pakistan's missile program is in an advanced stage, and U.S. restrictions will have no impact on it.' Former Pakistani army General Talat Masood said Pakistan has looked more to China than the United States for 'the expertise and technology' needed to advance its drone program. But he said the new curbs might affect Pakistan’s future collaboration with China in the field of drones and their sale to other countries. Pakistan has not officially responded to the latest restrictions but objected last month when Washington blacklisted four companies, three Chinese and one Pakistani, for 'knowingly' transferring prohibited equipment to Pakistan. Islamabad said the sanctions were imposed 'without any evidence whatsoever.' Syed Irfan Ashraf, an assistant professor at the University of Peshawar in Pakistan, said the United States has long prevented arms technology sales in black markets to protect its interests. 'However, the timing and scrutiny of entities supporting Pakistan right now is crucial' because of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. In September, the U.S. State Department acted against five entities and one individual — all but one Chinese — that were involved in the proliferation of ballistic missiles and controlled missile equipment and technology to Pakistan. Salman Ali, a Pakistani scholar at the School of Politics at the Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad, said the recent wave of U.S. sanctions represents a distinct shift from the usual regulatory measures observed since Pakistan's de facto nuclearization and are aimed more at pressuring China. 'Over the past six rounds of U.S. curbs, it's clear that the focus has been on the technical exchanges between China and Pakistan. These sanctions are not only intended to curb the rapid advancement of missile and drone programs but are also seen as a strategy to pressure China,' Ali told VOA. Pakistan and Iran are both members of the China-led regional alliance Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which opposed the unilateral sanctions in its recently concluded summit October 16 in Islamabad.

For Tibetan political leader, 'Middle Way' to autonomy is still core focus	Prague/Washington — In the lobby of an upscale hotel in Prague, Sikyong Penpa Tsering talked about death — specifically, the eventuality that China's Xi Jinping will one day die. 'Nothing is permanent. Even our life is not permanent. We are born, and we have to die. So even empires rise and fall. Governments rise and fall. Xi Jinping will also have to die. So, these are inevitable,' said Tsering, leader of Tibet's exiled government, the Central Tibetan Administration. He said it casually, matter-of-factly, as if he wasn't talking about the potential downfall of the world's second-most powerful government and the inevitable death of its powerful leader. 'China is going to change. It has to change. There is no other choice,' Tsering told VOA last week on the sidelines of the Forum 2000 democracy conference in the Czech capital Prague. Sitting on a leather chair and wearing a black Tibetan vest and a blue button-down shirt, Tsering spoke about how this fundamental Buddhist idea of impermanence gives him hope for his homeland. Reports say abuse has increased China annexed Tibet in 1950, and since then human rights abuses in the region have steadily grown, according to reports from the U.S. State Department and rights groups. Beijing claims the region has been part of China since 'ancient times.' It views the Central Tibetan Administration, or CTA, as a separatist organization and says that no government should allow the Dalai Lama — the spiritual and one-time political leader of Tibet — to visit. But for Tsering, under the Buddhist concept of impermanence, everything in life — even Beijing's power and repression — is transient. Although Tsering's hope abounds, so does his pragmatism. The prospect of an improved human rights landscape and more autonomy remains far-off. It doesn't help that the CTA and Beijing barely have an open communication channel, Tsering said. 'Even if we manage to re-establish contact, there's no possibility of anything really coming out of it,' Tsering said. For now, the backchannel dialogue is for the long term, not the short term, the democratically elected leader added. But in an ideal world, where Beijing was willing to engage with the CTA, among the top priorities would be human rights in Tibet, as well as the Middle Way Approach — the Tibet administration policy that would give the region increased autonomy while remaining part of China. Those are among the issues Tsering sought to raise with political and civil society leaders at Forum 2000, an annual gathering on democracy human rights issues founded by former Czech President Vaclav Havel. Advocating for 'Middle Way' Although based in India, Tsering frequently travels the world to make his case for the Tibetan people. But he feels a particular kinship with the Czech Republic and other countries in Europe that once suffered under communism. 'They have experienced what our people are going through now,' Tsering said. 'That makes it easier for them to understand.' Tsering has about one and a half years left in his five-year term. He said he hasn't decided whether he'll pursue a second term, but one of his priorities for the next 18 months is to advocate for the Middle Way Approach. The Middle Way Approach accepts Tibet's status as part of China but advocates for increased autonomy, like greater freedoms for religion, language and culture. It's an attempt to balance Beijing's concerns about Tibetan separatism and Tibetans' concerns about cultural preservation. Tsering said he doesn't really understand why Beijing appears to be so opposed to the approach, since it doesn't call for independence. 'Dying a slow death culturally' For years, reports from news outlets and rights groups have detailed Beijing's grave rights abuses in Tibet. Chinese authorities are particularly repressive of any signs of dissent among Tibetans in the region, with more than 5,600 political prisoners formerly or currently jailed in Tibet since 1990, according to the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy. Expressions of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan cultural identity are also restricted. 'We are dying a slow death culturally, because China is squeezing us out of our breath like a python, squeezing it out, slowly but surely,' Tsering said. Authorities have repressed the use of the Tibetan language, and the United Nations estimates that around 1 million children have been forcibly separated from families and sent to state-run boarding schools to assimilate into the dominant Han-Chinese culture. 'It's very clear that the Chinese government seeks to essentially hollow out and erase Tibetans' identities,' Sophie Richardson, a visiting scholar at Stanford and the former China director at Human Rights Watch, told VOA. China's Foreign Ministry did not reply to VOA's email requesting comment for this story. Other human rights issues include Beijing's harassment of exiled Tibetan journalists and activists in a process known as transnational repression. 'It's essentially to prevent anybody from hearing an alternative version of their story or critique of their version. The Chinese government wants everybody to believe its version of history,' Richardson said. But when it comes to transnational repression, Tsering said he isn't a target. 'They don't threaten me because they know it doesn't make sense. I won't listen. If they threaten me, I'll be much worse,' Tsering said. 'If they ask me not to do something, I do it more because I know it hurts them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/for-tibetan-political-leader-a-middle-way-to-autonomy-is-still-core-focus/7836462.html	2024-10-23T16:00:24-07:00

Tensions grip Bangladesh as student protesters demand president's resignation	DHAKA, BANGLADESH — Political tension in Bangladesh grew Wednesday after a leading student group called for the country's figurehead president to resign over his comments that appeared to call into question former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation in August. The interim government was expected to hold a Cabinet meeting to discuss the issue Thursday, while student protesters accused President Mohammed Shahabuddin of collaborating with Hasina's 'fascist' regime. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement set a two-day deadline for Shahabuddin to step down. Hundreds of protesters rallied in the capital, Dhaka, on Tuesday and into Wednesday while others attempted to storm the presidential palace. Police and witnesses said security officials used stun grenades to disperse people. Shahabuddin told a Bengali-language newspaper earlier this week that he had not seen Hasina's resignation letter as she fled to India in August during a student-led uprising. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took power and formed a government after Hasina stepped down on August 5. Shahabuddin told the Manab Zamin daily that he only heard about Hasina's resignation but had not seen the letter, saying he tried to collect it 'many times but failed.' He added: 'Maybe she did not have the time.' The statement infuriated the Yunus-led government and student activists. It contradicted Shahabuddin's address to the nation on August 5, when he said he had received the letter. Under Bangladesh's constitution, an elected prime minister must submit his or her resignation in writing to the president. Shahabuddin was appointed to the post by parliament after Hasina was elected prime minister for a fourth consecutive term in January. Shahabuddin dissolved parliament before the interim government took power on August 8. Asif Nazrul, the country's law adviser, recently accused Shahabuddin of spreading falsehoods and questioned if he was fit to remain in office. Experts said the resignation or removal of the president could create a constitutional vacuum. Under the constitution, only parliament can impeach the president. A senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which is led by Hasina's main rival and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, met with Yunus on Wednesday. 'If the associates of the fallen autocracy attempt to create any constitutional and political crisis, the pro-democracy and agitating political parties and different organizations will deal with it unitedly,' Nazrul Islam Khan, a standing committee member of the party, told reporters. Also on Wednesday, the Ministry of Home Affairs in a notice banned the Bangladesh Chhatra League, an influential student wing of Hasina's Bangladesh Awami League party, with immediate effect, saying the government made the decision following the country's Anti-Terrorism Act. The notice said the government has evidence that the 76-year-old student body has been involved in 'subversive' activities against the state since Hasina stepped down. It did not share the evidence. The decision came a day after the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement issued a seven-day ultimatum to the government to ban the group. Hasina is now in India, but the Yunus-led government has said it would seek her expatriation to try her for alleged crimes against humanity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tensions-grip-bangladesh-as-student-protesters-demand-president-s-resignation/7836343.html	2024-10-23T13:01:13-07:00

Ex WH chief of staff: Trump wanted generals like Hitler's and said Nazi leader 'did some good things’	Washington — Donald Trump's longest-serving chief of staff is warning that the Republican presidential nominee meets the definition of a fascist and that while in office, Trump suggested that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler 'did some good things.' The comments from John Kelly, the retired Marine general who worked for Trump in the White House from 2017 to 2019, came in interviews published Tuesday in The New York Times and The Atlantic. They build on past warnings from former top Trump officials as the election enters its final two weeks. Kelly has long been critical of Trump and previously accused him of calling veterans killed in combat 'suckers' and 'losers.' His new warnings emerged as Trump seeks a second term vowing to dramatically expand his use of the military at home and suggesting he would use force to go after Americans he considers 'enemies from within.' 'He commented more than once that, 'You know, Hitler did some good things, too,'' Kelly recalled to the Times. Kelly said he would usually quash the conversation by saying 'nothing (Hitler) did, you could argue, was good,' but that Trump would occasionally bring up the topic again. In his interview with the Atlantic, Kelly recalled that when Trump raised the idea of needing 'German generals,' Kelly would ask if he meant 'Bismarck's generals,' referring to Otto von Bismarck, the chancellor who oversaw the unification of Germany. 'Surely you can't mean Hitler's generals,' Kelly recalled asking Trump. To which the former president responded, 'Yeah, yeah, Hitler's generals.' Trump's campaign denied the accounts Tuesday, with campaign spokesman Steven Cheung saying that Kelly had 'beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated.' Polls show the race is tight in swing states, and both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are crisscrossing the country making their final pitches to the sliver of undecided voters. Harris' campaign has spent considerable time reaching out to independent voters, using the support of longtime Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney and comments like Kelly's to urge past Trump voters to reject his candidacy in November. Harris' campaign held a call with reporters Tuesday to elevate the voices of retired military officials who highlighted how many of the officials who worked with Trump now oppose his campaign. 'People that know him best are most opposed to him, his presidency,' said retired Army Brig. Gen. Steve Anderson. Anderson said he wished Kelly would fully back Harris over Trump, something he has yet to do. But retired Army reserve Col. Kevin Carroll, a former senior counselor to Kelly, said Wednesday that the former top Trump official would 'rather chew broken glass than vote for Donald Trump.' Before serving as Trump's chief of staff, Kelly worked as the former president's secretary of homeland security, where he oversaw Trump's attempts to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Kelly was also at the forefront of the Trump administration's crackdown in immigration policy that led to the separation of thousands of immigrant parents and their children along the southern border. Those actions made him a villain to many on the left, including Harris. Kelly is not the first former top Trump administration official to cast the former president as a threat. Retired Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, who served as Trump's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Bob Woodward in his recent book 'War' that Trump was 'fascist to the core' and 'the most dangerous person to this country.' And retired Gen. Jim Mattis, who worked as secretary of defense under Trump, reportedly later told Woodward that he agreed with Milley's assessment. Throughout Trump's political rise, the businessman-turned-politician benefited from the support of military veterans. AP VoteCast found that about 6 in 10 military veterans said they voted for Trump in 2020, as did just over half of those with a veteran in the household. Among voters in this year's South Carolina Republican primary, AP VoteCast found that close to two-thirds of military veterans and people in veteran households voted for Trump over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump's toughest opponent in the 2024 Republican primary.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-wh-chief-of-staff-trump-wanted-generals-like-hitler-s-and-said-nazi-leader-did-some-good-things-/7836221.html	2024-10-23T11:38:41-07:00	
Border arrests fall in September, last monthly gauge before US elections	San Diego — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico fell 7% in September to a more than four-year low, authorities said Tuesday. It was likely the last monthly gauge during a presidential campaign in which Republican nominee Donald Trump has made immigration a signature issue. The Border Patrol made 53,858 arrests, down from 58,009 in August and the lowest tally since August 2020, when arrests totaled 47,283, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Mexicans accounted for nearly half of the arrests, becoming a greater part of the mix. In December, when arrests reached an all-time high of 250,000, Mexicans made up fewer than 1 in 4. Arrests for other major nationalities seen at the border, including Guatemalans, Hondurans, Colombians and Ecuadoreans, have plunged this year. San Diego was again the busiest corridor for illegal crossings in September, followed by El Paso, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona. For the government's fiscal year that ended on September 30, the Border Patrol made 1.53 million arrests after topping 2 million in each of the previous two years for the first time. The White House touted the numbers as proof that severe asylum restrictions introduced in June were having the intended effect, and blamed congressional Republicans for opposing a border security bill that failed in February. Vice President Kamala Harris has used that line of attack against Trump to try to blunt criticism that the Biden administration has been weak on immigration enforcement. 'The Biden Harris administration has taken effective action, and Republican officials continue to do nothing,' said White House spokesman Angelo Fernández Hernández. The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a frequent administration critic and advocate for immigration restrictions, attributed recent declines to more enforcement by Mexican officials within their own borders, saying the White House 'essentially outsourced U.S. border security to Mexico in advance of the 2024 election — policies that can be reversed at any time that the government of Mexico chooses.' Arrests fell sharply after Mexico increased enforcement in December, and took a steeper dive after the U.S. asylum restrictions took effect in June. U.S. officials have not been shy about highlighting Mexico's role. Mexican authorities are encountering more migrants this year while deportations remain relatively low, creating a bottleneck. Panamanian authorities reported an increase in migrants walking through the notorious Darien Gap during September, though numbers are still well below last year. Troy Miller, acting CBP commissioner, said last week that the administration is working with Mexico and other countries to jointly address migration. 'We continue to be concerned about any bottlenecks, we continue to look at those, we continue to address them with our partners,' Miller said at a news conference in San Diego. The Biden administration has promoted new and expanded legal pathways to enter the country in an effort to discourage illegal crossings. In September, CBP allowed more than 44,600 people to enter with appointments on an online system called CBP One, bringing the total to 852,000 since it was introduced in January 2023. Another Biden policy allows up to 30,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela with financial sponsors to enter monthly through airports. More than 531,000 people from those four countries have entered that way up through September.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7836194.html	2024-10-23T11:22:59-07:00

Fernando Valenzuela, Mexican-born pitcher whose feats for Dodgers fueled 'Fernandomania,' dies at 63	LOS ANGELES — Fernando Valenzuela, the Mexican-born phenom for the Los Angeles Dodgers who inspired 'Fernandomania' while winning the NL Cy Young Award and Rookie of the Year in 1981, has died. He was 63. The team said he died Tuesday night at a Los Angeles hospital but did not provide the cause or other details. His death comes as the Dodgers prepare to open the World Series on Friday night at home against the New York Yankees. Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Valenzuela would be honored during the series at Dodger Stadium. Valenzuela left his color commentator job on the Dodgers' Spanish-language television broadcast in September without explanation. He was reported to have been hospitalized earlier this month. His job kept him as a regular at Dodger Stadium, where he held court in the press box dining room before games and remained popular with fans who sought him out for photos and autographs. 'God bless Fernando Valenzuela!' actor and Dodgers fan Danny Trejo posted on X. Valenzuela was one of the most dominant players of his era and a wildly popular figure in the 1980s, although he was never elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. However, he is part of Cooperstown, which features several artifacts including a signed ball from his no-hitter in 1990. 'He is one of the most influential Dodgers ever and belongs on the Mount Rushmore of franchise heroes,' Stan Kasten, team president and CEO, said in a statement. 'He galvanized the fan base with the Fernandomania season of 1981 and has remained close to our hearts ever since, not only as a player but also as a broadcaster. He has left us all too soon.' Valenzuela's rise from humble beginnings as the youngest of 12 children in Mexico and his feats on the mound made him hugely popular and influential in Los Angeles' Latino community while helping attract new fans to Major League Baseball. Their fondness for him continued after his retirement. '63 is way too young.... A piece of my childhood is gone,' actor and Access Hollywood co-host Mario Lopez posted on X. 'Growing up as a Mexican kid one of the main reasons I'm a Dodgers fan is because of Fernando. ... Not only a great player, but a great man to the community. What a legend.' Eva Torres, who is originally from Mexico City, drove from Anaheim to look at murals of Valenzuela on Sunset Boulevard near Dodgers Stadium. 'I wasn't a fan of baseball, but I am a fan of his,' she said. 'He's like me: an immigrant that came here to do great things.' In 1981, Valenzuela became the Dodgers' opening day starter as a rookie after Jerry Reuss was injured 24 hours before his scheduled start. He shut out the Houston Astros 2-0 and began the season 8-0 with five shutouts and an ERA of 0.50. He became the first player to win a Cy Young and Rookie of the Year in the same season. His performances created the delirium known as 'Fernandomania' among Dodgers fans. The ABBA hit Fernando would play as he warmed up on the mound. 'Fernando Valenzuela was a true icon of the Dodgers and the game,' U.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California posted on X. 'His legacy and connection with the Latino community in LA is one of the reasons I fell in love with the Dodgers.' Valenzuela was 13-7 and had a 2.48 ERA in his first season, which was shortened by a players' strike. He was an All-Star selection every year from 1981-86, when he recorded 97 victories, 84 complete games, 1,258 strikeouts and a 2.97 ERA. He was 5-1 with a 2.00 ERA in eight postseason starts. He earned two Silver Slugger Awards and a Gold Glove. Valenzuela's no-hitter on June 29, 1990, a 6-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals, was an emotional career highlight. He struck out seven and walked three. 'If you have a sombrero, throw it to the sky!' Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully exclaimed in his game call. Nicknamed 'El Toro' by the fans, Valenzuela had an unorthodox and memorable pitching motion that included looking skyward at the apex of each windup. His repertoire included a screwball — making him one of the few pitchers of his era who threw that pitch regularly. It was taught to him by teammate Bobby Castillo after the Dodgers felt Valenzuela, who wasn't known as a hard thrower, needed another pitch. Early in his Dodgers career, Valenzuela spoke little English and had trouble communicating with his catchers. Rookie Mike Scioscia learned Spanish and became Valenzuela's personal catcher before becoming the team's full-time catcher. Valenzuela was a better-than-average hitter, with 10 career home runs. Eventually, his pitching was compromised by nagging shoulder problems that kept him out of the 1988 postseason, when the Dodgers won the World Series. The team released Valenzuela just before the 1991 season. He also pitched for the former California Angels, Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Phillies, San Diego Padres and St. Louis Cardinals. He retired in 1997, going 173-153 with a 3.54 ERA in 17 seasons, the all-time major league leader in wins and strikeouts (2,074) by a Mexican-born player. In 11 seasons with the Dodgers, he was 141-116 with a 3.31 ERA. After retiring from MLB, Valenzuela remained active in Mexico's winter league. He played for the Aguilas de Mexicali in the Pacific League until he was 44. He retired on Dec. 20, 2006. 'We regret the passing of a Mexican baseball legend, his legacy will remain forever in our league and in the heart of our fans,' the league said in a statement. The baseball summer league as well other sports entities in Mexico, including the Mexican Soccer Federation and the National Sports Commission, also mourned his death. 'I think we, all Mexicans, are sad for the Valenzuela loss, and we express our solidarity with his family,' new Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said at her daily news conference. Valenzuela is not only considered Mexico's greatest baseball player, but he also is widely considered one of its top three athletes of all time, along with soccer player Hugo Sanchez and boxer Julio Cesar Chavez. 'It's a sad night. The news has shocked me, my soul and my spirit, it's a tremendous loss,' said Sanchez, now a sports analyst for ESPN. 'He was a symbol for Mexican sports during a historic moment.' Valenzuela's rise from his tiny hometown of Etchohuaquila in the Mexican state of Sonora to stardom in the U.S. was improbable. He was the youngest child in a large family who tagged along when his older brothers played baseball. He signed his first pro contract at age 16, and soon began overpowering older players in the Mexican Central League. In 1978, legendary Dodgers scout Mike Brito was in Mexico to watch a shortstop when Valenzuela entered the game as a reliever. He immediately commanded Brito's attention and at age 18, Valenzuela signed with the Dodgers in 1979. He was sent to the California League that same year. In 1980, Valenzuela was called up to the Dodgers in September and soon made his big league debut as a reliever. He remains the only pitcher in MLB history to win the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards in the same season. The left-hander was the National League's starting pitcher in the All-Star Game in 1981, the same year the Dodgers won the World Series. During his career, he made the cover of Sports Illustrated and visited the White House. In 2003, Valenzuela returned to the Dodgers as the Spanish-language radio color commentator for NL games. Twelve years later, he switched to the color commentator job on the team's Spanish-language TV feed. 'He consistently supported the growth of the game through the World Baseball Classic and at MLB events across his home country,' Manfred said in a statement. 'As a member of the Dodger broadcasting team for more than 20 years, Fernando helped to reach a new generation of fans and cultivate their love of the game. Fernando will always remain a beloved figure in Dodger history and a special source of pride for the millions of Latino fans he inspired.' He was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014. Five years later, the Mexican League retired Valenzuela's No. 34 jersey. The Dodgers followed in 2023 after keeping his number out of circulation since he last pitched for the team in 1991. The team has a rule that requires a player to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame before the Dodgers retire his number, but they made an exception for Valenzuela. The Dodgers named Valenzuela as part of the 'Legends of Dodger Baseball' in 2019 and inducted him into the team's Ring of Honor in 2023. He became a U.S. citizen in 2015. Valenzuela served on the coaching staff for Mexico during the World Baseball Classic in 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2017. He was a part-owner of the Mexican League team Tigres de Quintana Roo, with son Fernando Jr. serving as team president and son Ricky serving as general manager. Fernando Jr. played in the San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox organizations as a first baseman. 'To talk about Mexican baseball is to talk about Fernando Valenzuela. Thank you for putting Mexico's name high,' Baseball's National Teams Committee said on X. 'We join the Valenzuela Burgos family in their sorrow.' In addition to his sons, he is survived by his wife, Linda, who was a schoolteacher from Mexico whom he married in 1981, and daughters Linda and Maria as well as seven grandchildren.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fernando-valenzuela-mexican-born-pitcher-whose-feats-for-dodgers-fueled-fernandomania-dies-at-63-/7836121.html	2024-10-23T10:43:47-07:00	
Modi, Xi meeting signals thaw in frosty India-China ties	NEW DELHI — Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed the need to boost cooperation between the two countries on Wednesday during the first bilateral meeting held between the two leaders in five years. The meeting between Xi and Modi, held on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan, signaled a thaw in the icy hostility that has marked ties between the Asian giants since a bloody border clash between their armies in 2020. Televised images showed the two leaders shaking hands before they went into the meeting. It took place days after their governments announced an accord that is expected to ease military tensions along the disputed frontier where tens of thousands of soldiers have been massed on a war footing since the 2020 clash. 'The two sides should strengthen communication and cooperation, properly handle divergences and differences, and realize each other's development dreams,' Chinese state broadcaster CCTV quoted Xi as saying at the start of the meeting. He said that it was important for both sides to 'shoulder our international responsibilities.' 'It should be our priority to maintain peace and tranquility on the border,' Modi said. 'Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity should be the basis of our relationship.' A statement by the Indian Foreign Ministry said the two leaders affirmed that stable, predictable and amicable bilateral relations between India and China will have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters after the meeting that the endorsement of the recent agreement by the two leaders will lead to an easing of the situation along their frontier. 'Peace in the border areas will create space for returning toward normalization of ties,' Misri said. 'Now we must walk along that path.' The pact announced earlier this week involves allowing militaries from both sides to patrol contested sections of their Himalayan border. It aims at preventing border clashes and ensuring that the countries can 'quickly de-escalate' when there are disputes, according to Indian officials. China said on Tuesday that Beijing would work in the next stage to 'properly implement the plan with the Indian side.' In the last four years, both countries have withdrawn troops from some disputed areas after talks between their diplomats and military leaders, but there has been no breakthrough in reducing border tensions. On the other hand, both countries have raced to build roads and strengthen infrastructure in the high Himalayas, where the troops are backed by fighter jets and artillery tanks. It is not clear if there will be any withdrawal of troops from the border areas, but the accord is seen as a first step in ending the military standoff. The 2020 border clash killed 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers. Smaller clashes took place in 2021 and 2022, raising fears of bigger clashes between troops in close proximity along disputed stretches of their 4,000-kilometer Himalayan border. Modi held brief meetings with Xi in Indonesia on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in 2022 and the BRICS summit in Johannesburg last year, but the two leaders had not held a bilateral meeting since 2019. Xi did not attend the Group of 20 meeting hosted by India last year. Political commentators in India called Wednesday’s meeting significant. 'It marks a major step in trying to normalize ties between the two countries,' said Manoj Joshi at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'Both countries are trying to lower the temperatures, but of course there is still a long distance to go.' India’s estrangement with China in recent years had prompted New Delhi to build closer defense and economic ties with the United States and Western countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7836079.html	2024-10-23T10:32:16-07:00	
Human Rights Watch criticizes Burkina Faso for omitting abuses in state report	Nairobi, Kenya — Human Rights Watch is calling out the government of Burkina Faso for failing to include human rights violations taking place in the country in a report to the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights. Burkinabe authorities, security forces and terror groups are all accused of widespread abuses against civilians and restrictions on people’s rights and freedoms. The commission requires member states to report on the human rights situation in their countries and the measures taken by the authorities to address the abuses. The last report covers 2015 to 2021 and was reviewed Wednesday. Allan Ngari, HRW’s Africa advocacy director, said Burkina Faso's reporting does not cover more recent abuses in the country. 'The report falls short of a number of human rights violations that we have been documenting as Human Rights Watch between 2021 to 2024, so this information is not readily available for the commission at this point,' Nagari said, adding that the group has shared reports with the commission to take recent years into consideration. Local and international human rights groups say widespread human rights violations are taking place in the country as the military government wrestles with insecurity caused by Islamist extremist groups. The rights groups say abuses by the government and military include arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearance, torture, and interference with the judiciary and media. The Islamist groups are also accused of serious abuses against civilians, including summary executions, sexual violence, abductions, and besieging towns and villages across the country. Burkina Faso's report to the commission says the government has established a panel to investigate and prosecute terrorism acts, observe detainees' rights and train its security forces in international human rights and humanitarian law to prevent abuse. Paul Ogendi teaches law at the University of Nairobi and is a human rights expert attached to the African Commission on Human and People's Rights. He said periodic reporting of the human rights situation in a given country can help the country improve its record and save lives. 'The reporting obligation is very important to help the country adhere to the African charter or comply with the obligation under the African charter,' Ogendi said. 'When you do not report, then it's very hard for the commission through its mandate to help you as a country improve on aspects where there might be weaknesses.' Ngari said people in Burkina Faso continue to face abuses but there are also other concerns. Those include safeguarding civic space for activists and journalists and political opposition who have been targeted by the state and 'disappeared' but were forced to join the front lines of battle against Islamic armed groups. 'People who have no training in military operations and yet are put on the front line,' Ngari said. 'So we are urging the commission to take into cognizance these anomalies and violations of the African Charter and to ask the government of Burkina Faso to pursue accountability for serious abuses.' Ogendi explained which actions the commission can take against a country that fails to comply. 'Most of the action is taken for the head of states to take note of what is happening and perhaps in some cases urge the state to be compliant with the obligations under the African Charter,' Ogendi said. 'But I have also seen a situation where the commission can have a mission in those countries or they can have advocacy visits to try to talk to the head of states of those who are responsible.' Last year, the commission wrote to Burkina Faso following the killing of civilians in Namentenga and Yatenga province to initiate an investigation and ensure the protection of civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-watch-criticizes-burkina-faso-for-omitting-abuses-in-state-report-/7836096.html	2024-10-23T10:31:54-07:00	
Gabon to vote on constitution that would let military leader run for president	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Reactions were mixed in Gabon after military rulers this week announced that a referendum on a new constitution will be held November 16. The new charter would remove the post of prime minister, a move that critics say gives too much power to the president. The opposition is also unhappy that military leader General Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema would be allowed to run for president if the new constitution is approved. State media in Gabon is telling citizens that everyone 18 years and older has a civic duty to vote in the referendum. The country’s transitional military rulers said the new constitution would be a major step toward restoring civilian rule in Gabon and implementing recommendations of April's national dialogue — a nearly monthlong conference on how to achieve that objective. The proposed charter establishes August 30 as a Day of National Liberation to mark the bloodless coup in which Ngeuma seized power from President Ali Bongo last year. Military leaders say the coup saved Gabon from a serious political, economic and institutional crisis. The constitution would abolish the post of prime minister and create the post of vice president. Presidents would be directly elected by the people and limited to two seven-year terms. The new charter would also outlaw intimate relations between people of the same sex. Some Gabonese say the referendum is being rushed. Ondobo Emmanuel, a history student at Omar Bongo University in the capital, Libreville, said Gabon's transitional government officials should have taken at least two months to educate people on the basic principles and laws of the nation they are proposing before convening civilians to vote in a constitutional referendum. He said most people in Gabon neither read nor write and do not have access to television. Government officials said copies of the draft constitution have been distributed on social media platforms. However, an estimated 30% of the central African state’s civilians do not have internet access. Meanwhile, opposition parties say Nguema has not respected his promise to restore civilian rule by making it clear in the proposed constitution that the military should not play a role in politics. Jean Delors Biyogue, a member of the Constitutional Committee, defended the wording of the document. He said the proposed constitution would not bar qualified civilians and Gabon's defense staff members, including transitional president Nguema, from running for president because it would be undemocratic to restrain people who are capable from contributing to the welfare of Gabon. Biyogue also said the proposed constitution is revolutionary because it sets presidential term limits and makes it possible for power to alternate. If the constitution is approved, he said, Gabon will not find itself in a situation in which a leader rules until he dies, as was the case with Ali Bongo’s father, Omar Bongo, who was in power for 42 years. When Nguema seized power last year, he promised to restore civilian rule within two years. He has not said whether he will run for president at the end of the transitional period. But Thierry Essame, a member of Gabon's Civil Society Movement, said the proposed constitution makes it clear that Nguema wants to stay in power. Essame said Gabon's military leaders have not explained to civilians that officials are proposing a presidential system in which Nguema would have excessive powers. He said a presidential system should have separation and sharing of powers among the legislative, executive and judicial arms of government; the proposed constitution would mean that in Gabon, the president would appoint members of the judiciary and could dissolve parliament. Official campaigning for the constitutional referendum begins November 6.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-to-vote-on-constitution-that-would-let-military-leader-run-for-president/7835997.html	2024-10-23T09:49:08-07:00	
G7 allies move ahead with $50 billion loan for Ukraine backed by frozen Russian funds	Washington — Ukraine will receive $50 billion in loans, backed by frozen Russian assets, from Group of Seven allies, the White House said Wednesday. Distribution of the money will begin by year's end, according to American officials who said the United States is providing $20 billion of the total. Leaders of the wealthy democracies agreed earlier this year to engineer the mammoth loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival after Russia's invasion. Interest earned on profits from Russia’s frozen central bank assets would be used as collateral. 'To be clear, nothing like this has ever been done before,' said Daleep Singh, the deputy national security adviser on international economics. 'Never before has a multilateral coalition frozen the assets of an aggressor country and then harnessed the value of those assets to fund the defense of the aggrieved party all while respecting the rule of law and maintaining solidarity.' At a ceremony Wednesday in Washington, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Ukraine's finance minister, Sergii Marchenko, planned to put in writing assurances that the U.S. loan will be paid for by the windfall proceeds of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets, not by American taxpayer dollars. 'Russia is paying for this support,' Yellen said at a news conference Monday where she said the loan package was close to being finalized. Singh said the Biden administration intends to divide the U.S. share of $20 billion between aiding Ukraine’s economy and military. It will require congressional action to send military aid, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that weapons and equipment being promised now can take weeks or months to get to Ukraine. The additional $30 billion will come from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan, among others. The idea of using Russia’s frozen assets to help Ukraine faced resistance at first from European officials who cited legal and financial stability concerns. The move gained momentum after more than a year of negotiations between finance officials and after President Joe Biden in April signed legislation that let the government seize the roughly $5 billion in Russian state assets in the U.S. The G7 announced in June that most of the loan would be backed by profits being earned on roughly $260 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of that money is held in EU nations. The U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. The timing of the loan's disbursement has been called into question, coming about two weeks before the presidential election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. The candidates have taken opposing views on the threat from Russia. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin dismissed suggestions that military aid to Ukraine approved by the Biden administration now could be negated by any new team in power. 'I think we’re pretty sure that these materials will continue to flow,' Austin said, adding that he is confident it all will be delivered 'on the timeline that we’ve outlined.' The World Bank’s latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-allies-are-moving-ahead-with-50-billion-loan-for-ukraine-backed-by-frozen-russian-funds/7835996.html	2024-10-23T09:45:24-07:00	
Taiwan unveils plans to cope with potential Chinese military blockade	taipei, taiwan — Taiwan is stepping up efforts to strengthen its capabilities to respond to a potential military blockade by China, as Beijing increases military pressure on the democratically ruled island. In a report outlining Taiwan’s wartime food plan, which was submitted to parliament on Tuesday, the Ministry of Agriculture said it had maintained a three-month rice stockpile and ensured food and critical supplies were stored evenly across the island. According to the ministry, the current rice stockpile can sustain Taiwan for seven months, and its fish feed inventory is enough to support fishing in ponds for over three months if sea fishing is not possible. The government said it is also drafting plans to prepare for rice rationing during wartime. In the event of a Chinese military blockade, Taiwanese authorities said they would dedicate more farmland to grow rice and use additional ponds to grow aquaculture. The crops that Taiwan would prioritize growing in the event of war include sweet potatoes, soybeans and fresh vegetables. The ministry also plans to set up a task force to conduct a monthly inventory of the island’s food resources. Officials from Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs also laid out plans to boost Taiwan’s energy reserves and energy supply. Hu Wen-chong, director of the department of state-owned enterprise management at Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs, told lawmakers Wednesday that the government plans to set up three natural gas receiving stations to enhance the natural gas safety stock to more than 14 days. Taiwan currently has enough stock to maintain natural gas supplies for eight days. In the event of a natural gas shortage during wartime, Hu told lawmakers that the government could activate some decommissioned coal-fired power plants to support the island’s energy supply needs. Maintaining Taiwan’s oil supply is another concern. Taiwan imports close to 70% of its oil from the Middle East, which some legislators worry could be affected if China pressures regional countries to halt exports to the island during a blockade. Hu said the island has diversified its oil procurement from other countries, such as the United States and Indonesia. Analysts welcomed the preparations for a potential blockade but said Taiwan’s wartime food and energy reserve plans were designed to cope with food natural disasters, such as typhoons and earthquakes. 'Wartime is different from natural disasters because there won’t be threats posed by the Chinese military during an earthquake,' Lin Ying-yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. 'For these plans to work in wartime scenarios, there is still a lot of room for improvement.' Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, noted that Taiwan has been taking monthly inventories of critical supplies and storing these resources across the island for a long time. 'There are close to 1,000 grain silos of various sizes across Taiwan, and it has been conducting critical resource distribution drills during the annual Wan An air-defense exercise in July,' Su said. Natural gas accounts for around half of Taiwan’s electricity, a crucial resource that Taiwan will not be able to import during a Chinese blockade. Su said figuring out ways to use the island's oil and coal stocks to supply electricity is important. In a phone interview with VOA, Su cited a report from Taiwan’s Energy Administration Act that said the island has about five months’ worth of oil and coal reserve, with around 190 million tons of underground coal. Those resources could be used to supply electricity if Taiwan experiences a natural gas shortage during a Chinese blockade, Su said. Chinese blockade 'an act of war' Over the past week, China has increased its military pressure on Taiwan, staging a one-day blockade-style military exercise around the island just days after Taiwan President Lai Ching-te‘s National Day speech on October 10. In the speech, Lai said the People’s Republic of China — China’s official name — has no right to represent Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China. Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory. China also began holding live-fire air and sea drills near Niushan island off the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Taiwan’s defense minister Wellington Koo said a Chinese aircraft carrier group sailed through the Taiwan Strait. The group was led by the Liaoning, China’s oldest aircraft carrier. Taiwan’s defense ministry said it was closely monitoring the Liaoning’s movement. Koo also said Beijing’s 'Joint Sword-2024B' exercise, which took place on October 13, fell short of the definition of an actual blockade since the Chinese military didn’t impose no-flight and no-sail zones. 'If you really want to carry out a so-called blockade, which according to international law is to prohibit all aircraft and ships entering the area, then according to United Nations resolutions it is regarded as a form of war,' he told journalists at Taiwan’s parliament on Wednesday. Koo added that since around one-fifth of global freight passes through the Taiwan Strait, a blockade imposed by China would have global consequences. 'The international community could not sit by and just watch,' Koo told lawmakers during a legislative session on Wednesday. Since August 2022, China has held at least four blockade-style military exercises around Taiwan and each exercise has served as a response to high-level political exchanges between Taiwan and the U.S. or important speeches delivered by Taiwan’s president. Lin at Tamkang University said while China is using these blockade-style military exercises to test its capabilities and improve coordination between different forces, they are also Beijing’s way of responding to major political remarks in Taiwan. 'China is trying to signal that whenever the Taiwanese government makes important political remarks, Beijing will respond militarily,' he told VOA. Lin said Taipei should closely monitor Chinese military exercises and adjust or improve the military’s defense and offense capabilities accordingly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-unveils-plans-to-cope-with-potential-chinese-military-blockade-/7835984.html	2024-10-23T09:45:13-07:00	
Voting for Harris another milestone in former President Jimmy Carter's legacy	Plains, Ga. — In a cavernous store filled with trinkets and knick-knacks, Philip Kurland is surrounded by politics. 'We’re the largest political memorabilia dealer in the United States,' he tells VOA as he sorts through numerous bins that line his shop. If there’s a button or badge supporting a political candidate, chances are Kurland has it, as he stops and inspects one button in particular. 'This is the number one button people request and come in for,' as he proudly shows an image of a smiling peanut shell. Every four years, Kurland stocks up on items featuring the candidates of the moment, and gauges support by the volume of related memorabilia he sells. 'Our sales have always equaled to who has won,' said Kurland. 'This year’s election is really hard to even say by my sales.' His store isn’t just any ordinary shop in the country. It’s the Plains Trading Post … as in Plains, Georgia, the hometown of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter with a population of around 600 people, where the streets are lined with dueling signs from the current election supporting both Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. 'For the first time ever, I’d say there was some tension over the upcoming election,' Kurland told VOA. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won Sumter County which encompasses Plains, and narrowly won the state of Georgia by 11,779 votes out of more than 5 million cast. 'It’s shocking that we’re a battleground state now,' said Kurland, acknowledging that polls continue to show a close race in Georgia this election cycle where both campaigns recognize every vote counts, including a prominent one cast by mail-in ballot from the most famous resident of Plains. 'I don’t think he’d miss any opportunity to vote,' said Kurland, 'I can remember one time when they passed a new law in the state that you had to show an ID, and he went to vote and didn’t have an ID, and they said, ‘you can’t vote.’ And he said, ‘I’m the president of the United States!’ and they said, ‘well, we’re sorry,’ and he had to go home and get an ID to vote, which I thought was hilarious.' 'He was excited to turn 100, but he’s more excited to cast his ballot for Vice President Harris,' Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson, explained to VOA during a recent interview. Jason Carter currently serves as chairman of the board of the former president’s global nonprofit Carter Center. 'It would be an incredible story, at the end of his 100-year life, that is continuing on as we know, to have grown up in the segregated south and for one of his last political acts is to help elect a Black woman who is a president, I do think it would be important,' he said. 'Jimmy Carter has already said it was important for him to vote for Barack Obama in 2008,' said Joe Crespino, a professor of history at Emory University. Crespino believes Carter’s vote this year is directly connected to his legacy, specifically his efforts to get the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, or ERA — which prohibits sex discrimination — ratified by some U.S. states while he was president in the 1970s. 'Voting for the first female candidate of color would be important for him not only because of his experiences with race over the course of his life but also his experiences in trying to advance women in public life,' he said. More than 40 years after Carter served in the White House, the ERA is still an unsettled issue as legal debates over its ratification continue. Jason Carter believes with a vote in the 2024 election, his grandfather is thinking as much about the future as he is the past. 'I think he wants to see this country brought back together,' said Carter. 'I think he wants to reduce that polarization; I think he wants us to focus on what makes us Americans first and fundamentally, and I think he thinks she [Harris] can do that.' Kurland said not everyone in Plains agrees with Jimmy Carter, or his candidate of choice, as he sees not just the tourists but some of the locals stopping in to pick up memorabilia. 'Some days you can’t get eight people to say the sun is shining at the same time,' he said. But Kurland admits everyone in Plains honors the man who continues to draw tens of thousands of tourists to their small town each year. 'Even though he’s come out for Kamala Harris, everyone that’s not for her would instantly forgive him and still love him,' Kurland said. As election day nears, Jimmy Carter continues to receive hospice care in his modest home in Plains on the edge of town, not far from the Depression-era boyhood farm where his story began 100 years ago.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voting-for-harris-another-milestone-in-former-president-jimmy-carter-s-legacy/7835958.html	2024-10-23T09:15:33-07:00	
Guatemalan publisher vows to keep defending his case from house arrest	Washington — Two days after his transfer from prison to house arrest, publisher Jose Ruben Zamora had a visitor: Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo. At the meeting Monday afternoon, Arevalo and Zamora had 'an open and frank dialogue with a focus on key issues for the future of the country,' according to the Guatemalan presidency. Zamora, 67, had been detained on questionable grounds for two years. In 2023, he was sentenced to six years in prison for money laundering. But an appeals court overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial for 2025. A court on Friday finally ordered Zamora to be released for 'human rights reasons' and because the 'prison term has exceeded the limits.' After his release the following day, the journalist said he was 'extraordinarily happy for all the support' he had received from fellow journalists and international media watchdogs. Zamora was arrested in July 2022 after publishing an editorial in his former media outlet El Periodico. International groups said the accusation of money laundering and other charges leveled at him were in response to his media coverage and reporting on corruption in the government of former president Alejandro Giammattei. Following the court order, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, the international lawyer who represents the publisher, said in a statement that 'Zamora will finally be released but is not yet free.' 'His release is conditional, and he continues to face spurious charges with the risk of a return to prison hanging over him. The Guatemalan authorities must now drop the charges and bring an end to this cruel persecution,' said Gallagher, of Doughty Street Chambers in London. The judge prohibited Zamora from leaving the country and ordered him to report to the prosecutor’s office every week. He may no longer be in prison, but he still faces legal challenges. Zamora said he will defend himself while under house arrest and deal with other issues. 'I do have to respond to obligations. I owe banks, I have no income, but I have to move forward,' Zamora told a group of journalists moments after his release. His case brought worldwide attention to the state of press freedom in Guatemala. The country ranks 138 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best environment. Press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which compiles the index, reports that even though freedom of the press is guaranteed in Guatemala’s constitution, politicians and other government officials violate that right continuously. Zamora founded El Periodico, an independent media outlet that exposed multiple corruption scandals in Guatemala, in 1996. After his arrest, it closed. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols welcomed Zamora’s release, reaffirming Washington's commitment to defending press freedom in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/president-arevalo-visits-guatemalan-publisher-under-house-arrest/7835944.html	2024-10-23T08:59:19-07:00	
Chinese official urges Apple to continue 'deepening' presence in China	A top Chinese official has urged tech giant Apple to deepen its presence and investment in innovation in the world’s second largest economy at a time when supply chains and companies are shifting production and operations away from China. As U.S.-China geopolitical tensions simmer and tech competition between Beijing and Western countries intensifies, foreign investment in China shrunk in 2023 to its lowest level in three decades, according to government statistics. The United States has banned the export of advanced technology to China and Beijing’s crackdown on spying in the name of national security concerns has spooked investors. On Wednesday, Jin Zhuanglong - China's Minister for Industry and Information Technology – told Apple CEO Tim Cook he hoped that, 'Apple will continue to deepen its presence in the Chinese market,' urging Cook to 'increase investment in innovation, grow alongside Chinese firms, and share in the dividends of high-quality investment,' according to a ministry statement. At the meeting Jin also discussed 'Apple's development in China, network data security management, (and) cloud services,' according to the statement. China has the world’s largest market for smartphones, and Apple is a leading competitor. However, increasingly the iPhone producer has lost market share in the country due to an increasing number of local rivals in the smartphone sector. In the second quarter of this year, AFP reports that Apple ranked sixth among smartphone vendors in China, holding a 16% market share, marking a drop of three positions compared to its ranking during the same period last year, according to analysis firm Canalys. Jin also repeated a frequent pledge from officials in Beijing that China would strive to provide a 'better environment' for global investors and 'continue to expand high-level opening up. Cook’s trip to China was his second of the year. His posts on the X-like Chinese social media platform Weibo showed he visited an Apple store in downtown Beijing, visited an organic farm, and toured ancient neighborhoods with prominent artists such as local photographer Chen Man. Cook added that he met with students from China’s Agricultural University and Zhejiang University to receive feedback on how iPhones and iPads can help farmers adopt more sustainable practices. Some information in this report came from Reuters and AFP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-official-urges-apple-to-continue-deepening-presence-in-china/7835927.html	2024-10-23T08:59:01-07:00	
Pakistani court grants bail, orders release of ex-leader's wife	ISLAMABAD — A federal high court in Pakistan on Wednesday approved the bail application of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's wife, ordering her release after months of imprisonment related to corruption allegations. The lawsuit against former first lady Bushra Bibi involves the alleged sale of state gifts worth half a million dollars during Khan’s time in office from 2018 to 2022, charges Bibi and Khan rejected as unfounded and politically motivated. It remained uncertain whether Bibi would be allowed to leave prison anytime soon, given the many other legal challenges the couple has faced since a parliamentary no-confidence vote ousted Khan's government 18 months ago. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, Party of the deposed prime minister praised Wednesday's court ruling but accused the authorities of employing delaying tactics to continue Bibi's 'unlawful incarceration.' The statement reiterated that Bibi is a housewife and that the case against her arose from a nontransparent investigation, labeling the charges as baseless. Khan, who has been imprisoned since August 2023, and his wife are in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, a garrison city next to Islamabad. Bibi has been detained since January after being sentenced, along with Khan, to 14 years in a separate graft case, although an appeals court suspended the sentence weeks later for a lack of evidence. Subsequently, appeals courts overturned or suspended other convictions and sentences, but Pakistani authorities refused to release the couple, instead announcing new charges against them in July related to the alleged sale of state gifts. Khan, 72, faces numerous charges, including corruption and violence against state institutions, all of which the former prime minister says are orchestrated at the behest of the powerful Pakistani military to keep him from returning to national politics, charges his successors and military officials denied. The legal challenges have prevented the former cricket star-turned-politician from pursuing public office. His party was banned from participating in the national election in February. Khan maintains that the election was rigged to allow pro-military parties to secure victory. In June, a panel of independent United Nations experts urged Pakistan to end Khan's incarceration, saying his detention had 'no legal basis.' New chief justice Meanwhile, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday approved the selection of the country’s next chief justice, who was recommended under newly enacted constitutional amendments that critics decried as detrimental to judicial independence. Justice Yahya Afridi, the third-most senior judge after the outgoing chief justice, was picked by a government-dominated parliamentary committee on Tuesday, a day after a ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hastily amended the constitution. Previously, the judge who was second in seniority would automatically take over as the country’s chief justice when the top judge retired at 65. Law Minister Azam Tarar said that Afridi will replace the outgoing Supreme Court chief justice, who retires on Friday, for a three-year term in line with the new constitutional amendments. Khan’s PTI denounced the legislation as an assault on Pakistan’s judicial independence, saying judges handpicked by the Sharif government would decide everything. U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk said he was concerned about the constitutional amendments. In a brief statement that his office posted on X, he noted that the changes 'were adopted hastily, without broad consultation and debate.' Turk warned that these changes 'will seriously undermine the independence of the judiciary' and emphasized the importance of aligning constitutional reforms with international human rights law. The Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists, or ICJ, described the new legislation as 'a blow to judicial independence, the rule of law and human rights protection' in Pakistan. 'These changes bring an extraordinary level of political influence over the process of judicial appointments and the judiciary’s own administration,' said Santiago Canton, ICJ’s secretary general. 'They erode the judiciary’s capacity to independently and effectively function as a check against excesses by other branches of the state and protect human rights,' Canton said. Sharif and his Cabinet ministers have defended the constitutional changes, claiming they would prevent alleged judicial interference in governance matters that led to the dismissal of successive governments in Pakistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-court-grants-bail-orders-release-of-ex-leader-s-wife/7835891.html	2024-10-23T08:32:43-07:00	
Attack at Turkey aviation site leaves some dead, injured	Ankara — A deadly attack was carried out at the Turkish Aerospace Industries' headquarters near Ankara on Wednesday, the government said, as broadcasters showed footage of several armed assailants entering the building amid reports of gunfire and a loud explosion. 'A terrorist attack was carried out against the TUSAS facilities in Kahramankazan, Ankara. Unfortunately, we have martyrs and injured people,' Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media X, referring to the Aerospace Industries. The cause and perpetrators of the blast and subsequent gunfire remained unclear. Some media reports claimed a suicide attack had occurred and that there were hostages inside the building. Officials have not confirmed this. Witnesses told Reuters that employees inside the building were taken by authorities to shelters and no one was permitted to leave. They said bombings may have taken place at different exits as employees were leaving work for the day. The state-owned Anadolu Agency said emergency services were dispatched to the site, while television images showed a damaged gate and an exchange of gunfire in a parking lot. The images showed the attackers carrying assault rifles and backpacks as they entered the building. Anadolu also said prosecutors had launched an investigation into the attack. TUSAS is one of Turkey's most important defense and aviation companies. It produces KAAN, the country's first national combat aircraft, among other projects, and has over 10,000 employees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/attack-at-turkey-aviation-site-leaves-some-dead-injured/7835845.html	2024-10-23T07:54:19-07:00	
Armed group says it takes control of Myanmar rare earth mining hub	An armed group fighting Myanmar's ruling military said it has taken control of a mining hub that is a major supplier of rare earth oxides to China, likely disrupting shipments of elements used in clean energy and other technologies. Rare earth mining in Myanmar is concentrated in Kachin state around the towns of Panwa and Chipwe, adjacent to southwestern China's Yunnan province. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) took control of Panwa on Oct. 19, spokesperson Colonel Naw Bu told Reuters on Tuesday. It had previously captured Chipwe, according to local Myanmar media. Reuters was not able to independently verify the status of both towns. The KIA is focused on managing the town of Panwa and has no current plans for rare earths or other economic issues, Naw Bu said. He did not respond when asked whether the KIA is open to working with China on rare earths. Previously, rare earth mining areas in Kachin state were under the control of militia group NDA-K, which is allied with Myanmar's junta government and welcomed payments from Chinese companies looking to establish mines. Last year, Myanmar supplied China with about 50,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides (REOs) from ion-adsorption clays (IACs), eclipsing China's domestic IAC mining quota of 19,000 tons and making it the world's top exporter of heavy REOs, according to broker Ord Minnett. 'Rebel control of these mining sites could potentially disrupt rare earth concentrate shipments into China, which have declined for four months straight owing to the monsoon season and other challenges,' research firm Adamas Intelligence said in a note on Monday. China is the world's biggest consumer and importer of rare earth ores and compounds, which it uses to produce refined rare earth and magnets, industries it dominates. Last month, China halted rare earth imports from Myanmar and suspended exports of ammonium sulphate used to leach rare earths there due to the conflict, said Ord Minnett analyst Matthew Hope. 'I expect the KIA plans to resume the REO business provided China is prepared to accept the exports and supply the technicians and ammonium sulphate. But I reckon it will expect payments before letting the companies do so,' Hope said. 'Once the conflict passes, we expect financial deals with Chinese miners will be renegotiated, likely delaying restarts until early-2025,' he said, adding that prices for REOs used in magnets are likely to rise as supply tightens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/armed-group-says-it-takes-control-of-myanmar-rare-earth-mining-hub/7835802.html	2024-10-23T07:09:56-07:00	
Greek PM deplores worst climate conditions in 4 decades	Athens — Wildfire-plagued Greece has suffered its worst year in terms of climate conditions in four decades in 2024, its prime minister told parliament on Wednesday. The already sun-baked Mediterranean region has been designated by scientists as a climate change 'hotspot', with warming higher than the global average, according to United Nations reports. Greece has been perennially struck by scorching heatwaves and destructive wildfires every summer, with conditions worsening in recent years. 'We were expecting a very difficult year in terms of climate, it was objectively the most difficult in the past 40 years according to data by all scientists, including those from the national climate monitor,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told parliament. He pointed to 'temperatures constantly higher than average', 'prolonged drought', 'strong winds', adding that Greece needed to face the consequences of climate change. The number of wildfires so far this year has reached 9,101, up from 7,163 last year, with 44,000 hectares (109,000 acres) burnt, the premier said during a parliamentary debate on the matter. Forest blazes began earlier than normal this year, with one igniting at the end of March in the country's north. Greece experienced its hottest summer ever, Athens's climate monitor said in September, with premature heatwaves in June, and record-high summer temperatures. June and July were the warmest months since records began in 1960, while August was the second hottest after August 2021, the observatory said on its meteo.gr website. More than 20 people died in Greek forest fires last year, with a massive blaze in Dadia national park dubbed the most destructive ever recorded in the European Union. Rising temperatures are leading to extended wildfire seasons and increasing the area burnt by the blazes, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greek-pm-deplores-worst-climate-conditions-in-4-decades/7835758.html	2024-10-23T06:38:42-07:00

Boeing reports $6 billion quarterly loss ahead of vote by union workers who have crippled production	EVERETT, Wash. — Boeing reported a loss of more than $6 billion in the third quarter and immediately turned its attention to union workers who will vote Wednesday whether to accept a company contract offer or continue their crippling strike, which has dragged on for nearly six weeks. New CEO Kelly Ortberg laid out his plan to turn Boeing around after years of heavy losses and damage to its reputation. In remarks he planned to deliver later Wednesday to investors, Ortberg said Boeing needs 'a fundamental culture change in the company.' To accomplish that, he said, company leaders need to spend more time on factory floors to know what is going on and 'prevent the festering of issues and work better together to identify, fix, and understand root cause.' Ortberg repeated that he wants to 'reset' management’s relationship with labor 'so we don’t become so disconnected in the future.' He expressed hope that machinists will vote to approve the company’s latest contract offer and end their strike. 'It will take time to return Boeing to its former legacy, but with the right focus and culture, we can be an iconic company and aerospace leader once again,' he said. The strike is an early test for Ortberg, a Boeing outsider who became CEO in August. Ortberg has already announced large-scale layoffs and a plan to raise enough cash to avoid a bankruptcy filing. He needs to convince federal regulators that Boeing is fixing its safety culture and is ready to boost production of the 737 Max — a crucial step to bring in much-needed cash. Boeing can't produce any new 737s, however, until it ends the strike by 33,000 machinists that has shut down assembly plants in the Seattle area. Ortberg has 'got a lot on his plate, but he probably is laser-focused on getting this negotiation completed. That’s the closest alligator to the boat,' said Tony Bancroft, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, a Boeing investor. Boeing hasn't had a profitable year since 2018, and the situation is about to get worse before it gets better. Boeing said Wednesday that it lost $6.17 billion in the period ended Sept. 30, with an adjusted loss of $10.44 per share. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research were calling for a loss of $10.34 per share. Revenue totaled $17.84 billion, matching Wall Street estimates. Shares were flat before the opening bell. Investors will be looking for Ortberg to project calm, determination and urgency as he presides over an earnings call for the first time since he ran Rockwell Collins, a maker of avionics and flight controls for airline and military planes, in the last decade. The biggest news of the day, however, is likely to come Wednesday evening, when the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers reveals whether striking workers are ready to go back to their jobs. They will vote at union halls in the Seattle area and elsewhere on a Boeing offer that includes pay raises of 35% over four years, $7,000 ratification bonuses, and the retention of performance bonuses that Boeing wanted to eliminate. Boeing has held firm in resisting a union demand to restore the traditional pension plan that was frozen a decade ago. However, older workers would get a slight increase in their monthly pension payouts. At a picket line outside Boeing’s factory in Everett, Washington, some machinists encouraged colleagues to vote no. 'The pension should have been the top priority. We all said that was our top priority, along with wage,' said Larry Best, a customer-quality coordinator with 38 years at Boeing. 'Now is the prime opportunity in a prime time to get our pension back, and we all need to stay out and dig our heels in.' Best also thinks the pay increase should be 40% over three years to offset a long stretch of stagnant wages, now combined with high inflation. 'You can see we got a great turnout today. I’m pretty sure that they don’t like the contract because that’s why I’m here,' said another picketer, Bartley Stokes Sr., who started working at Boeing in 1978. 'We’re out here in force, and we’re going to show our solidarity and stick with our union brothers and sisters and vote this thing down because they can do better.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-reports-6-billion-quarterly-loss-ahead-of-vote-by-union-workers-who-have-crippled-production-/7835692.html	2024-10-23T05:41:13-07:00	
Britain Prime Minister Starmer plays down Trump team claims of interference	London — Britain’s prime minister Keir Starmer on Wednesday played down allegations made by Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump's team of 'blatant foreign interference' by his Labour Party in the U.S. election, saying it was normal for its volunteers to campaign. Starmer also insisted that he maintained 'a good relationship' with Trump, having met him for talks last month. The former president's legal team filed a complaint to the U.S. Federal Election Commission alleging the 'British Labour Party made, and the [Kamala] Harris campaign accepted, illegal foreign national contributions.' The filing cited media reports that Labour officials, including the prime minister's new chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, traveled to the United States to advise the Harris campaign. Trump's team also submitted a now-deleted LinkedIn post by Labour director of operations Sofia Patel calling for volunteers to travel to North Carolina, saying 'we will sort out your housing.' Foreign nationals are allowed to volunteer in U.S. elections but may not be compensated. Starmer told media traveling with him to a Commonwealth meeting on the Pacific island of Samoa that his party had done nothing wrong, and that the volunteers had paid for themselves. 'The Labour party has volunteers, who have gone over pretty much every election,' he said. 'They're doing it in their spare time, they're doing it as volunteers, they're staying, I think, with other volunteers over there.' 'That's what they've done in previous elections, that's what they're doing in this election and that's really straightforward.' He also denied suggestions that it could damage relations with Britain's most important ally should Republican party candidate Trump beat Democrat Harris and secure a return to the White House. Starmer said he had 'established a good relationship' with the former president, having met him last month for a two-hour dinner at the former real estate tycoon's Trump Tower residence in New York. Adding to the dispute, Trump surrogate Elon Musk wrote on his X site on Tuesday that 'this is war' after leaked documents from campaign group Center for Countering Digital Hate appeared to show that one of its objectives was to 'kill Musk's Twitter,' X's former name. The campaign group and think-tank is led by a former Labour adviser and McSweeney is a former director.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-prime-minister-starmer-plays-down-trump-team-claims-of-interference-/7835597.html	2024-10-23T04:06:49-07:00

Namibia opposition demonstrates against ballots contract	Windhoek, Namibia — As Namibia prepares to hold a general election next month, the country's main opposition party has objected to the South African company hired to print the ballots. The company, Ren-Form, is under investigation by Zimbabwe’s anti-corruption commission for alleged fraudulent conduct during that country’s elections. Over 110 members of Namibia’s People’s Democratic Movement marched to the Electoral Commission of Namibia’s offices in the capital on Tuesday. They delivered a petition asking it to cancel a contract with Ren-Form, which is to design, print and deliver ballot papers to be used in Namibia’s elections. Party leader McHenry Venaani said Ren-Form is tainted by the 2023 allegations in Zimbabwe. 'The accusation of the money that is involved is going into millions of Namibian dollars, over 800 million Namibian dollars to be exact, [for a company] currently under investigation by the Zimbabwean anti-corruption commission for money-laundering and abuse of office,' Venaani said. VOA contacted Ren-Form for comment but has not received a response. Political analyst Rakkel Andreas, who was stationed as an observer in last year’s elections in Zimbabwe, said the party's reservations and protests against the contract with Ren-Form are valid. She told VOA the company contributed to what she called 'systemic disruption' during the Zimbabwe elections. 'There were some polling stations where ballot papers were not delivered on time. People needed to come back the next day. Of course, one could argue that the electoral body of Zimbabwe was tasked with the distribution, it’s true,' she said. 'But there were certain things, certain materials that only became available to them later on, after the elections, so in that regard the position of the PDM is definitely valid.' Andreas said the PDM is right to speak up now so that it can object to any irregularities seen on or after election day. The Electoral Commission of Namibia accepted the petition by the main opposition and said they will forward it to the relevant institutions. The commission's spokesperson, De Wet Malauli, said in an earlier interview with VOA that the commission stands by the awarding of the contract to Ren-Form and said the accusations against the company are baseless. He said the allegations are meant to undermine public confidence in the electoral body that oversees Namibia’s elections. 'The decision to award the contract to Ren-Form was made following a thorough, rigorous evaluation process that adhered to the laws governing procurement,' he said. 'Factors considered included compliance with the technical requirements, cost-effectiveness, reliability and the ability to meet strict timelines.' He said the company being questioned has a track record of more than 70 elections over 20 years on the African continent, and the body will not rescind its decision. The PDM said it is consulting its lawyers with the goal of having the company removed from the election process. Fifteen presidential candidates and 21 political parties will contest the elections in Namibia, slated for the November 27. The general election is Namibia's seventh since attaining independence from South Africa in 1990.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-opposition-demonstrates-against-ballots-contract/7835527.html	2024-10-23T02:16:23-07:00	
Malaysia charges 22 people linked to Islamic firm GISB with organized crime	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia charged 22 people linked to an Islamic conglomerate, including its chief executive, on Wednesday for organized crime, according to court documents and the company's lawyer. Authorities last month launched a wide-ranging probe into Global Ikhwan Services and Business (GISB) Holdings, for various crimes including suspected money laundering, human trafficking and sexual offenses against children, after police rescued hundreds of youngsters from suspected abuse at care homes run by the firm. GISB, which police say is linked to a banned religious sect, has denied allegations of widespread abuse and other misconduct although its chief executive Nasiruddin Mohd Ali acknowledged that 'one or two' cases of sodomy had occurred at its shelters. On Wednesday, Nasiruddin and other members of GISB were charged with organized crime, an offense that carries jail terms between five and 20 years if convicted, charge sheets reviewed by Reuters showed. The documents did not provide details on the alleged charge. 'There will be a representation, an appeal, and a challenge of the charges,' GISB lawyer Rosli Kamaruddin told reporters after a court hearing where the chargesheets were issued. Those charged on Wednesday included Mohammad Adib At-Tarmimi, the son of late Malaysian preacher Ashaari Mohamed, the founder of the Al-Arqam religious sect that was outlawed by the government in 1994 for allegedly spreading deviant Islamic teachings in the Muslim-majority country. GISB has acknowledged its links to Al-Arqam, but now describes itself as an Islamic conglomerate based on Muslim practices. However, Malaysia's home affairs minister said last week investigations found many GISB followers still adhered to Al-Arqam teachings, while religious authorities in several states have issued fatwas declaring the group deviant.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-charges-22-people-linked-to-islamic-firm-gisb-with-organized-crime/7835504.html	2024-10-23T01:20:43-07:00	
Incoming EU foreign policy chief Kallas warns against Russia and China	The European Union's next foreign policy chief has told lawmakers that strengthening security must be a priority, warning that Europe must be prepared as Russia and 'partly China' exploit the continent’s open societies. 'European security is deeply personal to me as a native of a country that has long told others that Russia's imperialistic dream never died,' Kaja Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister, said in written replies to members of the European Parliament published late on Tuesday. 'My short-term priority must be to address the pressing global concerns: Russia’s war against Ukraine and strengthening the EU’s security and defense,' she wrote. Kallas, nominated by European leaders in June to serve as the bloc's new high representative for foreign affairs, is set to succeed incumbent Josep Borrell. The European Parliament will hold hearings in November for members of the next European Commission. In 21 pages of answers to questions posed by the lawmakers ahead of the hearings, the Estonian politician outlined her vision for Europe's foreign policy at a time when the bloc faces an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. The EU must stay at 'the forefront of humanitarian efforts' in the Middle East,' Kallas said, and work 'with all actors to support the pursuit of a just and comprehensive peace' while also pointing to challenges such as China's support for Russia. 'Actors such as Russia, Iran, North Korea, and partly China, aim at weaponizing interdependencies and exploiting the openness of our societies against us,' she added. 'For this, we must be prepared.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/incoming-eu-foreign-policy-chief-kallas-warns-against-russia-and-china/7835495.html	2024-10-23T00:59:40-07:00	
Blinken says there is ‘real opportunity’ for deal to free hostages after killing of Hamas leader	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar presents a 'real opportunity' to achieve an agreement to free the remaining hostages still being held by the militant group in the Gaza Strip. Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv before flying to Saudi Arabia, Blinken said Israel has achieved a number of successes in the war against Hamas, including degrading the group’s military capabilities. The top U.S. diplomat said what remains is bringing the hostages home and bringing the war to an end. Blinken said ending the war must be done in a way that keeps Hamas out of Gaza and ensures Israeli troops do not stay there. Plans for a post-war Gaza, including issues such as governance, security, reconstruction and what the international community can do to aid Palestinians, will be the topic of Blinken’s discussions with Arab partners in the coming days, he said. A week after Blinken sent a letter warning Israel to increase the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza or risk losing access to U.S. military aid, he said Wednesday there has been progress, but that there needs to be more and it needs to be sustained. Blinken told reporters he issued a similar warning earlier this year, which was followed by Israel quickly facilitating an increase in aid that did not last. The threats are linked to legal obligations that U.S. humanitarian aid should not be hindered by a recipient of U.S. military aid. Pressed on whether the new warning is an empty threat, Blinken said Wednesday: 'I am determined to follow the law. I will follow the law.' Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials Tuesday on his 11th visit to the region since the Israel-Hamas war erupted more than a year ago. Netanyahu and Blinken also discussed Israel’s ongoing fighting with Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants based in Lebanon. The Israeli leader told Blinken was a need for a security and political change in Lebanon that would allow displaced Israelis to return safely to their homes in northern Israel. The Blinken-Netanyahu meeting came six days after the killing of Sinwar and a little more than a week after the United States threatened to withhold some U.S. military aid without progress in delivering more assistance to Palestinians in Gaza, where the United Nations says a humanitarian crisis continues unabated. With the U.S. presidential election two weeks away, President Joe Biden asked Blinken to return to push for progress in reaching a cease-fire in the Gaza fighting, seeing new hope after Israel's killing of Sinwar, the architect of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. U.S. officials have said that Sinwar was intransigent in negotiations for a cease-fire, but no new talks have been started since his killing. Israel’s counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 42,600 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, with Israel saying that the death toll includes several thousand Hamas militants. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations. Blinken on previous trips to the Mideast has sought to prevent the conflict from escalating into a regional war. But Israel since last month has been striking across Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran. Miller said Blinken again called for a 'diplomatic resolution' in Lebanon and compliance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 of 2006 that calls for the long-term disarmament of Hezbollah but also a withdrawal of Israeli forces from its northern neighbor. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-says-there-is-real-opportunity-for-deal-to-free-hostages-after-killing-of-hamas-leader/7835489.html	2024-10-23T00:48:26-07:00	
Twelfth monkey death at Hong Kong zoo, soil infection blamed	HONG KONG — A 12th monkey has died at a Hong Kong zoo, authorities said late on Tuesday, after 11 monkeys died in the past week due to melioidosis, a bacterial infection, which can affect both humans and animals. Housed in five separate cages, the deceased monkeys included the De Brazza species as well as one common squirrel monkey, cotton-top tamarins and white-faced sakis. The zoo, located just above the city's financial center, has shut its mammals section since October 14, when authorities reported the first batch of monkey deaths. The government said it would continue to close the section and provide protective gear and health monitoring for staff taking care of the animals. 'The health conditions of the 78 mammals are normal,' the Leisure and Cultural Services Department said. Authorities said 11 monkeys died of sepsis after catching melioidosis. Tests were being done on the 12th deceased monkey to find out the cause of death. Autopsies in the past week found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys organs, which likely came from soil near the monkeys habitat, authorities said. The zoo, built in 1860, is the oldest park in Hong Kong.	https://www.voanews.com/a/twelfth-monkey-death-at-hong-kong-zoo-soil-infection-blamed/7835485.html	2024-10-23T00:14:28-07:00	
Shootout in Mexico's Sinaloa state kills 19, local cartel leader arrested	MEXICO CITY — A shootout near the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state killed 19 suspected gang members, while one local cartel leader was arrested, Mexico's defense ministry said on Tuesday, as intra-cartel violence intensifies. The deadly altercation on Monday took place about 11 kilometers outside the Sinaloa capital of Culiacan, when a group of more than 30 gunmen fired on soldiers, according to a statement from the ministry. It added that some of the suspected cartel gunmen fled the scene after federal agents returned fire. The detainee was identified as Edwin Antonio 'N' - his last name withheld as is typical for those accused of crimes in Mexico - and described as a local leader of the Sinaloa Cartel faction led by its legendary co-founder Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada. A document dated October 22 from Mexico's national registry of detained persons obtained by Reuters listed an Edwin Antonio Rubio Lopez apprehended by military personnel in Sinaloa. Seven vehicles and nearly 30 firearms, including machine guns, ammunition and military-style vests and helmets were also seized. Violence has flared in the western Pacific coast state ever since the late July arrest of Zambada, after he was flown to an airstrip in the United States near the city of El Paso, Texas, and promptly taken into custody by U.S. officials. The veteran cartel leader is believed to be in his 70s. He has alleged that a senior member of the Los Chapitos, another faction of the Sinaloa cartel, kidnapped him and then flew him to the United States against his will. The gangland violence plaguing Sinaloa is seen by security analysts as likely pitting the two factions against each other, and has intensified since early September with around 200 dead and more than 300 others believed to be missing, according to official data.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shootout-in-mexico-s-sinaloa-state-kills-19-local-cartel-leader-arrested/7835481.html	2024-10-22T23:54:34-07:00	
Taipei says Chinese aircraft carrier group sailed through Taiwan Strait	Taipei, Taiwan — A Chinese aircraft carrier group sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday, Taiwan's defense minister said, a day after Beijing held a live-fire exercise near the self-ruled island. China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has ramped up military activity around the island in recent years to pressure Taipei into accepting its claims of sovereignty. 'The Liaoning is passing through the Taiwan Strait now, sailing north along the west of the median line (of the passage) and we are closely monitoring it,' Defense Minister Wellington Koo told reporters. The Liaoning, China's oldest aircraft carrier, took part in Beijing's large-scale military drills around Taiwan last week that were condemned by Taipei and its key backer Washington. A blockade was among the exercises carried out. Koo warned on Wednesday that an actual blockade of Taiwan would be an 'act of war' and have a 'very serious impact on the global economy.' China has two aircraft carriers in active service, and a third undergoing sea trials. The Liaoning has previously passed through the strait. It appeared to be returning to Qingdao port in eastern China via the Pratas Islands, in the northern part of the South China Sea, for 'replenishing and necessary maintenance,' said Jiang Hsin-biao, a military expert at Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research. Its involvement in the recent military drills was for 'the purpose of practicing against foreign forces and intimidating Taiwan,' Jiang told AFP. Stronger language Beijing sent a record number of military aircraft, including fighter jets and drones, as well as warships to encircle Taiwan on October 14 in what Beijing said was a 'stern warning to the separatist acts of 'Taiwan Independence' forces.' It was in response to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's National Day speech on October 10 in which he vowed to 'resist annexation,' and insisted that Beijing and Taipei were not subordinate to each other. Lai, who took office in May, has used stronger language than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, angering China's leaders in Beijing who call him a 'separatist.' Taipei said Tuesday the live-fire drill could be part of Beijing's 'tactics to bolster its intimidation in conjunction with the dynamics in the Taiwan Strait'. Over the weekend, a U.S. and a Canadian warship passed through the 180-kilometer Taiwan Strait, part of regular passages by Washington and its allies meant to reinforce its status as an international waterway. Beijing condemned the passage as disrupting 'peace and stability' in the strait. Taiwan's defense ministry said Wednesday it had detected 15 Chinese military aircraft and six navy vessels in the skies and waters around the island in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. Wednesday. China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since 1949 after Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist forces fled to the island following their defeat by Mao Zedong's communist fighters. While Taiwan has its own government, military, and currency, Beijing insists the island is part of its territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to bring it under its control.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taipei-says-chinese-aircraft-carrier-group-sailed-through-taiwan-strait/7835479.html	2024-10-22T23:44:18-07:00	
North Korea's Kim Jong Un visits missile bases, cites US nuclear threat	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has visited missile bases to examine their readiness to undertake actions of 'strategic deterrence,' while calling U.S. nuclear capabilities a growing threat to the country, state media reported on Wednesday. The U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal poses an 'ever-increasing threat' to North Korea's security environment, which demands that Pyongyang maintain a strict counteraction posture of its nuclear forces, he was quoted as saying by KCNA. North Korea has been stepping up its development of ballistic missiles and a nuclear arsenal, drawing international sanctions, and forming close military relations with Russia. Kim's visit to the bases comes amid growing tensions with South Korea and its allies. This has included concerns over what Seoul says is a dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia to fight in Ukraine, a claim that has been denied by Pyongyang. South Korea's National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik and Jacek Siewiera, the head of the Polish National Security Bureau, expressed concern over Pyongyang's military cooperation with Moscow during a meeting in Seoul. The two also agreed to cooperate closely with the international community on the issue, according to a statement released by South Korea's presidential office. In the KCNA report, Kim also called for the modernisation of the armed forces by giving priority to strategic missiles in the future, calling it 'an important principle of the strategy for building national defense.' He was accompanied on his visit by Kim Yo Jong, his powerful sister, and Kim Jong Sik, the first vice department director of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, KCNA reported. Photographs released by KCNA showed Kim dressed in a leather coat inspecting the missile bases. KCNA did not specify when the visits took place.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-visits-missile-bases-cites-us-nuclear-threat/7835476.html	2024-10-22T23:29:42-07:00	
LeBron, Bronny James make NBA history with father-son appearance	Los Angeles — LeBron and Bronny James made NBA history on Tuesday, becoming the first father-and-son duo to play alongside each other in a regular season fixture as the Los Angeles Lakers opened their campaign against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The duo, who played together briefly in a pre-season game earlier this month, took to the court together late in the second quarter at the Crypto.com Arena with the Lakers leading 51-35. An enormous roar went up from the home crowd as the James duo were brought onto the court by coach J.J. Redick after the Lakers had surged into a double-digit lead. In a perfectly scripted moment that was pure Hollywood, the James' double-act was watched at courtside by Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr, who made baseball history playing for the Seattle Mariners as father and son in 1990-1991. 'We made history; now we get to watch history,' said Griffey Jr., who joined his father to pose for photos with LeBron and Bronny James shortly before Tuesday's tip-off. Lakers officials had been coy before Tuesday's season-opener about where and when LeBron James and Bronny would play their first regular season fixture together. However, NBA superstar LeBron James, who turns 40 in December, admitted in pre-game remarks that he could scarcely contain his excitement at the prospect of realizing his long-cherished dream of sharing a court with his son. 'Just to run out the tunnel knowing that he'll be in uniform, run out the tunnel with him, see him warm up, and be out there with the rest of my teammates,' James told reporters during a morning shoot-around on Tuesday. 'This is my 22nd time running out on opening night so I don't know how many times I'll have an opportunity, how many times I've got left to run out. I won't take it for granted.' Anticipation about the James double-act has dominated the Lakers' preparations for the new season since Bronny James was selected by the franchise with the 55th pick in the draft in June. 'It's been a treat' Bronny James, 20, is expected to spend most of his rookie season in the developmental G-League rather than the Lakers senior squad. LeBron James however said Tuesday that he had relished being able to accompany his son on his first steps into professional basketball. 'It's been a treat and just in preseason, the practices, just every day,' James said. 'The plane rides, the bus rides of being with him and showing him the ropes, along with his teammates and coaches. Just what this professional life is all about and how to prepare every day ... super-duper cool.' Bronny James' ascent to the ranks of the NBA has been made all the more remarkable given that just over a year ago he suffered a cardiac arrest during a workout with his University of Southern California college team-mates. James Sr. said his son's swift recovery from that life-threatening episode had convinced him that he would one day play in the NBA. 'To see him play in a college Division I game the same year he had heart surgery ... I knew that at that moment that there really was going to be nothing to stop him from anything that he wants to do,' James said. Bronny said at the Lakers recent media day he was fueled by the words of critics who have suggested he owes his place on the Lakers roster entirely to his superstar father. 'I'm just taking all that stuff, that criticism and backlash that people have given me and turning it into something that can fuel me,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebron-bronny-james-make-nba-history-with-father-son-appearance/7835473.html	2024-10-22T23:04:38-07:00	
Russia, Ukraine trade drone attacks	Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed 14 Ukrainian aerial drones in areas along the Ukraine-Russia border as well as four uncrewed Ukrainian boats in the Black Sea. The ministry said Russian air defenses destroyed 10 drones over Russia-occupied Crimea, and another four over the Rostov region. Russian forces carried out a second consecutive night of heavy drone attacks targeting the Sumy region in southern Ukraine. The Sumy regional military administration said Wednesday that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 19 Russian drones, a night after Ukraine downed 25 drones in the same area. Officials in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv regions also reported drones being shot down overnight. North Korean involvement Ukraine has 'information that two units of military personnel from North Korea are being trained — potentially even two brigades of 6,000 people each' — for combat in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday. 'This is a challenge,' the president said in his daily address. 'But we know how to respond to this challenge. And it is important that our partners do not shy away from this challenge, as well.' 'If North Korea can intervene in the war in Europe, then the pressure on this regime is definitely not strong enough,' Zelenskyy said. 'And if Russia is still able to expand and prolong this war, it means that everyone in the world who is still not helping to force Russia into peace is actually helping Putin to wage war.' 'We expect a firm, concrete response from the world,' he added. 'Hopefully, not only in words.' Also Tuesday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement that Russia is playing with lives beyond Ukraine. 'Russia’s indiscriminate strikes on ports in the Black Sea underscore that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is willing to gamble on global food security in his attempts to force Ukraine into submission. ... In doing so, he is harming millions of vulnerable people across Africa, Asia and the Middle East to try and gain the upper hand in his barbaric war.' Starmer said Russia’s conduct in the conflict has shown 'no respect for human life or the consequences of their invasion across the world.'

Thousands flee homes as fierce tropical storm batters Philippines	Manila, Philippines — Philippine rescuers waded through chest-deep floodwaters Wednesday to reach residents trapped by Tropical Storm Trami, which has forced thousands to evacuate as it barrels towards the country's east coast. Torrential rains driven by the storm have turned streets into rivers, submerged entire villages and buried some vehicles up to their door handles in volcanic sediment knocked loose by the downpour. At least 32,000 people had fled their homes in the northern Philippines, police said, as the storm edged closer to the Southeast Asian country's main island of Luzon. In the Bicol region, about 400 kilometers southeast of the capital Manila, 'unexpectedly high' flooding was complicating rescue efforts, said police. 'We sent police rescue teams but they struggled to enter some areas because the flooding was high and the current was so strong,' regional police spokeswoman Luisa Calubaquib told AFP. Trami's center was 310 kilometers east of Aurora province with maximum sustained winds of 85 kilometers per hour as of 8 a.m., the national weather agency said. Photos verified by AFP showed streets submerged by muddy floodwaters in Camarines Sur province's Bato municipality, with only the roofs of houses and convenience stores visible. 'It's getting dangerous. We're waiting for rescuers,' resident Karen Tabagan told AFP. In Naga city, about 40 kilometers from Bato, half of the 600 villages were fully submerged by flooding. At an emergency meeting of government agencies Wednesday morning, President Ferdinand Marcos said that 'the worst is yet to come.' 'I'm feeling a little helpless here because ... all we can do is sit tight, wait, hope and pray that there is not too much damage, that there are no casualties.' Families driven from their homes in Bicol were staying at around 2,500 evacuation centres scattered across the region. 'There was also a lahar flow in Albay due to the rains,' Calubaquib, the Bicol police spokeswoman said, referring to the volcanic sediment flowing from the Philippines' famous Mayon volcano. About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Philippines or its surrounding waters each year, damaging homes and infrastructure and killing dozens of people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-flee-homes-as-fierce-tropical-storm-batters-philippines/7835468.html	2024-10-22T22:45:13-07:00
