Mushers, dogs braved Alaska winter to deliver lifesaving serum 100 years ago	ANCHORAGE, ALASKA — The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the 'strangling angel' for the way it suffocated children. Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors — the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver lifesaving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria. Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 'Great Race of Mercy' are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club. Alaskans honor 'heroic effort' 'There's a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,' said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska's oldest newspaper, The Nome Nugget. 'People just dropped whatever they were doing,' she said. 'These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.' Other communities are also marking the anniversary — including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum. Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team. A race to save lives Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film on the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S. Nome, western Alaska's largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn't seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area. Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: 'An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.' The first death was a 3-year-old boy on January 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine. West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle, Washington, and then onto a ship for Seward, Alaska, an ice-free port south of Anchorage, Alaska. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital. It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome. Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 1,086 kilometers (675 miles) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails. Thanks to Alaska's new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers — many of them Alaska Natives — with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn't see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus minus 51 degrees Celsius (60 degrees Fahrenheit). The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke. Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 320 kilometers (250 miles) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound. After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on February 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed 'Dogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.' The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It's likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked. Balto gains fame Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala's dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team. Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck. But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland, a city in Ohio. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Iditarod pays homage to run Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1. 'The Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska's pioneering spirit,' Noonan said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mushers-dogs-braved-alaska-winter-to-deliver-lifesaving-serum-100-years-ago-/7959204.html	2025-01-31T23:03:17-08:00	
What to know about the NTSB, the agency investigating the DC plane crash	WASHINGTON — A collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people brought renewed focus on the federal agency charged with investigating aviation disasters. National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has described the investigation into the crash as an 'all-hands-on-deck event' for the agency. Here are some things to know about the NTSB: What does the agency do? The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents as well as serious incidents in the U.S. involving other modes of transportation, such as railroad disasters and major accidents involving motor vehicles, marine vessels, pipelines and even commercial space operators. 'We're here to ensure the American people that we are going to leave no stone unturned in this investigation,' Homendy said, noting the probe is in the very early stages. 'We are going to conduct a thorough investigation of this entire tragedy, looking at the facts.' The agency has five board members who serve five-year terms and are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. How will the investigation work? For the investigation into Wednesday's crash, the NTSB will establish several different working groups, each responsible for investigating different areas connected to the accident, board member Todd Inman said. Inman said those groups include operations, which will examine flight history and crewmember duties; structures, which will document airframe wreckage and the accident scene; power plants, which will focus on aircraft engines and engine accessories; systems, which will study the electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic components of the two aircraft; air traffic control, which will review flight track surveillance information, including radar, and controller-pilot communications; survival factors, which will analyze the injuries to the crew and passengers and crash and rescue efforts; and a helicopter group. The investigation also will include a human-performance group that will be a part of the operations, air traffic control and helicopter groups and will study the crew performance and any factors that could be involved such as human error, including fatigue, medications, medical histories, training and workload, Inman said. How long will the investigation take? NTSB officials did not say Thursday how long the investigation would take, but accident investigations often take between one to two years to complete. The agency typically releases a preliminary report within a few weeks of the accident that includes a synopsis of information collected at the scene. What is the NTSB's history? The NTSB history dates to 1926, when Congress passed a law charging the U.S. Department of Commerce with investigating aircraft accidents. It was established as an independent agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation in 1967 and then separated by Congress in 1974 as a stand-alone organization, fully independent from any other federal agencies. Since its creation in 1967, the agency reports it has investigated more than 153,000 aviation accidents and incidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-to-know-about-the-ntsb-the-agency-investigating-the-dc-plane-crash/7959187.html	2025-01-31T23:02:33-08:00	
South African woman has rescued more than 2,500 pugs	JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA — Lots of hair shedding, tons of fun, and a constant invasion of your personal space. That's what you're going to get with a pug, according to Cheryl Gaw, who has seen more than a few of the squashed-nosed pups in her time. Gaw has rescued more than 2,500 pugs in South Africa over the years after she and her husband sold their house, lived in a trailer home for a while and generally reset their lives to help as many dogs in need as they could. They eventually established their Pug Rescue South Africa in Johannesburg in 2010 because of an overflowing number of dogs in their house. It was 'never part of the plan' when they looked ahead to their retirement, said Gaw, who is 63. 'Of course, the pugs won,' she added. The center is currently home to nearly 200 pugs, the latest batch who have hit hard times and need a helping paw. Some of them were abandoned, some sick, and many were given up by owners who couldn't look after them anymore. Gaw's pug life started in 2008 when her husband, Malcolm, gave her one as a gift. At a pug club, someone asked if they'd be interested in providing a foster home for 'a couple' of pugs. In the first year, the Gaws provided a temporary home to 60 pugs and had 19 in their home at one point — too much fur for one small house. 'They are known as the clowns of the dog world, and they can make you laugh,' said Gaw, giving her own breed guide. 'Always in your space. They're just an amazing, lovable breed. And you always have hair on you.' The rescue center's staff do their best to keep order. The routine is: 5:15 a.m., the dogs wake up and come out of the cottages where they sleep in groups according to their 'age and personality,' said Gaw. Then there's breakfast, medication for those who need it, bathtime, playtime, grooming time, midday snacks, afternoon rest, more playtime, evening meal, more medication, and all pugs back in their rooms between 6-7 p.m. Fights occasionally break out. The veterinary bill for the center is nearly $40,000 a year, and it's a constant process of rescue, rehabilitation, and trying to rehome them, with more pugs arriving all the time. 'The operation doesn't stop,' said Gaw. There is a reason why so many pugs need a new home. Their short muzzles, a mark of the breed, give rise to breathing problems and other health issues such as eye and ear infections, she said. A pug's vet costs are not to be sniffed at and Gaw warns prospective owners to do their homework and get a good pet insurance policy: 'You're going to need it.' Many of the pugs have come to the Gaws because their owners can't afford those vet bills. Be prepared for their problems, she said, and also the hair, which she can't stress enough. 'They shed an enormous amount of hair,' she said. 'You can brush them all day long, they still shed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---south-african-woman-has-rescued-more-than-2-500-pugs-/7957914.html	2025-01-31T23:01:54-08:00	
New Zealand mountain is granted personhood, recognizing it as sacred for Maori	WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND — A mountain in New Zealand considered an ancestor by Indigenous people was recognized as a legal person on Thursday after a new law granted it all the rights and responsibilities of a human being. Mount Taranaki — now known as Taranaki Maunga, its Maori name — is the latest natural feature to be granted personhood in New Zealand, which has ruled that a river and a stretch of sacred land are people before. The pristine, snow-capped dormant volcano is the second highest on New Zealand's North Island at 2,518 meters and a popular spot for tourism, hiking and snow sports. The legal recognition acknowledges the mountain's theft from the Māori of the Taranaki region after New Zealand was colonized. It fulfills an agreement of redress from the country's government to Indigenous people for harms perpetrated against the land since. How can a mountain be a person? The law passed Thursday gives Taranaki Maunga all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a person. Its legal personality has a name: Te Kahui Tupua, which the law views as 'a living and indivisible whole.' It includes Taranaki and its surrounding peaks and land, 'incorporating all their physical and metaphysical elements.' A newly created entity will be 'the face and voice' of the mountain, the law says, with four members from local Maori iwi, or tribes, and four members appointed by the country's conservation minister. Why is this mountain special? 'The mountain has long been an honored ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual sustenance and a final resting place,' Paul Goldsmith, the lawmaker responsible for the settlements between the government and Maori tribes, told Parliament in a speech on Thursday. But colonizers of New Zealand in the 18th and 19th centuries took first the name of Taranaki and then the mountain itself. In 1770, the British explorer Captain James Cook spotted the peak from his ship and named it Mount Egmont. In 1840, Maori tribes and representatives of the British crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi — New Zealand's founding document — in which the Crown promised Maori would retain rights to their land and resources. But the Maori and English versions of the treaty differed — and Crown breaches of both began immediately. In 1865, a vast swathe of Taranaki land, including the mountain, was confiscated to punish Maori for rebelling against the Crown. Over the next century hunting and sports groups had a say in the mountain's management — but Maori did not. 'Traditional Maori practices associated with the mountain were banned while tourism was promoted,' Goldsmith said. But a Maori protest movement of the 1970s and '80s has led to a surge of recognition for the Maori language, culture and rights in New Zealand law. Redress has included billions of dollars in Treaty of Waitangi settlements — such as the agreement with the eight tribes of Taranaki, signed in 2023. How will the mountain use its rights? 'Today, Taranaki, our maunga, our maunga tupuna, is released from the shackles, the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate,' said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, a co-leader of the political party Te Pati Maori and a descendant of the Taranaki tribes, using a phrase that means ancestral mountain. 'We grew up knowing there was nothing anyone could do to make us any less connected,' she added. The mountain's legal rights are intended to uphold its health and wellbeing. They will be employed to stop forced sales, restore its traditional uses and allow conservation work to protect the native wildlife that flourishes there. Public access will remain. Do other parts of New Zealand have personhood? New Zealand was the first country in the world to recognize natural features as people when a law passed in 2014 granted personhood to Te Urewera, a vast native forest on the North Island. Government ownership ceased and the tribe Tuhoe became its guardian. 'Te Urewera is ancient and enduring, a fortress of nature, alive with history; its scenery is abundant with mystery, adventure, and remote beauty,' the law begins, before describing its spiritual significance to Maori. In 2017, New Zealand recognized the Whanganui River as human, as part of a settlement with its local iwi. How much support did the law receive? The bill recognizing the mountain's personhood was affirmed unanimously by Parliament's 123 lawmakers. The vote was greeted by a ringing waiata — a Maori song — from the public gallery, packed with dozens who had traveled to the capital, Wellington, from Taranaki. The unity provided brief respite in a tense period for race relations in New Zealand. In November, tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament to protest a law that would reshape the Treaty of Waitangi by setting rigid legal definitions for each clause. Detractors say the law — which is not expected to pass — would strip Maori of legal rights and dramatically reverse progress from the past five decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-mountain-is-granted-personhood-recognizing-it-as-sacred-for-m%c4%81ori/7957903.html	2025-01-31T23:01:11-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: Will China be marginalized by US involvement in Russia-Ukraine talks?	Over the past three years, despite accusations that China has provided covert support to Russia in the Ukraine war, Beijing has repeatedly emphasized its 'neutrality' in public and called for peace talks. However, with newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump joining the call for a ceasefire, Beijing's carefully crafted role as a 'peacemaker' may face the risk of marginalization.

Trump’s funding freeze hits program for Burmese students, scholars	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s decision to freeze $45 million in U.S. federal funding for over 400 Burmese students has left many in shock and dismay as their scholarships were abruptly canceled. The move has also raised concerns about the broader impact it could have on Burmese in Myanmar, a country already grappling with political turmoil and a collapsing education system under military rule. Students in limbo One Burmese student who studies at Chiang Mai University in Thailand told VOA that she feels completely lost after learning that her scholarship was being suspended. 'To be honest, I am lost because of this sudden loss of my scholarship. I had been studying with the goal of earning a degree, and now I don’t know what to do,' she said. The student spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because she fears for her safety if she returns to Burma, which remains under military control. She said students like her and others at different academic levels are now left without financial support. 'There are students doing four-year master’s degrees, others in four-year bachelor's programs, and even PhD students. I don’t know whether I should continue my studies, go home, or what my next step should be,' she said. 'I am saddened that President Trump only cares about the United States and has cut off my studies.' An email sent to recipients of the program that was shared with VOA’s Burmese Service, said the Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program, or DISP, is currently suspended, and officials 'will review whether to continue the scholarship for the students who have been awarded it.' DISP was created to support Burmese students from marginalized and underprivileged backgrounds, giving them opportunities to study at universities across Asia, including the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The program also provided funding for online education through the University of Arizona. For many, the initiative was their only chance to pursue higher education outside of Burma, where the junta-controlled education system has systematically restricted access for those opposing the military regime. For some students, the immediate impact has been less severe. Hlwan Paing Thi Ha, who has been studying at Chiang Mai University for a year, told VOA: 'My education has already been paid for through the scholarship program, so it hasn’t impacted me yet.' Future leaders impacted One source who has in-depth understanding of the program, said the impact goes beyond just access to education and opportunities. The source spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with the media. More than a quarter of the Burmese students in the program have fled Myanmar due to the military coup, ongoing fighting and forced conscription, which has targeted youth. 'The impact is huge,' the source said, adding that currently, more than 400 Burmese students are attending universities in four countries—the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand through the USAID-funded program. 'Of these, 110 were directly recruited from Myanmar, while the rest are students who fled to border regions and Southeast Asian countries due to the military coup or boycotted Myanmar’s junta-controlled education system,' the source said. The program, which was launched in February 2024, was designed as a five-year initiative, with plans to recruit three batches of students over that period. 'The goal was to ensure that at least 1,000 Burmese students, the 'current and future leaders of the country,' could continue their studies in universities across the region. The second batch, which would include hundreds of students, is now in the final stage of the screening process,' the source explained. Debate continues In Washington a debate over the freeze and review continues. On Tuesday, the State Department issued a waiver that exempts some humanitarian aid from the freeze. U.S. lawmakers have also voiced concerns, warning that the freeze will impact American soft power and give China an advantage. On Wednesday, President Trump defended the funding freeze, specifically calling out the $45 million allocated for diversity scholarships for Burmese students. 'We also blocked $45 million for diversity scholarships in Burma. Forty-five—that’s a lot of money for diversity scholarships in Burma. You can imagine where that money went,' Trump said. 'These were the types of payments and many others. I could stand here all day and tell you about things that we found, and we have to find them quickly because we want the money to flow to proper places.' Name threatens its demise? Some note that in addition to the freeze, the name of the program may also leave it in a difficult position, with some worrying that the mention of diversity in its title could impact a substantive review of its impact. The source with direct knowledge of the initiative for Burmese students told VOA that the program was swiftly terminated when the Trump administration began reducing foreign aid, and that its name 'Diversity and Inclusion' likely played a major role in its elimination. 'This program was one of the first to be cut as soon as the administration began making budget reductions in this area,' the source said. While all USAID-funded programs have been temporarily frozen, DISP appears to have been specifically blocked without any review, the source noted. 'USAID officials have not been able to explain why this program was halted so suddenly.' VOA reached out to the State Department to verify whether the program was permanently blocked or still under review and whether its name played a role in its swift termination. However, as of the time of publication, VOA had not received a response from the State Department. The source also voiced concern the administration may not understand that the program has no connection to Myanmar’s military junta and was created solely to support young people who lost their education due to military oppression. Lifeline for ethnic and religious minorities The Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program was set up to reflect Burma’s ethnic and religious diversity, giving equal opportunities to students from all backgrounds who have historically faced discrimination under the Burman-dominated and military-controlled education policies. Burman is the name of the main ethnic group in Myanmar. Many recipients of the scholarship program belong to ethnic minority groups such as the Karen, Kachin, Shan, Chin, and Rohingya, who have historically faced systemic discrimination in Burma’s education system.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-funding-freeze-hits-program-for-burmese-students-scholars/7959215.html	2025-01-31T19:34:23-08:00	
Health data, pages wiped from federal websites as Trump officials target 'gender ideology'	Public health data disappeared from websites, entire webpages went blank and employees erased pronouns from email signatures Friday as federal agencies scrambled to comply with a directive tied to President Donald Trump's order rolling back protections for transgender people. The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip 'gender ideology' from websites, contracts and emails in a memo sent Wednesday, with changes ordered to be instituted by 5 p.m. Friday. It also directed agencies to disband employee resource groups, terminate grants and contracts related to the issue, and replace the term 'gender' with 'sex' on government forms. Some parts of government websites appeared with the message: 'The page you’re looking for was not found.' Some pages disappeared and came back intermittently. Asked by reporters Friday about reports that government websites were being shut down to eliminate mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump said he didn’t know anything about it but that he’d endorse such a move. 'I don’t know. That doesn’t sound like a bad idea to me,' Trump said, adding that he campaigned promising to stamp out such initiatives. Much public health information was taken down from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use, bullying and other problems. Eliminating health resources creates dangerous gaps in scientific information, disease experts said. The Infectious Diseases Society of America, a medical association, issued a statement decrying the removal of information about HIV and people who are transgender. Access is 'critical to efforts to end the HIV epidemic,' the organization’s leaders said. A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled 'Inmate Gender' was relabeled 'Inmate Sex' on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in federal prisons was no longer included. The State Department on Friday removed the option to select 'X' as a gender on passport applications for nonbinary applicants. It also replaced the word 'gender' from the descriptor with the word 'sex.' All State Department employees were ordered to remove gender-specific pronouns from their email signatures. The directive, from the acting head of the Bureau of Management, said this was required to comply with Trump’s executive orders and that the department was also removing all references to 'gender ideology' from websites and internal documents. 'All employees are required to remove any gender identifying pronouns from email signature blocks by 5:00 PM today,' said the order from Tibor Nagy. 'Your cooperation is essential as we navigate these changes together.' An official from the U.S. Agency for International Development said staffers were directed to flag the use of the word 'gender' in each of thousands of award contracts. Warnings against gender discrimination are standard language in every such contract. The official spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, under a Trump administration gag order prohibiting USAID staffers from speaking with people outside their agency. The official said staffers fear that programs and jobs related to inclusion efforts, gender issues and issues specific to women are being singled out and possibly targeted under two Trump executive orders. Some Census Bureau and National Park Service pages were also inaccessible or giving error messages. Trump's executive order, signed on his first day back in office, calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to immediately stop recognizing identity a day before the start of February's Black History Month, saying they 'erode camaraderie and threaten mission execution.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/health-data-pages-wiped-from-federal-websites-as-trump-officials-target-gender-ideology-/7959210.html	2025-01-31T19:09:02-08:00

High-ranking member of Assad’s regime arrested in Syria	Syria’s new authorities have announced the arrest of Atif Najib, a former senior security officer and cousin of ousted President Bashar al-Assad. Najib is seen by many as being responsible for suppressing the initial protest which triggered Syria’s 2011 uprising. Najib was arrested in western Syria in the Latakia countryside, where the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported he 'was hiding in a farm.' He is the highest-ranking member of Assad’s government to be arrested since Assad was ousted from office in December. 'The criminal Atif Najib has been referred to the competent authorities to be tried and held accountable for the crimes he committed against the Syrian people,' the official SANA news agency reported, citing a senior security official. Najib was the head of political security in Daraa in southern Syria, under Assad’s regime. Syria’s nationwide uprising was sparked by the arrest and torture of children in Daraa, whom, the Observatory said had been arrested for 'writing sentences criticizing the regime on their school walls.' The protests in Daraa that followed the children’s arrests evolved into the 2011 uprising that Assad’s government responded to with a brutal crackdown. Ahmed al-Sharaa is Syria’s newly appointed transitional president. Before being appointed to his current role, Sharaa was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, that spearheaded the campaign in December to wrest control of the country from Assad. Assad fled to Russia, ending more than half a century of oppressive rule by him and his late father, Hafez al-Assad.

Small plane crashes in Pennsylvania, governor says	PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA — A small plane crashed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 30 seconds after it took off as crews responded to a fiery scene, Pennsylvania's governor said Friday. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said he is offering all 'Commonwealth resources as they respond to the small private plane crash in Northeast Philly.' The crash happened less than 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, which primarily serves business jets and charter flights. Photos taken at the crash site appear to show residential homes on fire. Philadelphia's emergency management office said there was a 'major incident' at the location of the crash site and that roads are closed in the area. Flight data showed a small jet taking off from the airport at 6:06 p.m. and disappearing from radar about 30 seconds later after climbing to an altitude of 487 meters (1,600 feet). A photo posted on the social platform X by the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management showed a thick cloud of smoke in the sky near the Roosevelt Mall, where first responders were blocking traffic and onlookers crowded onto a street corner. The plane crashed in a busy intersection near Roosevelt Mall, an outdoor shopping center with dozens of stores and restaurants in the residential neighborhood of Rhawnhurst. The Federal Aviation Administration said two people were aboard the plane, which was a Learjet 55. The plane, a small, business-type jet, was en route to Springfield, Missouri. The plane appeared to be a medical transport jet. The plane that took off and quickly disappeared from radar was registered to a company operating as Med Jets. The FAA said the National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation. The NTSB, which investigates air crashes, said it was gathering information about the crash.	https://www.voanews.com/a/small-plane-crashes-in-pennsylvania-governor-says-/7959165.html	2025-01-31T17:49:11-08:00	
‘Black box' recovered from helicopter involved in Washington midair collision	U.S. investigators say the 'black box' recorder from an Army Black Hawk helicopter was recovered Friday, as teams continue to search for clues into the midair collision that killed 67 people near Washington. The Army helicopter and a commercial passenger jet collided late Wednesday as the jet was attempting to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Investigators said Friday evening that they are reviewing the flight data recorder along with two from the plane that they found Thursday as they try to understand what caused the crash over the Potomac River. National Transportation Safety Board member J. Todd Inman told reporters Friday the helicopter’s recorder appeared to be intact. 'We saw no exterior damage that would indicate it was compromised at this time, so we have a high level of confidence we’ll have a full extraction,' he said. The NTSB is the federal agency leading the investigation into the accident. The commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional craft operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines, carried 64 passengers and crew, while the U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carried a crew of three. Officials say there were no survivors. Fire and emergency service officials in Washington said Friday that 41 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage. Authorities said that they would likely be unable to extricate more victims from the plane without heavier equipment. Inman said that barges from Virginia Beach will arrive Saturday to begin more extensive salvage operations. He said rescue workers will also make sure that the victims are recovered. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced Friday that most helicopters would not be allowed to travel through and near Reagan National Airport for the time being. He wrote on social media platform X, 'Today’s decision will immediately help secure the airspace near Reagan Airport, ensuring the safety of airplane and helicopter traffic.' Speaking Friday before the helicopter’s black box was found, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the recorder would likely determine who was piloting the helicopter at the time of the crash. He said Thursday that the helicopter crew, which was conducting a night-flight training evaluation, included a staff sergeant, a captain-in-training, and a chief warrant officer, who was an instructor. The crew had been issued night vision goggles for the flight, but Hegseth said it was unclear if they were using them. The defense secretary said the black box also could determine who was in communication with the airport’s air traffic control tower and if there was any confusion regarding the instructions they received. Hegseth also said Thursday that the helicopter’s altitude at the time of the accident was under investigation. President Donald Trump said Friday that the Army helicopter was flying too high at the time of the crash. 'It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Trump said in a Friday morning post on his Truth Social platform. Citing a government report, The Washington Post reported Thursday that the control tower was understaffed Wednesday night. The report said two people were handling the jobs of four inside the tower at the time of the collision. A similar report from U.S. broadcaster NBC News, citing a source familiar with the investigation, said a supervisor in the tower let an air traffic controller leave their shift early before the collision. That decision, the report said, left one controller to handle both airplane traffic and helicopter traffic in the area, whereas typically there is one controller looking at each type of aircraft. The NBC report said it is allowable under Federal Aviation Administration standards for one person to do both jobs, although it is not considered optimal. At a news conference Thursday, both Virginia U.S. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner said they had expressed concerns over the years regarding the high volume of air traffic in the Washington area, but that they would await results from the accident probe before revisiting that specific concern. During a White House news conference Thursday, Trump suggested previous presidential administrations, led by Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, lowered standards for the hiring of air traffic controllers and blamed diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, initiatives in the federal government for that. He said he reversed those initiatives with executive orders last week. The U.S. Figure Skating organization said several members of its community, including athletes, coaches and family members, were among the passengers on the plane. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts,' the organization said. The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, also were on the plane. Trump said his administration would facilitate the return of their remains to Russia.

Venezuela frees 6 Americans after meeting between Maduro, Trump envoy	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela in recent months were freed by the government of President Nicolas Maduro after he met Friday with a senior Trump administration official. U.S. President Donald Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media. Grenell posted on X a photo showing him and the men aboard an aircraft. Grenell's trip to Venezuela, according to the White House, was focused on Trump's efforts to deport Venezuelans back to their home country, which currently does not accept them, and on the release of the detained Americans. 'We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,' Grenell wrote on X. 'They just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn't stop thanking him.' The visit by Grenell came as a shock to many Venezuelans who hoped that Trump would continue the 'maximum pressure' campaign he pursued against the authoritarian Venezuelan leader during his first term. Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump's special envoy to Latin America, previewed Grenell's visit to Caracas in a conference call with journalists on Friday. He said Grenell, who served as U.S. ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, was in Venezuela on a 'very specific mission' that in no way detracts from the Trump administration's goal of restoring democracy in the South American nation. 'I would urge the Maduro government, the Maduro regime in Venezuela, to heed special envoy Ric Grenell's message,' said Claver-Carone, himself a former top national security aide to Trump during his first administration. 'Ultimately there will be consequences otherwise.' The visit comes less than a month after Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro's claim to victory. Venezuelan state television aired footage of Grenell and Maduro speaking in the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, the capital, and said the meeting had been requested by the U.S. government. Signing an executive order in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was asked if Grenell being filmed meeting with Maduro lent legitimacy to an administration that the Trump White House hasn't official recognized. 'No. We want to do something with Venezuela. I've been a very big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,' Trump responded. 'They've treated us not so good, but they've treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly.' Some Republicans criticized the visit. 'This is terrible timing,' said Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela and Iran during the first Trump administration. 'A meeting with Maduro will be used by him to legitimize his rule and show that the Americans recognize him as president. If the purpose is to deliver a tough message about migration issues, the president could've done that himself. There was no need to send someone to Caracas.' Among those detained are as many as 10 Americans. Neither the White House nor Maduro's government immediately released the names of the six who were freed Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-frees-6-americans-after-meeting-between-maduro-trump-envoy/7959164.html	2025-01-31T17:23:03-08:00	
Mozambique urges refugees in Malawi to return home	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Mozambican authorities have assured thousands of refugees who fled to Malawi following the recent post-election unrest that peace has been restored in their country and that they are welcome to return home. Officials from Mozambique's Institute of Disaster Management Affairs made the comment Friday during a visit to the Nyamithuthu refugee camp in Nsanje district, which hosts asylum seekers from Mozambique. Luisa Celma Meque, the head of the Institute of Disaster Management Affairs in Mozambique, thanked the Malawi government for taking care of asylum-seekers from her country. 'On behalf of our President Daniel Francisco Chapo, we are sending our message of thanks from the government of Mozambique, and we recognize all the effort of the government of Malawi,' said Meque. 'The second message is for our brothers here. We are doing all efforts necessary for them to return home as soon as possible' Thousands of Mozambicans have fled to Malawi to escape violence triggered by the disputed October presidential election. Hilda Katema Kausiwa, the senior administrative and operations manager for the Department of Refugees in Malawi, said the screening and registration of refugees continues. 'Today, as the Department of Refugees, we have registered a total of 3,640 households, representing 7,456 people,' said Kausiwa. 'As of yesterday, we had finished registration in Mwanza, Neno as well as Mulanje [districts] which were additional sites that we had not gone to screen and register together with immigration [officers].' Kausiwa said her department has received no new asylum-seekers from Mozambique so far. Meque of the Institute of Disaster Management Affairs in Mozambique said peace has returned to the country. Malawian authorities said they are struggling to provide for refugees because the situation comes at a time when more than a quarter of Malawi's 20 million people face food shortages due to an El Nino-induced drought. However, during the visit, the Mozambican delegation donated food to the refugees. Kausiwa of the Department of Refugees in Malawi, appreciated the donation. 'And in the package, there is some rice, maize flour, salt and some beans,' said Kausiwa. 'These are critical foods that can be provided to the community noting that food has been a challenge since these people started coming.' But Mozambican traditional leader Reymond Commando of the Mulili area said the refugees would only return if there was concrete proof of their safety. He said they fled to Malawi to escape being killed and chased from their homes 'like animals.' Plataforma Decide, a monitoring group in Mozambique, said in December that more than 200 people have been killed since post-election protests started in October.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-urges-refugees-in-malawi-to-return-home/7959157.html	2025-01-31T17:18:57-08:00	
UN: After taking Goma, M23 rebels head to Congo's Bukavu	UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations' peacekeeping chief said Friday that M23 rebels are advancing south toward the provincial capital of Bukavu after seizing control of Goma in the mineral-rich eastern Congo earlier this week. 'The information I have is that M23/RDF are about 60 kilometers north of Bukavu. They seem to be moving quite fast,' Jean Pierre Lacroix told reporters of the rebels who are backed by the Rwandan Defense Forces. 'There is an airport in the vicinity of where they are, I think a few kilometers south, which is Kavumu.' He said if they succeed in taking over the airport as they did in Goma, it would be another 'significant step.' Congolese military bases in Bukavu were being emptied on Thursday to reinforce positions along the route to the provincial capital, residents told The Associated Press. Reuters reports that officials in Bukavu have also been recruiting civilians to help protect the city. Rwanda did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the latest military movements. Rebels take over schools, hospitals Earlier this month, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in along the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the support of the Rwandan army. Rwanda has denied accusations that it supports the rebels, whom the Congolese government has designated as a terrorist group. Until June, the United Nations had peacekeepers deployed in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province. The U.N. made an agreement with the government to gradually begin drawing down its mission, known as MONUSCO, and closed its Bukavu office. In areas under M23 control in South Kivu, including the key trading town of Minova, the rebels have occupied schools and hospitals, expelled displaced persons from camps, and forced the local population to fight for them and perform forced labor, the U.N. office of human rights said Friday. The U.N. peacekeeping chief, echoing the secretary-general and the Security Council, urged diplomatic engagement to halt the fighting and lead to a political solution. Goma still 'tense,' some services restored Meanwhile, in the North Kivu provincial capital of Goma, which fell to the rebels earlier this week, the situation is 'tense and volatile,' Lacroix said, but calm is gradually being restored, along with some basic services. U.N. peacekeepers have also been able to resupply some of their positions, he said. The airport, however, remains out of commission after sustaining heavy damage to its runways. The World Health Organization and the Congolese government assessed that 700 people had been killed between Sunday and Thursday, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. Another 2,800 wounded are receiving treatment in health facilities. 'These numbers are expected to rise as more information becomes available,' Dujarric said. The International Organization for Migration said 300,000 people had been sheltering in displacement sites, including on the outskirts of Goma. Those sites are now mostly empty as people fled the fighting. The agency says the displaced urgently need food, shelter, clean water, medical care and protection. Before the latest round of violence, eastern Congo was mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country's valuable mineral deposits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-after-taking-goma-m23-rebels-head-toward-bukavu-congo/7958949.html	2025-01-31T16:37:07-08:00	
Why the Arctic matters in the 21st century	The Arctic is one of the coldest and least populated regions on Earth, much of it covered by ice. But in recent years it has become one of the most important sites of geopolitical tensions — and a key focus of American policy. Despite its inhospitability, land north of the Arctic Circle has long been inhabited by Indigenous people like the Inuit, Sami and Yukaghir and today includes territories belonging to eight countries: Canada, Russia, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the United States. In 1996, these countries formed the Arctic Council — a forum that includes all eight countries as member states along with representatives from Indigenous groups. But while the Arctic was once envisioned as a neutral zone where research and conservation could promote deeper international cooperation, multiple developments since then have turned it into a site of competition. The number one issue facing the Arctic is climate change. Since the 1990s, Arctic sea ice has declined by 7.6 trillion metric tons, with the rate of loss increasing by 57%. Besides contributing to rising sea levels, the loss of ice also reduces global solar reflection. This creates a feedback loop as the darker ocean water absorbs more heat, causing more ice to melt, adversely affecting global weather patterns. The melting of Arctic ice also directly affects local wildlife, with polar bear populations projected to decline by two-thirds in the next quarter-century as they lose their hunting grounds. But where some see environmental disaster, others see opportunity. The melting ice is making Arctic trade routes more navigable, providing shorter distances for transoceanic shipping than current lanes using the Suez and Panama canals. Furthermore, increased navigability is expanding potential for exploration and extraction of natural resources. The Arctic region is estimated to hold over 20% of the world’s remaining fossil fuel reserves, with over 400 oil and gas fields already discovered. Both the seabed and offshore areas also hold vast quantities of minerals ranging from staple commodities like iron, gold, nickel and zinc to rare earth metals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are used in electronics and battery technology. Even traditional subsistence activity may be greatly altered and expanded as global warming leads fish stocks to migrate north and more coastal land becomes available for agriculture. Yet economic opportunities in the Arctic are emerging at a time of increased geopolitical tensions, as countries scramble to secure resources, stake territorial claims and develop facilities. With 53% of the Arctic coastline under its control, Russia has the largest presence in the region in terms of civilian ports like Murmansk and Arkhangelsk as well as multiple airfields and military bases along its northern border. More recently, Russia has moved to expand its claims to the Arctic seabed at the same time that its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has led other members of the Arctic Council to suspend cooperation with Moscow. While land jurisdiction in the Arctic is largely settled aside from a few small disputes, maritime claims are much more complex. Control over Arctic waters is generally governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which defines multiple types of territorial waters where a nation may have the right to restrict the activity of foreign vessels. These range from internal waters that are considered part of a nation’s sovereign territory to exclusive economic zones where foreign ships may travel freely but cannot extract resources. Although the United States played a formative role in negotiating the treaty and abides by most of its provisions, it remains one of the few countries that has not formally acceded to it because of concerns about limitations it places on seabed mining. Even among UNCLOS signatories, however, boundary definitions can vary. While Canada considers parts of the Northwest Passage to lie within its territorial waters, for example, most other nations including the United States consider it to be an international strait where foreign ships may transit. Similarly, Russia has claimed parts of the Northeast Passage along its northern coastline as internal waters, moving to restrict the right of passage in areas where it was previously allowed. Given these disputes, the Transpolar Sea Route through the center of the Arctic Ocean, which lies fully in international waters, will become more attractive as polar ice continues to thaw. The increasing importance of the Arctic has attracted the attention of other powers without Arctic territory. Several of these states have been admitted as observers in the Arctic Council, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea. China, which is also an observer, has unilaterally declared itself as a 'near-Arctic state' and has expanded both research and commercial activity in the region by partnering with Russia as well as investing in infrastructure in Norway, Iceland and Greenland. China’s increased presence in the Arctic alongside Russia’s more aggressive posture have been among the reasons cited for U.S. President Donald Trump’s insistence on annexing or buying Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark. While Greenland already contains a U.S. military base on its northwest coast, the discussion is likely to result in a further militarization of the territory, even under Denmark. Satellites are also expected to play a major role in exerting control within the Arctic, given the importance of observation and monitoring in remote areas with poor communications infrastructure. What was once considered a frozen frontier with little to offer is quickly becoming one of the most contested regions on Earth. And as the planet heats up, competition in the Arctic will as well.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-the-arctic-matters-in-the-21st-century-/7958931.html	2025-01-31T15:47:38-08:00	
Trump administration moving to fire FBI agents involved in investigations of Trump, AP sources say	WASHINGTON — Trump administration officials are moving to fire at least some of the FBI agents engaged in investigations involving President Donald Trump, two people familiar with the plans said Friday. It was not clear how many agents might be affected, though scores of investigators were involved in various inquiries touching Trump. Officials acting at the direction of the administration have been working to identify individual employees who participated in politically sensitive investigations for possible termination, said the people who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. A third person familiar with the situation said U.S. attorneys were instructed on a call this week to provide the names of prosecutors and agents who had any involvement in the hundreds of cases against the rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It was not made clear on the call why the names were needed, said the person, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. Any mass firings would be a major blow to the historic independence from the White House of the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency and would reflect Trump's persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a mass firing by the Justice Department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team who investigated Trump. The FBI Agents Association said the planned firings are 'outrageous actions' that 'are fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI agents.' 'Dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the bureau's ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the bureau and its new leadership for failure,' the association said in a statement. It was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might take, but the bureau has a well-defined process for terminations and any abrupt action that bypasses the protocol could presumably open the door to a legal challenge. When pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump's pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the FBI's internal review processes for taking action against employees. Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that didn't follow that standard process, Patel said, 'I don't know what's going on right now over there, but I'm committed to you, Senator, and your colleagues, that I will honor the due process of the FBI.' Before he was nominated for the director's position, Patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about the existence of what he called anti-Trump 'conspirators' in the government and news media. Trump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and Justice Department over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the last four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia investigation and then said he would fire his second, Christopher Wray. Wray later resigned before Trump took office Jan. 20. Asked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents, he said: 'No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody's never seen before. They came after a lot of people — like me — but they came after a lot of people.' He added, 'If they fired some people over there, that's a good thing, because they were very bad.' The FBI and Smith's team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump's November presidential win because of long-standing Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president. The Justice Department also brought charges against more than 1,500 Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, though Trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them — including the ones convicted of violent crimes — through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments. This week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives — including several executive assistant directors and leaders of big-city field offices — were told to either resign or retire or be fired Monday. Spokespeople for the FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment. The firings would be done over the will of acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, who has indicated that he objects to the idea, the people said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-moving-to-fire-fbi-agents-involved-in-investigations-of-trump-ap-sources-say/7958928.html	2025-01-31T15:40:15-08:00	
Consumers brace for impact of China tariffs	washington — White House press secretary Karoline Levitt announced Friday that President Donald Trump would be implementing 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods and a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports on Saturday. Consumers told VOA they were bracing for the possible impact of increased costs. 'I’m concerned about rising prices,' Yon Bui, a student of music and computer science at Middlebury College in Vermont, said in an interview Thursday. Bui said that while it might still be too early to tell what the impact could be, she has been considering purchasing costly items, such as expensive cosmetics that she buys sometimes, from China. She also said she needed a new phone. Bui said she would 'buy products now before they go up in price to a point where they’d become unaffordable.' Sean Liu, who lives in Virginia, told VOA that he was glad he'd recently decided to buy a new phone and car. 'With things that are already really expensive, if you add another 10% to their price – it's not like, say, buying a thermos and adding another 10% – this kind of price hike is truly big,' he said. He did add, though, that it might be a little easier to deal with if the tariffs came alongside lower prices for more basic necessities like groceries and gas. ‘One very big power’ On the campaign trail, Trump threatened tariffs as high as 60% on China. Since taking office, those threats have expanded and include everything from a universal tariff to threats against trade partners and rivals such as China and Russia. Last week, Trump threatened Colombia with tariffs of 25% to 50% to get Bogota to accept deportation flights. On China, Trump recently told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that tariffs were the 'one very big power' the U.S. has over China. 'They don't want them, and I'd rather not have to use it,' Trump said. The 10% tariff on all Chinese imports is part of what Trump says is a punitive response to China’s role in manufacturing precursor chemicals essential to fentanyl production in Mexico. Currently, the United States targets China with a 100% tariff on electric vehicles, a 50% tariff on solar cells and semiconductors, a 25% tariff on critical minerals needed to make certain advanced batteries and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. New tariffs would build on more than $300 billion worth of taxes on Chinese imports that Trump imposed during his first term. Those tariffs were upheld and, in some cases, advanced under former President Joe Biden. Who will feel impact? Some analysts question who will be hurt if these tariffs are implemented. Some say the deep economic ties between China and the United States could mean that American consumers will be the ones bearing the brunt of Trump’s punishment on Beijing. Supporters, however, see the move as a fulfillment of Trump’s promise to put American lives and livelihoods first — particularly when it comes to stopping the flow of fentanyl into the country. According to William Reinsch, senior adviser of the economics program and Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the tariff likely would raise prices of goods in America. 'The prices on a lot of things that people buy at retail — apparel, footwear, household goods – things like that will be affected. Ten percent is not huge, but it's not zero either,' Reinsch said. Costs and benefits Trump has pushed back against the argument that tariffs drive inflation higher and said instead that tariffs would make America rich. Liu Longzhu, a California lawyer and delegate at the 2024 Republican National Convention, sees tariffs as the key to recovering America’s economic strength. 'The main purpose of increasing tariffs is to assure that America is truly ‘America First’ and protect American jobs. If you are looking for a job, they are beneficial to you. If the tariffs are increased, Chinese products will lose their competitiveness, and American products will become more competitive. This will make it easier for Americans to find jobs,' Liu said. James Galbraith, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, doesn’t see tariffs as inherently inflationary, and he agrees that tariffs would bring back jobs that were lost to overseas companies. 'A tariff strategy can be implemented in such a way that the cost largely falls outside of the country,' Galbraith told VOA. But Stephen Lamar, president and CEO at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said that tariffs, especially those levied on China, will ultimately raise the cost of both domestic and foreign goods given the interconnectivity of global economies. 'The theory on paper is that you're giving domestic producers an advantage. The reality in practice is that more people are paying higher prices for products, regardless of their source,' Lamar told VOA. Reinsch also cast doubt on the ability of tariffs to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, particularly in labor-intensive sectors like apparel or footwear. 'I would be surprised if you see a renaissance in the American apparel industry as a result of a 10% tariff. It would take a lot more than that,' Reinsch said, adding that tariffs don’t guarantee a move away from imports and toward domestic manufacturing. Importers looking for cheap products can still source from countries in Southeast Asia or Africa that provide competitive, low-cost alternatives to Chinese products.	https://www.voanews.com/a/consumers-brace-for-impact-of-china-tariffs/7958898.html	2025-01-31T15:03:45-08:00	
Venezuela calls Rubio 'enemy' over US recognition of Guyana's territorial integrity	The territory in question has been under Guyana’s control for more than a century, and it is Venezuela that has failed to maintain its own obligations to law and peace.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-calls-rubio-enemy-over-us-recognition-of-guyana-s-territorial-integrity/7958873.html	2025-01-31T14:11:58-08:00	
US deportations to China continue amid shifts in immigration crackdown	The Trump administration has confirmed that the deportation of Chinese nationals is still underway as part of a broader effort to enforce U.S. immigration laws. In an emailed response to VOA this week, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official wrote that the agency is removing from the United States any immigrant who is here unlawfully. 'ICE continues to conduct removals to the People’s Republic of China. Due to operational security, ICE does not confirm future removal operations until deportees have been returned to their country of origin,' the ICE official said Tuesday, speaking on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous. VOA requested the most recent removal numbers for China and an update on deportation flights, but as of Friday, ICE had yet to respond. Deportations have increased as China signals a greater willingness to repatriate its citizens, a departure from its historically restrictive stance. Large repatriation flights resumed last June, the first since 2018. On Jan. 6, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through ICE, conducted the Biden administration’s fifth removal flight to China in less than seven months. 'These [Biden administration] flights were the product of sustained cooperation between the Department and PRC counterparts to repatriate individuals who have not established a legal basis to remain in the United States,' DHS said in a statement on Jan. 10. Fast-track deportations Under the Trump administration, the approach is shifting toward making deportations faster and bypassing judicial review. The Trump administration issued an executive order on Jan. 21 to expand expedited removal, also known as fast-track deportations, to include immigrants who cannot prove they have been continuously living in the United States for more than two years. 'The effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,' the notice read. Expedited removal allows the U.S. government to quickly deport people who are undocumented. Under the process of expedited removal, some noncitizens can be deported in a single day without an immigration court hearing or other appearance before a judge. ICE data from November showed 37,908 Chinese nationals who were believed to be removable from the United States but had not yet been detained. December and January numbers are not yet available. On Jan. 22, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over the expansion of expedited removal. The ACLU argued in court documents that the new rule violates federal law and the Fifth Amendment's due process clause by effectively eliminating full court hearings that immigrants are entitled to receive. The organization also cited studies indicating that expedited removals are prone to errors, often leading to the mistaken deportation of immigrants. Joanna Derman, a program director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, told VOA that advocates are worried the Trump administration will use 'extreme options' to specifically target Chinese nationals for deportation, 'especially in the event of a significant escalation between the United States and China.' 'But on the other hand,' she said, 'we're also rapidly mobilizing right now. … We are uplifting resources for people who are the most likely to be impacted. The most vulnerable folks need to know what to do if [or] when ICE shows up at their school, their work or their place of worship.' US-China repatriation cooperation For years, China has been among the countries that refused or delayed accepting deportees, complicating U.S. efforts to remove individuals with final orders. Countries that do not negotiate or refuse to accept their nationals back are deemed 'recalcitrant' or 'uncooperative.' Recalcitrant countries do not accept their nationals back. Uncooperative countries will accept some of their nationals back. According to an ICE official and a DHS removal operations document, 15 countries were deemed to be uncooperative: Bhutan, Burma, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Laos, Pakistan, the People’s Republic of China, Russia, Somalia and Venezuela. ICE considers these to be at risk of recalcitrant: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Gabon, Gambia, Iraq, Jamaica, Nicaragua, South Sudan, St. Lucia and Vietnam. During a Monday press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was asked if Beijing intended to accept all Chinese nationals in the U.S. illegally. 'I’d refer you to competent authorities for anything specific,' she said. 'Let me say more broadly that the Chinese government firmly opposes any form of illegal migration. We have conducted practical cooperation with the migration and law enforcement departments of the U.S. and other countries, which has been productive. As far as repatriation is concerned, China’s principle is to receive the repatriates who are confirmed as Chinese nationals from the Chinese mainland after verification.' ICE’s deportation numbers reflect U.S. diplomatic efforts with China, with DHS reporting the removal of 109 Chinese nationals on the latest charter flight as of November, following 131 deportations in October and 116 in June. According to DHS, the Biden administration’s increase in deportations matches China’s work to decrease illegal immigration, which has led to a 62% decline in Chinese migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. Apprehensions of Chinese dropped from 2,198 encounters in June 2024 to 873 in December 2024. January numbers are not yet available. Deportation logistics, cost An ICE official confirmed to VOA by email in late December that the U.S. government buys the commercial airline tickets for deportees, working closely with a travel service provider to book the most cost-effective flights. ICE determines whether to use charter or commercial flights based on operational needs. ICE did not share cost per person for either type of flight. But the American Immigration Council estimates that removing 1 million people a year would cost U.S. taxpayers about $88 billion, with the total over a decade approaching $1 trillion. Despite Beijing’s increased cooperation, China remains one of several nations that usually refuse to take back their citizens or delay repatriations. During the 2024 fiscal year, ICE removed 517 Chinese nationals from the United States. Deportation process In immigration court, deportation orders are usually issued after a foreign national violates the terms of a visa, is found to be undocumented or is convicted of a crime. When the United States seeks to deport an immigrant, it generally follows a framework negotiated with the other nation; these frameworks are often detailed in writing, through a memorandum of understanding. Before the United States can deport someone, the other country must agree to receive the deportee. There must also be an administratively final order of removal, or deportation order, and the individual must have a travel document issued by a foreign government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deportations-to-china-continue-amid-shifts-in-immigration-crackdown/7958862.html	2025-01-31T14:06:33-08:00	
RFK Jr. vows to stop collecting from vaccine lawsuit if confirmed to Cabinet	WASHINGTON — Facing intense scrutiny from U.S. senators over his potential profit from vaccine lawsuits while serving as the nation's health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that if he is confirmed he will not collect fees from litigation against the drugmakers of a cervical cancer vaccine. Kennedy, who's President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Health and Human Services agency, told the Senate finance committee that he would amend his ethics disclosure after several senators, including Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and his cousin Caroline Kennedy raised concerns about his financial arrangement with the law firm representing patients who are claiming injuries from the vaccines. 'An amendment to my Ethics Agreement is in process, and it provides that I will divest my interest in this litigation,' Kennedy said in a written response to the committee. Initially, Kennedy had told the committee that he would continue to accept referral fees in legal cases that don't involve the U.S. government. That included an arrangement with a law firm that's sued Merck over Gardasil, its human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents cervical cancer. The deal earned Kennedy $850,000 last year, and he told senators he had referred hundreds of clients to the firm. During Wednesday's hearing, Warren outlined several ways in which Kennedy could make it easier to sue vaccine manufacturers. 'Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he does it,' Warren said. 'Kids might die, but Robert Kennedy can keep cashing in.' The issue also may have been a concern for Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is also a physician and is conflicted over his vote on Kennedy's confirmation because of Kennedy's anti-vaccine views. The Republican president's nominee is 'financially vested in finding fault with vaccines,' Cassidy, the chair of the health committee, noted as he ended Thursday's confirmation hearing. Kennedy also stopped short of making other commitments, refusing to promise that he would not engage in lobbying Health and Human Services after his term ends. Kennedy and his supporters have railed against that sort of activity, saying the 'revolving door' of Washington — where federal officials trade public service jobs to influence government agencies while in the private sector — has undermined the U.S. public health system. He has criticized the practice at least a half-dozen times in social media posts over recent years. Kennedy, who ran for president last year before dropping his bid and endorsing Trump, vowed in one post on social media platform X to 'rein in lobbyists and slam shut the revolving door,' if elected president. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination but then ran as an independent before striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration. Now, after two days of hearings, his shot at that job is on the line with concerns about his anti-vaccine advocacy prompting nearly all Democrats to reject his nomination and a handful of Republicans who are at least considering doing the same. If Democrats unanimously oppose Kennedy, he'll need support from all but three Republicans. The Senate finance committee is expected to decide if he makes it to the Senate floor for a vote next week. Kennedy's response to the Senate committee was first reported by The New York Times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rfk-jr-vows-to-stop-collecting-from-vaccine-lawsuit-if-confirmed-to-cabinet/7958807.html	2025-01-31T13:24:43-08:00	
Uganda health officials warn of Ebola outbreak	KAMPALA, UGANDA — A day after Uganda's Ministry of Health announced a new Ebola outbreak in the capital, Kampala, most Ugandans appeared unaware or unconcerned about the outbreak and went about their business normally. But health authorities are warning Ugandans not to take Ebola lightly. For weeks, Uganda has battled an outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, that has affected more than 2,000 people and caused 13 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. But Dr. Julius Lutwama, deputy director of the Uganda Virus Research Institute, said Ugandans need to worry more about Ebola than mpox. 'Ebola is more highly infectious even than monkeypox,' Lutwama said. 'And it is even a more severe infection than monkeypox. The percentage of people that end up dead from Ebola is up to 80% while for monkeypox it is below 5%.' Ebola killed more than 50 people in Uganda during the 2022 outbreak. Nurse dies of Ebola On Thursday, Dr. Diana Atwine, Uganda's permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health, announced the new outbreak after a 32-year-old nurse died from the disease. Atwine said the nurse sought treatment at multiple health facilities including Mulago National Referral Hospital and from a traditional healer. The patient suffered with high fever, chest pain and difficulty breathing since Jan. 20, then unexplained bleeding and multiple organ failure before dying Wednesday. Atwine said the nurse died from the Sudan strain of Ebola. 'We will leave it to God' While the Ministry of Health is cautioning the public with reminders of the symptoms of Ebola, several Kampala residents who spoke to VOA said they had not heard about or were not worried about the outbreak. Kampala resident Ntale Steven said he is not going to shut down his business. 'We will leave it to God, so the disease doesn't spread,' he said. 'And if there's an outbreak, we should get treatment and be helped. Health workers should also care for whoever gets infected. Because we have nothing to do, we must move.' Health authorities have moved to quarantine those who had contact with the deceased Ebola victim. Out of the 44 people in isolation, 30 are health workers from the National Referral Hospital. The rest are family members and health workers from other private facilities. Lutwama said because it takes days before symptoms start to show, this is when most infected persons transmit the disease to others, placing health workers at a higher risk. 'Many people then can transmit it during that period, before they come to that stage of bleeding,' said Lutwama. 'But still the health workers are supposed to be on the lookout. And they are also supposed to be protected, but as you know, sometimes our hospitals are missing a few things like gloves, they don't have hypochlorite like Jik [bleach] to be able to wash their hands thoroughly and things like that.' Even with warnings from Lutwama and the Ministry of Health, Ogwang John, a security guard, said he will take precautions only if he gets an order from his boss. 'Me, I'm not worried,' he said. 'I always go with the decision of my boss. When he says that we do this, the disease is there, yes, we can take. But if he has not talked with me, I'm also a carefree man.' The Ministry of Health said it will continue tracing contacts and monitoring those under isolation as they await more support from the World Health Organization's contingency fund for emergencies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-health-officials-warn-of-ebola-outbreak/7958749.html	2025-01-31T12:30:17-08:00	
Lake Chad governors pledge stronger security, economic cooperation	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Leaders in Africa’s conflict-hit Lake Chad region have promised to fight illegal gun and drug trafficking, which were part of the discussions during their three-day gathering focused on stabilization, sustainability and development. The governors of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad have concluded an annual Lake Chad Basin Governors' Forum summit in Nigeria’s northeastern Borno State with local officials, traditional leaders, civil society groups and humanitarian partners also in attendance. This year's summit, the fifth since its inception in 2018, was hosted by Nigeria’s Yobe State. During the meeting, authorities praised ongoing joint efforts against terror groups, including Boko Haram and its offshoot ISWAP, in the region and pledged to intensify efforts to eliminate the remnants. ISWAP stands for the Islamic State in West Africa Province. The governors also resolved to combat illicit arms trade and drug trafficking while enhancing resilience initiatives to mitigate climate change and rehabilitate displaced populations. Ambassador Mamman Nuhu, executive secretary of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC), said discussions over the three days were 'fruitful and robust.' 'This gathering has reaffirmed our shared commitment to sustainable peace, regional stability and the prosperity of the community we serve,' Nuhu said. The Lake Chad governors also pledged to establish free-trade zones to foster economic recovery and integrate more women and youth into stabilization and resilience programs. But officials raised concerns over the suspension of support for Niger’s National Window of the Regional Stabilization Facility (RSF), warning it could hinder regional progress. Lake Chad, a vast but shallow body of water surrounded by Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger, provides livelihoods for millions through agriculture. However, decades of climate change and poor water management have caused the lake’s surface area to shrink by an alarming 90%, increasing competition for scarce resources. In recent years, Islamist militant groups have exploited the instability, using the region as a recruitment ground. Matthias Naab, director of the Regional Service Center for Africa at the United Nations Development Program, said participants at the community level added a great deal to the forum. 'The richness of the engagements in the pre-forums with civil society organizations and traditional leaders has been a highlight of this forum,' Naab said. 'Their perspectives grounded in community realities and have strengthened our dialogue and reinforced the principle that stabilize, resilience and recovery must be shaped by the voices of those most affected.' The governors' forum also emphasized the need to rehabilitate and reintegrate former fighters and called for member state support and collaboration with traditional leaders. The forum elected Nigeria’s Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, as its new chair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lake-chad-governors-pledge-stronger-security-economic-cooperation/7958773.html	2025-01-31T12:24:57-08:00	
War in Ukraine through the eyes of an artist	After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, artist and illustrator George Butler traveled to the war-torn country to paint scenes of modern wartime life.

Tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, China start Saturday	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China effective on Saturday, the White House said on Friday, but it provided no word on whether there would be any exemptions to the measures that could result in swift price increases to U.S. consumers. Trump, a Republican, had been threatening the tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from the countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl, but he also has pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing. 'Starting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. 'These are promises made and promises kept by the president.' Trump had said he was weighing issuing an exemption for Canadian and Mexican oil imports, but Leavitt said she had no information to share on the president's decision on any potential carveouts. The United States imported almost 4.6 million barrels of oil daily from Canada in October and 563,000 barrels from Mexico, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. daily production during that month averaged nearly 13.5 million barrels a day. He has previously stated that a 10% tariff on Chinese imports would be on top of other import taxes charged on products from the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tariffs-on-goods-from-canada-mexico-china-start-saturday-/7958695.html	2025-01-31T11:39:00-08:00	
More than 40 bodies recovered from Washington midair collision	Fire and emergency service officials in Washington said Friday that more than 40 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of a commercial passenger jet and military helicopter that collided and crashed into the Potomac River late Wednesday. Operations to recover the bodies of 67 people killed in the collision resumed at dawn Friday. The National Transportation Safety Board — or NTSB, the federal agency leading the investigation into the accident — reportedly is at the scene along with local and regional EMS crews. The commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional craft operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines, carried 64 passengers and crew, while the U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carried a crew of three. Officials said there were no survivors. The NTSB reported late Thursday the cockpit voice recorder and flight-data recorder from the airliner, devices often referred to as black boxes, have been recovered and are at the agency’s labs for evaluation. In an interview Friday with U.S.-based Fox News network, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the 'black box' for the helicopter had not yet been recovered, but that its data will likely determine who was piloting the helicopter at the time of the crash. Hegseth on Thursday said the crew, which was conducting a night-flight training evaluation, included a staff sergeant, a captain-in-training and a chief warrant officer, who was an instructor. The crew had been issued night vision goggles for the flight, but Hegseth said it was unclear if they were using them. The defense secretary also said Thursday that the helicopter’s altitude at the time of the accident was under investigation. The two aircraft collided as the passenger jet was attempting to land at Reagan National Airport. Hegseth said the flight voice and flight data recorders also could determine who was in communication with the airport’s air traffic control tower and if there was any confusion regarding the instructions they received. Citing a government report, The Washington Post said Thursday that the control tower was understaffed Wednesday night. The report said two people were handling the jobs of four inside the tower at the time of the collision. A similar report from U.S. broadcaster NBC News, citing a source familiar with the investigation, said a supervisor in the tower let an air traffic controller leave their shift early before the collision. That decision, the report said, left one controller to handle airplane traffic and helicopter traffic in the area, whereas typically there is one controller looking at each type of aircraft. The NBC report said it is allowable under Federal Aviation Administration standards for one person to do both jobs, although it is not considered optimal. The agency on Friday significantly restricted helicopter traffic in the immediate vicinity of Washington Reagan National Airport until further notice. At a news conference Thursday, both U.S. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner from Virginian said they had expressed concerns over the years regarding the high volume of air traffic in the Washington area, but they would await results from the accident probe before revisiting that specific concern. During a White House news conference Thursday, President Donald Trump suggested previous presidential administrations, led by Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, lowered standards for the hiring of air traffic controllers and blamed diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives in the federal government for that. He said he reversed those initiatives with executive orders last week. The U.S. Figure Skating organization said several members of its community, including athletes, coaches and family members, were among the passengers on the plane. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts,' the organization said. The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, also were on the plane. Trump said his administration would facilitate the return of their remains to Russia. Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest aviation incident on U.S. soil since 2001, when an American Airlines flight crashed in Belle Harbor, New York, killing 260 people. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-40-bodies-recovered-from-washington-mid-air-collision/7958629.html	2025-01-31T11:03:21-08:00	
Anger in Greece over rail disaster prompts opposition plan to challenge government	ATHENS — Three Greek opposition parties vowed Friday to challenge the country’s center-right government with a censure motion over its handling of a deadly rail disaster nearly two years ago. The pledge was prompted by mounting public anger over delays in the inquiry and allegations of a cover-up that the government strongly denies. Fifty-seven people were killed — including college students returning from a holiday — when a passenger train collided head-on with a freight train on Feb. 28, 2023, near Tempe in northern Greece. On Sunday, relatives of those killed led protests in dozens of cities, directed at the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Apart from rallies held in Athens, Thessaloniki and other Greek cities, protests were also organized by Greek communities in Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels and other European cities. Sokratis Famellos, leader of the left-wing Syriza party, said outside parliament that he sided with two other opposition parties, Pasok and the New Left, to seek a no-confidence vote. 'A joint initiative by progressive parties for a censure motion is necessary today. The evidence is there, and society demands accountability,' Famellos said Friday. Although a censure motion is unlikely to pose a direct threat to the government, it could help forge bonds in Greece’s fractured opposition. Lawmakers from the three parties confirmed they were involved in discussions to agree on the timing of the motion. Investigations have faced delays, with critics accusing authorities of obstructing justice. While some railway officials have been charged, no senior political figures have been held accountable, further intensifying public scrutiny. Speaking to ministers at a Cabinet meeting, Mitsotakis vowed to overcome the 'turbulence' facing the government. 'This difficult week comes to a close under the shadow of the Tempe tragedy,' he said in a televised address. 'We are now entering the final stage of investigations into this deeply painful national trauma.' The controversy overshadowed an ongoing parliamentary process to elect a new president. A government-backed candidate, Constantine Tassoulas, failed to win the cross-party support needed to secure the presidency in a second round of voting in parliament Friday. The 65-year-old former speaker of the assembly is expected to win in later rounds scheduled next month when the threshold is lowered.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anger-in-greece-over-rail-disaster-prompts-opposition-plan-to-challenge-government-/7958537.html	2025-01-31T09:53:21-08:00	
US aid freeze spells uncertain future for international media	WASHINGTON — On the front lines of the war in Ukraine, local newspapers are vital lifelines in areas where Russia has destroyed cell towers and internet infrastructure. Journalists provide information about evacuation routes, document alleged Russian war crimes and troop movements, and counter Moscow’s propaganda. Even a temporary freeze of U.S. foreign aid can mean financial difficulties for small media organizations that rely on outside donors to keep working. 'Many Ukrainian media may now face the threat of closure or significant reduction in operations in the coming weeks,' Sergiy Tomilenko, president of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine, told VOA. Ukraine is not alone. News outlets on the front lines of war and authoritarianism from Ukraine and Belarus to Myanmar are among the organizations affected by a freeze on U.S. foreign aid. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 mandating all federal government agencies pause all foreign development assistance for 90 days. The directive took effect on Jan. 24 and includes foreign funding from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked a White House directive that ordered a freeze on federal aid programs, but that does not apply to the foreign aid pause. 'Every dollar we spend, every program we fund, and every policy we pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions,' Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a Jan. 26 statement. 'Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?' Worldwide impact Many independent news outlets around the world rely on State Department and USAID funding because they report in repressive environments, according to the JX Fund, a Berlin-based group that supports exiled media. With the current freeze, news outlets around the world are scrambling to find alternative sources of funding in an attempt to continue delivering the news to their audiences and avoid shutting down, multiple analysts told VOA. 'The general feeling is panic. Panic is the only way to describe the situation,' Karol Luczka, who works in Eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna, told VOA. JX Fund managing director Penelope Winterhager agreed. These outlets 'are thrown back to emergency mode,' she said. The measure is estimated to be affecting dozens of independent news outlets in more than 30 countries, according to the Brussels-based European Federation of Journalists, or EFJ. Maja Sever, EFJ president, called on potential donors to fill the gap. 'The European Union and other donors cannot abandon to their fate journalists who are the best bulwark for defending the rule of law and democracy in countries where they are under threat,' Sever said in a statement Tuesday. During the 90-day pause, relevant U.S. departments and agencies are required to review their foreign funding and determine whether the aid will continue, be modified or cease altogether, according to the executive order. Neither the State Department nor USAID replied to VOA’s requests for comment. In Ukraine Tomilenko said the aid freeze is creating a dire situation for Ukrainian news outlets on the front line of the war. 'In many areas close to the battle lines, local newspapers are often the only reliable source of information,' said Tomilenko, who is based in Kyiv. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has ramped up global propaganda efforts while further restricting independent media inside Russia. The war has also limited the advertising market in Ukraine, which would ideally be a primary source of financial independence for Ukrainian news outlets, said Tomilenko. The USAID website says it supports programs that 'promote free and independent media' in more than 30 countries. VOA could not determine how much U.S. aid goes to support media outlets in these countries. In the case of Ukraine, Luczka said, 'The previous administration in the U.S. saw the importance of supporting civil society in Ukraine in order to make sure that this country keeps standing.' The United States has been the strongest player when it came to supporting independent media outlets, according to the JX Fund’s Winterhager. But even though these outlets receive foreign funding, Winterhager emphasized that 'their reporting is independent.' In Myanmar Several Myanmar news outlets that rely on financial support from USAID and Internews also find themselves in a precarious situation. Internews is a USAID-affiliated nonprofit that supports independent media. After launching a coup in 2021, Myanmar’s military arrested journalists and banned news outlets. The crackdown forced entire outlets to flee into exile. Some outlets now report from the Thai-Myanmar border, while others manage to operate from rebel-controlled regions of Myanmar. Funding has been among the biggest problems for Myanmar media since the coup. 'It is difficult — or even impossible — for many of them to make commercial revenue in this environment,' Ben Dunant, editor-in-chief of the magazine Frontier Myanmar, told VOA last year. 'This underlines the vulnerability of these media organizations whose operations are dependent on the whims of donors in faraway countries.' Mizzima, one of the most prominent of the country’s news outlets and an affiliate of VOA, is among those affected by the aid freeze, according to local media reports. Founded in exile in 1998, the media outlet covers news on the resistance against the junta and China’s growing influence in the region. Another outlet, Western News, has already cut staff, according to its chief editor, Wunna Khwar Nyo. 'We are struggling to survive,' Wunna Khwar Nyo told VOA. 'Ultimately, this will also hurt the Burmese people.' If the funding freeze forces news outlets to shutter, the IPI’s Luczka warned that state-backed propaganda from countries such as Russia could fill the gap. 'When media outlets disappear, they create a void,' Luczka said. 'And that void needs to be filled by something.' VOA’s Burmese Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aid-freeze-spells-uncertain-future-for-international-media/7958494.html	2025-01-31T09:51:07-08:00	
Trump envoy Grenell expected to meet Venezuela's Maduro	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy Richard Grenell is expected to meet with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Friday in Venezuela, according to U.S. Special Envoy for Latin America Mauricio Claver-Carone. Trump said last week his administration likely would stop buying oil from Venezuela and was looking 'very strongly' at the South American country. Grenell, Trump's envoy for special missions, had earlier said he spoke with multiple officials in Venezuela and would begin meetings, days after the outgoing Biden administration imposed new sanctions on the government of Maduro. 'Diplomacy is back,' Grenell said in a post on social media platform X disclosing his initial calls. 'Talking is a tactic.' During his campaign, Trump called Maduro a dictator after he pursued a 'maximum pressure' campaign against him during his first term, from 2017 to 2021, including imposing harsh sanctions on the South American country and its oil industry. Former President Joe Biden briefly rolled back some of the Trump-era restrictions following electoral promises from Maduro but then reinstated them, saying the Venezuelan leader had reneged on pledges for a fair democratic vote. The Financial Times reported Friday that Chevron is trying to protect the special U.S. license allowing it to operate in Venezuela. The oil giant's chief executive, Mike Wirth, told the newspaper the company would engage with the White House after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the license should be reconsidered. If Chevron is forced out, China and Russia will gain influence in the OPEC nation, Wirth said. Venezuela's oil exports to the U.S. soared 64% to some 222,000 barrels per day last year, making the United States its second-largest export market behind China, which took 351,000 bpd, down 18% compared with the previous year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-envoy-grenell-expected-to-meet-venezuela-s-maduro/7958410.html	2025-01-31T08:38:16-08:00	
EU: Human rights progress needed to preserve Pakistan's trade privileges	ISLAMABAD — The European Union is linking Pakistan’s access to European trading markets as a duty-free exporter to progress on the country’s 'most pressing' human rights issues. Olof Skoog, the EU’s special human rights envoy, issued a warning Friday following a weeklong visit to the South Asian nation, where authorities have faced increasing accusations of suppressing civil liberties, political dissent, and free speech. 'The trade benefits under [the human rights development plan known as] GSP+ depend on the progress made on addressing a list of issues, including on human rights, and tangible reforms remain essential,' a post-visit EU statement quoted Skoog as saying. He referred to the Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus, commonly known as GSP+, which grants developing countries, including Pakistan, tariff-free access to the EU market in exchange for its adherence to specific human and labor rights obligations. The EU statement noted that its envoy highlighted areas of concern during meetings with Pakistani leaders, including blasphemy laws, enforced disappearances, freedom of expression, media independence, impunity for rights violations, due process, fair trials, civic space, and the death penalty. 'As we approach the midterm of the current monitoring cycle, we encourage Pakistan to continue on its reform path as it prepares for reapplication under the upcoming new GSP+ regulation,' Skoog stated. The declaration noted that 'Pakistan has become the largest beneficiary of GSP+' since the implementation of the trading plan in 2014, with Pakistani businesses increasing their exports to the EU market by 108%. The EU envoy’s visit coincided with the swift passage of controversial amendments by Pakistan's parliament this week to cybercrime laws that critics warned would curtail freedom of speech, not only for the conventional media but also for social media users. The legislation criminalizes the 'intentional' spread of 'false news' with prison terms of up to three years, a fine of up to $7,100, or both. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government, accused of growing censorship, has defended the law, saying it is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation. Pakistani and international free media advocacy groups, along with human rights activists, have condemned the amended law and are calling for its immediate repeal.

Many across Africa shocked by 90-day freeze on US aid	NAIROBI, KENYA — Many people across Africa are shocked and worried about the 90-day pause on U.S.-funded foreign aid and a stop-work order on existing grants and contracts worldwide. While the orders have been modified to allow waivers for 'life-saving humanitarian assistance,' many are struggling to assess the implications of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision. The Trump administration says that the United States spends about $40 billion every year in aid, and that it’s time to review and prioritize America’s core national interest one dollar at a time. Most development and humanitarian assistance is channeled through the U.S. Agency for International Development through various programs, working with individuals, communities, organizations and countries across the globe. In Kenya, while many organizations directly affected are keeping quiet, one employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he’s grateful for what American aid has accomplished over the years. 'We've been having success stories,' he said. The employee is among the hundreds who received a stop-work order. He said he is most concerned for the beneficiaries of programs he’s been associated with over the years. 'These are families who were anticipating they could get support. … This will stop. … There are children who are HIV-positive, and we always collaborate with their facilities to ensure that they are viral-suppressed. Now they’ll be of high viral load,' the man said. On Tuesday, the administration issued waivers on 'existing life-saving humanitarian' assistance programs, including 'core life-saving medicine,' which may apply to health programs such as PEPFAR, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which works with partners in 55 countries worldwide. One of them is South Africa, where 7.8 million people have HIV/AIDS. Asanda Ngoasheng, an independent political analyst from South Africa, said the nation 'is the biggest beneficiary of the PEPFAR program, and has been for many years. … It will have dire consequences for people in the region because there are some people who come to South Africa to receive some medication. … So, it’s a medical disaster in waiting, effectively, and a humanitarian disaster in waiting.' Addressing a press conference broadcast live on SABC on Wednesday, South African Health Minister Dr. Pakishe Motsoaledi said he hopes withdrawn aid will not affect antiretroviral treatments. 'One thing we want to ascertain is that nobody must stop taking ARVs,' Motsoaledi said. 'That will be devastating. ... When you are on ARVs and you stop, there will be serious trouble.' Through PEPFAR, the U.S. has invested over $110 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response, saving over 25 million lives and preventing millions of HIV infections since it was established more than two decades ago by President George W. Bush, according to U.S. State Department data. There are other programs that can’t afford a funding break, said Dr. Akila Udoji, manager of Karu Primary Healthcare Center, a Nigerian facility sponsored by USAID. 'Tuberculosis diagnosis treatment, if that funding is cut off, it will greatly affect the program because there won’t be any diagnosis of such cases and then the medicines, people can’t afford them,' Udoji said. 'And if they can’t afford it, it will lead to serious outbreaks of these diseases.' The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, an advocacy group, welcomed the administration’s review of foreign assistance programs in a statement but expressed some concerns. Former commander of U.S. Central Command Anthony Zinni, who is co-chair of the council of nearly 270 retired admirals and generals, warned that the freeze 'takes the U.S. off the playing field' and could directly affect U.S. military operations overseas. VOA requested interviews with the USAID offices in Kenya, Nigeria and the U.S. but did not receive replies. Meanwhile, the 90-day freeze is already paying dividends, a statement released by the U.S. State Department said this week. It said the review has already prevented over $1 billion in spending not aligned with the administration’s 'America First' agenda, including programs providing certain contraceptive, climate justice, clean energy and abortion programs and services. VOA’s Kate Bartlett in South Africa and Timothy Obiezu in Nigeria contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/many-across-africa-shocked-by-90-day-freeze-on-us-aid/7958378.html	2025-01-31T08:07:46-08:00

Hamas announces names of hostages to be released Saturday	The militant group Hamas has announced — and Israel has confirmed — the identity of the next three hostages to be released Saturday in the fourth such exchange between the sides under a ceasefire agreement to halt more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza. The hostages include Yarden Bibas, 35, who was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel along with his wife, Shiri, and two young boys, Ariel and Kfir. The fate of his family is uncertain. Also to be released is U.S.-Israeli citizen Keith Siegel, 65, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, who was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza along with his wife, Aviva Siegel. Aviva Siegel was released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. The third hostage was identified as Ofer Kalderon, 54, a French-Israeli hostage, who was captured by the militants from Kibbutz Nir Oz along with his two children. His ex-wife, Hadas, also was taken captive. The two children and Hadas Kalderon were released during the 2023 hostage exchange. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the U.S., Britain and other Western nations. Hamas released eight hostages, including three Israelis and five Thai nationals, on Thursday. Later in the day, Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners, including 32 serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. Under the ceasefire deal, more than 423,000 Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza. The Israeli military ordered them out of the territory in the earliest stages of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. At a news conference Friday in Geneva, the U.N.’s World Food Program, WFP, provided an update on efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. Country Director Antoine Renard told reporters the agency has delivered more than 32,000 metric tons of food into Gaza since the ceasefire agreement began on Jan. 19. He said that amount was more than twice what was delivered in December and three times what was delivered in October. Renard said the WFP has already reached 300,000 people. Meanwhile, during a visit to Lebanon Friday, Egypt’s foreign affairs minister, Badr Abdelatty, called for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon. Following talks with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Abdelatty told reporters, 'Egypt is very keen on confirming the need for a full and complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, without taking away a single inch of Lebanese sovereignty and territory.' Under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal announced Nov. 27, Israeli forces were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, and the militant group Hezbollah was to move north of the Litani River by Jan. 26. Israeli forces have remained in more than a dozen villages past the deadline. The United States and Lebanon announced Sunday the deadline to meet the ceasefire terms had been extended to Feb. 18. Since the ceasefire began, Israel has conducted near-daily operations in southern Lebanon, including airstrikes and shelling. They accuse Hezbollah of violating ceasefire terms by attempting to move weapons. In statements posted to its social media accounts, the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, reported overnight Thursday its fighter jets launched several attacks against what it said were Hezbollah terrorist organization targets in Lebanon’s Bekaa region, which it said 'posed a threat to the Israeli home front and IDF forces.' The IDF statement said the targets included a military site 'with underground infrastructure for the development and production of weapons and transit infrastructure on the Syrian-Lebanon border' through which, the IDF said, Hezbollah was trying to transfer weapons. The IDF also reported the Israeli air force intercepted a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone over Israeli territory Thursday, which it said violates the ceasefire agreement. 'The IDF continues to be committed to the understandings reached regarding the ceasefire in Lebanon,' its statement said, 'and will not allow the execution of terrorist plots of this type.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-announces-names-of-hostages-to-be-released-saturday-/7958346.html	2025-01-31T07:32:20-08:00	
Rubio warns of China’s potential to block Panama Canal in conflict	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first official trip as the nation’s top diplomat on Saturday, with planned visits to Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic from Saturday to Thursday. Officials and experts say the visit is partly aimed at countering China’s growing influence in the region. The trip comes as President Donald Trump pushes to regain control of the Panama Canal, and as Washington intensifies efforts to curb illegal migration. 'Secretary Rubio’s engagements with senior officials and business leaders will promote regional cooperation on our core, shared interests: Stopping illegal and large-scale migration, fighting the scourge of transnational criminal organizations and drug traffickers, countering China, and deepening economic partnerships to enhance prosperity in our hemisphere,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on Friday. Trump has asserted that China controls the Panama Canal, a crucial trade route linking the Atlantic and Pacific. But Panama has denied the claim, insisting that it manages the canal impartially for all maritime traffic. On Thursday, Rubio warned that China could potentially block access to the canal in the event of a conflict. 'If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to. And in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so. That is a direct threat,' Rubio said during an interview with SiriusXM Radio. In Panama City, Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino ruled out any discussion of control over the canal with Rubio. 'I cannot negotiate and much less open a process of negotiation on the canal,' he told reporters on Thursday. 'That is sealed. The canal belongs to Panama.' Some analysts caution that China has been employing economic and noneconomic tactics across the Western Hemisphere to expand its influence, prompting national security concerns. 'You might think that you are just getting more Chinese investment in your country, but pretty soon you are kind of being coerced or coaxed into signing at the Belt and Road Initiative, or you're being coaxed into signing another deal that gives elements of your telecoms,' said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, during an online discussion Thursday. The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI 'is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.' China’s foreign direct investment, or FDI, in Latin America and the Caribbean has grown significantly, Berg said, citing approximately $160 billion in Chinese FDI over the past 15 years. 'From the lens of national security, a lot of China's commercial endeavors are fundamentally military ambitions that they're prepositioning into Latin America,' said Joseph Humire, executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society, or SFS, a national security think tank. 'China's been in Panama for more than 20 years, but China really got politically active in Panama after 2017,' when Panama signed the BRI and shifted its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People’s Republic of China, said Humire on Thursday. He said that Panama's economy has declined in recent years. All the nations on Rubio’s itinerary maintain diplomatic ties with Cuba and Venezuela. Given the strained U.S. relations with these countries and their restrictions on accepting deportees, Rubio may use his trip to advocate for 'third-country' agreements, allowing other nations to receive people deported by the U.S. Additionally, he could work on facilitating increased repatriation flights for migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-warns-of-china-s-potential-to-block-panama-canal-in-conflict/7958272.html	2025-01-31T06:46:15-08:00	
Serbian student protesters march ahead of bridge blockade as driver rams Belgrade demonstration	INDJIJA, Serbia — Hundreds of striking students marched through the Serbian countryside Friday as they took their anti-graft protest toward the northern city of Novi Sad, where they plan to blockade three bridges over the River Danube this weekend. The bridge blockade planned for Saturday will mark three months since a huge concrete construction at the railway station collapsed in Novi said on Nov. 1, leaving 15 people dead. What started two months ago as a protest against suspected corruption in construction contracts has developed into the most serious challenge in years to the country’s powerful populist leader, President Aleksandar Vucic. Meanwhile in Belgrade, a driver rammed a car into a silent protest Friday, injuring two women who work as doctors at a nearby psychiatric institution. Media reports say both hit the pavement with their heads and are being examined. The incident, the third of its kind in weeks, happened in downtown Belgrade during 15 minutes of silence observed daily throughout Serbia at around noon when the canopy collapsed at the railway station in Novi Sad. Pro-government thugs have repeatedly attacked the protesters, many of them students, twice ramming cars into demonstrations. Two people were seriously injured in the previous attacks. Along the way to Novi Sad on Friday, the students were greeted by cheering citizens who honked their car horns or came out of their homes to offer food and drinks. When they reached the town of Indjija on Thursday, roughly halfway along their 80-kilometer route, the students were welcomed with fireworks and cheers from residents. Although most of them spent the night out in the open in a soccer field, the freezing temperatures did not dampen their desire for major changes in the corruption-ridden Balkan state. Nevena Vecerinac, a student, said she hoped the protesters' demands that include the punishment of all those responsible for the rail station tragedy will be fulfilled. 'We will make it to Novi Sad,' she said. 'Yesterday’s walk was easy. It’s cold now, but we can make it. We all have the same goal.' 'We need support from all people. With this energy and mood, I hope we can do it, otherwise there will be no brighter future,' said Luka Arsenovic, another student marcher. Many in Serbia believe that the collapse of the overhang at the train station was essentially caused by government corruption in a large infrastructure project with Chinese state companies. Critics believe graft led to a sloppy job during the reconstruction of the Novi Sad train station, poor oversight and disrespect of existing safety regulations. Monthslong demonstrations have already forced the resignation of Serbia’s prime minister Milos Vucevic this week, along with various concessions from authorities which were ignored by the protesters who say that is not enough. Vucic and other officials have shifted from accusing the students of working with foreign powers to oust him, to offering concessions or issuing veiled threats. The strength and determination of the protesters have caught many by surprise in a country where hundreds of thousands of young people have emigrated, looking for opportunities elsewhere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-student-protesters-march-ahead-of-bridge-blockade-as-driver-rams-belgrade-demonstration-/7958279.html	2025-01-31T06:36:55-08:00	
Chad officials say French troops have finally left after 70 years’ presence	YAOUNDE — Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby said Chad's military is ready to protect the country from any destabilization attempt as a January 31 deadline loomed for France to withdraw its troops. The last French troops left the N'djamena military base they occupied for about 70 years this week, continuing France’s reduced military presence in West Africa. Chad's President Field Marshal Mahamat Idriss Deby says this week’s departure of the last French troops from the central African state signals a new dawn for Chad. Deby spoke at the Sergeant Adji Kossei Military Base in Chad's capital, N'djamena, Friday, during a ceremony to mark the complete withdrawal of French troops before the January 31 deadline he gave Paris to pull out its troops. The event, broadcast on state radio and TV, was attended by top military officials, government ministers, traditional rulers, diplomats and huge crowds of onlookers. Twenty-six-year-old teacher Balkange Jean spoke to VOA via a messaging app from N'djamena Friday. He said he was delighted to see French troops leaving. He said he does not understand why it took a long time for Chad’s government officials to order French troops out. He says French troops were only useful in Chad from June 1983 to December 1984, when France sent close to 4,000 troops to stop an invasion by Libyan military and Chad rebels. French troops officially arrived in N'djamena to train the country’s young military during independence in 1960. Deby said the forces remained, claiming France wanted to support Chad's air force against rebels. It stationed troops in N'djamena claiming it was helping Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger to fight militant groups and terrorists operating within Sahel states. State TV reports that the last French military planes and fighter aircraft left Chad Friday after handing over France's last military base in a military ceremony in N'Djamena Thursday. Chad announced an end to military cooperation with France November 28. On December 10, several hundred of the more than 1,000 French troops began leaving, but on December 31, Deby ordered the troops to leave his country by January 31. General Pascal Ianni, the commander of French forces in Africa, speaking on Chad state TV on Friday, said the withdrawal of French troops from several African countries, including Chad, enables France to adapt itself to a revolution that Africa and the world is facing. He said France has to reinvent its military ties in Africa, where dynamic and younger leaders are affecting several changes and bringing hope to their citizens. French troops were also ordered out of the West African nations of Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali following coups in the countries. Last year, Senegal said it was negotiating the withdrawal of French forces before December of this year. Djelassem Maïbé Adolphe is a former member of Chad’s Movement for Peace, Reconstruction and Development, a former rebel group. He was granted amnesty and freed from prison by Deby in August. He said many leaders in French-speaking African states with young leaders tend to turn to Russia for military assistance because of growing anti-French sentiments. He said African countries should make sure they individually and collectively have strong militaries to protect their territories instead of thinking that they can always count on external support. Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have shifted toward Russia by signing military deals and inviting Russian troops to train Africa militaries. Chad says it is within its sovereign powers to negotiate military cooperation with any country of its choice, and that its troops are well trained to protect Chadians and their territory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-officials-say-french-troops-have-finally-left-after-70-years-presence-/7958190.html	2025-01-31T06:02:52-08:00	
Myanmar’s rebels closing in around junta into fifth year of civil war	Bangkok — Myanmar’s rebel groups made historic gains last year, the fourth of a civil war set off by a military coup in February 2021, seizing wide swathes of the country’s west and northeast and overrunning two of the regime’s regional command bases for the first time. As the war enters its fifth bloody year Saturday, experts tell VOA the rebels are positioned to keep gaining ground in 2025, closing in on more cities and weapons factories vital to the military despite mounting efforts by China, which has billions of dollars invested in the country, to keep the junta afloat. 'The military has lost significant control, and in 2025, based on that trajectory over late 2023 and 2024 … it will still continue to lose control,' said Matthew Arnold, an independent analyst tracking the war. A BBC World Service study found the junta in full control of only 21% of Myanmar as of mid-November, a patchwork of rebel groups holding 42% and both sides contesting the rest. With the ground they gained over the past year, Arnold says the rebels have transformed the war by linking up what were mostly pockets of armed resistance into long stretches across the country which the military can no longer penetrate overland. 'The military does not face rebels in this valley or that valley, or this mountaintop or that mountaintop. They say these rebels can now attack us across hundreds and hundreds of miles of contiguous territory where they have absolutely full control,' he said. 'It just fundamentally shifted the nature of warfare in the country.' The rebels’ latest gains have not been even across the country. In northeast Myanmar’s Shan state, China pressured one of the largest rebel groups in the area, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), into a ceasefire with the military in mid-January after the group had made major advances. Experts tell VOA that China has also started leaning on Myanmar’s largest rebel group, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), to cut back on weapons sales to other groups. Both the MNDAA and UWSA keep close ties with Beijing, and while the latter are not fighting the Myanmar military themselves, they have been a major source of arms and ammunition for rebel groups that are. Without their help, other groups have been forced to scale back their push toward Myanmar’s second largest city, Mandalay, which remains in junta control, says Min Zaw Oo, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. He said the squeeze on munitions has even helped the junta reverse gains another group, the Karenni National Defense Force, had been making in Kayah state, just south of Shan. 'They had to stop the offensive and they had to abandon, and now they are losing ground. One of the key factors was they … acquired less ammunition and weapons from UWSA,' said Min Zaw Oo. Elsewhere, though, rebel groups have continued to press ahead, even defying Beijing’s interests. In Myanmar’s far north, the capture of rare earth mines that supply China by the Kachin Independence Army in November compelled China to resume some of the border trade it had cut off to try and slow down the KIA’s march south, said Min Zaw Oo. In the west, the Arakan Army (AA) has nearly completed its sweep across Rakhine state and surrounded an oil and gas terminal on the shores of the Bay of Bengal central to China’s energy projects in Myanmar. Arnold and Min Zaw Oo say the AA is now pushing farther east with other allied groups into Ayeyarwady, Bago and Magwe regions in Myanmar’s center. Magwe, they add, with its many factories churning out weapons for the military, would be an especially big prize for the rebels and a painful loss for the junta if it were to fall next. The military’s recent losses to the AA also highlight one of the military’s main problems, says Morgan Michaels of the U.K.’s International Institute for Strategic Studies — a lack of manpower. Under pressure by rebel groups on nearly all sides, he said, the military could muster few reinforcements late last year as the AA bore down on its regional command base for western Myanmar, which it took, dealing the junta another heavy blow. The junta began enforcing a dormant conscription law in April to bolster troop numbers being worn down by desertions, defections and battlefield losses, and toughened the rules earlier this month to try and cut down on draft dodgers. 'Basically, the military cannot respond to protect or … wage counter attacks at these very sensitive and important strategic areas because of the manpower issue,' said Michaels. 'Opposition forces have their own limitations,' he added. 'But if the military can’t respond, then it’s going to bit by bit lose these areas.' The rebels’ own problems, the experts say, include an ever-short supply of ammunition and limited strategic coordination between the groups — many fighting for territory for any one of the country’s myriad ethnic minorities — across the whole of the country. Even so, they say they still expect most of the rebel groups in the fight to keep advancing on the junta into the year ahead. Conflict data crunched by Michaels and his team at the International Institute for Strategic Studies show no letup in the overall level of violence. Estimates of civilians and soldiers killed in the fighting stretch into the tens of thousands. Over 3 million people have been displaced, and half the country now lives in poverty. Bolstered by a steady stream of weapons and diplomatic cover from China and Russia, the experts also say the junta remains resilient but add that the collapse of a military battle-hardened by decades of counterinsurgency and once seen as all but invincible now looks plausible. Much will depend on how much longer Beijing in particular believes the junta has a useful role to play in protecting China’s economic and strategic interests in the country, says Arnold. 'China’s very straightforward, they’re very logical in what they see,' he said. 'And at some point, if the military doesn’t really stabilize the situation, China will have to make hard decisions about how much is it willing to support a military that is still losing control. And I think that will be the question for 2025.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-rebels-closing-in-around-junta-into-fifth-year-of-civil-war-/7958145.html	2025-01-31T05:23:58-08:00	
DeepSeek vs. ChatGPT fuels debate over AI building blocks	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — When Chinese startup DeepSeek released its AI model this month, it was hailed as a breakthrough, a sign that China’s artificial intelligence companies could compete with their Silicon Valley counterparts using fewer resources. The narrative was clear: DeepSeek had done more with less, finding clever workarounds to U.S. chip restrictions. However, that storyline has begun to shift. OpenAI, the U.S.-based company behind ChatGPT, now claims DeepSeek may have improperly used its proprietary data to train its model, raising questions about whether DeepSeek’s success was truly an engineering marvel. In statements to several media outlets this week, OpenAI said it is reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have trained its AI by mimicking responses from OpenAI’s models. The process, known as distillation, is common among AI developers but is prohibited by OpenAI’s terms of service, which forbid using its model outputs to train competing systems. Some U.S. officials appear to support OpenAI’s concerns. At his confirmation hearing this week, Commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick accused DeepSeek of misusing U.S. technology to create a 'dirt cheap' AI model. 'They stole things. They broke in. They’ve taken our IP,' Lutnick said of China. David Sacks, the White House czar for AI and cryptocurrency, was more measured, saying only that it is 'possible' that DeepSeek had stolen U.S. intellectual property. In an interview with the cable news network Fox News, Sacks added that there is 'substantial evidence' that DeepSeek 'distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,' adding that stronger efforts are needed to curb the rise of 'copycat' AI systems. At the center of the dispute is a key question about AI’s future: how much control should companies have over their own AI models, when those programs were themselves built using data taken from others? AI data fight The question is especially relevant for OpenAI, which faces its own legal challenges. The company has been sued by several media companies and authors who accuse it of illegally using copyrighted material to train its AI models. Justin Hughes, a Loyola Law School professor specializing in intellectual property, AI, and data rights, said OpenAI’s accusations against DeepSeek are 'deeply ironic,' given the company’s own legal troubles. 'OpenAI has had no problem taking everyone else’s content and claiming it’s 'fair,'' Hughes told VOA in an email. 'If the reports are accurate that OpenAI violated other platforms’ terms of service to get the training data it has wanted, that would just add an extra layer of irony – dare we say hypocrisy – to OpenAI complaining about DeepSeek.' DeepSeek has not responded to OpenAI’s accusations. In a technical paper released with its new chatbot, DeepSeek acknowledged that some of its models were trained alongside other open-source models – such as Qwen, developed by China’s Alibaba, and Llama, released by Meta – according to Johnny Zou, a Hong Kong-based AI investment specialist. However, OpenAI appears to be alleging that DeepSeek improperly used its closed-source models – which cannot be freely accessed or used to train other AI systems. 'It’s quite a serious statement,' said Zou, who noted that OpenAI has not yet presented evidence of wrongdoing by DeepSeek. Proving improper distillation may be difficult without disclosing details on how its own models were trained, Zou added. Even if OpenAI presents concrete proof, its legal options may be limited. Although Zou noted that the company could pursue a case against DeepSeek for violating its terms of service, not all experts believe such a claim would hold up in court. 'Even assuming DeepSeek trained on OpenAI's data, I don't think OpenAI has much of a case,' said Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School who specializes in intellectual property and technology. Even though AI models often have restrictive terms of service, 'no model creator has actually tried to enforce these terms with monetary penalties or injunctive relief,' Lemley wrote in a recent paper with co-author Peter Henderson. The paper argues that these restrictions may be unenforceable, since the materials they aim to protect are 'largely not copyrightable.' 'There are compelling reasons for many of these provisions to be unenforceable: they chill good faith research, constrain competition, and create quasi-copyright ownership where none should exist,' the paper noted. OpenAI’s main legal argument would likely be breach of contract, said Hughes. Even if that were the case, though, he added, 'good luck enforcing that against a Chinese company without meaningful assets in the United States.' Possible options The financial stakes are adding urgency to the debate. U.S. tech stocks dipped Monday after following news of DeepSeek’s advances, though they later regained some ground. Commerce nominee Lutnick suggested that further government action, including tariffs, could be used to deter China from copying advanced AI models. But speaking the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to take a different view, surprising some industry insiders with an optimistic take on DeepSeek’s breakthrough. The Chinese company’s low-cost model, Trump said, was 'very much a positive development' for AI, because 'instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution.' If DeepSeek has succeeded in building a relatively cheap and competitive AI model, that may be bad for those with investment – or stock options – in current generative AI companies, Hughes said. 'But it might be good for the rest of us,' he added, noting that until recently it appeared that only the existing tech giants 'had the resources to play in the generative AI sandbox.' 'If DeepSeek disproved that, we should hope that what can be done by a team of engineers in China can be done by a similarly resourced team of engineers in Detroit or Denver or Boston,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deepseek-vs-chatgpt-fuels-debate-over-ai-building-blocks/7958031.html	2025-01-31T02:52:21-08:00	
Russian drones injure 4 in Ukraine's south, Ukrainian officials say	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia launched a barrage of drones on Ukraine in an overnight attack on Friday, injuring four people and damaging a hospital and a grain warehouse in the southern Odesa region, officials said. Ukraine's air defenses shot down 59 of 102 Russian drones, the air force said. It said that 37 drones were 'lost,' referring to the use of electronic warfare to redirect them. Russian drones caused damage in the northeastern Sumy region, the Odesa region in the south and the central Cherkasy Region. Oleh Kiper, the Odesa regional governor, said that four civilians, including a doctor, were injured in drone attacks targeting the city of Chornomorsk. The strikes also partially disrupted electricity supplies in the city and damaged the city's hospital, an administrative building, a grain warehouse, a residential house, and several trucks, he said on the Telegram app. Regional officials in the central Cherkasy region said that drone debris damaged an apartment building in the region. Meanwhile, an oil refinery in Russia's southern Volgograd region caught fire after an overnight Ukrainian drone attack, but the blaze has now been put out, the regional governor said on Friday. Andrei Bocharov, the governor, said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that Russian air defenses had repelled an attack on his region by eight drones. 'As a result of falling debris from one of the drones, a fire broke out on the territory of an oil refinery, which was promptly extinguished. One injured refinery worker was hospitalized,' he said. Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, said on Telegram that the Volgograd oil refinery, which he described as one of Russia's largest, had been struck. SHOT, a Russian news outlet with contacts in the security services, said four Ukrainian drones had been destroyed over a second refinery in Yaroslavl, northeast of Moscow. Ukraine has carried out frequent air attacks on Russian refineries, oil depots and industrial sites to cripple key infrastructure underpinning Russia's war effort. This week it claimed to have struck and set on fire a Lukoil refinery, Russia's fourth largest, in the Nizhny Novgorod region, east of Moscow. Sources at Lukoil denied that the NORSI refinery was hit, and said production was not affected. Petrochemical company Sibur said there had been a drone strike and fire at its nearby plant. Russia is currently feeding more crude oil through its refineries in the hope of boosting fuel exports after new U.S. sanctions on Russian tankers and traders made exports of unprocessed crude more difficult, sources told Reuters this week. A Ukrainian drone attack last week forced a refinery in Ryazan, southeast of Moscow, to suspend operations. Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement on Friday that 49 Ukrainian drones had been downed over the country overnight, including 25 in the southern Rostov region and eight in the Volgograd region. Drones had also been detected and destroyed in the Kursk, Yaroslavl, Belgorod, Voronezh, and Krasnodar regions, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drones-injure-4-in-ukraine-s-south-ukrainian-officials-say/7958004.html	2025-01-31T01:16:21-08:00	
Israel targets Hezbollah sites in Lebanon, accuses group of ceasefire breach	DUBAI, UAE — The Israeli military said on Friday it struck several Hezbollah targets overnight in the Bekaa Valley and along the Syrian-Lebanese border. The army said the targets include a facility used for underground weapons development and another associated with the smuggling of arms into Lebanon. On Thursday, Israel said it intercepted a surveillance drone launched by Hezbollah calling it 'a breach of the ceasefire agreement' between Israel and Lebanon. Hezbollah and Israel reached a ceasefire in late November, ending a deadly conflict that began with the Gaza war in 2023. The U.S. confirmed on Sunday that the agreement, which includes a 60-day period for Israeli troop withdrawal, will remain in effect until Feb. 18, extending the original Jan. 26 deadline. Israel has carried out multiple strikes on Lebanese territory since the ceasefire extension killing and injuring more than 100 people. The most recent attack is a drone strike that injured at least five people in southern Lebanese town of Majdal Selm.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-targets-hezbollah-sites-in-lebanon-accuses-group-of-ceasefire-breach/7957990.html	2025-01-31T00:34:59-08:00	
Trump support for denuclearization talks with Russia, China raises hopes	white house — Arms control advocates are hoping U.S. President Donald Trump’s fresh words of support for denuclearization will lead to talks with Russia and China on arms reduction. U.S. negotiations with the Russians and Chinese on denuclearization and eventual agreements are 'very possible,' according to Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum a week ago in Davos, Switzerland. 'Tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear [weapons], and the destructive capability is something that we don’t even want to talk about because you don’t want to hear,' he said. 'It’s too depressing.' Trump noted that in his first term, he discussed the topic with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'We were talking about denuclearization of our two countries, and China would have come along,' according to Trump. 'President Putin really liked the idea of cutting back on nuclear [armaments], and I think the rest of the world — we would have gotten them to follow.' Just months before leaving office, former U.S. President Joe Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in Peru where both agreed that decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons should remain under human control. That consensus was seen as a positive step after the Chinese, four months previously, suspended nuclear arms control talks with Washington to protest American arms sales to Taiwan. The horror of nuclear attacks first became evident to many in the world through magazines in the West, which printed photographs of the radiation-burned survivors of the U.S. atomic attack on two Japanese cities in 1945 to end World War II. In subsequent years during the Cold War, U.S. government films captured the destructive force of test detonations in the Nevada desert, eventually prompting public demonstrations to 'ban the bomb' and diplomacy to reduce or eliminate all nuclear weapons. A major breakthrough occurred in 1987 with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) between the United States and the Soviet Union. It entered into full force the following year. By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been dismantled. That was the first time the two nuclear superpowers achieved a reduction of such weapons rather than just limiting their growth. Over the years, the Americans and the Russians lost their monopoly on nuclear weapons. Nine countries presently have nuclear arsenals, although Israel has never acknowledged possession of such weaponry. The United States and Russia each have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads — 90% of the world’s total. The combined global force of all countries’ nuclear weapons could destroy the world many times over, according to arms control advocates. The current New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, set limits on the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems, while including on-site inspection and exchanges of data for verification. The treaty expires in early February 2026, which adds urgency to Trump’s call for talks with Russia and China, according to Xiaodon Liang, senior analyst for nuclear weapons policy and disarmament at the Arms Control Association. 'And because of that, this issue has to be at the top of the agenda, and having a signal that the president is concerned about this issue and thinking about it is very positive,' Liang told VOA. Since a formal, comprehensive agreement could take years to negotiate — possibly spanning beyond the four years of the second Trump presidency — Liang suggests the U.S. president consider an 'executive agreement' with Putin, an informal consensus or a series of unilateral steps to continue adhering to the numbers in New START for an indefinite period. 'That would be a stabilizing factor in this important bilateral relationship,' Liang added. There are analysts who advocate a more aggressive tactic. Trump should consider ordering a resumption of nuclear testing to demonstrate to America’s adversaries that the U.S. arsenal of weapons of mass destruction remains viable and as an act of resolve, writes Robert Peters, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank seen as having a dominant influence on Trump administration policies. Peters also suggests that Trump might want to withdraw from the 1963 Test Ban Treaty made with Moscow and 'conduct an above-ground test either at the Nevada National Security Site or in the Pacific Ocean over open water, where nuclear fallout can be minimized' to stave escalatory moves by an adversary to the United States. The Heritage Foundation did not respond to multiple requests from VOA to interview Peters. Moscow is not known to have conducted any sort of test causing a nuclear chain reaction, known as criticality, since 1990. Two years later, the United States announced it would no longer test nuclear weapons, although subcritical simulations continue. The other nuclear nations have followed suit except North Korea, which last triggered a nuclear test explosion in 2017. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on Tuesday moved up the hands of its 'Doomsday Clock' by one second to 89 seconds to midnight, meant to signify the peril from weapons of mass destruction and other existential threats. 'We set the clock closer to midnight because we do not see positive progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk, climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive technology,' said Daniel Holz, a physics professor at the University of Chicago, just after the hands of this year’s clock were unveiled at the U.S. Institute of Peace. While the Doomsday Clock is merely symbolic, Liang at the Arms Control Association sees it as an annual important ritual highlighting the risks to Americans and everyone else posed by the world’s nuclear arsenals. 'It is a good tool for bringing this to more people’s attention, and you can’t blame Americans for having so many other issues on their plate. And having this [clock] as a reminder, I think, is an effective communications tool,' Liang said. At the Doomsday Clock ceremony, VOA asked former Colombian President and Nobel laureate Juan Manuel Santos what he viewed as the biggest hurdle to Trump, Putin and Xi making progress on denuclearization. 'The biggest challenge, in my view, is for them to understand that they should sit down and talk about how the three of them can take decisions to save their own countries and the whole world,' he said. Liang compared the situation to U.S. President John F. Kennedy's call to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, which led Washington and Moscow to pull back from the brink of nuclear war. That resolution turned the hands of the Doomsday Clock the following year back to 12 minutes to midnight in recognition of the Americans, Soviets and British banning nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space and under water. It has been several years since the United States engaged in any denuclearization negotiations. Those working-level talks in 2019 in Sweden between the first Trump administration and North Korean officials did not yield any agreement, with Pyongyang’s chief negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, telling reporters that the Americans had raised expectations with promises of flexibility but would not 'give up their old viewpoint and attitude.' The State Department spokesperson at the time, Morgan Ortagus, said in a statement the two countries could not be expected to 'overcome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula in the course of a single Saturday,' but such weighty issues 'require a strong commitment by both countries. The United States has that commitment.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-support-for-denuclearization-talks-with-russia-china-raises-hopes-/7957584.html	2025-01-30T23:06:25-08:00	
Trump's support for denuclearization talks with Russia, China raises hopes	Arms control advocates are hoping U.S. President Donald Trump's fresh words of support for denuclearization will lead to talks with Russia and China about nuclear arms reduction.

Spain well short of NATO defense target, as Trump demands huge additional spending	As U.S. President Donald Trump demands a large increase in defense spending by NATO allies, the spotlight has fallen on Spain, which spends the least on defense of all member states relative to the size of its economy. Spain is the eurozone’s fourth-biggest economy. The country spent an estimated $21.3 billion on defense last year, equating to 1.28% of its gross domestic product (GDP), putting it at the bottom of the league among the 32-nation Atlantic alliance. That’s despite a pledge made by all NATO members in 2014 to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense, according to the bloc. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte visited Madrid and Lisbon earlier this week and warned all members of the need to boost spending beyond existing targets. 'The goal of 2%, now set a decade ago, will not be enough to meet the challenges of tomorrow. The threat from Russia may seem distant, but let me assure you, it is not,' Rutte said at a press conference in Lisbon on Jan. 27. 'NATO is strong today. To keep NATO strong we must, however, continue to adapt. And to guarantee our security in the future, we also need to ramp up our efforts now. It also means we need to spend more in our defense,' he said. Only 23 of the 32 NATO member states were expected to meet the 2% target by 2024, according to the alliance. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has rejected criticism that his government has been too slow to boost defense spending. In a statement, the prime minister’s office said Monday that Spain was a 'serious, responsible and committed ally of NATO,' noting that the government had increased defense spending by 70% in the last decade. 'Spain's commitment to reach 2% of defense spending by 2029 is firm,' the statement said. Spanish troops are also helping to train Ukrainian forces as Kyiv battles Russia’s invasion. Trump criticism That’s unlikely to be enough to satisfy NATO’s biggest spender, the United States, which spent 3.38% of its GDP on defense in 2024. Earlier in January, Trump described Spain’s contribution to NATO as 'very low' and has demanded a much higher spending target from European allies. 'I'm also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago,' Trump told delegates by video link at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 23. Trump has long complained that European allies are taking advantage of the United States, insisting that they should share the burden of defense spending. However, the 5% target is unrealistic for Spain, according to analyst Pere Ortega of the Delas Center for Peace Studies in Madrid. 'Reaching 5% is impossible. That would mean that Spain would have to spend almost 65 billion euros [$67.7 billion]. That is impossible, because we do not have that economic capacity,' Ortega told VOA. 'No political program would ask for an increase in military spending to reach 3, 4 or 5% ... because that would be in some way making sacrifices in the social security sphere. And the Spanish population would penalize that with their vote at the polls,' Ortega added. Lithuania boost Trump does have some support in Europe. Lithuania plans to raise defense spending to 5% or 6% of GDP by 2026. Announcing the increase on January 17, Lithuanian Minister of Defense Dovile Sakaliene said the policy was a response to regional threats. 'We are fitting in with NATO defense plans, which are vital to our region,' he said. Poland and Estonia have also indicated their intention to boost defense spending toward Trump’s target of 5%. France has also urged allies to invest more, although Paris only met the 2% target itself in 2023. 'What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets from the Atlantic to the Pacific?' French President Emmanuel Macron said Jan. 20 in an address to members of the French military. 'These are scenarios that we need to prepare for. These are the scenarios that we are preparing for.' At his first NATO summit as U.S. president in 2017, Trump berated other members for failing to spend enough on defense. European allies, including Spain, are braced for further robust diplomacy ahead of the next summit, scheduled to be held in The Hague in June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-well-short-of-nato-defense-target-as-trump-demands-huge-additional-spending-/7957334.html	2025-01-30T23:05:05-08:00	
Teen skaters, group of hunters and students among victims of air crash	WICHITA, KANSAS — The victims of a crash between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter included teen figure skaters returning from a national meet with their mothers and coaches, an Ohio college student coming from her grandfather's funeral, two Chinese nationals and a group of hunters headed back from a guided trip in Kansas. They were among 60 travelers and four crew members on board the commercial flight late Wednesday when it collided with the Black Hawk helicopter, which was carrying three soldiers. Officials say there were no survivors. As the search for remains continued Thursday, communities grieved. Faith leaders held a vigil Thursday in the city council chambers. 'The only way we will get through this is together,' said the Rev. Pamela Hughes Mason of Wichita's St. Paul AME Church. American Airlines set up a hotline as well as centers in Washington and Wichita for people searching for information about family members who may have been aboard the downed flight. Here's what we know about some of the people killed in Wednesday night's crash: From the Skating Club of Boston Skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane were among those killed, according to Doug Zeghibe, CEO of the Skating Club of Boston. Their mothers, Jin Han and Christine Lane, as well as their coaches Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov also died. Han and Lane, who was about 16, were returning from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 'We watched Jinna just grow up here from just a tiny little tyke into this amazingly mature 13-year-old,' he said. 'A great performer, a great competitor, and off the ice, a great kid.' Spencer Lane, who was from Barrington, Rhode Island, took part in his first professional show in December with Elin Schran's company, Joy Skate Productions. 'He started to discover this connection with the audience and that joy that he was giving to other people through his gift,' Schran said. In a statement, the Lane family recalled Christine Lane for both her singular talents and her dedication to parenting. 'Christine exuded creativity throughout her life, using her formal graphic design training as a jumping-off point for seemingly endless creative pursuits across areas such as photography, quilting, knitting, and more. She brought even greater passion to her role as a mother to Spencer and his brother Milo,' the family said. Their coaches, Shishkova and Naumov, won the pairs title at the 1994 world championships in Chiba, Japan. The Russia-born pair also competed twice in the Olympics. More young athletes and coaches Skating organizations in Philadelphia and the Washington area also said some of their young athletes had been aboard the plane. Several athletes on the flight had attended a development camp held after the U.S. Figure Skating Championships ended Sunday in Wichita, Kansas. Wichita Skating Center manager Sean O'Reilly said the championships brought a 'groundswell of positivity,' drawing enthusiastic parents and young athletes from across the U.S. He was 'gutted' to learn some of those skaters had been killed. In Virginia's Loudoun County, a coach at a skating club was also identified as among the passengers, Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam confirmed. The club, Ashburn Ice House, said that its 'figure skating community has been directly affected,' but did not give further details. Students Students and parents at Cedarville University in Ohio said one of the passengers on the plane was Grace Maxwell, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering. Maxwell's father, Dean Maxwell, said she was returning to campus from her home in Wichita, Kansas, after attending her grandfather's funeral, The Wichita Eagle reported. Grace Maxwell had been working on a project this semester to create a hand-stabilizing device to help a boy in the area feed himself instead of relying on others, the university said in a statement. 'Grace was a quiet person with a keen interest in helping others through engineering,' said Tim Norman, who served as her secondary adviser. Three other students from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia, and six parents from the district were also on board the plane, superintendent Michelle Reid said in a letter to families. She did not identify them, but she said the students were from different schools and that two of the parents were current or former district staffers. Chinese citizens, Philippines police officer Chinese citizens and a cop from the Philippines Philippine Police Col. Pergentino Malabed Jr., who headed the supply management division of the national police, was among the dead. He had traveled to the U.S. to inspect equipment the Philippines was planning to purchase for its 232,000-member force, according to the Philippine police. 'His untimely passing is a profound loss to the Philippine National Police, where he served with honor, with integrity and dedication throughout his career,' Philippine police said in a statement. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said two Chinese nationals were also among the victims. It did not offer further details. The country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs offered its condolences for the crash victims and requested the U.S. to 'promptly report any progress with the search and rescue and find out the cause of the accident as soon as possible.' Hunters headed home from a trip Seven people returning from a guided hunting trip in Kansas were killed, according to a Facebook post by Fowl Plains, the guide service. The Fowl Plains team said they had grown close to the hunters on board the flight over the years and considered them to be family members. The post doesn't identify the hunters by name, but it says they had spent the past week on a guided hunt, 'laughing, talking about our families and sharing memories.' 'Heartbroken is an understatement,' the company said. Members of a Maryland union Those killed also included four steamfitters, all members of a United Association union local in suburban Maryland, union leaders said in a social media post Thursday. 'Our focus now is on providing support and care to the families of our brothers as we continue to gather more information in the coming days,' said the post by UA General President Mark McManus and Chris Madello, the business manager of Local 602. From the military The victims also include three soldiers who were aboard the helicopter. Officials said their remains will be at Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operations at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. That office coordinates the dignified transfer of fallen service members. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet announced. No identities of the crew have been released. But the wife of one of the helicopter pilots said on Facebook that her husband, Andrew Eaves of Noxubee County, Mississippi, was killed. In a phone call, Carrie Eaves confirmed the post was hers. 'We ask that you pray for our family and friends and for all the other families that are suffering today. We ask for peace while we grieve,' her post read. The three soldiers were doing an annual night proficiency training flight, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, adding they were a 'fairly experienced crew.' Officials were notifying relatives, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teen-skaters-group-of-hunters-and-students-among-victims-of-air-crash/7957971.html	2025-01-30T22:47:18-08:00	
Senate confirms North Dakota's Burgum as Trump interior secretary	The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, as President Donald Trump's interior secretary. The vote was 79-18. Burgum, 68, will lead an agency that guides the use of 202 million hectares of federal and tribal land, a fifth of the nation's surface area. He is expected to pursue Trump's goal of maximizing energy and mineral production on public lands, likely by ratcheting up new leasing in oil-producing states like Wyoming and New Mexico and in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has said is now officially called the Gulf of America. A wealthy former software executive, Burgum has portrayed himself as a traditional, business-minded conservative. During his nomination hearing, Burgum said he would expand oil and gas drilling rights auctions and support permitting reforms that could speed development of energy projects like transmission lines and pipelines. His comments signaled a sharp turn in federal policy after former President Joe Biden's administration sought to limit oil and gas drilling on federal lands and promote renewable energy sources like wind and solar as part of its climate change agenda. Burgum ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination before quitting and becoming a Trump supporter. He is also being considered to head a new national council to coordinate policies to boost U.S. energy output.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-north-dakota-s-burgum-as-trump-interior-secretary/7957967.html	2025-01-30T22:19:20-08:00	
Rwanda-backed rebels in eastern Congo say they plan to take their fight to the capital	GOMA, CONGO — Rwanda-backed rebels who captured eastern Congo's largest city said Thursday they want to take their fight to the far-off capital, Kinshasa, while Congo’s president called for a massive military mobilization to resist the rebellion and his defense minister rejected calls for talks. In a video message, Congo's Defense Minister Guy Kabombo Muadiamvita said he has directed plans for any dialogue with the rebels to 'be completely burned immediately.' 'We will stay here in Congo and fight. If we do not stay alive here, let’s stay dead here,' said Muadiamvita, a close ally of Congo's president. At a briefing where they sought to assert their control over the eastern city of Goma and surrounding territory in the neighboring South Kivu province, the M23 rebels said they would be open to dialogue with the government, also proposed by the east African regional bloc of which Rwanda is a member. Their motive, however, is to gain political power, Corneille Nangaa, one of the political leaders of M23, said during the briefing. 'We want to go to Kinshasa, take power and lead the country,' Nangaa said. He did not indicate how the rebels planned to advance on the capital, more than 1,500 kilometers away. Rwanda's leader, Paul Kagame, said he spoke with Angola's President Joao Lourenco — a mediator in the conflict who also met with Congo's leader a day earlier — and both leaders committed to working with other African countries to resolve the hostilities. U.S. President Donald Trump described the conflict as a 'very serious problem' when asked about it Thursday but declined to comment further, and a U.N. spokesman said the agency is 'disturbed' by reports that neighboring Rwandan forces have crossed the border in the direction where the rebels are said to be advancing. The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first captured Goma. They are one of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits estimated to be worth $24 trillion that are critical to much of the world’s technology. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, meanwhile, called on young people to enlist massively in the military, as a crucial meeting of neighbors asked the Congolese government to talk with the rebels. Rwanda's leader also threatened to 'deal' with any confrontation with South Africa, which has complained that fighting in eastern Congo has left South African peacekeepers dead. In his first public remarks since the M23 rebels advanced into Goma on Monday, Tshisekedi vowed 'a vigorous and coordinated response' from his forces to push back the rebels while reaffirming his commitment to a peaceful resolution. On Thursday, he met with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot in Kinshasa, the Congolese presidency said on X, noting that France has provided significant support to Congo in recent U.N. meetings on the issue. '(Congo) expects a little more action in the face of this crisis,' it added. Dead bodies, looting in Goma Goma remained largely without electricity and water on Thursday, as the bodies of several alleged government soldiers lay in the streets, horrifying residents, including children. M23 rebels escorted some 2,000 government soldiers and police officers — who they said surrendered — to an undisclosed location, some of them singing anti-Tshisekedi songs. The U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Congo said basic services are largely paralyzed in Goma, a humanitarian hub critical for more than 6 million people displaced by the conflict. 'After several days of intense clashes, the city is now (faced) with massive humanitarian needs and severely impacted response capacities,' said Bruno Lemarquis, the humanitarian coordinator. Footage from Goma showed residents carrying food items and goods looted from stores and warehouses in the city. 'This is something that is going to exacerbate a dangerous cycle of violence as desperate times call for desperate measures,' the U.N. World Food Program emergency coordinator in eastern Congo, Cynthia Jones, said Thursday. South Kivu gripped by fear After capturing much of Goma, the rebels were advancing toward South Kivu’s provincial capital, Bukavu, causing fear and panic among residents, witnesses said Thursday. Nana Bintou, a civil society leader, said gunshots and explosions were heard in Mukwinja, a captured town 135 kilometers from Bukavu. The Congolese military has been weakened after hundreds of foreign military contractors withdrew and handed over their arms to the rebels. Residents of Goma described seeing soldiers changing into civilian clothing and dropping their guns as they crossed over the border to Rwanda or took shelter in foreign peacekeeping bases. 'The (Congolese) military bases in Bukavu have been emptied to reinforce those in Nyabibwe, Bushushu, and Nyamukubi' along the way to the capital, one youth leader said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was worried about his safety. Neighbors urge talks with M23 as tensions grow A summit of the regional East African bloc called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in eastern Congo and 'strongly urged' Tshisekedi’s government to hold talks with the rebels. Tshisekedi was conspicuously absent from the virtual summit attended by Rwanda, also a member. While African countries as well as the U.N. and U.S. have called for an immediate ceasefire, the risk of a regional war has increased, analysts say, exacerbated by the rebels' advance into South Kivu and diatribes between Rwandan and South African officials. Congo is a member of the southern Africa regional bloc and also that of east Africa, whose peacekeeping force it expelled last year after deeming it ineffective. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa blamed the 'Rwanda Defense Force militia' for the fighting that has resulted in the deaths of 13 South African peacekeepers in eastern Congo. He also said his government will ensure the peacekeepers are 'sufficiently supported during this critical mission.' His comment drew an angry response from Kagame, who called the South African peacekeepers a 'belligerent force' working alongside armed groups that target Rwanda. 'If South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day,' the Rwandan leader said on the social media platform X. Who are the M23 and what do they want? The chaotic situation with the M23 has its roots in ethnic conflict, stretching back to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, when 800,000 Tutsis and others were killed by Hutus and former militias. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and others involved in the genocide. Many Hutus fled into Congo after 1994. Unlike in 2012 when the rebels seized Congo for days, observers say their withdrawal could be more difficult now. The rebels have been emboldened by Rwanda, which feels Congo is ignoring its interests in the region and failed to meet demands of previous peace agreements, according to Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, a think tank. 'Ultimately, this is a failure of African mediation (because) the warning signs were always there. Kigali was adopting very bellicose rhetoric and the Congolese government was also adopting very, very aggressive rhetoric,' Mutiga said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-backed-rebels-in-eastern-congo-say-they-plan-to-take-their-fight-to-the-capital/7957962.html	2025-01-30T22:07:17-08:00	
Judge extends court-monitoring agreement for children in Customs and Border Protection custody	McALLEN, TEXAS — A federal judge extended a court agreement on Thursday ensuring safe and sanitary conditions for migrant children in federal custody a day after U.S. Customs and Border Protection was set to begin self-monitoring. The agreement originally ended Wednesday, but District Judge Dolly M. Gee in California decided to extend it by 18 months. 'CBP is not yet capable of wholly fulfilling its responsibilities under the 2022 Settlement and the FSA (Flores Settlement Agreement) without the additional support provided by the JCM (Juvenile Care Monitor) and the Court,' the judge wrote in her order. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A court-appointed monitor will continue to visit and report on conditions for children in custody at U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities in the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso, Texas. Concerns were initially raised during the first Trump administration when reports surfaced of children separated from family for weeks and held in poor sanitary conditions. In 2019, a Guatemalan teenager died in custody as a result of a flu outbreak and a lack of proper medical care in a federal facility in Weslaco, Texas. The parties reached an agreement that was implemented in July 2022 for 2½ years. It allowed a court monitor to keep track of progress made by Customs and Border Protection. In the last report filed in December, the monitor noted positive changes while also mentioning a continued practice of separating some parents from their children during their time in custody. The monitor later told the court of discrepancies with Customs and Border Protection data suggesting the agency underreported the number of children who had exceeded the recommended time in custody of three days. Customs and Border Protection was scheduled to begin self-monitoring its facilities on Wednesday. The agency said in December it was ready for the task after issuing new guidance on family unity and increased training on detention policies, guidelines and regulations that rolled back court oversight under the Biden administration. Plaintiffs argued the agency was not ready, citing testimony from minors held in Customs and Border Protection facilities, and they requested the renewal of the court agreement. 'No child should be forced to spend weeks inside a windowless pod in dirty clothes with no access to the outdoors. We are relieved the Court ruled to force CBP to meet its obligations under the settlement,' Mishan Wroe, senior attorney for the National Youth Law Center, said in a statement. Trump officials have said they plan to end 'catch-and-release' policies and stop the release of migrants into the U.S. while they wait for immigration court hearings. The changes could result in longer detention times exceeding the court-recommended 72 hours for families.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-extends-court-monitoring-agreement-for-children-in-customs-and-border-protection-custody/7957950.html	2025-01-30T21:00:10-08:00	
Dick Button, Olympic great and voice of skating, dies at 95	NEW YORK — Dick Button was more than the most accomplished men's figure skater in history. He was one of his sport's greatest innovators and promoters. Button, winner of two Olympic gold medals and five consecutive world championships, died Thursday, said his son, Edward, who did not provide a cause. He was 95. As an entrepreneur and broadcaster, Button promoted skating and its athletes, transforming a niche sport into the showpiece of every Winter Olympics. 'Dick was one of the most important figures in our sport,' Scott Hamilton said. 'There wasn't a skater after Dick who wasn't helped by him in some way.' Button's impact began after World War II. He was the first U.S. men's champion — and his country's youngest at age 16 — when that competition returned in 1946. Two years later, he took the title at the St. Moritz Olympics, competing outdoors. He performed the first double axel in any competition and became the first American to win the men's event. 'By the way, that jump had a cheat on it,' Button told the U.S. Olympic Committee website. 'But listen, I did it and that was what counted.' That began his dominance of international skating, and U.S. amateur sports. He was the first figure skater to win the prestigious Sullivan Award in 1949 — no other figure skater won it until Michelle Kwan in 2001. In 1952, while a Harvard student, he won a second gold at the Oslo Games, making more history with the first triple jump (a loop) in competition. Soon after, he won a fifth world title, then gave up his eligibility as an amateur. All Olympic sports were subject to an amateur/professional division at the time. 'I had achieved everything I could have dreamed of doing as a skater,' said Button, who earned a law degree from Harvard in 1956. 'I was able to enjoy the Ice Capades (show) and keep my hand in skating, and that was very important to me.' With the Emmy Award-winning Button as the TV analyst, viewers got to learn not only the basics but the nuances of a sport foreign to many as he frankly broke down the performances. He became as much a fixture on ABC's Wide World of Sports as Jim McKay and the hapless ski jumper tumbling down the slope. 'Dick Button is the custodian of the history of figure skating and its quintessential voice,' 1988 Olympic champion Brian Boitano said in Button's autobiography. 'He made the words 'lutz' and 'salchow' part of our everyday vocabulary.' After a 1961 plane crash killed the entire U.S. figure skating team on the way to the world championships, which then were canceled, Button persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event on Wide World. That's when he joined the network as a commentator. Button's death coincided with another tragedy in the skating world, Wednesday night's crash of an American Airlines flight that collided with an Army helicopter and plummeted into the Potomac River outside Washington, D.C., killing everyone on board. Two teenage figure skaters, their mothers, and two former world champions who were coaching at the Skating Club of Boston were among the 14 people killed from the skating community. Button skated for the Boston club and remained close to it for the rest of his life. The trophy room at the club is named in his honor. He also provided opportunities for skaters to make money after their competitive careers. He ran professional events he created for TV for years, attracting many top names in the sport — Hamilton, Torvill and Dean, Kristi Yamaguchi, Kurt Browning and Katarina Witt. Button's Candid Productions, formed 1959, also produced such made-for-TV programs as Battle of the Network Stars. He also dabbled in acting, but the rink was his realm. 'Dick Button created an open and honest space in figure skating broadcasting where no topic or moment was off-limits,' said Johnny Weir, the three-time U.S. champion and current NBC Sports figure skating analyst. 'He told it like it was, even when his opinion wasn't a popular one. His zingers were always in my mind when I would perform for him, and I wanted to make him as happy and proud as I would my coaches. 'I think that is something very special about commentating figure skating. As an athlete, we rarely have an opportunity to speak, and we rely on the TV voices to tell our story for us. Nobody could do it like Mr. Button.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dick-button-olympic-great-and-voice-of-skating-dies-at-95/7957949.html	2025-01-30T20:52:33-08:00	
US economy grows solid 2.3% in October-December on eve of Trump return to White House	WASHINGTON — A humming American economy ended 2024 on a solid note with consumer spending continuing to drive growth, and ahead of what could be a significant change in direction under a Trump administration. The Commerce Department reported Thursday that gross domestic product — the economy's output of goods and services — expanded at a 2.3% annual rate from October through December. For the full year, the economy grew a healthy 2.8%, compared with 2.9% in 2023. The fourth-quarter growth was a tick below the 2.4% economists had expected, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. Consumer spending grew at a 4.2% pace, fastest since January-March 2023 and up from 3.7% in July-September last year. But business investment tumbled as investment in equipment plunged after two straight strong quarters. Wednesday's report also showed persistent inflationary pressure at the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.3% annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Fed's 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter. A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off fourth-quarter growth. But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said that figure 'suggests the economy remains strong, particularly given the fourth-quarter disruptions,'' including a strike at Boeing and the aftermath of two hurricanes. President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low — 4.1% in December. The economy has proven remarkably resilient after the Fed's inflation fighters raised rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to combat the biggest surge in consumer prices since the 1980s. Instead of sliding into a recession, as most economists predicted, GDP kept expanding. Growth has now topped 2% in nine of the last 10 quarters. On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, 'we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022. The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year. The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices. Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then 'demand'' lower interest rates – a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president. Trump has also tried to reshape the federal government, offering buyouts to workers and issuing a memo Monday night freezing federal grants, then rescinding the memo Wednesday after a public outcry. Citing the 'squeeze'' on the federal government, Ashworth wrote in a commentary, 'we wouldn't be surprised to see a reversal in the first quarter. As a starting point, we expect first-quarter GDP growth to slow marginally below 2%.'' Thursday's GDP release was the first of three Commerce Department estimates of October-December growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-economy-grows-solid-2-3-in-october-december-on-eve-of-trump-return-to-white-house/7957945.html	2025-01-30T20:40:59-08:00

Ugandan nurse dies of Ebola	A male nurse in Uganda has died of Ebola, the first recorded death by the disease in the East African country since an outbreak ended in 2023, health officials said. The 32-year-old nurse worked at Mulago National Specialised Hospital in Kampala, Diana Atwine, permanent secretary of Uganda’s health ministry, said Thursday. The nurse died Wednesday of the Sudan strain of Ebola, Atwine said. He sought treatment at several hospitals and had also consulted with a traditional healer before tests confirmed an Ebola diagnosis, health officials said. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X that his organization was supporting Uganda’s efforts to contain an Ebola outbreak in Uganda with a $1 million allocation from WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies. Atwine said on her X social media account that 'rapid response teams are fully deployed, contact tracing is underway, and all necessary measures are in place to contain the situation. We assure the public that we are in full control.' Contact tracing, however, could be challenging in Kampala, with its population of 4 million people. The health ministry, however, reported that it had identified 44 contacts of the late nurse, which included 30 other health care workers. The symptoms of Ebola, an often fatal disease, include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, and at times internal and external bleeding. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health care workers and family members caring for someone with Ebola are at high risk for contracting the disease. WHO said Ebola 'is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g., bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.' Ebola’s fatality rate is around 50%, WHO said on its website, but it also said that fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in some outbreaks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ugandan-nurse-dies-of-ebola/7957916.html	2025-01-30T18:18:08-08:00

Washington crash mars long record of US aviation safety	A collision between a passenger jet and U.S. Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport late Wednesday marked the first time in more than 15 years that there had been a mass fatality event in U.S. airspace related to commercial aviation. The accident, which killed a reported 67 people, took place while American Airlines Flight 5342 was making its final approach to the runway. The Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet and the Sikorsky H-60, commonly known as a Black Hawk, collided only a few hundred meters above the ground, officials said. The plane was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. There were three service members aboard the military helicopter, including the pilot. Both aircraft crashed into the icy waters of the Potomac River, and authorities said Thursday that they didn't believe there were any survivors. The accident took place in darkness at 8:47 p.m., and no significant weather problems were reported. As of Thursday, authorities had not identified the cause of the accident. However, The New York Times on Thursday, citing an 'internal preliminary Federal Aviation Administration safety report' it reviewed, reported that staffing at the airport's air traffic control tower was 'not normal' Wednesday night. The newspaper said a single air traffic controller was directing incoming and outgoing plane traffic as well as helicopter traffic in the area. Those jobs are usually split between two controllers. Experts consider crash an anomaly Aviation experts said as tragic as the accident was, it should be considered an anomaly in an air traffic system that has been notably free of major disasters for many years. 'Some of it was luck. Some of it is technology. And mostly it was the tremendous job that the pilots and air traffic controllers do,' former United Airlines pilot Captain Ross 'Rusty' Aimer told VOA. 'They literally perform miracles every day because our system is extremely congested everywhere you go. ... And Washington National Airport is, perhaps in my 60 years in aviation, one of the most demanding and busiest airports in the world.' It is necessary to look back to 2009 to find a comparable commercial disaster in U.S. airspace. At that time, a Colgan Air jet en route from New Jersey to Buffalo, New York, stalled during its approach and crashed into a house, killing 49 passengers and crew, as well as one individual in the house. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines jet crashed while landing in San Francisco, California. Two passengers who were not wearing seat belts were killed when they were thrown from the plane, and another person died after being struck by an emergency response vehicle on the tarmac. There were 187 other people who suffered injuries, many serious, but no other fatalities. While there have been a number of other high-profile incidents involving U.S. airlines recently, none involved mass casualties. Last year, for example, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max in midflight, but the plane landed safely, though some passengers suffered minor injuries. Experts stressed that such events occur in only a tiny fraction of the millions of flights that take place in the U.S. every year. Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst and former senior airline executive, told VOA that the U.S. commercial aviation industry experiences an extremely low level of safety incidents and 'an even lower level of fatality accidents.' 'That's not luck, that's effort,' he said. 'We're thankful to have so many professionals in the operating environment. In the oversight environment, focus on safety is the number one priority.' Crash occurs in crowded airspace The accident took place in one of the most crowded — and highly regulated — sectors of airspace in the United States. The Washington region has three major airports, 11 regional airports and dozens of heliports — not counting the multiple military installations in the region with aviation operations. Keith M. Cianfrani, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who served as a flight instructor and an accident investigator, told VOA he flew helicopters in the area where the accident took place while on active duty and later as a commercial pilot. 'It's congested,' said Cianfrani, who now works as an aviation safety consultant and adjunct professor at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University. 'So, it's not unusual to cross the path of an incoming [plane] as long as there is traffic separation.' Traffic separation refers to the distance, in time and space, between aircraft in the same area. But because of the congestion, there are very clear rules about where aircraft are allowed to be and when they can be there, Cianfrani said. Helicopters are required to follow specific routes when passing through the region, he said, calling it 'very uncommon' to see something like Wednesday's crash take place. 'As a whole, the general aviation industry in the United States is outstanding,' he said. 'They all have to adhere to what we call SMS — safety management systems. On a regular basis, they get audited. They have an internal audit program, and they're constantly being looked at by people like myself going in and auditing their safety program. So, it's outstanding.' Turnover in federal aviation oversight Wednesday's accident took place at a time when leadership of the federal agencies in charge of flight safety is being overhauled by the new administration of President Donald Trump. The day after his inauguration, Trump dismissed Transportation Security Administration Administrator David Pekoske and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, which provides the federal government with recommendations for aviation safety. He also initiated a hiring freeze, preventing the hiring of new air traffic controllers. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who oversees the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), was sworn in the day before the crash. Michael Whitaker, who served as administrator of the FAA in former President Joe Biden's administration, announced in December that he would resign his post on January 20, the day Trump took office. The new president has not yet nominated a permanent replacement for Whitaker, but on Thursday he named Chris Rocheleau, a former Air Force officer who has spent more than 20 years at the FAA, as interim administrator. Trump spreads blame With recovery teams still searching for bodies in the Potomac River on Thursday, Trump held a press conference and attempted to pin blame for the accident on the previous presidential administration. He asserted, with no proof or evidence, that the Biden administration had lowered hiring standards for air traffic controllers as part of its 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' efforts. Trump took particular aim at former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, saying he had driven the agency 'right into the ground with his diversity.' Buttigieg responded with a post on the social media platform X. 'Despicable,' Buttigieg wrote. 'As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. 'President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA,' he added. 'One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.'

Experts: Trump faces tough task to denuclearize North Korea	washington — The White House says President Donald Trump is going to pursue the denuclearization of North Korea, although analysts say that is easier said than done. White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told VOA Korean via email this week that 'President Trump had a good relationship with [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un,' and that Trump’s 'mix of toughness and diplomacy led to the first-ever leader-level commitment to complete denuclearization.' Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, in Singapore, Hanoi and over the inter-Korean border at Panmunjom. Trump, who has recently called North Korea 'a nuclear power,' said in an interview with Fox News last week that he would reach out to Kim again, adding, 'He liked me, and I got along with him.' Commitment to denuclearization Former U.S. government officials say there is no doubt that Trump is serious about resuming talks with Kim. Susan Thornton, a former senior U.S. diplomat for Asian affairs, told VOA Korean on Wednesday via email it 'seems clear that President Trump plans to pick up where he left off with Kim Jong Un in his first administration.' Thornton, who was acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs during the first Trump administration, said Trump would 'like to hold Kim and North Korea to the 2018 Singapore joint statement that included Kim’s commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.' However, 'much has changed since then, and Kim’s hand is stronger, so it won’t be easy,' Thornton said, referring to Pyongyang’s development of more advanced weapons. The state-run Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, reported Wednesday that Kim said it was 'indispensable' to bolster nuclear forces, as North Korea continues to face 'confrontations with the most vicious, hostile countries.' Last Saturday, the North test-fired what it said were sea-to-surface strategic cruise-guided missiles. Kim, who inspected the test launch, said the country’s war deterrence means are 'being perfected more thoroughly,' according to KCNA. Evans Revere, former acting secretary for East Asia and Pacific affairs during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on the phone Wednesday that Kim would agree to come back to the table if he believed reengaging with Washington 'could help him attain any of his own goals with respect to his nuclear and missile programs and relations with the United States.' Revere is skeptical that any of Kim’s goals would include his regime’s denuclearization. 'The North Koreans might dangle the possibility of a discussion about denuclearization to attract the United States into a dialogue, but it would not be a serious proposal,' he said. 'Quite frankly, they are determined to keep their weapons, keep their capabilities, which they regard as essential to their own existence.' Daunting task Frank Aum, a senior expert on North Korea at the U.S. Institute of Peace who worked at the Department of Defense from 2010 to 2017, said denuclearization is not a realistic goal to achieve in the near or medium term. 'The best thing Trump can do to increase the odds of North Korea’s engagement is to resolve Russia’s war in Ukraine, which would decrease North Korea’s leverage and signal that a U.S. offer better than the one in Hanoi might be on the table,' Aum said in an email to VOA Korean. North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to help Moscow in its war against Ukraine. In return, North Korea has received military or financial assistance, according to U.S. and South Korean officials. The February 2019 talks, in which Trump and Kim met for the second time, collapsed after Kim asked for full lifting of sanctions in exchange for the dismantling of the country’s main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, about 100 kilometers north of Pyongyang. Trump demanded more should be done on Kim’s end. Aum said Kim would likely not have budged from his position then. 'Trump may probe to see if he can get Kim to accept partial sanctions relief instead, like he tried at Hanoi, or offer more for Yongbyon,' Aum said. 'It seems clear that Kim will not offer any more security concessions than Yongbyon.' Sydney Seiler, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA Korean via email on Wednesday that 'for now, it is unlikely any meeting, if it takes place, will reasonably be related to denuclearization.' 'Trump will likely seek to keep the ultimate goal of denuclearization alive while exploring ways in which to reduce the threat,' Seiler said. Referring to recent comments by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the failure of sanctions to halt the North Korean nuclear program, Seiler speculated that sanctions relief may be offered for significant steps in the new talks between Washington and Pyongyang. Seiler added that military exercises and extended deterrence may also be reduced in terms of their frequency, volume and scale, in exchange for a halt or slowing of Kim's long-range missile launches and nuclear tests. In June 2018, Trump decided to suspend major military exercises with South Korea in an apparent gesture of good faith, right after his first meeting with Kim in Singapore. It raised some fears among South Koreans that such a move could weaken defense against the North.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-trump-faces-tough-task-to-denuclearize-north-korea-/7957893.html	2025-01-30T17:24:50-08:00	
Foreign officials begin meeting Syria's interim president	Foreign dignitaries and officials are beginning to travel to Syria to meet with Ahmed al-Sharaa, the country's newly appointed transitional president. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani became the first head of state to visit Damascus, Syria's capital, and meet with Sharaa. The Qatari royal court said the emir discussed with Sharaa 'the urgent need to form a government that represents all segments of the Syrian people.' Before being appointed to his current role, Sharaa was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, that spearheaded the campaign in December to wrest control of the country from President Bashar al-Assad. Assad fled to Russia, ending more than half a century of oppressive rule by Bashar and his late father, Hafez. Qatar has been a longtime supporter of Syria's opposition. The foreign ministers of both countries held a press conference Thursday. 'The Syrian people won't forget Qatar's committed position while we open a new chapter in a new Syria,' Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani said. Qatar is looking forward to providing Syria with additional aid in the electrical and infrastructure arenas, Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed al-Khulaifi said. Promise of inclusive government On Wednesday, the commanders of the military factions that toppled the former regime named Sharaa, who has served as the de facto head of government since the fall of Assad, as president during the formation of a new government. Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, is facing the daunting task of forming a temporary legislative council for the transitional period, as the previous parliament has been dissolved. Syria's constitution has also been annulled, and a new charter will be adopted. No timeline for the creation of a new parliament and constitution has been announced. Sharaa has promised to create an inclusive government and eventually elections. The elections could take as long as four years to arrange, Sharaa said, according to Reuters. Russians, Palestinians visit On Tuesday, delegations from Russia and the Palestinian Authority arrived in Syria. The Russian delegation included Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia's special envoy for Syria, according to RIA Novosti. There was no official government comment on the itinerary of the Russian officials. However, the Russians were expected to meet with Sharaa and Syria's foreign minister, according to the semiofficial Al Watan newspaper. Syria has not cut all ties with Russia, where Assad is living in exile. Russian troops and assets remain in Syria, but they have all been relocated to Hmeimim Air Base, The Associated Press reported. A Palestinian Authority delegation that included Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa was in Syria on Tuesday to meet with Sharaa, but no details have been released. At one point, the U.S. placed a $10 million bounty on Sharaa, according to the AP. The bounty was removed recently after a U.S. delegation met him in Damascus. In a video released after the meeting with the Syrian factions, Sharaa said one of his top priorities would be filling 'in a legitimate and legal way' Syria's government. Another priority, he said, will be 'maintaining civil peace by seeking transitional justice and preventing revenge attacks' due to Assad's reign. Some information for this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-officials-begin-meeting-syria-s-interim-president/7957853.html	2025-01-30T17:08:21-08:00	
Analysts consider ramifications of ECOWAS members’ exit	ABUJA, NIGERIA — The departure of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from West Africa’s most influential bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), raises concerns, especially in the areas of security and economics, according to regional analysts who spoke with VOA. Some say the split — the first time nations have quit the regional body since its creation a half-century ago — could weaken joint military operations and further destabilize the Sahel, a region already struggling with jihadist insurgencies. But on Wednesday, the day the decision was formally recognized by the bloc, ECOWAS Commission President Omar Alieu Touray told reporters in Abuja that the bloc was willing to continue security cooperation despite the split. ECOWAS also announced that its 'doors remain open' to the departing nations and urged the remaining 12 member states to continue to support them. 'I think that ECOWAS has taken a pragmatic approach about the unfolding situation,' said Rotimi Olawale, a political affairs analyst. 'I expect also that there would be continued cooperation around security issues. Issues of peace and security pose a big challenge.' Junta-led Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso officially quit the regional body on Wednesday after a yearlong notice. Relations between ECOWAS and the departing trio of member states soured after a July 2023 coup in Niger, which led ECOWAS to threaten military intervention. In 2023, the three states formed their own bloc, the Alliance of Sahel States, seeking closer ties with Russia. Touray said ECOWAS plans to hold a technical session with the three countries to discuss the way forward. Chris Kwaja, the Nigerian director at the United States Institute of Peace, said 'there are so many issues, so I think a technical session of that nature is important to allow each party to weigh where it stands on the issue of separation.' Trade is one of them. Analysts say economic challenges may loom large for the three departing nations, especially regarding access to maritime ports to the south. 'The countries will get to a point where they will seek at the very least greater cooperation with ECOWAS countries, as they would require access to the port,' said Olawale. 'The three countries are landlocked, so they'll continue to depend on the subregion for trade partnership to ensure that they continue to have a booming economy. My predictions are that the three countries are coming back to ECOWAS, perhaps not in the short term.' In recent years, ECOWAS, which was founded to promote economic integration, has faced increasing challenges in maintaining stability across the region. Kwaja said public sentiment toward ECOWAS is shifting because some citizens view the bloc as an entity that primarily protects the interests of regional leaders rather than the masses. 'ECOWAS was a bit detached from its citizens,' said Kwaja. 'Now a big lesson for ECOWAS should be to invest heavily in the people, back to the point about the ECOWAS agenda of moving away from an ECOWAS [of] state to an ECOWAS of the people, because the people constitute the pillar upon which ECOWAS is [sitting].' The Sahel region has become the world’s deadliest terrorism hot spot, accounting for the highest number of terror-related deaths last year. The outcome of the looming technical session remains uncertain, and many will be watching to see how ECOWAS moves past its most significant political crisis in decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-consider-ramifications-of-ecowas-members-exit/7957552.html	2025-01-30T17:00:29-08:00

US lawmakers weigh cost of foreign aid freeze in competition with China	U.S. lawmakers Thursday weighed the impact that President Donald Trump's 90-day foreign aid freeze will have on competition with China. Trump signed an executive order within hours of being sworn in as president ordering a halt to all U.S. international assistance while the new administration determines whether the aid aligns with his 'America First' policy. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch said the move was a necessary step to prioritize fiscal responsibility as the U.S. faces a debt of $36 trillion. 'This is obviously a work in progress,' Risch, a Republican from Idaho, said Thursday. 'It was intended to underscore the fact that we're going into debt at the rate of $1 trillion every 100 days. I think that has certainly been underscored as a result of this. If you think this is bad, when our debtors come and want their money and we can't pay it, that's going to be really bad,' Risch said. 'It's caused everyone to take a breath and look at how we're spending our money, where we're spending our money, seeing that it's done as efficiently as possible. Admittedly, there have been some inconveniences along the line, but they're continuing to work on this.' Democrats said the pause in aid creates a void that will be filled by the People's Republic of China (PRC). 'I'm particularly concerned about the expansion of China's influence, both at home and abroad, as a result of a freeze on our foreign assistance — and, in particular, the way it's implemented in its cascading effect,' Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said in a hearing about Chinese influence abroad. 'There is nothing China wants to do more than limit the reach of our global influence, than to reinforce its imprint,' Coons added. '[That way] we're an unreliable partner with countries throughout the world and particularly in the Global South, and my concern is that we put our security, our economic and our diplomatic interest at risk with an abrupt pause that puts a halt to actions to counter malign activity by the PRC, to advance to invest in infrastructure.' But Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Democrats should not be the only ones concerned about evaluating and restoring the aid. 'I hope that all of you on the other side of the aisle will share your concerns with the administration and point out that this is not a partisan issue,' she said. 'This is about what are we going to do to ensure that our influence continues around the world in the interest of our own national security.' Around the world, U.S.-funded foreign aid programs have already begun shutting down their programming and laying off staff in the wake of the freeze. The U.S. is the world's largest foreign aid provider but is outspent by China in some areas. According to the Government Accountability Office, between 2013 and 2022, China spent $679 billion on global infrastructure projects compared with the United States' $76 billion. 'Foreign aid is a really important arrow in the quiver of U.S. national security, along with other tools such as diplomacy, military assistance and so on,' Jennifer Lind, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College, told lawmakers Thursday. 'And so ideally, we would want to be using all of our different tools in a coordinated fashion to achieve our objectives. For that reason, I think it's understandable if the administration wants to take a short pause and assess: Are we using the right tools in the right way?' But Melanie Hart of the Atlantic Council said the freeze 'is hobbling America's ability to compete with China in every domain.' 'Over $1 billion more foreign military financing for Taiwan. Frozen. NDI [National Democratic Institute] and IRI [International Republican Institute] are shutting down global operations. Human rights organizations — frozen,' she said. 'Washington has effectively abandoned the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement.' Hart said she understood the administration's desire to maximize the strategic focus of the aid and appreciated the State Department's waivers, but that 'this broad freeze hobbles America at a moment when we are in the battle of the century.' 'It is a massive gift to Beijing. The longer it goes on, the harder it will be to regain the ground we are already losing today, tomorrow and this week,' Hart said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a waiver last Friday unfreezing emergency food assistance and earlier this week issued another waiver unfreezing humanitarian assistance. The top Democrat on the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition with China on Thursday welcomed Rubio's waivers but said more had to be done. 'While periodic review of foreign assistance programs' contribution to U.S. national security is necessary, abruptly freezing any foreign assistance directly cedes ground to our foremost adversary: the CCP,' said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, in a statement. 'At a time when the CCP is aggressively investing abroad, rerouting supply chains and buying authoritarian favor, the United States must double down on foreign assistance — not kneecap ourselves.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-weigh-cost-of-foreign-aid-freeze-in-competition-with-china/7957852.html	2025-01-30T16:24:42-08:00	
Zelenskyy condemns Russian strike that killed 9 as ‘terrible tragedy’	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned an early Thursday morning Russian drone strike that killed at least nine people as a 'terrible tragedy.' The drone, which struck an apartment building in the city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine, also injured 13 people, according to regional authorities. 'This is a terrible tragedy, a terrible Russian crime. It is very important that the world does not stop putting pressure on Russia for this terror,' Zelenskyy said on Telegram. Police said the search-and-rescue operation had concluded after 19 hours. Three elderly couples were among those killed, and an 8-year-old child was among those wounded. The child’s mother was killed in the attack. '[Russian President Vladimir] Putin claims to be ready for negotiations, but this is what he actually does,' Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on social media. Russia launched 81 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian military said Thursday. The attacks damaged businesses and homes around the country, according to the military. In the southern region of Odesa, the attack damaged a grain warehouse and a hospital, according to the governor. Meanwhile, James Anderson, a British man who was captured while fighting on the Ukrainian side in Russia’s Kursk region, will face terrorism and mercenary charges, Russian state investigators said Thursday. Russia announced in November that it had captured Anderson. Also, the review and 90-day freeze on U.S. foreign aid means Ukrainian aid groups that rely on U.S. funding are being forced to cut services. Zelenskyy said U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was not affected by U.S. President Donald Trump’s freeze on foreign aid, but the Ukrainian president still expressed concern about the funding pause. Some information for this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-condemns-russian-strike-that-killed-9-as-terrible-tragedy-/7957549.html	2025-01-30T15:12:04-08:00

After fires, Los Angeles gets moonshot moment to rebuild	As Los Angeles recovers from its devastating wildfires, environmental engineers, urban planners and natural disaster experts are casting forward with visions of what could come next for neighborhoods that have been reduced to ash and rubble. Apartment buildings could spring up where strip malls and parking lots once stood, with locals walking to ground-floor shops, offices and cafes, European-style. The city could 'infill' vertically to add affordable housing in safer downtown areas, rather than outwards with more single-family homes on fire-prone hills. Some blocks could be turned into buffer zones, where no building was allowed. And the city's trademark palm trees, which burn like Roman candles, could be replaced with fire-resistant native trees. These are some of the bold ideas academics have for Los Angeles as it recovers from the Eaton and Palisades fires, which killed 28 people and damaged or destroyed nearly 16,000 structures. Together, the blazes charred 152 square kilometers — an area larger than Paris. The city is far from rebuilding, with many people only now being allowed back to their burned neighborhoods. When construction does begin, few of the dozen experts Reuters spoke to expected their dream plans to be adopted, citing factors ranging from lack of future insurance coverage to political pressure to rebuild as before. Nonetheless, experts in urban development, climate change and housing said Los Angeles has a chance to think outside the box. Many also said there should be no rush to rebuild. Instead, residents of Pacific Palisades and Altadena should be afforded time to decide what their future communities should look like and dream big. 'The biggest thing is how do we promote infill development in safer areas,' said Emily Schlickman, assistant professor of landscape architecture and environmental design at the University of California, Davis, who suggests retreating from fire-prone peripheries. Model cities Los Angeles could learn from cities like Kobe, Japan, decimated by a 1995 earthquake, where officials imposed a two-month building moratorium, said Columbia University's Jeffrey Schlegelmilch. 'One of the most important things is to give yourself time to come up with a robust solution,' said Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the university's climate school. Then there are Houston's Harris County and the city of San Antonio, Texas, which bought up homes and properties to reduce future flood risk. In the case of Harris County, authorities offered willing sellers pre-flood market values for homes flooded during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 then demolished them. Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis and history at Pomona College in Claremont, California, is among those who point to Texas' experience. While buying up properties in Pacific Palisades and Altadena would be costly, Miller said, it would be possible with the financial support of the city, county, state and possibly insurers. Burned-out lots could be turned into what he envisions as fire buffer zones. While disruptive to residents, Miller believes many would be willing to use the money to relocate. 'People go, 'Yeah, I don't want to be in danger, and you're buying me out. Yeah, thank you,'' said Miller. He despairs at city and state efforts to fast-track redevelopment in areas that burned at a similar housing density. 'They just pulled the plug on the moonshot,' Miller said. Alice Hill, a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, wants to see more green spaces like playing fields and bike paths between fire-risk areas and homes. 'It simply is unsafe to rebuild communities where they were, and retreating may be the wisest approach,' Hill wrote in a Jan. 14 essay. A little more panache Other experts advocate rebuilding the communities but in a way that will resist fire. 'The only way to do this impactfully is to do it communitywide so if the fire gets in, it has a hard time moving on,' said Michael Gollner, a professor of mechanical engineering at University of California, Berkeley. Gollner tests prototype houses to see how they handle flames. Homes can be made more fire-resistant by moving a wooden fence back five feet (1.5 meters), surrounding a house with gravel and putting mesh over attic vents to stop embers, he said. Then there is landscaping, a contentious subject for some homeowners. 'Who wants to cut down their juniper? But come a wildfire, your juniper is a torch,' said Gollner. Ecologists suggest Los Angelenos replace palms, junipers and eucalyptus with trees that evolved to survive fire, such as California oaks. The species has thick bark that resists flames and leathery leaves that burn slowly. 'There are lots of people who are working to plant oaks, and I think there's some effort in giving them more panache,' said Alexandra Syphard, a San Diego-based wildfire ecologist at the Conservation Biology Institute. For Hussam Mahmoud, a professor in civil and environmental engineering at Colorado State University, the key is predicting the path of future fires. He has developed a model that calculates which buildings will burn, allowing a community to fire-harden 'super spreader' structures, rather than fully adapt every house to resist wildfires. Hardening a home begins with using metal or concrete for a roof and fire-retardant materials on the sides. Multipane windows are less likely to break from the heat and cause a home to burn from within. 'When the fires hit L.A., it's clear that nobody knew what was going to happen, which buildings were more likely to burn,' said Mahmoud.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-fires-los-angeles-gets-moonshot-moment-to-rebuild/7957503.html	2025-01-30T14:27:47-08:00	
Republican senator airs concerns about supporting RFK Jr to be US health secretary	WASHINGTON — A key Republican senator on Thursday said he was struggling with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination by President Donald Trump to run the top U.S. health agency, saying he had reservations about the nominee's 'misleading arguments' on vaccines. 'Your past of undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments concerns me,' Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician from Louisiana, told Kennedy. 'I have been struggling with the nomination,' he said at the end of Thursday's Senate health committee hearing to consider Kennedy to run the massive Department of Health and Human Services. 'Does a 70-year-old man ... who spent decades criticizing vaccines and who's financially vested in finding fault with vaccines, can he change his attitudes and approach now that he'll have the most important position influencing vaccine policy in the United States?' Cassidy said. The hearing was the second in two days for Kennedy during which he squared off with Democrats and some Republicans over his past comments on vaccines, abortion and COVID-19 among other topics. The Finance Committee, which Kennedy appeared before on Wednesday, has not yet said if it will send Kennedy's nomination to the full Republican-controlled Senate, which has not rejected any of Trump's nominees so far. A spokesperson for the Finance Committee said a vote could potentially take place next week, but that one had not yet been scheduled. Cassidy, who sits on both committees, told Kennedy at the end of Thursday's hearing that Kennedy would be hearing from him over the weekend, presumably regarding questions he has over the nomination. Kennedy's nomination could fail to move to the Senate for consideration if all Democrats on the Finance Committee voted against him and were joined by Cassidy. During wide-ranging questioning on Thursday, Kennedy spoke more confidently than the day prior, adjusting the characterization of previous statements, and saying he would support the U.S. children's vaccination schedule, research and development for bird flu, and scientific data on vaccine safety. Kennedy also said he would address rapidly increasing rates of chronic disease. 'Our country is not going to be destroyed because we get the marginal tax rate wrong. It is going to be destroyed if we get this issue wrong,' he said of chronic diseases. 'And I am in a unique position to be able to stop this epidemic.' He was asked about comments he has made over decades, including that it was 'highly likely' that Lyme disease was a military bioweapon. He said he never said that it was definitively created in a biolab. He would not answer a question from Senator Bernie Sanders about whether he agreed that vaccines do not cause autism. He also said he did not know if the coronavirus vaccine saved millions of lives. 'If you come out unequivocally, 'vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism' that would have an incredible impact,' Cassidy said. Kennedy has said vaccines are linked to autism, and he opposed state and federal restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The causes of autism are unclear, though theories that childhood vaccines cause autism have been widely debunked and are contrary to scientific evidence. Kennedy, who founded the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, argued during both hearings that he was not against vaccines. The group has sued in state and federal courts over vaccines. 'News reports and many in the hearing yesterday have claimed that I'm anti-vaccine and anti-industry. Well, I'm neither,' Kennedy said, repeating that his children are vaccinated. Thursday's hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is a courtesy hearing with no vote involved. However, Republican Senators Cassidy, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins sit on the committee, all of whom are seen as potential swing votes against Kennedy. Supporters of Kennedy wearing 'Make America Healthy Again' hats crowded around the committee hearing room on Thursday, while some opposing his confirmation wore 'Reject RFK Jr' stickers on their shirts. 'Catastrophic' impacts If confirmed, Kennedy would run HHS, which oversees more than $3 trillion in healthcare spending, including at the Food and Drug Administration and the agency in charge of the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs covering nearly half of all Americans. He said he would follow Trump's direction on abortion and would hire for his department those who are against abortion rights. Kennedy also said gender-affirming care for children has 'catastrophic' impacts and that children are not equipped to make judgments about receiving such care. He said he would rescind a Biden-era rule that requires medical providers who receive federal funding to offer gender-affirming care. Kennedy said farmers should be offered an off-ramp from chemically intensive agriculture, and that illness in farm communities is 'undoubtedly' related to the use of pesticides. Some farm and food groups have expressed concern about Kennedy's positions on pesticides and food additives. Opposition groups have ramped up their efforts to persuade Republican senators to vote against Kennedy. Caroline Kennedy, another member of the storied American political family, on Tuesday urged senators to vote against her cousin's nomination, calling him a predator with dangerous views on health care. Kennedy has also faced scrutiny over his ties to Wisner Baum, a law firm specializing in pharmaceutical drug injury cases. He has an arrangement to earn 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases he refers to the firm, according to a letter Kennedy wrote to an HHS ethics official released last week. If confirmed, Kennedy would retain that financial interest in cases that do not directly impact the U.S. government, the letter said. If his nomination goes to the full Senate, Kennedy would need the support of at least 50 senators, which would allow Vice President JD Vance to cast another tie-breaking vote to confirm his nomination.	https://www.voanews.com/a/republican-senator-airs-concerns-about-supporting-rfk-jr-to-be-us-health-secretary/7957459.html	2025-01-30T14:17:33-08:00

US ban on gun sales to adults under age 21 is unconstitutional, court rules	A decades-old U.S. government ban on federally licensed firearms dealers selling handguns to adults under the age of 21 is unconstitutional, a U.S. appeals court held on Thursday, citing recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings expanding gun rights. The ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals marked the first time a federal appeals court has held that the prohibition violated the right to keep and bear arms enshrined in the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. The appeals court had previously upheld that same ban in 2012. But that was before the 6-3 conservative majority U.S. Supreme Court handed down a landmark ruling in 2022 that established a new test for assessing modern firearms laws. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Supreme Court held that modern gun restrictions were required to be 'consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.' The federal ban on sales to people under 21 was first adopted by Congress in 1968 as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. A group of individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 along with the gun rights groups the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Second Amendment Foundation challenged the ban in 2020 and was appealing a lower-court judge's decision upholding the statutes. U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Jones, writing for Thursday's three-judge panel, said that decision was wrong, as the statutes were 'unconstitutional in light of our Nation's historic tradition of firearm regulation.' The U.S. Department of Justice during Democratic former President Joe Biden's tenure had defended the ban. But Jones said it put forth 'scant' evidence to show that the gun rights of adults ages 18 to 20 were similarly restricted during the nation's founding era in the 1700s. 'Ultimately, the text of the Second Amendment includes eighteen-to-twenty-year-old individuals among 'the people' whose right to keep and bear arms is protected,' wrote Jones, who like the other panel members was appointed by a Republican president. Brandon Combs, the Firearms Policy Coalition's president, in a statement called the ruling a victory against 'an immoral and unconstitutional age-based gun ban.' The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-ban-on-gun-sales-to-adults-under-age-21-is-unconstitutional-court-rules-/7957454.html	2025-01-30T13:36:56-08:00

East African leaders call for ceasefire in DRC; humanitarian crisis worsens	NAIROBI, KENYA — East African Community leaders on Wednesday called for an immediate ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where government forces are fighting rebel group M23, while aid agencies say the clashes are deepening the already dire humanitarian crisis there. Kenyan President William Ruto led an online meeting for seven of eight of the trade bloc's heads of state. The only member not participating was Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi. In a statement afterward, the leaders called on the warring parties to cease hostilities in eastern Congo and facilitate humanitarian access to the affected areas. The summit also asked the DRC government to protect diplomatic missions in the country, following attacks this week by protesters in the capital, Kinshasa, targeting embassies of several countries presumed to be sympathetic to the M23 rebel group. The Congolese government has accused Rwanda of supporting M23, which this week took control of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. Witnesses reported seeing bodies in the streets, but local officials have not determined a death toll. The Congolese government said it is fighting to push out the rebels from the city of 2 million. Edgar Githua, an international relations analyst in Nairobi, said animosity between Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame could derail any ceasefire talks. 'There’s still a lot of bad blood between DRC and Rwanda on how to approach this issue because DRC believes that these are Rwandese, and Kagame categorically keeps on saying M23 are not Rwandese, these are ethnic Tutsis who are Congolese by citizenship,' Githua said. 'It is only that they share a language with Rwanda. So, this issue of identity is what is ailing this conflict and needs to be addressed deeply.' Meanwhile, aid agencies say these latest clashes have made the dire humanitarian crisis in DRC even worse, as thousands of Goma residents, many of whom were already displaced due to earlier conflict, are forced to flee again. Maina King’ori, the acting country director for CARE International in DRC, told VOA from Goma, 'There’s been no electricity supply for the last several days in most parts of Goma. The water system is not functioning; it has been shut down, though slowly coming back in some places, and there has been no internet connectivity in Goma for the last three days. This makes living really difficult.' King’ori urged parties to the conflict to adhere to international humanitarian law and protect civilians. 'Civilians cannot be a target,' he said. 'Civilians are not party to this conflict, yet they’re having to bear the immense load. … They’re the ones that are having to feel the pain of sleeping outside, of being relocated several times, of losing loved ones.' Democratic Republic of Congo is grappling with a decadeslong crisis that humanitarian agencies say has left over 6 million people displaced, with recent hostilities exacerbating their plight. North Kivu, where Goma is located, hosts over 2.7 million internally displaced people, according to CARE International.	https://www.voanews.com/a/east-african-leaders-call-for-ceasefire-in-drc-humanitarian-crisis-worsens/7957409.html	2025-01-30T13:11:35-08:00	
Immigrant neighborhoods in Chicago on edge amid federal enforcement actions	CHICAGO — Alderman Michael Rodriguez represents Chicago's 22nd Ward, including the 'Little Village' neighborhood on the west side of the city. Outside his office windows, he has an up-close view of 26th Street, an important thoroughfare with stores and merchants attracting immigrants from across the region. '26th Street is known as the capital of the Mexican Midwest,' Rodriguez told VOA. 'Our local economy here is thriving and is a generous tax base for the whole region.' A 2020 study by the Delta Institute says the Little Village provides about $900 million in annual tax revenue for Chicago, the second-highest amount for the city. But as federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and other agents fan out across the area amid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants, the usually bustling 26th Street is noticeably quieter. 'My community members are in absolute fear,' Rodriguez said. One way his office prepared for the crackdown was sharing information with the community about their rights. 'We've held workshops for our businesses knowing their rights. We've passed out 'Know your Rights' cards outside of grocery stores. There are other organizations and entities going door to door talking to neighbors and letting them know what their rights are,' he said. White House 'Border Czar' Tom Homan was in Chicago observing federal law enforcement efforts. In an interview at the White House on Wednesday, he explained to VOA that law-abiding immigrants in the country legally are not the focus of the crackdown. 'Right now, we are concentrating on public safety threats and national security threats. That's our number one goal,' Homan said. 'So, we've got all of our government operations. It's not just ICE looking for these criminal aliens — it's DEA, and FBI, and ATF and U.S. Marshals Services. … It's an all-government approach to look for criminal aliens throughout the United States. We're going to hit every city in this country and arrest those that are in the country illegally that have a criminal conviction.' A new executive order signed by President Donald Trump enables ICE officers to enter sensitive locations such as schools and churches to apprehend suspects, Homan said in an interview Sunday on ABC's 'This Week.' 'ICE officers should have discretion to decide if a national security threat or a public safety threat is in one of these facilities. Then it should be an option for them to make the arrest,' Homan told ABC. 'We're really concerned for the safety of our families,' said Cristina De La Rosa, executive director of Erie House, a nonprofit organization that assists immigrants in the Little Village neighborhood. 'We've already experienced some participants that are not coming to our sites or keeping their kids at home, so we want them to know that we are prepared, as well.' De La Rosa said her organization has moved some services online for those reluctant to visit offices. 'We've definitely experienced less people on the streets, for sure,' she told VOA. 'I think that unfortunately, there's been a lot of chaos, as well, because of the fear.' De La Rosa said concerns among community members she talks to extend beyond fear of deportation. 'A lot of the organizations in the community, we rely on government dollars to do a lot of the work that we do in our communities. And so, I think this is just one of the many ways our work is going to be impacted,' she said. At a city press conference on Wednesday, Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling told reporters that federal law enforcement agencies were providing updates to his department on their enforcement actions. 'What I can tell you right now is that we don't have an exact number of Chicago people who have been detained,' Snelling said. 'But what I can tell you is that the number in the Chicagoland area exceeds 100.' Mayor Brandon Johnson tried to reassure the public that Chicago was still a city that welcomed immigrants. 'Chicago is a city that opens its arms to people from around the globe,' he said. 'We will continue to protect civil and human rights, and we welcome all individuals and families who want to work, live and thrive here in our beloved city.'

US-born girl shot dead by father in Pakistan over TikTok videos, police say	QUETTA, Pakistan — A Pakistani man suspected of killing his U.S.-born 15-year-old daughter in a so-called honor killing after she apparently refused to stop sharing videos on TikTok appeared in court Thursday in the southwestern city of Quetta, police said. The shooting happened on a street in the southwestern city of Quetta on Tuesday. The suspect, Anwar ul-Haq, initially said that unidentified gunmen shot and killed his daughter before he confessed to the crime Wednesday, police official Babar Baloch said. 'Our investigation so far has found that the family had an objection to her dressing, lifestyle and social gathering,' another police investigator, Zohaib Mohsin, said. 'We have her phone. It is locked,' he told Reuters. 'We are probing all aspects, including honor killing.' The family had recently returned to Balochistan province in predominantly Muslim Pakistan, a nation with conservative social norms, having lived in the United States for about 25 years, Baloch said. The suspect has U.S. citizenship, the officer said. He said Haq had told him his daughter began creating 'objectionable' content on the social media platform TikTok when she lived in the United States. He told police that she continued to share videos on the platform after returning to Pakistan. Baloch said the main suspect's brother-in-law had also been arrested in connection with the killing. Police said they had charged Haq with the killing. They did not offer proof of Haq's U.S. citizenship except for the suspect's own testimony and declined to say whether the U.S. Embassy had been informed of the incident. His family declined to respond to a Reuters request for comment. More than 54 million people use TikTok in Pakistan, a nation of 241 million. The government has blocked the video-sharing app several times in recent years over content moderation. Islamabad often takes issue with what it terms 'obscene content' with the social media platform, which has lately started complying with requests from Pakistan to remove certain content. Over 1,000 women are killed each year in Pakistan at the hands of community or family members over perceived damage to 'honor,' according to independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. That could involve eloping, posting social media content, fraternizing with men, or any other infraction against conservative values relating to women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-born-girl-shot-dead-by-father-in-pakistan-over-tiktok-videos-police-say/7957369.html	2025-01-30T12:34:24-08:00	
Trump signs order to plan US's 250th anniversary, punish statue vandals	NEW YORK — U.S. President Donald Trump is making plans to celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence and create a new national sculpture garden while reviving efforts to harshly punish those who vandalize or destroy existing statues and monuments. Trump signed an executive order Wednesday establishing a White House task force to plan what he says will be a 'grand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion of the 250th anniversary of American Independence,' which the country will celebrate on July 4, 2026. Trump will serve as chair of the task force, which will include a long list of senior administration officials, including Cabinet secretaries. The order also revives Trump's plans to build a 'National Garden of American Heroes' with statues memorializing 250 historical figures. Trump first announced plans for what he said would be 'a new monument to the giants of our past' in a 2020 speech celebrating Independence Day at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. It was to have featured sculptures of dozens of American historical figures, including presidents, athletes and pop culture icons. Trump himself curated the list of who was to be included — Davy Crockett, Billy Graham, Whitney Houston, Harriet Tubman and Antonin Scalia, among others. No site was selected, however, and the garden was never funded by Congress. President Joe Biden abolished the task force after his election. Trump's announcement had come at a time of conservative backlash against efforts to take down statues dedicated to Confederate leaders and slave owners in the wake of George Floyd’s murder and subsequent protests. 'The National Garden will honor American heroism after dozens of monuments to Americans, including Presidents and Founding Fathers, have toppled or destroyed and never restored,' said a White House document on the order shared with The Associated Press ahead of the signing. Wednesday’s action also puts back into place an executive order Trump signed in 2020, and which Biden also overturned, that was aimed at protecting monuments, memorials and statues from destruction and vandalism. Trump had signed the order during the protests over racial injustice that year after police thwarted an attempt by protesters to pull down a statue of Andrew Jackson, the seventh U.S. president, in a park across from the White House. That earlier order had called on the attorney general to fully prosecute any person or group responsible for destroying or vandalizing a monument, memorial or statue. It called for the maximum prosecution of anyone who incited violence and illegal activity and threatened state and local law enforcement agencies with a loss of federal money if they failed to protect monuments. Wednesday's order cites 'Recent examples of conduct necessitating reinstatement of this order' in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel by Hamas and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza, including a demonstration last June when protesters demanding a ceasefire vandalized statues and structures around the White House with graffiti. During his 2024 campaign, Trump had talked about creating a yearlong 'Salute to America 250' celebration. He said that on his first day back in office he would convene a task force that would be responsible for coordinating with state and local governments to plan festivities, beginning this Memorial Day. He said he wanted the plan to include a yearlong 'Great American State Fair' in Iowa, featuring pavilions that would 'showcase the glory of every state in the Union, promote pride in our history, and put forth innovative visions for America’s future.' And he said he wanted to launch 'Patriot Games' — sports contests featuring high school athletes from across the country that he said would 'allow young Americans from every state to show off the best of American skill, sportsmanship and competitive spirit.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-to-plan-us-s-250th-anniversary-punish-statue-vandals/7957326.html	2025-01-30T12:17:54-08:00	
Trump's orders take aim at critical race theory, antisemitism on college campuses	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is ordering U.S. schools to stop teaching what he views as 'critical race theory' and other material dealing with race and sexuality or risk losing their federal money. A separate plan announced Wednesday calls for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college campuses, promising to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be 'Hamas sympathizers.' Both plans were outlined in executive orders signed by Trump on Wednesday. The measures seek to fulfill some of the Republican president's core campaign promises around education, though it's unclear how much power he has to enact the proposals. His order on K-12 schools declares that federal money cannot be used on the 'indoctrination' of children, including 'radical gender ideology and critical race theory.' It says civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex and race would be used to enforce the order, calling critical race theory an 'inherently racist policy.' Examples cited in the order include a policy at Harrisonburg City Public Schools in Virginia requiring teachers to use students' preferred names and pronouns. Another policy at Madison Metropolitan School District in Wisconsin says schools should 'disrupt the gender binary' by teaching students to embrace different gender identities, according to the order. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations of civil rights violations and can impose sanctions up to a total loss of federal money, though that penalty has almost never been used and must be approved by a judge. The order unfairly tarnishes teachers and makes it harder for them to do their jobs, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. 'Today is a sad day because the Trump administration is doing exactly what it accuses others of: creating division and fear in classrooms across America,' she said. Trump also directs the education secretary to craft a strategy within 90 days to 'end indoctrination in K-12 education.' Trump has appointed billionaire professional wrestling mogul Linda McMahon as his education chief, but her Senate confirmation hearing has not been scheduled. During his campaign, Trump said he would sign an order 'on day one' to cut federal money for schools that push critical race theory or other 'inappropriate' content. The federal government provides billions of dollars to schools every year, though the vast majority of their money comes from state and local sources. 'Divisive concepts' The measure taps into a wave of conservative anger that has taken aim at classroom lessons that some see as too liberal. A growing number of Republican states have adopted laws or rules barring the teaching of critical race theory or 'divisive concepts' in public schools and universities. Opponents say the rules impose vague restrictions on teachers and create a chilling effect on discussions about history and other subjects. The term 'critical race theory' refers to a complex academic and legal framework centered on the idea that racism is embedded in the nation’s systems. Trey Walk, a researcher and advocate with Human Rights Watch, said students have a right to learn about how discrimination can be entrenched in law and society. 'If the U.S. denies young people this knowledge, it has little hope of eradicating racism,' he said. Trump's plan to fight antisemitism would 'marshal all federal resources' and bring immediate action from the Justice Department to investigate and punish offenders on U.S. campuses. It calls for the deportation of nonresident aliens who 'violate our laws,' citing previous threats by Trump to revoke student visas for international students who attended pro-Palestinian protests. Trump's action promises to 'protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.' It drew swift backlash from civil rights groups who said campus protests have mostly been peaceful and are protected by constitutional free-speech rights. Edward Ahmed Mitchell, national deputy director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the action is discriminatory and wrongly characterizes protesters as 'pro-jihadist' or 'pro-Hamas.' 'These college students were Jewish, Muslim, Black, Palestinian and various other races who were simply protesting what they viewed as a genocide in Gaza,' Mitchell said. 'They are no different than the students who protested Vietnam or segregation or apartheid in South Africa.' Tensions over the Israel-Hamas war led to emotional demonstrations on U.S. campuses, including a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments that led to some 3,200 arrests. The Biden administration opened more than 100 investigations into alleged antisemitism and Islamophobia at schools and universities after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. A flurry of schools reached deals to settle the cases before Trump took office amid fears that he would issue heavier sanctions. The White House on Wednesday also reinstated an order from Trump's first term establishing the 1776 Commission to promote 'patriotic education' in U.S. schools. Biden revoked the order and the commission's guide for teaching history. The guide played down America’s role in slavery and argued that the civil rights movement ran afoul of the 'lofty ideals' espoused by the Founding Fathers. It was widely panned by historians, who said it was outdated and ignored decades of research.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-orders-take-aim-at-critical-race-theory-antisemitism-on-college-campuses/7957336.html	2025-01-30T12:12:42-08:00	
Immigrants in Chicago area live 'in absolute fear' as federal agents search for 'criminal aliens'	U.S. federal agents have stepped up immigration-related arrests in several American cities as part of President Donald Trump’s pledge to crack down on undocumented immigrants. VOA’s Kane Farabaugh reports from Chicago, where people in immigrant neighborhoods say the raids have many feeling anxious.	https://www.voanews.com/a/immigrants-in-chicago-neighborhoods-in-absolute-fear-as-federal-agents-seek-criminal-aliens-/7957307.html	2025-01-30T12:04:17-08:00	
Pakistan says Afghan-based 'terrorists' increasingly use US arms for cross-border attacks	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan said Thursday it had provided Taliban leaders in Afghanistan with 'sufficient proof' to substantiate its claims that militants are using modern weapons left behind by the United States military for cross-border terrorism. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan stated at a weekly news conference in Islamabad that the presence of U.S. advanced weapons in the neighboring country 'remains a source of concern,' and it has been communicated multiple times to the Taliban government in Kabul. 'The proofs are regularly provided,' Khan said when asked for his comments on whether Pakistan has shared any evidence with the Taliban. 'We have given sufficient proof, and this remains an important component of our engagement with the Taliban authorities to convey that the terrorists enjoy sanctuary [in Afghanistan] for attacks inside Pakistan,' the spokesperson asserted. Khan said Islamabad has consistently urged the de facto Afghan leaders to ensure that the weapons 'do not fall into the wrong hands.' Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson, vehemently dismissed allegations Thursday that the military hardware in question has been acquired by terrorist organizations and is being utilized in attacks against Pakistani territory. 'All weapons and military equipment are safely stored and maintained to prevent any potential misuse,' Taliban-run state television quoted Fitrat as claiming. Pakistan has seen an increase in militant attacks since the Taliban regained control in Kabul, leading to the deaths of hundreds of civilians and security personnel. The violence is primarily attributed to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, a globally designated terrorist organization that Islamabad claims is being sheltered and supported by the de facto Afghan rulers. The TTP has been waging deadly attacks for more than 15 years, but regional experts note a marked increase in the precision and lethality of militant raids against Pakistani security forces over the past couple of years, inflicting heavy losses on them. U.S.-led Western troops were stationed in Afghanistan to protect the internationally backed government in Kabul for nearly two decades. They hastily and chaotically withdrew in August 2021, just days after the then-insurgent Taliban regained control of the war-torn South Asian nation. A U.S. Department of Defense report in 2022 found that about $7 billion worth of military hardware was left behind in Afghanistan after the military withdrawal was completed. The equipment, including aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment and other materials was subsequently seized by the Taliban. President Donald Trump pledged on the eve of his Jan. 20 inauguration to retrieve the U.S. military weapons from the Taliban, claiming former President Joe Biden’s administration 'gave our military equipment, a big chunk of it, to the enemy.' Trump stated that future financial assistance to Afghanistan would be contingent upon the return of U.S. military equipment. 'If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re not going to give them the money unless they give back our military equipment,' he said. Taliban officials have not publicly responded to Trump’s assertions but privately claim they fought against and defeated American troops, acquiring the military equipment as 'spoils of the war.' The Kabul government, not recognized by any country, has repeatedly displayed U.S. military gear in their so-called victory day celebrations over the past three years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-says-afghan-based-terrorists-increasingly-use-us-arms-for-cross-border-attacks-/7957275.html	2025-01-30T11:48:00-08:00	
Fact-checkers in Ethiopia take on disinformation amid rising tensions	WASHINGTON — As tensions flared between Somalia and Ethiopia last year, social media became a breeding ground for misinformation. One video falsely claiming to show Egyptian troops training in Somalia gained 34,000 views on the social media platform X. But fact-checkers were able to prove the footage was old and unrelated to the current tensions. The case was not an isolated incident in Ethiopia, or globally. The spread of mis- or disinformation is a global phenomenon. Research has repeatedly shown how hostile groups use disinformation to further inflame tensions, create confusion and weaken trust in institutions, including government offices, nonprofits and media. Often it falls to news outlets or fact-checking initiatives to set the record straight. But moves by Meta to end some fact-checking tools such as CrowdTangle, and its decision in January to end a Facebook fact-check program in the U.S., have experts concerned about how to contain the spread of hate speech and disinformation. In Ethiopia, some specialists are already seeking extra training to be able to better spot and debunk false or misleading content. Communications specialist Netsanet Tesfaye already knew how to use tools such as Google’s reverse image search. But he sought extra training after seeing how quickly doctored images can be spread to stoke tensions. To learn how to better spot fakes, Netsanet turned to HaqCheck, an Ethiopia-based organization set up four years ago. 'Fake information is causing great damage to organizations and the country. The methods people use have also gone from spreading simple rumors to using advanced technology such as deep fake or AI. So it was important I understand what tools are available to counter them,' Netsanet said. Since its launch, HaqCheck has identified and debunked thousands of misleading posts shared on social media and has made it easier for the public to verify information, said Kirubel Tesfaye, lead fact-checker at HaqCheck. It also offers training. 'It wasn't until I joined HaqCheck that I began to understand the darker side of social media,' Kirubel said. 'I'm constantly shocked by the lengths people will go to to disseminate false information.' Much of the misinformation Kirubel and his team deal with involves internal conflicts, border disputes, and the diplomatic tension between Ethiopia and Somalia over a port deal with Somaliland. 'We also find the prime minister's and government officials' various speeches are frequently manipulated,' Kirubel said. Dangers of disinformation Most of the disinformation is circulated on social media. Facebook, TikTok and the Telegram messaging apps are all popular in Ethiopia. But some platforms have been criticized for posts that stoke tensions. A 2023 Amnesty International report alleges that Meta, Facebook's parent company, contributed to human rights abuses against the Tigrayan community in Ethiopia. The report said Facebook’s algorithms 'supercharged the spread of harmful rhetoric' and that content moderation systems failed to prevent that spread. Noting that Facebook is widely used in Ethiopia and 'considered a trustworthy news source,' Amnesty said that its 'algorithms fueled devastating human rights impacts' on Tigrayans. Prior to the conflict in Tigray, Facebook in November 2021 announced that Ethiopia was in its highest-risk category for violence, and that it had developed technology to identify hate speech in Ethiopia's four most spoken languages. The following year, two British digital research companies found that Facebook was still approving posts containing hate speech during the conflict. The U.N.’s then-special adviser on the prevention of genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, noted similar findings in her 2022 reports. Meta does have systems in place to try to address such concerns. But in the U.S., some of those methods are being rolled back. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced a change in policy to end content moderation — its third-party fact-checking program — in the U.S. 'The fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the U.S.,' Zuckerberg said in a January 7 video. 'So, over the next couple of months, we are going to phase in a more comprehensive community notes system.' In his message, Zuckerberg said the platform, which globally has 2.9 billion monthly users, plans to change its content policies. Zuckerberg in August said the Biden administration had 'pressured' his company to censor posts about the coronavirus pandemic. Misinformation alerts were added to Facebook and Instagram posts that contained disinformation about the pandemic or vaccines. And some posts critical of the vaccines were deleted. Contacted by VOA’s Horn of Africa Service, Meta said it was making changes in the U.S. first and would improve its systems 'before expansion to other countries.' 'There are no changes in other countries at this time, and before rolling out any changes to our fact-checking program outside of the U.S., we will carefully consider our obligations,' Meta said. Fact-checker tool kit Back in Ethiopia, HaqCheck fact-checkers rely on several digital tools to verify information, including reverse image search. CrowdTangle was one such tool, helping the team analyze public content on social media. Meta shut down the tool in August, saying it didn't provide a complete picture of what was happening on its platform. 'It was a powerful tool that helped us monitor Facebook, Instagram and Reddit,' said Kirubel of HaqCheck. 'Now we've reverted to manual monitoring, using keywords.' The team employs other tools, too, including InVid, which can help researchers identify when an image was first shared, and whether or even where it was manipulated. Beyond debunking false information, the group trains journalists, communication experts and academics. Netsanet said that this work carries special significance in countries like Ethiopia. 'False information can turn ethnic groups that lived in harmony against each other and threaten national security,' he said. 'The spread of misinformation also worsens conflicts. So, fact-checking means protecting a country from all that.' To ensure it reaches as wide an audience as possible, HaqCheck publishes verified articles on its website, social media and local TV stations.

Trump's FBI chief pick, Kash Patel, says bureau has lost trust which he will restore	Washington — Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FBI, portrayed himself Thursday as the right leader of a law enforcement agency he said had lost public trust and told senators he would commit himself to 'due process and transparency' if confirmed as director. At his confirmation hearing, Patel braced for deeply skeptical questioning from Senate Democrats about his loyalty to the president and stated desire to overhaul the bureau. He is a Trump loyalist who, before being nominated to lead the FBI, railed against the bureau over its investigations into the president and said that Jan. 6 rioters were mistreated by the Justice Department. Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the FBI is critical in keeping America safe from terrorism, violent crime and other threats, and the nation 'needs an FBI director who understands the gravity of this mission and is ready on day one, not someone who is consumed by his own personal political grievances.' Patel was picked in November to replace Christopher Wray, who led the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency for more than seven years but was forced out of the job Trump had appointed him to after being seen as insufficiently loyal to him. A former aide to the House Intelligence Committee and an ex-federal prosecutor who served in Trump's first administration, Patel has alarmed critics with rhetoric — in dozens of podcasts and books he has authored — in which he has demonstrated fealty to Trump and assailed the decision-making of the agency he's now been asked to lead. He's also identified by name officials he believes should be investigated. In one such podcast interview last year, he said that if he oversaw the FBI, he would 'shut down' the bureau’s headquarters building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington and 'reopen it the next day as a museum of the ‘deep state.’' 'And I’d take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to go chase down criminals. Go be cops,' he added. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece published Wednesday night, Patel did not address some of his more incendiary comments or criticism of the FBI, except to say that his time as a House staffer investigating flaws in the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation had shown him how 'the FBI’s immense powers can be abused.' 'I spearheaded the investigation that found the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — a tool I had previously used to hunt down terrorists — had been unlawfully used to spy on political opponents,' he wrote. 'Such misconduct is unacceptable and undermines public trust.' Patel pledged to be transparent if confirmed as director and said he would keep the FBI out of prosecutorial decisions, keeping them instead with Justice Department lawyers. 'First, let good cops be cops,' Patel wrote in outlining his priorities. 'Leadership means supporting agents in their mission to apprehend criminals and protect our citizens. If confirmed, I will focus on streamlining operations at headquarters while bolstering the presence of field agents across the nation. Collaboration with local law enforcement is crucial to fulfilling the FBI’s mission.' Patel found common cause with Trump over their shared skepticism of government surveillance and the 'deep state' — a pejorative catchall used by Trump to refer to government bureaucracy. He was part of a small group of supporters during Trump’s recent criminal trial in New York who accompanied him to the courthouse, where he told reporters that Trump was the victim of an 'unconstitutional circus.' That close bond would depart from the modern-day precedent of FBI directors looking to keep presidents at arm’s length. Several Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee who have met with Patel, including Durbin of Illinois, have issued statements sounding the alarm and signaling their opposition to the pick. The lawmakers foreshadowed their interest in Patel by directing numerous questions about him to Pam Bondi, Trump's pick for attorney general, when she had her own confirmation hearing this month. Republican allies of Trump, who share the president's belief that the FBI has become politicized, have rallied around Patel and pledged to support him, seeing him as someone who can shake up the bureau and provide needed change. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the committee, sought to blunt attacks on Patel preemptively by focusing on the need to reform an FBI that he said had become weaponized. The FBI in recent years has become entangled in numerous politically explosive investigations, including not just the two federal inquiries into Trump that resulted in indictments but also probes of President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. 'It’s no surprise that public trust has declined in an institution that has been plagued by abuse, a lack of transparency, and the weaponization of law enforcement,' Grassley said. 'Nevertheless, the FBI remains an important, even indispensable institution for law and order in our country.' He later added: 'Mr. Patel, should you be confirmed, you will take charge of an FBI that is in crisis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-fbi-chief-pick-kash-patel-says-bureau-has-lost-trust-which-he-will-restore/7957029.html	2025-01-30T09:01:01-08:00	
South African, Rwandan leaders in war of words over DR Congo	Johannesburg — Rwandan President Paul Kagame has lashed out at South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa, after Ramaphosa accused Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels behind the escalating crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo this week. Kagame has accused Ramaphosa of 'lying' and warned of possible 'confrontation.' South Africa has troops deployed in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo as part of a U.N. peacekeeping mission there, as well as in a separate deployment by the Southern African Development Community, or SADC, aimed at backing up Congolese forces fighting rebels. But Pretoria is under pressure this week after 13 South African soldiers were killed in a recent surge in fighting that resulted in the M23 militia – which Rwanda is widely accused of backing – making a rapid advance and seizing partial control of the key city of Goma in North Kivu province on Sunday night. Ramaphosa said in a written statement on Wednesday that the M23, and what he called 'a Rwandan Defense Force militia,' were responsible for the casualties, while his minister of defense, Angie Motshekga, went one step further. 'It’s just that at that stage, when they were firing above our heads, the president did warn them to say, ‘If you are going to fire, we’ll take it as a declaration of war.’' The remarks by Ramaphosa and Motshekga have caused a diplomatic spat with Kigali. Kagame verbally hit back in an angry statement posted to his social media on Wednesday night, saying the Rwandan Defense Force was not a militia and quote, 'if South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day.' He also disputed Ramaphosa’s statement that the dead South African soldiers were 'peacekeepers,' saying the SADC force was engaged in 'offensive combat operations.' 'I spoke with the president of South Africa, who sought me out to speak with me, on this matter, because of their involvement in eastern Congo, and he’s also there pretending to be playing a peacemaker role. M23 are not Rwandans, please, and South Africa dares even issue threats,' he said. South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola has directly blamed Rwanda for backing the M23, saying reports by U.N. experts proved Kigali’s involvement. He said on Wednesday that South Africa had taken part in an African Union meeting on the crisis. 'As South Africa, we participated in that platform and put our position across, which is that there is a ceasefire, immediate cessation of hostilities… and, also, to request all the forces that are supporting M23, to also cease all support immediately,' he said. Mineral-rich eastern Congo, which borders Rwanda, has been plagued by conflict for more than three decades. The current fighting stems partly from the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The perpetrators fled across the border to North Kivu, and Rwanda says they now represent a security threat to its territory. The Congolese government has accused Kigali of being active in eastern Congo, saying Kigali is after the area’s vast mineral wealth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-african-rwandan-leaders-in-war-of-words-over-dr-congo/7957006.html	2025-01-30T08:49:25-08:00	
UN mission in DR Congo under scrutiny as conflict escalates	NAIROBI, KENYA — Seventeen U.N. peacekeepers have been killed this year in clashes between M23 rebels and government forces in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, including three within the last week, the U.N. reported Wednesday. The three peacekeepers — one from Uruguay and two from South Africa — were killed over the weekend in the fighting around Goma. More than 300 U.N. peacekeepers have been killed since the mission in Congo was deployed in 1999. The deaths have renewed questions about the future of the U.N. mission, known as MONUSCO. The Congolese government requested the mission’s withdrawal last year, citing its failure to prevent attacks by the many armed groups in eastern Congo. Philippe Undji, a member of parliament from South Kivu province and a member of the AFDC party, which is allied with President Felix Tshisekedi's ruling party, said the government is waiting to see how the United Nations handles this latest conflict. 'I think the U.N. peacekeepers have helped to protect the civilians, but it's not enough,' Undji said. 'We are watching the United Nations meeting in the U.S. over this matter, and the decision they are going to make will tell us whether they like Africa and DR Congo. We are telling them we are watching their next move.' Undji said he wants to see action taken against Rwanda, which Congo, the U.N. secretary-general and other observers accuse of supporting M23. Kigali denies the allegation. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has said the conflict is a Congolese internal problem and has accused Kinshasa of supporting rebel groups that want to interfere with his country's security. International relations and diplomacy expert Kizito Sabala said the violence and tension will increase pressure on the U.N. mission to withdraw. 'I think the calls for its withdrawal will intensify, and it's going to convince everyone that MONUSCO’s time in DRC is long overdue,' Sabala said. 'They need to leave.' Addressing the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, Vivian van de Perre, the deputy special representative for protection and operations in MONUSCO, said the mission remains important in addressing the conflict and humanitarian situation. 'Despite the significant challenges, MONUSCO continues to play a vital role in this crisis in eastern DRC and has proven to be a beacon for myriad vulnerable groups seeking protection,' van de Perre said. 'However, the mission is challenged in ensuring safety of its staff and premises, which has been severely impacted heavily by direct and indirect fire used in these last few days, and to address the logistical, human rights and humanitarian challenges we are all facing to ensure the mission's continued effectiveness,' she said. The peacekeepers are mandated to protect civilians and humanitarian workers and support the Congolese government's stabilization and peace efforts. Sabala said, 'We always see there is a conflict going on, and I think they owe the international community and the region an explanation for why this is happening. Is it about their mandate, their facilities, or the equipment? Because I think that explanation will help the region and the international community see how best to address the problem in DRC.' Experts warn that M23’s capture of Goma could start another extended period of instability and, in the worst scenario, a third Congo war. The previous conflicts, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, caused widespread destruction, displacement and food shortages, leading to the deaths of several million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-mission-in-drc-under-scrutiny-as-conflict-escalates/7956989.html	2025-01-30T08:44:23-08:00	
Economic hardship affects Lunar New Year celebrations in China	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — The Lunar New Year, also called the Chinese New Year or the Spring Festival in China, is traditionally celebrated with tables piled with food and red envelopes filled with cash for children. In past years, smoke from outdoor fire pits filled the air throughout the morning and afternoon, as people burned paper money to ensure that even the ancestors can feel the financial boon that the biggest holiday of the year usually brings to the living. In recent years, however, China’s economic slowdown has altered the atmosphere of Chinese New Year. Facing increasing financial burdens, young people are reexamining long-held traditions as they welcome the Year of the Snake, opting for more frugal alternatives during this year’s eight-day-long national holiday. A 30-year-old legal worker from Shanghai, who did not want to use his name for fear of reprisal, told VOA that stores selling trinkets and supplies for the holiday appeared unusually deserted. He said people appear to be forgoing large purchases, which manifests mostly in the custom of giving money-filled red envelopes — the color symbolizes good luck and prosperity in the new year. 'As with goods purchased for the new year, red envelopes have become more simple and less thick,' the Shanghai resident said. He told VOA he usually gives his niece an envelope with around $140 inside, but this year, he plans to give her $90. Talk on social media Frustration with the economy is being expressed on social media — young people are saturating online threads with images and comments describing the pressure and criticism they will encounter during the holiday. An account on RedNote called 'I don’t give a damn about the banana' posted a series of funny images detailing the levels of anxiety young, unmarried and unemployed people will face during the holiday. 'You haven’t earned any money but you still have to give the younger kids a red envelope,' the user wrote, over a picture of a woman giving a small bill to a cat. Many others offer advice to ease fears of being scrutinized by the family. 'Unique-me' wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo: 'Now the economy is not good, it's good to just have an income. If you are in a difficult situation, you can admit that you don't make much. There is no need to be generous. Just show your appreciation. Those who have opinions about you because of the size of your red envelope, let them have opinions.' Faced with economic woes, some local governments are advocating frugality. Baise City, Guangxi, suggested that the amount of money in a red envelope should not exceed $3. The initiative also encourages the younger generation to give their elders 'blessing gifts' with commemorative significance or emotional value instead of red envelopes. This move has attracted widespread attention, with many social media users expressing their support for the program’s positive impact on financial and mental health. Some suggested that blessing gifting be promoted nationwide. Workplace anxiety The size of red envelopes exchanged in the workplace and increasing leniency on new year vacation day allowances have stoked fears of job insecurity among employees. 'The economic downturn is not only reflected in my meager salary, but also in the red envelopes given by the boss every year,' 'Life with Greed' said on Weibo. A user called 'Let’s try to be happy' commented on Weibo: 'My company is in a slump. New Year gifts have not been issued. In previous years, the maximum New Year holiday was 20 days, but this year it was more than a month. I don't know what it will be like next year. It feels like it is on the verge of bankruptcy.' A 39-year-old government worker in Dalian, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity because of security fears, said despite having a family and a stable job, she will limit her holiday spending. 'We have to reduce some unnecessary expenses, such as buying less candy and snacks, and we try to buy simple things outside when worshiping,' the wife and mother said. The changes in Chinese Spring Festival customs are affected by many factors, but the economy is most critical, said Sun Guoxiang, a professor in the international affairs and business department at Nanhua University in Taiwan. 'The economic downturn has led to a decline in consumption capacity. Young people pay more attention to rational consumption and actual needs, which reduces the relatively high-cost parts of traditional Spring Festival customs,' Sun said, adding that pressure from family about issues that include work, marriage and education cannot be ignored as drivers of this trend. He said the future of Chinese New Year and how it will be celebrated will depend heavily on China’s development and whether the country can overcome its current economic decline.	https://www.voanews.com/a/economic-hardship-affects-lunar-new-year-celebrations-in-china/7956877.html	2025-01-30T07:04:32-08:00

Uganda confirms Ebola outbreak in capital Kampala, one dead	Kampala, Uganda — Uganda has confirmed an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the capital Kampala, with the first confirmed patient dying from the disease on Wednesday, the health ministry said on Thursday. The patient, a nurse at the Mulago referral hospital in the capital, had initially sought treatment at various facilities, including Mulago after developing fever-like symptoms. 'The patient experienced multi-organ failure and succumbed to the illness at Mulago National Referral Hospital on Jan 29. Post-mortem samples confirmed Sudan Ebola Virus Disease (strain),' the ministry said. The highly infectious hemorrhagic fever is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissue. Symptoms include headache, vomiting blood, muscle pains and bleeding. Uganda last suffered an outbreak in late 2022 and that outbreak was declared over on Jan. 11, 2023, after nearly four months in which it struggled to contain the viral infection. The last outbreak killed 55 of the 143 people infected and the dead included six health workers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-confirms-ebola-outbreak-in-capital-kampala-one-dead/7956782.html	2025-01-30T05:35:32-08:00	
Economists mixed on possible impacts of Trump’s tariff proposals	President Donald Trump is widely expected to impose tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada as early as February 1 as part of a plan he says will boost the U.S. economy.

Philippine president offers deal to China: Stop sea aggression and I'll return missiles to US	MANILA — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. offered on Thursday to remove a U.S. missile system from the Philippines if China halts what he called its 'aggressive and coercive behavior' in the disputed South China Sea. The U.S. Army installed the Typhon mid-range missile system in the northern Philippines in April last year to support what the longtime treaty allies described as training for joint combat readiness. China has repeatedly demanded that the Philippines remove the missile system, saying it was 'inciting geopolitical confrontation and an arms race.' Asked by reporters about China's criticism of the missile system, Marcos said he did not understand the Chinese position because the Philippines does not comment on China's missile systems which 'are a thousand times more powerful than what we have.' 'Let's make a deal with China: Stop claiming our territory, stop harassing our fishermen and let them have a living, stop ramming our boats, stop water cannoning our people, stop firing lasers at us and stop your aggressive and coercive behavior, and we'll return the typhoon missiles,' Marcos told reporters in central Cebu province. 'Let them stop everything they're doing and I'll return all of those,' he said. Chinese officials did not immediately comment on the Philippine leader's remarks. The U.S. Army's mobile Typhon missile system, which consists of a launcher and at least 16 Standard Missile-6 and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, was repositioned about two weeks ago from the northern Philippines to a strategic area nearer the capital, Manila, in consultation with Philippine defense officials, a senior Philippine official told The Associated Press. The Philippine official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive issue in public, said the U.S. missile system is now nearer an area where Chinese and Philippine coast guard and navy forces have been involved in increasingly tense faceoffs in the South China Sea. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which puts parts of mainland China within their range. The missile system will remain in the Philippines indefinitely, the Philippine official said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said last week that the Philippines is 'creating tensions and antagonism in the region and inciting geopolitical confrontation and an arms race' by allowing the U.S. missile system to be positioned in its territory. 'This is a highly dangerous move and an extremely irresponsible choice,' Mao said. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro has rejected China's demand that the missile system be removed as interference in Philippine internal affairs. The U.S. and the Philippines have repeatedly condemned China's increasingly assertive actions to press its territorial claims in the South China Sea, where hostilities have flared over the past two years with repeated clashes between Chinese and Philippine coast guard forces and accompanying vessels. Aside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims in the busy waterway, a key shipping route which is also believed to be sitting atop large undersea deposits of gas and oil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-president-offers-deal-to-china-stop-sea-aggression-and-i-ll-return-missiles-to-us/7956717.html	2025-01-30T04:31:44-08:00	
EU vows 'action plan' for beleaguered auto sector	Brussels, Belgium — The EU promised Thursday an 'action plan' to help the bloc's beleaguered auto sector, as it held talks with industry leaders who have sounded the alarm over emissions fines and Chinese competition. The European Union is under pressure to help a sector that employs 13 million people and accounts for about seven percent of the bloc's GDP, as it seeks to revamp the continent's lagging competitiveness. 'The European automotive industry is at a pivotal moment, and we acknowledge the challenges it faces. That is why we are acting swiftly to address them,' EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said, promising an 'action plan' by early March. Chaired by the European Commission president, the so-called 'strategic dialogue' brought together carmakers, suppliers, civil society groups and trade unions. Representatives of 22 industry 'players' including Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes and Renault, were in attendance, the commission said. The get-together comes as the commission embarks on a pro-business shift, with firms complaining its focus on climate and business ethics has resulted in excessive regulations. On Wednesday, it unveiled a blueprint to revamp the bloc's economic model, amid worries that low productivity, high energy prices, weak investments and other ills are leaving the EU behind the United States and China. The car industry has been plunged into crisis by high manufacturing costs, a stuttering switch to electric vehicles (EV) and increased competition from China. Announcements of possible job cuts have multiplied. Volkswagen plans to axe 35,000 positions across its German locations by 2030. Emissions fines Carmakers have been calling for 'flexibility' on the steep emission fines they could face in 2025 -- something the bloc's new growth blueprint said should be in the cards. 'Penalizing immediately the industry, financially, is not a good idea, because the industry is in trouble and... has to restructure itself, which will cost a lot of money,' Patrick Koller, CEO of French parts producer Forvia, said ahead of the meeting. 'When you look back, we have heavy industries which disappeared from Europe completely, because of lack of competitiveness.' To combat climate change, the EU introduced a set of emission-reduction targets that should lead to the sale of fossil-fuel-burning cars, being phased out by 2035. About 16 percent of the planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) gas released into the atmosphere in Europe comes from cars' exhaust pipes, the EU says. As of this year, carmakers have to lower the average CO2 emitted by all newly sold vehicles by 15 percent from 2021 levels, or pay a penalty -- with tougher cuts further down the road, according to advocacy group Transport & Environment. The idea is to incentivize firms to increase the share of EVs, hybrids and small vehicles they sell compared to, for instance, diesel-guzzling SUVs. But some manufacturers complain that is proving harder than expected as consumers have yet to warm to EVs, which have higher upfront costs and lack an established used-vehicle market. 'We want to stick to the objective... but we can smoothen the way,' von der Leyen said on Wednesday. Critics say lifting the fines would unfairly penalize producers who have invested to comply and remove a key incentive to speed up electric transitions. Sales and tariffs EV sales slid 1.3 percent in Europe last year, accounting for 13.6 percent of all sales, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), an industry group. A senior EU official said incentives for businesses to buy electric are an option. 'Company fleets' account for more than half of new cars purchased in Europe, the official said. The 27-nation bloc could also seek to improve a patchy charging network, modernize grids to allow for faster charging, bring down energy costs, cut regulations and loosen China's grip on battery production, analysts say. Meanwhile, the market share of Chinese electric cars has ballooned in the EU, to reach 14 percent in the second quarter of 2024. Brussels has imposed extra import tariffs on China-made electric vehicles of up to 35.3 percent after concluding Beijing's state support was unfairly undercutting European automakers. The move was opposed by Germany and other EU members, and it is the object of a lawsuit by BMW, Tesla and several Chinese automakers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-vows-action-plan-for-beleaguered-auto-sector-/7956667.html	2025-01-30T04:07:01-08:00	
Rwanda's Kagame slams criticism of east Congo offensive as rebels push south	GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — President Paul Kagame said Rwanda was ready for 'confrontation' as he rejected criticism over his backing for M23 rebels who were pushing south on Thursday in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo after capturing the major city of Goma. M23 rebels, with support from Rwandan troops, marched into Goma this week and are now advancing toward Bukavu, capital of neighboring South Kivu province, in the biggest escalation since 2012 of a decades-old conflict. Rwanda is facing an international backlash over its actions in eastern Congo, where it has repeatedly intervened either directly or through allied militias over the past 30 years in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. But the chorus of condemnation, which has included Germany canceling aid talks with Rwanda and Britain threatening to withhold $40 million of annual bilateral assistance, was having no apparent effect on the ground. After seizing Goma, a lakeside city of nearly 2 million and a major hub for displaced people and aid groups, M23 fighters were advancing south from the town of Minova, along the western side of Lake Kivu. They tried to take the town of Nyabibwe, about 50 km north of Bukavu, on Wednesday but were pushed back by Congolese forces, a local resident told Reuters by phone. A civil society source in Bukavu, who has contacts around the region, said clashes were ongoing on Thursday morning in a location known as Kahalala, about 20 km away from Nyabibwe. 'The Congolese army seems to be putting up fierce resistance there,' the source said. In the latest diplomatic initiative, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot arrived on Thursday in Congo's capital Kinshasa, more than 1,600 km west of Goma. He was due to meet President Felix Tshisekedi, the Congolese presidency said. Barrot's visit comes two days after Congolese protesters in Kinshasa attacked the French embassy and several other foreign missions over their perceived support for Rwanda. Any successful push south by M23 would see them control territory previous rebellions have not taken since the end of two major wars that ran from 1996 to 2003, and magnify the risk of an all-out conflict that draws in regional countries. Troops from neighboring Burundi, which has had hostile relations with Rwanda, support Congolese troops in South Kivu. A spokesperson for Burundi's military declined to comment on the current situation in Congo. In Goma itself, where M23 say they plan to administer the city and appear to be settling in for a lengthy period of control, the border with Rwanda, which is close to the city center, was re-opened under M23 control, its spokesperson said. Kagame accuses South Africa Kagame responded angrily on X to a post by President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, 13 of whose soldiers have been killed in eastern Congo since last week. Ramaphosa attributed the fighting to an escalation by the M23 and the Rwandan army. Kagame accused South African forces of working alongside a militia in Congo with ties to perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide and 'threatening to take the war to Rwanda itself.' 'If South Africa wants to contribute to peaceful solutions, that is well and good, but South Africa is in no position to take on the role of a peacemaker or mediator,' Kagame wrote. 'And if South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day.' Since the fall of Goma, Rwanda has also reacted angrily to calls for restraint from Western nations, accusing its critics of 'victim-blaming' and turning a blind eye to what it says is Congo's complicity in the slaughter of Tutsis. Congo rejects Rwanda's accusations, saying Kigali's true motive for involvement in its eastern provinces is to use its proxy militias to control lucrative mineral mines. U.N. experts have documented the export of large quantities of looted Congolese minerals via Rwanda. M23 is the latest ethnic Tutsi-led insurgency backed by Rwanda to fight in Congo since the 1994 genocide, when extremist Hutus killed about a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and were then toppled by Tutsi forces led by Kagame, who has been Rwanda's president ever since. About a million Hutus, some refugees and some genocide perpetrators, fled into eastern Congo in the aftermath of the genocide, and Rwanda accuses Congo of harboring Hutu-led militias bent on killing Tutsis and threatening Rwanda itself. The eight-member East African Community, to which Rwanda and Congo both belong, held a virtual summit late on Wednesday to discuss the crisis. The final communique largely embraced Rwanda's position. It called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict through direct talks between Congo and armed groups. Congo rejects direct negotiations with the M23, which it considers a terrorist group. The EAC also recommended a joint summit to discuss the crisis with the Southern African Development Community. SADC member Angola, which has led the most recent efforts to broker a peace deal but is also a firm ally of Congo, called on Rwanda to withdraw its forces shortly after hosting Tshisekedi for talks in Luanda on Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-s-kagame-slams-criticism-of-east-congo-offensive-as-rebels-push-south/7956645.html	2025-01-30T03:31:19-08:00	
UN rights chief seeks $500 million in 2025, warning that lives are at risk	GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief appealed on Thursday for $500 million in funding for 2025 to support its work, such as investigating human rights abuses around the world from Syria to Sudan, warning that lives hang in the balance. The U.N. human rights office has been grappling with chronic funding shortages that some worry could be exacerbated by cuts to U.S. foreign aid by President Donald Trump. The annual appeal is for funds beyond the allocated U.N. funds from member states' fees, which make up just a fraction of the office's needs. 'In 2025, we expect no let-up in major challenges to human rights,' High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk told member states in a speech at the U.N. in Geneva. 'I am very concerned that if we do not reach our funding targets in 2025, we will leave people ... to struggle and possibly fail, without adequate support,' he said. He said any shortfall would mean more people remain in illegal detention; that governments are allowed to continue with discriminatory policies; violations may go undocumented; and human rights defenders could lose protection. 'In short, lives are at stake,' Turk said. The human rights office gets about 5% of the regular U.N. budget, but the majority of its funding comes voluntarily in response to its annual appeal announced on Thursday. Western states give the most, with the United States donating $35 million last year or about 15% of the total received in 2024, followed by the European Commission, U.N. data showed. Still, the office received only about half of the $500 million it sought last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-chief-seeks-500-million-in-2025-warning-that-lives-are-at-risk/7956627.html	2025-01-30T03:03:16-08:00	
Senate panel to question director of national intelligence nominee Gabbard	The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee is set to question former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as she seeks confirmation to become the nation’s director of national intelligence. Gabbard is expected to face questions about her 2017 visit to Syria, when during her time in Congress she met with then-President Bashar al-Assad. At the time she faced criticism for what opponents of the trip said was legitimizing Assad amid the Syrian civil war. The military veteran, who ran for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2020 presidential election, was a critic of the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine, including questioning sending aid for Ukrainian troops instead of using resources for domestic issues. 'This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns,' Gabbard said as Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In announcing her nomination, U.S. President Donald Trump said Gabbard would 'bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and security Peace through Strength.' If approved by a simple majority in the Senate, Gabbard would oversee 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. Trump’s Republican Party holds a 53-47 Senate majority. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7956608.html	2025-01-30T02:38:04-08:00	
NATO, EU on high alert as undersea cable attacks escalate in Baltic	As authorities investigate the fourth Baltic Sea cable-cutting incident in recent months, European leaders have expressed concern about the frequency of attacks involving civilian vessels and critical civilian infrastructure. The Vezhen, a Bulgarian-owned vessel, was detained this week in the Baltic Sea, suspected of dragging its anchor across the seafloor, severing a data cable between Sweden and Latvia. Aleksander Kalchev, the CEO of the company that owns the Vezhen, denied that the damage was intentional. Nevertheless, Swedish security services have boarded the vessel for further investigation. Latvian Minister of Defense Andris Spruds, in a written response to VOA on Wednesday, confirmed that Latvia is working closely with Sweden and NATO to address the incident. 'Latvia’s Naval Forces' diving team has conducted an inspection at the damage site and collected evidence in cooperation with Swedish Coast Guard vessels,' Spruds told VOA. He emphasized that Latvia would deploy new technologies and continue working closely with NATO allies to enhance the protection of critical sea infrastructure. 'These sabotage actions will not be tolerated, and we will continue to enforce bold actions within the rule of law,' Spruds said. Growing pattern of attacks Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo, whose country launched a sabotage investigation into damage to the Estlink 2 undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia on Dec. 25, has emphasized the urgency of the situation. 'This cannot continue,' he told Finnish Lannen Media this week. He called for stronger coordination within the European Union to prevent further attacks. 'We must be on a common front in sanctions against Russia. That applies to every EU country,' he told a Finnish journalist. The government in Poland, another Baltic Sea country with more than 1,000 kilometers of coastline, has called for enhanced security measures. In an interview with VOA, Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said recent attacks on undersea cables — such as those between Latvia and Sweden, as well as Estonia and Finland — align with broader patterns of sabotage seen in the region. While investigations are ongoing, Poland views these incidents as deliberate actions, he said. 'Even if there is no direct evidence today, sabotage and provocations are part of Russia’s standard arsenal. ... We are at a point where we have to assume that this is a conscious, deliberate action,' he told VOA on Tuesday. Polish officials also emphasize the need for more coordinated maritime security measures. 'We want such policing missions to start taking place in the Baltic Sea. There is a lot of traffic when it comes to ships and vessels … and security is an absolutely fundamental issue here,' he told VOA. Given its strategic importance and the increasing presence of Russian naval activity, he said, NATO must prioritize the Baltic Sea as a critical security zone. 'The Baltic Sea has become an arena where all tricks are allowed,' Siemoniak said. Political and strategic motives While evidence is still being gathered, the geopolitical implications of these attacks are becoming clearer. Analysts believe the sabotage is not just an attempt to disrupt communication networks but also a calculated effort to test NATO’s response capabilities and sow discord among member states. Lawmakers in Finland, the newest member of NATO, have voiced concerns that these incidents may be part of a broader conflict that many Western governments are hesitant to acknowledge. 'If we don't know whether we're at war, it's always best to assume that we are,' Jussi Halla-aho, the speaker of the Finnish Parliament, said in an interview earlier this month in the Turku daily Turun Sanomat. Countering hybrid warfare A significant challenge for NATO and its allies is how to respond effectively to these incidents. Unlike conventional military aggression, these acts of sabotage involve civilian vessels and infrastructure, making direct retaliation difficult. 'If we openly accuse Russia or China of these attacks, the next logical question is: What are we going to do about it?' Matti Posio, a Finnish foreign policy expert and chief editor at Lannen Media Oy, told VOA in an interview. 'The reality is that options are limited, and that’s exactly what the perpetrators are counting on.' With tensions rising, NATO is considering additional measures to secure the Baltic Sea, officials and observers told VOA. One option includes increasing naval patrols and surveillance of key maritime routes. However, 'more drastic proposals — such as closing parts of the Gulf of Finland to Russian-linked vessels — remain politically sensitive and legally complex,' Posio said. Dilemma for NATO and EU Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen, who visited Latvia this week, issued a a statement with her Latvian counterpart. 'We are aware that Russia is a long-term threat to world peace and international order; therefore, NATO’s deterrence and defense measures must be further strengthened, while coordinating the Allied response to the intensifying threat posed by Russia,' their statement said. As tensions rise, NATO has launched Baltic Sentry 2025 to enhance security and resilience. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has emphasized the need for greater coordination in protecting critical infrastructure from sabotage. EU interior ministers will meet in Warsaw on Thursday. Among other topics, they will address growing concerns over sabotage targeting critical infrastructure in Europe. The ministers are expected to discuss potential countermeasures and coordination efforts to strengthen security and deterrence against future disruptions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-eu-on-high-alert-as-undersea-cable-attacks-escalate-in-baltic/7956600.html	2025-01-30T02:26:58-08:00	
Russian drone attack kills 4 in Sumy, Ukraine says	Ukrainian officials said Thursday a Russian drone attack killed at least four people in the northeastern city of Sumy. The regional state administration in Sumy said a drone hit a high-rise residential building, and that the attack also injured nine people. Ukraine’s military said it shot down 37 of the 81 drones that Russian forces launched overnight. Intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Poltava, Odesa, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, the military said. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged two residential buildings, a grain warehouse and a hospital. Officials in Zhytomyr said drone fragments damaged six houses. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it shot down three Ukrainian drones overnight in Belgorod and another two drones in Bryansk. US aid Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday he has received an initial report on 'critical programs' previously funded by American support that are now suspended. U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended funding of many foreign programs to conduct a 90-day audit of foreign aid. Zelenskyy said the key areas that have been affected by the frozen funds are the energy sector, veteran projects and border crossings. Ukrainian officials have been instructed to continue their own audit of areas affected by the frozen funds, Zelenskyy said. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-kills-4-in-sumy-ukraine-says/7956543.html	2025-01-30T00:37:24-08:00	
Microsoft, Meta CEOs defend hefty AI spending after DeepSeek stuns tech world	Days after Chinese upstart DeepSeek revealed a breakthrough in cheap AI computing that shook the U.S. technology industry, the chief executives of Microsoft and Meta defended massive spending that they said was key to staying competitive in the new field. DeepSeek's quick progress has stirred doubts about the lead America has in AI with models that it claims can match or even outperform Western rivals at a fraction of the cost, but the U.S. executives said on Wednesday that building huge computer networks was necessary to serve growing corporate needs. 'Investing 'very heavily' in capital expenditure and infrastructure is going to be a strategic advantage over time,' Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a post-earnings call. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, said the spending was needed to overcome the capacity constraints that have hampered the technology giant's ability to capitalize on AI. 'As AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand,' he said on a call with analysts. Microsoft has earmarked $80 billion for AI in its current fiscal year, while Meta has pledged as much as $65 billion towards the technology. That is a far cry from the roughly $6 million DeepSeek said it has spent to develop its AI model. U.S. tech executives and Wall Street analysts say that reflects the amount spent on computing power, rather than all development costs. Still, some investors seem to be losing patience with the hefty spending and lack of big payoffs. Shares of Microsoft — widely seen as a front runner in the AI race because of its tie to industry leader OpenAI - were down 5% in extended trading after the company said that growth in its Azure cloud business in the current quarter would fall short of estimates. 'We really want to start to see a clear road map to what that monetization model looks like for all of the capital that's been invested,' said Brian Mulberry, portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which holds shares in Microsoft. Meta, meanwhile, sent mixed signals about how its bets on AI-powered tools were paying off, with a strong fourth quarter but a lackluster sales forecast for the current period. 'With these huge expenses, they need to turn the spigot on in terms of revenue generated, but I think this week was a wake-up call for the U.S.' said Futurum Group analyst Daniel Newman. 'For AI right now, there's too much capital expenditure, not enough consumption.' There are some signs though that executives are moving to change that. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the company's capital spending in the current quarter and the next would remain around the $22.6 billion level seen in the second quarter. 'In fiscal 2026, we expect to continue to invest against strong demand signals. However, the growth rate will be lower than fiscal 2025 (which ends in June),' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/microsoft-meta-ceos-defend-hefty-ai-spending-after-deepseek-stuns-tech-world/7956542.html	2025-01-30T00:26:38-08:00

Israel, Hamas to carry out third exchange of hostages, prisoners under ceasefire	Israel and Hamas are set to carry out their third exchange of hostages and prisoners on Thursday as part of a ceasefire agreement that has halted fighting in the Gaza Strip. Hamas is due to release three Israelis and five Thai citizens. Israel is releasing 110 Palestinian prisoners. Previous exchanges have freed seven hostages the militants were holding in Gaza and 300 prisoners held by Israel. Hamas is due to release three additional hostages Saturday, with Israel freeing dozens more Palestinian prisoners. The first phase of the ceasefire lasts for 42 days, about one-quarter of which has passed. It calls for the release of 33 total hostages from Gaza, as well as negotiations on the details of the second phase involving the release of the rest of the hostages, an end to the conflict and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Those negotiations are due to begin next week. U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to reinforce the ceasefire. Witkoff, who played a key role in shaping the six-week truce, also inspected the Netzarim Corridor, a 6-kilometer-wide strip of land that bisects Gaza, where American security contractors have been hired to help oversee the return of displaced Palestinians. Witkoff was the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Gaza in years. American officials have stayed away from the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea because of security concerns and Washington’s no-contact policy with Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. Netanyahu is headed to Washington this weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump has invited him for talks at the White House on Tuesday, his first meeting with a foreign leader since starting his second term in office. Meanwhile during the ceasefire in Gaza, Israel has ramped up its military operations in the occupied West Bank. Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a visit to the city of Jenin on Wednesday that Israel has 'declared war on Palestinian terrorism in Judea and Samaria,' referring to the West Bank. 'The Jenin refugee camp will not return to what it was,' he said. 'After the operation is completed, the [Israel Defense Forces] will remain in the camp to ensure that terrorism does not return.' Palestinians in Gaza have been allowed back into some areas long held off-limits by Israeli troops, including northern Gaza, where the United Nations said Wednesday more than 423,000 people have returned this week. On orders from Israel, about 1 million people fled the area in the early days of the war, and those returning are going back to an area that has been decimated by Israeli military operations against Hamas. The war in Gaza started with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 47,400 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials. The Israeli military said the death toll includes 17,000 militants. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-hamas-to-carry-out-third-exchange-of-hostages-prisoners-under-ceasefire/7956514.html	2025-01-29T22:18:57-08:00	
State Department says Trump froze foreign aid to 'root out waste'	WASHINGTON — The State Department on Wednesday sought to clarify President Donald Trump's order to freeze and review foreign development aid after the top U.S. diplomat blunted some of the chaos that ensued with an emergency order that could shield the world's largest HIV program from the 90-day funding freeze. At the White House, Trump said his pauses to foreign and domestic funding are part of his administration's effort to root out 'tremendous waste and fraud and abuse.' Secretary of State Marco Rubio's late-Tuesday waiver exempts humanitarian aid, which he classifies as 'life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.' The United Nations' AIDS program welcomed the news, emphasizing the value of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which serves 20 million people in 55 countries. 'UNAIDS welcomes this waiver from the U.S. government, which ensures that millions of people living with HIV can continue to receive life-saving HIV medication during the assessment of U.S. foreign development assistance,' said Executive Director Winnie Byanyima. 'This urgent decision recognizes PEPFAR's critical role in the AIDS response and restores hope to people living with HIV.' 'Blocking woke programs' In a Wednesday memo sent to journalists, the State Department explained its rationale for the freeze during the review and lauded early cost cuts, saying that 'even at this early stage, over $1,000,000,000 in spending not aligned with an America First agenda has been prevented.' The U.S. spent about $70 billion in foreign aid in fiscal year 2023, the most recent data available. 'We are rooting out waste,' the memo said. 'We are blocking woke programs. And we are exposing activities that run contrary to our national interests. None of this would be possible if these programs remained on autopilot.' The president, who said Wednesday at the White House that he 'could stand here all day' and give examples of wasted fraud and abuse in the U.S. government, highlighted a few. 'We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas,' he said. 'Fifty million. And you know what's happened to them? They've used them as a method of making bombs. How about that?' The State Department echoed this, saying in a statement, 'Without the pause, U.S. taxpayers would have provided condoms [and other contraceptive services] in Gaza, climate justice marketing services in Gabon, clean energy programs for women in Fiji, gender development programs in D.C., family planning throughout Latin America, sex education and pro-abortion programs for young girls globally, and much more. These types of programs do not make America stronger, safer or more prosperous.' A day earlier, the State Department sent a memo citing examples of unworthy projects, including $102 million to fund humanitarian aid nonprofit International Medical Corps' work in war-battered Gaza. A USAID report says the agency delivered about $7 million worth of male condoms and about $1 million in female condoms in the 2023 fiscal year. In total, the agency said it disbursed nearly 138 million male condoms and 1.7 million female condoms worldwide. Under USAID, the main administrator for U.S. foreign development funds, the bulk of contraceptive items were delivered to African countries, according to the report. Jordan was the only country in the Middle East to receive a shipment, which consisted of injectable and oral contraceptives valued at $45,680. 'Dramatic overreach' At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers not only affirmed the need for accountability but also emphasized that Congress, not the White House, decides how U.S. taxpayer money is spent. 'I think it's appropriate to have a review,' said Senator Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican. 'It would be my hope, however, that the aid can be reinstated and flow to Ukraine,' Cramer said. 'And then we'll see in the next appropriation cycle whether or not Congress still has the will to continue that aid.' 'This is dramatic overreach by the White House, by the president,' said Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Democrat. 'It's unprecedented, uncalled for. This is money that we have appropriated in our role as members of the Senate and the House.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-department-says-trump-froze-foreign-aid-to-root-out-waste-/7956412.html	2025-01-29T21:31:11-08:00

Former rebel leader is Syria’s new interim president	A former rebel leader who helped defeat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last month was named interim president of the country Wednesday. Commanders of military factions that toppled the former regime named Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has served as the de facto head of government since the fall of Assad, as president during the formation of a new government. Al-Sharra, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, is facing the daunting task of forming a temporary legislative council for the transitional period, as the previous parliament has been dissolved. Syria’s constitution has also been annulled and a new charter will be adopted. No timeline for the creation of a new parliament and Constitution has been announced. Al-Sharra is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, that spearheaded the campaign in December to take control of Damascus. Assad fled to Russia, ending more than half a century of oppressive rule by Bashar and his late father, Hafez. At one point, the U.S. had placed a $10 million bounty on al-Sharra, the new interim president, according to the Associated Press. The bounty was removed recently after a U.S. delegation met him in Damascus. Barbara Leaf, a top U.S. diplomat in the Middle East described al-Sharra as 'pragmatic,' after meeting him, AP reported. In a video released after the meeting with the Syrian factions, al-Sharaa said one of his top priorities in the new position will be filling 'in a legitimate and legal way' Syria’s vacuum in government. Another priority, he said, will be 'maintaining civil peace by seeking transitional justice and preventing revenge attacks' due to Assad’s reign. Syrians took to the streets of Damascus, the capital, to celebrate the announcement of al-Sharaa's appointment. One of those celebrating was Abdallah al-Sweid who told AP that the new president 'is someone who is intelligent and has a good understanding and he was the leader of the battle that freed Syria.' Al-Sharra 'is someone who deserves to be president,' al-Sweid said. However, Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics sees al-Sharra's appointment differently. He told Reuters that the declaration of the interim president’s appointment 'formalized' al-Sharra's 'status as the strongman ruler.' Gerges said, 'My take is that HTS and Sharaa intend to consolidate single-party Islamist rule.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-rebel-leader-is-syria-s-new-interim-president/7956463.html	2025-01-29T19:27:22-08:00

Regional jet collides with helicopter near Washington's Reagan Airport	Washington — The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday night that a PSA Airlines regional jet collided midair with a Sikorsky H-60 helicopter while on approach to Reagan Washington National Airport. PSA was operating Flight 5342 for American Airlines, which had departed from Wichita, Kansas, according to the FAA. According to American Airlines' website, the jet has a capacity for up to 65 passengers. Police said multiple agencies were involved in a search and rescue operation in the Potomac River, which borders the airport but that there was no immediate word on casualties. The airport said late on Wednesday that all takeoffs and landings had been halted emergency personnel responded to an aircraft incident. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was gathering more information on the incident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/regional-jet-collides-with-helicopter-near-washington-s-reagan-airport/7956456.html	2025-01-29T19:13:47-08:00	
US Federal Reserve holds rates steady, sees inflation as 'elevated'	WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged Wednesday after cutting it three times in a row last year, a sign of a more cautious approach as the Fed seeks to gauge where inflation is headed and what policies President Donald Trump may pursue. In a statement, the Fed said the job market is 'solid,' and noted that the unemployment rate 'has stabilized at a low level in recent months.' The Fed also appeared to toughen its assessment of inflation, saying that it 'remains somewhat elevated.' Both a healthier job market and more stubborn inflation typically would imply fewer Fed rate cuts in the coming months. In a news conference Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell largely deflected questions about recent comments from Trump, including one from last week, when the president said he would lower oil prices and then 'demand' lower rates. He also said he would speak with Powell about it. 'I'm not going to have any response or comment on whatever the president said,' Powell said. Asked if Trump had communicated his desire for lower rates directly to Powell, the Fed chair said he had 'no contact.' Regarding the Fed's key rate, Powell conveyed a more deliberate approach, noting that the economy is mostly healthy — the unemployment rate is a low 4.1% and growth topped 3% at an annual rate in the fall. 'With ... the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,' Powell said. Asked about the potential impact of the sharp policy changes Trump has proposed regarding tariffs, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation, Powell said Fed policymakers are 'waiting to see which policies are enacted.' 'We don't know what will happen,' he added. 'We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be.' Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide Financial, said Powell's comments suggest the Fed won't cut rates again until the middle of this year. 'We are all in wait-and-see mode, including the Fed,' she said. The Fed reduced its rate last year to 4.3% from 5.3%, in part out of concern that the job market was weakening. Hiring had slowed in the summer and the unemployment rate ticked up, leading Fed officials to approve an outsized half-point cut in September. Yet hiring rebounded last month and the unemployment rate declined slightly, to a low 4.1%. Powell has said it is harder to gauge where inflation is headed, in part because of increased uncertainty around what policies Trump will adopt and how quickly they will affect the economy. Higher tariffs and tax cuts could push inflation higher, while deregulation could possibly reduce it. The Fed typically keeps interest rates high to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. In December, Fed officials signaled they may reduce their rate just twice more this year. Goldman Sachs economists believe those cuts won't happen until June and December. In November, inflation was just 2.4%, according to the Fed's preferred measure, not far from its 2% target. But excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose a more painful 2.8% from a year earlier. The Fed pays close attention to core prices because they are often a better guide to inflation's future path. Powell said the Fed wants to see 'real progress on inflation or ... some weakness in the labor market before we consider' making further cuts. In a post to his Truth Social account late Wednesday, Trump criticized the Fed for failing to curtail inflation, saying he would do so by 'unleashing American Energy production, slashing Regulation, rebalancing international Trade, and reigniting American Manufacturing.' During the news conference, Powell was also asked about Trump's executive orders intended to limit diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which Powell has previously backed. 'As has been our practice over many administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-federal-reserve-holds-rates-steady-sees-inflation-as-elevated-/7956433.html	2025-01-29T18:54:23-08:00	
Police say at least 30 died in stampede at India’s Maha Kumbh festival	PRAYAGRAJ, INDIA — At least 30 people were killed and many more injured in a stampede at the world's largest religious gathering early Wednesday, police said, as millions of pilgrims rushed to dip in sacred waters during the Maha Kumbh festival in northern India. Police officer Vaibhav Krishna in Prayagraj city said another 60 injured were rushed to hospitals. Wednesday was a sacred day in the six-week Hindu festival, and authorities expected a record 100 million devotees to engage in a ritual bath at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. Hindus believe that a dip at the holy site can cleanse them of past sins and end the process of reincarnation. The stampede happened when pilgrims tried to jump barricades erected for a procession of holy men, Uttar Pradesh state's top elected official, Yogi Adityanath, said in a televised statement. The event's main draw is the thousands of ash-smeared Hindu ascetics who make massive processions toward the confluence to bathe. Indian authorities took more than 16 hours to release casualty figures, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged the loss of lives, calling the incident 'extremely sad' and extending his condolences. 'Suddenly there was pushing in the crowd, and we got trapped. A lot of us fell down and the crowd went uncontrolled,' the Press Trust of India news agency quoted pilgrim Sarojini as saying. 'There was no chance for escape, there was pushing from all sides,' she said. Distressed families lined up outside a makeshift hospital, desperate for news of missing loved ones. Clothes, blankets and backpacks were strewn around the site of the stampede. Millions continued to throng the 4,000-hectare pilgrimage site despite the stampede, even as police urged them over megaphones to avoid the confluence. Adityanath urged people to take baths at other riverbanks instead. 'The situation is now under control, but there is a massive crowd of pilgrims,' Adityanath said, adding that 90 million to 100 million pilgrims were at the site. About 30 million people had taken the holy bath by 8 a.m. Wednesday, he said. The Maha Kumbh festival, held every 12 years, started on Jan. 13. Authorities expect more than 400 million people to throng the pilgrimage site in total. Nearly 150 million people have already attended, including Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah and celebrities like Coldplay's Chris Martin. A sprawling tent city has been built on the riverbanks to accommodate the millions of visitors, with roads, electricity and water, 3,000 kitchens and 11 hospitals. About 50,000 security personnel are stationed in the city to maintain law and order and manage crowds, and more than 2,500 cameras monitor crowd movement and density so officials can try to prevent such crushes. Several opposition leaders criticized the federal and the state government, both led by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, and blamed the stampede on 'mismanagement' and 'VIP culture' — the latter referring to what they say is preferential treatment for politicians and celebrities. 'The government should make better arrangements to meet the needs of common devotees,' Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi wrote on social platform X. The 45-day festival is a significant cultural event for India's Hindus, who make up nearly 80% of the country's more than 1.4 billion people. It's also a prestige event for Modi, whose ruling party boasts of promoting Hindu cultural symbols. The Maha Kumbh festival has had stampedes in the past. In 2013, at least 40 pilgrims who were taking part in the festival were killed in a stampede at a train station in Prayagraj. Deadly stampedes are relatively common around Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas. In July at least 116 people died, most of them women and children, when thousands at a religious gathering in northern India stampeded at a tent camp in Hathras town.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-say-at-least-30-died-in-stampede-at-india-s-maha-kumbh-festival-/7956427.html	2025-01-29T18:34:52-08:00	
Trump says he will detain undocumented migrants at Guantanamo Bay	white house — U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would sign an executive action directing his administration to prepare to detain undocumented migrants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The U.S. detention facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the 9/11 attacks and members of the Taliban. His order will instruct the Defense and Homeland Security departments to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold 30,000 migrants, Trump said. 'Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust the countries to hold them because we don’t want them coming back. So we’re going to send them out to Guantanamo,' Trump added. 'This will double our capacity immediately. And tough, it’s a tough place to get out of.' Trump made the announcement during a White House event during which he signed the Laken Riley Act into law. It was the first legislation he'd signed in his second term. The bill, named after a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered last year by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant, aims to expand the federal government's mandate to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally. It's unclear how the administration proposes to do this. Asked by reporters, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said this was something the White House was 'working on, to use resources that we currently have there at Guantanamo Bay.' 'We'll go through the process,' she said, adding that the administration was working with lawmakers to fund it. She offered no estimate of the cost. A White House official, speaking on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous, told VOA that Trump had signed a presidential memorandum regarding housing migrants at Guantanamo. Presidential memoranda are less formal than executive orders. For example, they do not have to be submitted to the Federal Register for publication. Late Wednesday, the White House published the executive memorandum. Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, said Wednesday that U.S. Coast Guard personnel already tasked to intercept illegal migrants at sea 'can take them straight to Guantanamo Bay.' Homan told reporters that migrants had been housed there before. 'So we're just going to expand upon the existing migrant center logistics to work for that,' he said. According to a September 2024 report from the International Refugee Assistance Project, the U.S. has for decades detained migrants intercepted at sea in the Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo Bay under prisonlike conditions. IRAP and other immigration rights advocates have called for the immediate closure of the migrant center. The organization also called on Congress to investigate alleged human rights abuses at the facility and called for the end of migrant detention operations everywhere. Later Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called Guantanamo Bay the 'perfect place' for criminal migrants. Hegseth told Fox News that Guantanamo Bay could also temporarily hold other undocumented immigrants while they’re waiting to be sent back to their home countries. 'It's folks who maybe are in transit to their home country or a safe harbor country, and it's taking a little time to move with that processing of the paperwork,' he said, adding, 'Better they be held at a safe location, like Guantanamo Bay, which is meant and built for migrants, meant and built to sustain that away from the American people.' According to media reports, Immigration and Customs Enforcement averaged 710 arrests per day from Thursday through Monday, more than double the daily average of 311 recorded in the 12-month period through September under President Joe Biden. If ICE officers continue with these detentions, it would exceed the agency’s previous record set during President Barack Obama's administration in 2013, when daily arrests averaged 636. The Trump administration has intensified deportations, with ICE regularly updating arrest figures. The swift removals have sometimes created challenges in determining where to send deportees, especially when certain countries refuse to accept them. Closing Guantanamo Democratic administrations under Obama and Biden had sought to close the notorious detention camp. It was built by the George W. Bush administration in the Guantanamo Bay U.S. naval base facility in 2002 following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Rights groups say that Guantanamo is a symbol of U.S. disregard for the rule of law, as many detainees were held there without charge or trial. Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human rights catastrophe. 'Housing accused terrorists at Guantanamo has been a debacle. For the past 20 years, the U.S. government has locked up people it never even accused of taking action against the United States while continually failing to try those credibly charged with serious crimes,' she wrote. 'The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,' Hendrickson added. At its height during the Global War on Terror, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. According to the Pentagon, as of January 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility. Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s, per the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. 'At one point in late 1994, the migrant population of the naval station approached 45,000,' a CRS report dated August 2022 said. The report noted the last of the migrants had left by the end of January 1996.

Generative AI makes Chinese, Iranian hackers more efficient, report says	A report issued Wednesday by Google found that hackers from numerous countries, particularly China, Iran and North Korea, have been using the company’s artificial intelligence-enabled Gemini chatbot to supercharge cyberattacks against targets in the United States. The company found — so far, at least — that access to publicly available large language models (LLMs) has made cyberattackers more efficient but has not meaningfully changed the kind of attacks they typically mount. LLMs are AI models that have been trained, using enormous amounts of previously generated content, to identify patterns in human languages. Among other things, this makes them adept at producing high-functioning, error-free computer programs. 'Rather than enabling disruptive change, generative AI allows threat actors to move faster and at higher volume,' the report found. Generative AI offered some benefits for low-skilled and high-skilled hackers, the report said. 'However, current LLMs on their own are unlikely to enable breakthrough capabilities for threat actors. We note that the AI landscape is in constant flux, with new AI models and agentic systems emerging daily. As this evolution unfolds, [the Google Threat Intelligence Group] anticipates the threat landscape to evolve in stride as threat actors adopt new AI technologies in their operations.' Google’s findings appear to agree with previous research released by other large U.S. AI players OpenAI and Microsoft, which found a similar failure to achieve novel offensive strategies for cyberattacks through the use of public generative AI models. The report clarified that Google works to disrupt the activity of threat actors when it identifies them. Game unchanged 'AI, so far, has not been a game changer for offensive actors,' Adam Segal, director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations, told VOA. 'It speeds up some things. It gives foreign actors a better ability to craft phishing emails and find some code. But has it dramatically changed the game? No.' Whether that might change in the future is unclear, Segal said. Also unclear is whether further developments in AI technology will more likely benefit people building defenses against cyberattacks or the threat actors trying to defeat them. 'Historically, defense has been hard, and technology hasn't solved that problem,' Segal said. 'I suspect AI won't do that, either. But we don't know yet.' Caleb Withers, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, agreed that there is likely to be an arms race of sorts, as offensive and defensive cybersecurity applications of generative AI evolve. However, it is likely that they will largely balance each other out, he said. 'The default assumption should be that absent certain trends that we haven't yet seen, these tools should be roughly as useful to defenders as offenders,' he said. 'Anything productivity enhancing, in general, applies equally, even when it comes to things like discovering vulnerabilities. If an attacker can use something to find a vulnerability in software, so, too, is the tool useful to the defender to try to find those themselves and patch them.' Threat categories The report breaks down the kinds of threat actors it observed using Gemini into two primary categories. Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors refer to 'government-backed hacking activity, including cyber espionage and destructive computer network attacks.' By contrast, information operation (IO) threats 'attempt to influence online audiences in a deceptive, coordinated manner. Examples include sock puppet accounts [phony profiles that hide users' identities] and comment brigading [organized online attacks aimed at altering perceptions of online popularity].' The report found that hackers from Iran were the heaviest users of Gemini in both threat categories. APT threat actors from Iran used the service for a wide range of tasks, including gathering information on individuals and organizations, researching targets and their vulnerabilities, translating language and creating content for future online campaigns. Google tracked more than 20 Chinese government-backed APT actors using Gemini 'to enable reconnaissance on targets, for scripting and development, to request translation and explanation of technical concepts, and attempting to enable deeper access to a network following initial compromise.' North Korean state-backed APTs used Gemini for many of the same tasks as Iran and China but also appeared to be attempting to exploit the service in its efforts to place 'clandestine IT workers' in Western companies to facilitate the theft of intellectual property. Information operations Iran was also the heaviest user of Gemini when it came to information operation threats, accounting for 75% of detected usage, Google reported. Hackers from Iran used the service to create and manipulate content meant to sway public opinion, and to adapt that content for different audiences. Chinese IO actors primarily used the service for research purposes, looking into matters 'of strategic interest to the Chinese government.' Unlike the APT sector, where their presence was minimal, Russian hackers were more common when it came to IO-related use of Gemini, using it not only for content creation but to gather information about how to create and use online AI chatbots. Call for collaboration Also on Wednesday, Kent Walker, president of global affairs for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, used a post on the company’s blog to note the potential dangers posed by threat actors using increasingly sophisticated AI models, and calling on the industry and federal government 'to work together to support our national and economic security.' 'America holds the lead in the AI race — but our advantage may not last,' Walker wrote. Walker argued that the U.S. needs to maintain its narrow advantage in the development of the technology used to build the most advanced artificial intelligence tools. In addition, he said, the government must streamline procurement rules to 'enable adoption of AI, cloud and other game-changing technologies' by the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, and to establish public-private cyber defense partnerships.	https://www.voanews.com/a/generative-ai-makes-chinese-iranian-hackers-more-efficient-report-says/7956403.html	2025-01-29T17:23:36-08:00

Former US Senator Menendez gets 11 years in prison for bribes, acting as agent of Egypt	NEW YORK — Former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez was sentenced Wednesday to 11 years in prison for accepting bribes of gold and cash and acting as an agent of Egypt — crimes his own lawyer said earned him the nickname 'Gold Bar Bob.' U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein announced the sentence after the Democrat tearfully addressed the judge, saying he’d lost everything he cared about, except for his family. 'You were successful, powerful, you stood at the apex of our political system,' the judge said. 'Somewhere along the way, and I don’t know when it was, you lost your way and working for the public good became working for your good.' Menendez’s actions, the judge said, feeds the cynicism of voters. 'What’s been the result?' he said, noting a lengthy investigation of a five-year crime. 'You lost your senate seat. You lost your chairmanship and you lost your good name.' Menendez, 71, who tearfully told the judge in court that he was chastened, was defiant when he stepped before cameras at a bank of microphones outside the Manhattan courthouse, saying: 'I am innocent.' He then railed against the judicial system and aligned himself with President Donald Trump's recent criticisms of the judicial system, particularly in New York City. 'President Trump is right. This process is political and it’s corrupted to the core. I hope President Trump cleans up the cesspool and restores the integrity to the system,' he said, reading from a sheet of paper and calling himself the victim of 'the Wild West of political prosecutions.' Prosecutors had requested a 15-year prison term for Menendez, who was convicted of multiple charges including acting as an agent for Egypt for selling his once-considerable clout in Washington for bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Menendez: I’ve done more good than bad Given a chance to speak in court, Menendez broke down several times as he described his accomplishments. 'You really don’t know the man you are about to sentence,' Menendez told Stein as he stood before him with his hands in his pockets, except when he wiped his face several times with a tissue. 'Your honor, I am far from a perfect man. I have made more than my share of mistakes and bad decisions,' he added. 'I’ve done far more good than bad. I ask you, your honor, to judge me in that context.' Attorney Adam Fee told Stein to give Menendez credit for a 'lifetime of extraordinary public service and personal sacrifices.' 'Despite his decades of service, he is now known more widely as Gold Bar Bob,' Fee said. Menendez's lawyers had said prior to the sentencing that their client deserves less than two years in prison, describing how the son of Cuban immigrants rose from poverty to become 'the epitome of the American Dream' before his conviction had 'rendered him a national punchline.' He'd beaten a prosecution once before. In 2015, he was charged with selling his influence to a wealthy Florida eye doctor and entrepreneur who prosecutors said lavished him with luxury vacations and campaign contributions. But the jury in that case couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict. Federal prosecutors dropped the case rather than put him on trial again. Businessmen sentenced Before sentencing Menendez, Stein sentenced two men convicted of bribing Menendez, giving Fred Daibes, a real estate developer, a seven-year prison term and Wael Hana, an entrepreneur, eight years behind bars. Prior to the announcement of his sentence, Daibes, 67, tearfully told Stein the jury verdict had left him 'borderline suicidal,' and requested leniency so that he could care for his 30-year-old autistic son. Hana told the judge, 'I am an innocent man.' A third businessman pleaded guilty and testified against Menendez at a trial last year. Menendez resigned from the Senate after his conviction last year, though he lost much of his power in fall 2023 when the charges against him were revealed and he was forced to surrender his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Wife faces trial The trial traced Menendez’s dealings with Egyptian officials and his quest to aid three men who showered him with lucrative gifts found during a 2022 raid on the Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home he shared with his wife, Nadine. His wife faces a March trial on many of the same charges as her husband. FBI agents who searched the house found $480,000, some of it stuffed inside boots and the pockets of clothing hung in the couple's closets. They also seized gold bars worth an estimated $150,000. Prosecutors said Menendez had 'put his high office up for sale in exchange for this hoard of bribes,' including by serving Egypt’s interests as he worked to protect a meat certification monopoly Hana had established with the Egyptian government. Among other things, Menendez provided Egyptian officials with information about the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and ghostwrote a letter to fellow senators encouraging them to lift a hold on $300 million in military aid to Egypt. Prosecutors said that for other bribes, Menendez attempted to persuade a federal prosecutor in New Jersey to go easy on Daibes, a politically influential real estate developer accused of bank fraud. And at the trial, another businessman, Jose Uribe, testified that he helped Nadine Menendez get a Mercedes-Benz convertible after the senator sought to pressure state prosecutors to drop criminal probes of his associates. Menendez has insisted that he is innocent of any crime, saying repeatedly that his interactions with Egyptian officials were normal for the head of the Foreign Relations Committee, and that he always put American interests first. He denied taking any bribes and said the gold bars belonged to his wife. In court papers, Menendez's lawyers described how Menendez devoted much of his life to his country and his community after he was scarred by the early loss of his father, who killed himself when Menendez was 23 after he was unable to pay off gambling debts. They described a 50-year history of public service in heroic terms, tracing a career in which Menendez was mayor of Union City, New Jersey, a state lawmaker, a member of the U.S. House and then a senator from 2006 to 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-senator-menendez-gets-11-years-in-prison-for-bribes-acting-as-agent-of-egypt/7956117.html	2025-01-29T15:16:39-08:00

What is the Laken Riley Act? A look at the first bill Trump signed	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the first bill of his new term, and it is named after a slain Georgia nursing student whose name became a rallying cry during his White House campaign. Trump said that he appreciated the bipartisan support for the first piece of legislation since he took office on Jan. 20. The Laken Riley Act will require the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes. The bill won bipartisan support in the House and Senate. Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat, attended Wednesday's bill signing at the White House. Here are some things to know about the Laken Riley Act: Who was Laken Riley? Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing when she went out for a run on Feb. 22, 2024. Prosecutors said she encountered Jose Antonio Ibarra, who killed her during a struggle. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial and was found guilty in November of murder and other crimes by a judge, who alone heard and decided the case. Ibarra was sentenced to life without parole. Trump and other Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden for her death because Ibarra had been arrested for illegal entry in September 2022 near El Paso, Texas, amid an unprecedented surge in migration and released to pursue his case in immigration court. 'If this act had been the law of the land, he never would have had the opportunity to kill her,' said Representative Mike Collins, a Republican. Biden mentioned Riley during his State of the Union address last year as he spoke about border security and after Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, shouted at him, 'Say her name!' What does the bill do? Under the new law, federal officials will be required to detain any migrant arrested or charged with crimes such as shoplifting or assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone. 'If you come into this country illegally and you commit a crime, you should not be free to roam the streets of this nation,' said Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, who helped push the bill through the Senate. The bill also empowers state attorneys general to sue the federal government for harm caused by failures or decisions in immigration enforcement that harm states or people. That includes releasing migrants from custody or failing to detain migrants who have received deportation orders. The provision gives states some power in setting immigration policy when they have been trying to push back against presidential decisions under the Trump and Biden administrations. While Republicans control both chambers of Congress, 46 Democrats in the House and 12 Democrats in the Senate supported the measure. Why did most Democrats oppose it? Some have raised concerns that the bill will strip due process rights for migrants, including minors or recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. 'In the wake of tragedy, we are seeing a fundamental erosion of our civil rights,' said Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. 'In this bill, if a person is so much as accused of a crime, if someone wants to point a finger and accuse someone of shoplifting, they would be rounded up and put into a private detention camp and sent out for deportation without a day in court.' Most Democrats criticized the lack of funding in the bill, arguing the new law will not solve immigration problems but will impose new requirements on federal authorities. Democrats on the Appropriations Committee estimate the bill will cost $83 billion over the next three years, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press. Senator Chris Murphy said the bill is 'a totally unfunded mandate.' Why did some Democrats back it? Democrats who supported it were mostly from five battleground states and said their constituents demanded more border security and supported deportations of migrants accused of crimes. 'Anyone who commits a crime should be held accountable. That’s why I voted to pass the Laken Riley Act,' Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, said on social media after its passage. New Hampshire Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Virginia Senator Mark Warner also supported the bill. Shaheen and Warner are each up for a fourth term next year. Fetterman, who also backed the bill because he wants a 'secure border,' was the first Senate Democrat to meet with Trump after the election. He has met with many of Trump’s Cabinet picks and broken with his own party on some policy. Senator Ruben Gallego, whose parents are immigrants from Mexico and Colombia, was elected in November and became Arizona's first Latino senator. He said he supported the bill. 'We must give law enforcement the means to take action when illegal immigrants break the law, to prevent situations like what occurred to Laken Riley,' he said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-is-the-laken-riley-act-a-look-at-the-first-bill-trump-signed/7956078.html	2025-01-29T15:04:47-08:00	
Kennedy struggles to answer questions at Senate confirmation hearing for top health post	WASHINGTON — In a contentious confirmation hearing on his nomination to become the nation's top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. struggled to answer questions about how he would reform Medicaid or Medicare, the government health care programs used by millions of disabled, poor and older Americans. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician and key vote Kennedy needs to win, repeatedly pressed the nominee on Wednesday to share ways he plans to reform Medicaid, a multibillion-dollar taxpayer-funded program that covers health care for about 80 million people, including children. Republicans have said they might need to make deep cuts to Medicaid to fund President Donald Trump's proposals. 'I don't have a broad proposal for dismantling the program,' Kennedy said. Kennedy also inaccurately claimed that Medicaid is fully paid for by the federal government. It's not; states and federal taxpayers fund it. He also said most Americans have purchased a Medicare Advantage plan, when only about 1 in 10 Americans have. His misstatements about the program were peppered in between suggestions that he would seek to push privatization of the programs, repeatedly saying that most Americans like private insurance and that they dislike the government-run versions of the programs. Kennedy is seeking to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency with a $1.7 trillion budget that oversees, among other things, vaccine recommendations, food inspections, hospital oversight, and funding for hundreds of community health clinics. In sometimes heated exchanges Wednesday, Kennedy denied that he is anti-vaccine. But Kennedy, who pointed out that his children are vaccinated, acknowledged he has asked 'uncomfortable questions' about vaccinations. 'I believe that vaccines play a critical role in health care,' Kennedy told the Senate Finance Committee. Republicans did not ask Kennedy about his vaccine views during the first hour of the hearing. But Democrats did, with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon pointing out that Kennedy has previously claimed there's 'no safe' vaccine, initiating a back-and-forth between him and Kennedy. Wyden also quoted from Kennedy's books, which say that parents have been 'misled' on the measles vaccine. 'You have spent years pushing conflicting stories about vaccines,' Wyden said. Over many years, Kennedy has expressed his beliefs about vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts. He's led a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He has said there is 'no vaccine that is safe and effective' and repeatedly has called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that prove they've safely prevented disease. Republicans focused on questions about agriculture, food and the abortion pill, which many women access via telemedicine systems. Kennedy tried to assure senators that he would not seek widespread bans on vaccines or food, saying he wants to provide more information to people. 'I don’t want to take food away from anybody,' he said. 'If you like a cheeseburger – a McDonald’s cheeseburger and a Diet Coke, like my boss — you should be able to get them.' Kennedy hails from one of the nation’s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid over the summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump, a Republican, in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration. Trump selected Kennedy in November, shortly after he won the presidential election, saying Kennedy would 'end the Chronic Disease epidemic' and 'Make America Great and Healthy Again!' With Kennedy being one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, his nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kennedy-struggles-to-answer-questions-at-senate-confirmation-hearing-for-top-health-post-/7956093.html	2025-01-29T15:03:43-08:00	
UN: Fighting eases in DR Congo's Goma as rebels gain 'upper hand'	UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations said Wednesday that there is relative calm in the eastern Congolese city of Goma, following several days of intense fighting between the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels and the Congolese army for control of the city. 'There is, however, continued sporadic shooting, but an overall reduction in exchanges of fire within the city,' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. 'Continued clashes have been reported in surrounding areas, including in Sake, northwest of Goma.' Dujarric said bodies were in the streets, and humanitarians report at least 2,000 people have been injured by weapons and shrapnel since the fighting escalated. In early January, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the mineral-rich east with the support of the Rwandan army. On Monday, M23 said it had captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and a city of more than 2 million people, thousands of whom have been displaced from other conflict areas. Rwanda has denied accusations that it supports the rebels. Asked who controls the city, Dujarric said the U.N. assessment is that the M23 rebels clearly have 'the upper hand.' The U.N. has a peacekeeping mission in eastern Congo known as MONUSCO, currently with about 10,000 troops and police tasked with protecting civilians and disarming combatants. It has been in the process of drawing down its presence at the request of the Congolese government. In June, it left neighboring South Kivu province entirely. The rebels are reported to be pushing toward its capital, Bukavu. In and around Goma, MONUSCO has reinforced its positions to counter the rebels’ advance deploying a quick reaction force, a rapid deployment battalion, a reserve battalion, a platoon of special forces and an artillery battery. 'The mission's priority right now remains the protection of its personnel, its assets and the many civilians sheltering within U.N. premises,' Dujarric said. 'Our peacekeepers are also planning on sending out patrols today in Goma to assess the situation, to conduct resupplies and assess routes.' The U.N. says Goma’s airport remains closed, halting the flow of humanitarian supplies. Most of the roads connecting Goma with the rest of the country are also closed. Water and electricity have been cut off since Sunday, and internet access has been interrupted since Monday. Only mobile phones are working. In the capital, Kinshasa, the situation was also calm Wednesday. Dujarric said the main roads were reportedly empty, and supermarkets were closed because of the high risk of looting. On Tuesday, protesters attacked, looted and burned some embassies, including those of Belgium, France and Rwanda. The United States said Tuesday it was closing its embassy until further notice. On Wednesday it advised Americans not to travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo. The U.N. Security Council and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have called for the M23 to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories. They have also called for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces and a return to the Luanda process of mediation overseen by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. The East African Community, which includes DRC and Rwanda among its eight members, was expected to hold an emergency summit Wednesday evening. Reuters reported that Rwandan President Paul Kagame would attend, but Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi was not expected to participate. Before the latest round of violence, eastern DRC was mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country’s valuable mineral deposits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-fighting-eases-in-dr-congo-s-goma-as-rebels-gain-upper-hand-/7956071.html	2025-01-29T14:34:45-08:00

White House rescinds memo freezing federal grants	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's budget office on Wednesday rescinded a memo freezing spending on federal grants, less than two days after it sparked widespread confusion and legal challenges across the country. The Monday evening memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget sparked uncertainty over a crucial financial lifeline for states, schools and organizations that rely on trillions of dollars from Washington and left the White House scrambling to explain what would and wouldn't be subject to a pause in funding. The reversal was the latest sign that even with unified control of Washington, Trump's plans to dramatically and rapidly reshape the government has some limits. The White House confirmed that OMB pulled the memo Wednesday in a two-sentence notice sent to agencies and departments but said that Trump's underlying executive orders targeting federal spending in areas such as diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change remained in place. Administration officials said the notice to halt loans and grants was necessary to conduct a review to ensure that spending complies with Trump’s recent blitz of executive orders. Agencies had been directed to answer a series of yes or no questions on each federal program by Feb. 7. The questions included 'does this program promote gender ideology?' and 'does this program promote or support in any way abortion?' Still, the vaguely worded memo, combined with incomplete answers from the White House throughout the day, left lawmakers, public officials and average Americans struggling to figure out what programs would be affected by the pause. Even temporary interruptions in funding could cause layoffs or delays in public services. The freeze was scheduled to go into effect at 5 p.m. Tuesday but was stayed by a federal judge until at least Monday after an emergency hearing requested by nonprofit groups that receive federal grants. An additional lawsuit by Democratic state attorneys general was also pending. 'The Executive Orders issued by the President on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, blaming the confusion on the courts and news outlets, not the administration. 'This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the President’s orders on controlling federal spending.' Administration officials insisted that despite the confusion, the order still had its intended effect by underscoring to federal agencies their obligations to abide by Trump's executive orders. Although Trump had promised to turn Washington upside down if elected to a second term, the effects of his effort to pause funding were being felt far from the nation’s capital. Organizations such as Meals on Wheels, which receives federal money to deliver food to the elderly, and Head Start, which provides early childcare in lower-income communities, were worried about getting cut off. On Tuesday, Trump administration officials said programs that provide direct assistance to Americans, including Medicare, Social Security, student loans and food stamps, would not be affected. But they sometimes struggled to provide a clear picture. Leavitt initially would not say whether Medicaid was exempted from the freeze, but the administration later clarified that it was. Democratic critics of the order moved swiftly to celebrate the action. 'This is an important victory for the American people whose voices were heard after massive pressure from every corner of this country — real people made a difference by speaking out,' said Senator Patty Murray. 'Still, the Trump administration — through a combination of sheer incompetence, cruel intentions and a willful disregard of the law — caused real harm and chaos for millions over the span of the last 48 hours which is still ongoing.' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said, 'Americans fought back, and Donald Trump backed off.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-rescinds-memo-freezing-federal-grants/7956004.html	2025-01-29T13:31:14-08:00	
Online child sexual exploitation increasing in Kenya, says report	NAIROBI, KENYA — For young people like Winnie Muyam, accessing digital platforms was her way to connect with friends and entertainment, until last year when the 17-year-old said strangers began to chat with her. 'They started talking to me as a friend, telling me how beautiful I was,' she said. 'From there they started sending pictures. They wanted to see my private parts and I felt so bad.' The teenager said her efforts to flag her abusers through the platform's reporting tools were futile. Her complaint was not acted upon. While Muyam was able to avoid exploitation, up to 13% of minors online have been exploited or abused, according to a survey by Child Fund International and Africa Child forum. A majority of the targeted children are 12 to 17 years old. The fund’s child advocacy and protection manager, Eunice Kilundo, said perpetrators try to play on their victims’ desperation for affection. 'They will pose as a very good friend,' said Kilundo. 'They even give children rewards and lure them into going deeper and deeper up to the point where probably they may want children to send them their nudes and all that.' In a fast-changing digital world, parents, caregivers, communities and governments face new challenges in keeping children safe, UNICEF said. Researchers say a low capacity to investigate and prosecute online sexual exploitation in Africa creates a fertile ground for potential offenders. So Kenyan authorities are training officers in the justice system to handle such cases. Kilundo said concerted efforts to combat such abuse will go a long way. 'It's a high time everybody in the children sector — or even outside the children sector, the corporate, government, everyone — to demonstrate commitment and concern,' said Kilundo. Kenyan law prohibits any sexual involvement with children under 18 years old, including online, without permission of a parent or guardian. Dennis Otieno, senior counsel for Kenya’s Federation of Female Lawyers, told VOA that although such crimes can be prosecuted, some caregivers are oblivious to them and making them aware is crucial. 'The report rate for such cases is very low,' said Otieno. 'Many people still do not understand there are crimes that can be committed through social media.' More than 22 million people in Kenya have access to the internet, according to national data, and with increasing access to digital platforms, authorities believe programs such as this training will help keep children online safe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/online-child-sexual-exploitation-increasing-in-kenya-says-report/7955952.html	2025-01-29T13:25:58-08:00	
WHO warns polio progress in Afghanistan, Pakistan at risk due to US funding cut	ISLAMABAD — A senior World Health Organization official cautioned Wednesday that the eradication of polio in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the only countries where the paralytic virus persists, is threatened by the suspension of funding from the United States. In an online news conference, Hanan Balkhy, regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean, emphasized the crucial role of U.S. financial contribution to the organization's surveillance efforts for polio and all other communicable diseases, particularly within her region. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an unprecedented 90-day suspension of almost all foreign aid to give his administration the time to evaluate whether to continue funding the numerous humanitarian, development and security programs that receive U.S. assistance. On his first day back in the White House, Trump announced he was withdrawing the United States from WHO. His executive order accused the United Nations agency of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises, as well as failing 'to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.' Balkhy referred to Trump's announcement to withdraw from WHO as 'very unfortunate' and highlighted that the U.S. has been a 'major' supporter of her organization's work in the Eastern Mediterranean region for decades. 'The U.S. funding was indeed decisive in fighting polio, eradicating polio. Currently, we are in the last round of eradicating polio in the last two countries in the world: Afghanistan and Pakistan,' the Saudi physician said through an interpreter. 'We hope that our collaboration with our partners will enable us to achieve our goal of fully eradicating polio in these countries during this final stage,' she added. Balkhy emphasized WHO's dedication to safeguarding the world against the resurgence of polio. In 2024, Pakistan reported 73 cases of the paralytic poliovirus, while Afghanistan reported 25 cases. Although there have been no additional polio cases in Afghanistan so far, Pakistani officials confirmed the first poliovirus infection of 2025 last week. Balkhy attributed efforts led by WHO to contain what she described as the 'inevitable' spread of polio in Gaza due to the destruction of its sewage and sanitation services. She stated they are prepared to discuss the reforms the United States plans to propose and carry out necessary internal assessments to help advance the organization's work. 'Funding shortfalls in 2024 have already led to devastating cuts to lifesaving health operations. We ask for your support in amplifying our message — help us save lives, restore health systems and bring hope to millions,' Balkhy said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7955883.html	2025-01-29T12:29:48-08:00	
African Union demands halt to fighting in eastern DR Congo	NAIROBI, KENYA — The African Union and other regional bodies on late Tuesday called for an immediate halt to fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The M23 rebel group seized control of eastern Congo’s largest city, Goma, on Monday. According to some residents who spoke to VOA, Goma is calm after two days of heavy fighting. Residents who ventured out Wednesday saw bodies on the streets, some in military uniforms and others in civilian clothes. The regional bodies called for M23 to withdraw from the city, a move security experts say will be difficult for the rebel group to accept. The East African Community bloc has called for a summit to address the tension between the DRC and Rwanda, which Kinshasa accuses of backing M23. Rwandan authorities deny the charge. According to Congolese state media, President Felix Tshisekedi will not attend the talks. Meanwhile, calm returned to Kinshasa on Wednesday, a day after angry protesters attacked the embassies of Belgium, France, Kenya and Uganda as well as Rwanda. The protesters accused the other countries of supporting Rwanda. The embassies either condemned or expressed deep concern over the attacks. The United States closed its embassy in Kinshasa to the public on Tuesday and called on its citizens to review their safety and travel plans. On Wednesday it advised Americans not to travel to the DRC. Chacha Nyaigotti-Chacha, a Kenyan expert in international relations and diplomacy, said he does not think the protests will affect the DRC’s relations with the affected countries. In regard to the fighting in the east, the DRC’s government needs to address and solve its internal problems, said Chrispin Mvano, a Congolese political and security researcher in Goma. 'The conflict in DR Congo isn't just about disputes with other countries,' Mvano said. 'It also stems from internal divisions among the Congolese people. Even as talks continue in Nairobi, lasting stability depends on resolving these internal issues. If Congolese leaders and communities don't engage in dialogue and address their differences in Kinshasa, the peace talks alone are unlikely to bring real stability.' The DRC is home to over 100 armed groups, many fighting for control of resources and mining areas. In the latest conflict, the Congolese army and the allied Wazalendo militia retreated from the city, with some soldiers surrendering at the U.N. peacekeeping base in Goma. Great Lakes region security analyst Dismas Nkunda said Kinshasa needs to build a strong army to confront rebels. 'M23, they are very well-equipped. ... If the DRC government does not up its game, then it's going to be very difficult for them to be able to maintain [a] semblance of peace when they have well-armed and well-supported armed groups like M23,' Nkunda said. Congolese Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwama Wagner said in an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that more than half a million people in eastern Congo were displaced this month and that the humanitarian situation there is getting worse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-union-demands-halt-to-fighting-in-eastern-dr-congo/7955855.html	2025-01-29T12:16:15-08:00

Debate rages over Trump's push to end birthright citizenship	Washignton — President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. has ignited a legal and political debate, raising questions about the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the extent of presidential power. The amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. 'We're the only country in the world that does this with birthright, as you know. And it's just absolutely ridiculous. But, you know, we'll see. We think we have very good grounds and certain people have wanted to do this for decades,' Trump said while signing the executive order on his first day in office. The United States is one of about 30 countries that grant automatic citizenship to individuals born on their soil, including Brazil, Mexico, and Canada, among others. The practice is known as jus soli (Latin for 'right of the soil'). But the U.S. remains notable for its broad application of unconditional jus soli, as enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Are there limits to 14th Amendment? The amendment, ratified in 1868, was designed to address citizenship questions following the U.S. Civil War and to overrule the Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott decision, which denied African Americans citizenship. The text reads: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' 'This language ratifies the traditional understanding that anyone born in the United States is automatically a citizen,' John Yoo, a professor at University of California Berkeley Law School and visiting fellow at the Hoover Institute, told VOA in a phone intervie However, critics argue that the phrase 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof' implies that at least one parent must be a U.S. citizen for a child to be granted citizenship. According to Yoo, this interpretation aligns more closely with the European jus sanguinis, or 'law of blood' approach, which ties citizenship to parentage rather than birthplace. 'To me, that just doesn’t make sense of the language of the 14th Amendment and historical practice,' Yoo said. 'The Supreme Court, in cases like United States v. Wong Kim Ark, has consistently interpreted the amendment to mean birthright citizenship.' Critics of Trump’s executive order say the 14th Amendment is a cornerstone of civil rights in the United States. 'The 14th amendment, it was created to give birthright citizenship. … Constitutional rights cannot be taken away by a president. They can only be taken away by Congress, and thus the executive order is illegal,' said Tuyet Duong, an immigration lawyer and policy expert with the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum. However, supporters of the executive order argue a more limited interpretation of the amendment is warranted. 'President Trump has made it clear that restoring fairness to our immigration system and defending the true intent of the 14th Amendment are central to his vision of making America great again,' Republican Congressman Brian Babin of Texas, told reporters during a press conference last Thursday. Amy Swearer, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, wrote in a report in 2019 that there is good reason for the United States to reconsider its long-standing policy of automatically granting citizenship to everyone born on U.S. soil. Swearer argued that the 14th Amendment was intended to give birthright citizenship only to those U.S.-born children whose parents were 'like the freed slaves, subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United States. In a modern immigration context, this would mean that the Constitution only mandates birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of citizens, nationals, and lawful permanent residents.' Legal challenges Trump’s executive order is facing significant legal challenges, with multiple lawsuits in progress. Twenty-two Democratic-led states have filed a lawsuit arguing the order violates the 14th Amendment. A federal judge in Seattle has temporarily stopped the birthright citizenship order from taking effect. Last Thursday, U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour of Seattle temporarily blocked it, describing it as 'blatantly unconstitutional.' But if the case reaches the Supreme Court, the outcome could reshape the nation’s understanding of citizenship. If the court were to side with Trump, the most immediate impact will be on newborns and those yet to receive birth certificates and Social Security numbers. And questions about retroactive application would arise. 'Figuring out how this rule would operate retroactively is extremely complex. Would it deny citizenship to people born here historically without citizen parents? How far back would it go? These are precisely the issues the 14th Amendment was designed to avoid,' Yoo told VOA. While much of the focus is on judicial challenges, Yoo pointed out that Congress could settle the issue legislatively. 'Congress could extend birthright citizenship by statute, reaffirming the traditional understanding. But it’s unclear what Congress might do in this politically charged environment,' Yoo said. Still, he believes the Supreme Court would uphold birthright citizenship. 'The text of the 14th Amendment, its history, and consistent Supreme Court rulings all point to birthright citizenship,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/debate-rages-over-trump-s-push-to-end-birthright-citizenship/7955708.html	2025-01-29T10:23:50-08:00	
West Africa bloc announces formal exit of three junta-led states	LAGOS, NIGERIA — The Economic Community of West Africa States, ECOWAS, on Wednesday announced the formal exit of junta-led Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger from the bloc following their withdrawal last year. West Africa has been rocked by a spate of coups that has countries in the 15-member body under military rule over the past five years. 'The withdrawal of Burkina Faso, the Republic of Mali and Republic of Niger has become effective today, 29th January 2025,' ECOWAS said in a statement. The three states announced their withdrawal from the bloc last January after ECOWAS demanded a restoration of democratic rule in Niger following a military coup in 2023. Instead, the three breakaway states formed Alliance of Sahel States, an alternate bloc and launched their own biometric passports. ECOWAS said on Wednesday the remaining members tentatively agreed to 'keep ECOWAS doors open' by recognizing national passports and identity bearing the bloc's logo from the countries, to continue trade under existing regional agreement, and to continue diplomatic cooperation with the countries. In December, ECOWAS gave Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger a six-month grace period to rethink their exit. 'These arrangements will be in place until the full determination of the modalities of our future engagement with the three countries of by the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government,' ECOWAS said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/west-africa-bloc-announces-formal-exit-of-three-junta-led-states-/7955666.html	2025-01-29T09:26:28-08:00	
Plane crashes in South Sudan, killing 20, official says	NAIROBI — A small aircraft carrying oil workers in South Sudan's Unity State crashed on Wednesday, killing 20 people, an official said. The plane crashed at the Unity oilfield airport on Wednesday morning as it was heading to the capital Juba, said Gatwech Bipal, Unity State's information minister. Bipal said the passengers were oil workers of the Greater Pioneer Operating Company, or GPOC, a consortium that includes China National Petroleum Corporation and state-owned Nile Petroleum Corporation. He said among the dead were two Chinese nationals and one Indian. Bipal gave no more details on the circumstances that led to the crash. Media reports had initially put the death toll at 18 but Bipal told Reuters two survivors had later died. One person survived. Several air crashes have occurred in war-torn South Sudan in recent years. In September 2018, at least 19 people died when a small aircraft carrying passengers from the capital Juba to the city of Yirol crashed. In 2015, dozens of people were killed when a Russian-built cargo plane with passengers on board crashed after taking off from the airport in the capital Juba.	https://www.voanews.com/a/plane-crashes-in-south-sudan-killing-20-official-says/7955609.html	2025-01-29T09:13:59-08:00	
Trump administration ends extended protections for Venezuelans in US, official says	Washington — The Trump administration has ended extended protections for Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status, TPS, in the United States, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News in an interview on Wednesday. Noem said Homeland Security would not follow a Biden-era move that gave Venezuelans in the U.S. with the TPS program an additional 18 months of protections, adding: 'We are going to follow the process, evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country, including the Venezuelans that are here.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-ends-extended-protections-for-venezuelans-in-us-official-says/7955611.html	2025-01-29T09:05:03-08:00	
Trump’s push for Greenland shakes up Arctic island’s politics	Nuuk, Greenland — The road south from Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, runs out at the tip of a blizzard-scoured peninsula stretching into the Labrador Sea. Icebergs drift beyond the sea ice toward the open ocean, carved off the glacier some 100 kilometers away at the head of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord. Locals call this spot 'the edge of the world.' For local Inuit artist and researcher Vivi Vold, it is a place of spiritual power, somewhere she comes to connect with nature – intrinsic to her Greenlandic identity. 'It reminds me that I am Inuk, that I am Greenlandic… when I am in doubt and want to reconnect with myself and my Greenlandic identity, I find solace in nature,' Vold told VOA. In her work, Vold researches Inuit 'ways of knowing' and how they differ from Western concepts. 'I sense that there is more pride now than earlier. The pride has always been there, but it seems like now there is more acceptance of it. Everything I do as a researcher is about the land and the nature; hunting, the climate, and the way we think,' she said. Greenlandic pride A resurgence in indigenous pride can be felt across Greenlandic society. The eyes of the world are on this Arctic island, thanks largely to U.S. President Donald Trump. In Greenlandic politics and media, in the pubs and coffee bars, and on social media, the conversation is about the island’s future. There is excitement - but also trepidation. President Trump has repeatedly said that America needs to take control of Greenland from Denmark for, in his words, 'international security.' 'I do believe Greenland, we’ll get, because it really has to do with freedom of the world... And you know what, the people don't like the way they've been treated by Denmark. They don't like the way they've been treated by Denmark and they do like us,' Trump told reporters Saturday on Air Force One. Meanwhile, Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, attempted to build European solidarity in the face of the challenge posed by Trump’s comments Tuesday, visiting Berlin, Paris and NATO headquarters in Brussels in the space of a single day. Local media reported that France offered to send troops to Greenland in a show of unity with Copenhagen, but the offer was turned down. A poll released on Wednesday, commissioned by the Danish Berlingske newspaper and the Sermitsiaq newspaper in Greenland, suggested that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, with 6% in favor and 9% undecided. However, almost half of respondents said they saw an opportunity with Trump's interest in Greenland, with the other half seeing it as a threat. The poll did not ask respondents whether they wanted to break ties with Denmark and become independent. A 2019 survey suggested that more than two-thirds of the Greenlanders want independence at some point in the future. Danish colonization A statue of the Norwegian-Danish missionary Hans Egede stands over the capital Nuuk. Greenlanders have lived under varying degrees of Danish rule ever since he landed here in 1721. In recent years, the statue has been daubed with graffiti calling for its removal and for Greenland’s independence from Denmark. Nevertheless, in a 2020 poll, 62% of Greenlanders voted to keep the statue in place. Greenland’s government is now largely autonomous and pushing for full independence. Under the terms of an agreement with Denmark, the territory has a right to hold a referendum on the issue. 'Things are changing in the world. We don't know yet. But we need to have that discussion in Greenland without the outside world requiring us to give an answer to the end goal,' said Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for resources, business, justice and gender equality. 'We need to be able to discuss amongst ourselves how will independence look like, what kind of welfare do we want, what kind of democracy, what kind of institutions should guard it, what kind of constitution. We want those debates for ourselves,' she told VOA. Independence challenges Could Greenland stand on its own? Just 57,000 people inhabit the island’s 2.1 million square kilometers. Denmark pays an annual grant of around $800 million dollars, which makes up half the Greenland government’s revenue. Trump may balk at the cost, said Marc Jacobsen, a researcher at the Royal Danish Defense College in Copenhagen. 'I'm not really sure if they are aware of what the cost is to keep a high living standard in Greenland with the welfare system as we know from the Nordic states. So, in comparison with the Inuit in Alaska or for instance [the indigenous people] in Puerto Rico, it's a different living standard in Greenland. And that comes with a cost,' he told VOA. There are hopes that the global attention now focused on Greenland will unlock investment to exploit its vast mineral wealth, which includes graphite, uranium and valuable rare earth metals. 'The problem is pretty much that they are staying there at the moment because nobody's investing in getting them out,' said Ulrik Pram Gad, an expert on Greenland’s mineral wealth at the Danish Institute for International Studies. 'And that's not a question of Greenlanders not wanting it or Denmark not allowing it. It's a question of the only supply chains that exist concerning many of these resources are in China. And the Western world, you might say, cannot present a credible business model to the private companies that would in principle be able to use these materials.' Tourism A new international airport opened in November, making access to Nuuk much easier. International flights currently depart for Denmark, Canada and Iceland – but United Airlines is due to begin direct flights from New York later this year. Greenland’s stark beauty is attracting more tourists. 'The international airport in Nuuk has opened up; there will be another one in Ilulissat where the fantastic ice-shelf glacier is. So there are opportunities for growth in tourism. There's really a lot of desire for relations not just to the U.S., but to Canada, to Iceland, to Europe, to everybody. And if this turns into that, I think many Greenlanders will be happy,' Pram Gad told VOA. For now, fishing is Greenland’s biggest industry by far, making up around 85% of total exports. It is deeply entwined with the Greenlandic way of life. Jesper Jacobsen runs a fishing cooperative in Nuuk. In the depths of the January winter, customers drop in to buy cod and halibut, along with duck and reindeer meat brought in by local hunters. Whale, bear and walrus are sometimes available. 'We have fish and we have natural resources,' Jacobsen said. 'And the Americans could pay a lot of money to rent the northern part of Greenland. They could use it for their military. Then we will have our independence because the Americans will pay a lot to rent the northern part of Greenland,' he told VOA. 'Make Greenland Great Again' A ‘Make America Great Again’ or MAGA hat hangs in Jacobsen’s office, given by Donald Trump Jr.’s entourage when the U.S. president’s son visited Greenland in early January. The visit continues to cause a stir. YouTubers arrived in the wake of the younger Trump’s visit, handing out U.S. dollars and hats bearing the slogan ‘Make Greenland Great Again.’ Some locals criticized the social media stunt. Others welcomed the attention. 'I don't want to be a part of Denmark. I don't like [the] Danish. They took children and they colonized us,' said 20-year-old student Hans Louis Petersen, proudly showing off his 'Make Greenland Great Again' baseball cap. Scandals Petersen referenced a 1950s social experiment run by the Danish state, where Greenlandic children were taken to Denmark, sometimes without the full understanding of their parents. Many struggled to re-integrate when they returned. Separately, in recent years it emerged that Danish doctors in the 1960s and 70s had implanted IUD contraceptive devices in Inuit women and girls without their permission, allegedly to limit population growth. A group of 67 Greenlanders is currently seeking $6.3 million in compensation from the Danish state. An investigation into the program is expected to be published later this year. The scandals have further fueled the campaign for independence. 'I think there is a lack of understanding of the impact of these cases in Greenland,' said Greenlandic Minister Naaja Nathanielsen. 'It's not ancient history, it's current history. We right now have women, men, families that are directly affected by the actions of the Danish state in the past. It's traumatizing and some of them have not been able to become mothers.' 'This is not some cases that should be solved in a courtroom. They should be solved politically and with the proper amount of respect and understanding and assuming responsibility for the hurt inflicted on the Greenlandic people. And it's absolutely necessary for us to move forward,' Nathanielsen told VOA. Outside forces are building pressure on the government. The island’s prime minister, Mute B. Egede, has repeated the same message when questioned on Trump’s aim to take control of the territory. 'We have said very precisely that Greenland, and us in this country, do not want to be Americans. We don't want to be Danes either,' Egede said in a televised debate on January 20. 'We are Greenlanders. We will stand firmly as Greenlanders and cooperate with the West. We will also cooperate with other countries in the world,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-push-for-greenland-shakes-up-arctic-island-s-politics/7955482.html	2025-01-29T07:51:18-08:00	
Year of the Snake is underway with Lunar New Year festivities	BEIJING — Lunar New Year festivals and prayers marked the start of the Year of the Snake around Asia and farther afield on Wednesday — including in Moscow. Hundreds of people lined up in the hours before midnight at the Wong Tai Sin Taoist temple in Hong Kong in a bid to be among the first to put incense sticks in the stands in front of the temple’s main hall. 'I wish my family will be blessed. I hope my business will run well. I pray for my country and wish people peace. I hope this coming year is a better year,' said Ming So, who visits the temple annually on the eve of the Lunar New Year. The holiday — known as the Spring Festival in China, Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in Korea — is a major festival celebrated by diaspora communities around the world. The snake, one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, follows the just-ended Year of the Dragon. The pop-pop-pop of firecrackers greeted the new year outside Guan Di temple in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, followed by lion dances to the rhythmic beat of drums and small cymbals. Ethnic Chinese holding incense sticks in front of them bowed several times inside the temple before sticking the incense into elaborate gold-colored pots, the smoke rising from the burning tips. Many Chinese who work in bigger cities return home during the eight-day national holiday in what is described as the world’s biggest annual movement of humanity. Beijing, China's capital, has turned into a bit of a ghost town, with many shops closed and normally crowded roads and subways empty. Traditionally, Chinese have a family dinner at home on New Year's Eve and visit 'temple fairs' on the Lunar New Year to watch performances and buy snacks, toys and other trinkets from booths. Many Chinese take advantage of the extended holiday to travel in the country and abroad. Ctrip, an online booking agency that operates Trip.com, said the most popular overseas destinations this year are Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the United States, South Korea, Macao and Vietnam. Russians cheered, waved and took smartphone photos of a colorful procession with drummers, costumed dancers and large dragon and snake figures held aloft that kicked off a 10-day Lunar New Year festival in Moscow on Tuesday night. Visitors shouted 'Happy New Year' in Russian and expressed delight at being able to experience Chinese food and culture in Moscow, including folk performances and booths selling snacks and artwork.	https://www.voanews.com/a/year-of-the-snake-is-underway-with-lunar-new-year-festivities/7955461.html	2025-01-29T07:48:31-08:00	
Somali general confident of defeat against IS	For almost a month, security forces in the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland have been advancing on the mountainous hideouts of Islamic State militants. The fiercest clashes occurred late last week when the regional forces dislodged the militants from Turmasaale, a strategic location about 150 kilometers southeast of Bosaso. Puntland’s leader, Said Abdullahi Deni, went to the airport over the weekend to meet wounded soldiers, including a senior officer, a sign of clashes taking place. Before the Turmasaale clashes, the region’s forces seized caves, camps and small villages largely unopposed. Brigadier General Ahmed Abdullahi Sheikh, who until recently was the commander of special operations for the Somali army and has been following the offensive in his home region, said losing Turmasaale was a blow for IS as it was the militants’ main supply route. 'This is where they were coordinating both attacks — mainly drone-deployed ammunition, IEDs, attacking the Puntland forces — but also getting their resupply, whether it's rations or whatever. So it was a strategic achievement by the Puntland forces,' he said. He said both sides suffered casualties from the fighting over Turmasaale, the biggest confrontation so far. 'There has been almost daily fighting. The Puntland forces have suffered casualties, mainly from IEDs, which is the weapon of choice of terrorism everywhere,' he said. 'But they have been progressing on very well for the past three weeks. And they have captured several important locations. The regional forces so far have the upper hand for sure.' The IS group’s main camps, located in the vicinity of Dhaadaar village, have yet to be reached. The IS group claimed responsibility for attacks against Puntland forces, including a deadly suicide attack on Dec. 31, 2024, which the group said was carried out by militants from multiple countries. Sheikh said he believes Puntland forces can achieve a military victory against IS before Ramadan, which starts in four weeks. 'This operation was planned very well. It was prepared very well,' he said. 'The mobilization was exceptional. and they have huge support from the local communities, which is very important.' Sheikh said the presence of foreign fighters in the Islamic State camps gives both locals and Puntland forces extra motivation. 'If you capture their bases and camps and strategic headquarters, that for me will be the measurement of victory,' he added. IS presence in Somalia small but growing It has been 10 years since about two dozen al-Shabab fighters defected from the group, set up an Islamic State Somalia branch and gave allegiance to the group’s then-leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The group remained small for years but appealed to foreign fighters who came to Somalia, mainly from the Middle East and from other parts of East Africa. Some U.S. officials also believe that IS Somalia’s leader, Abdulkadir Mumin, is also the emir of IS global. Others disagree but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure, with a recent United Nations report naming him as the group’s directorate of provinces, 'placing him in a leadership role over [IS] affiliates in Africa.' On the ground, observers believe Mumin is in firm control of the group as leader, as well as a dealmaker who acts between the locals and militants. The office of IS in Somalia was already documented to run the terrorist group’s financial network. The U.S. supports Somali security forces, training the elite Danab forces in multiple locations. The U.S. has also conducted airstrikes against al-Shabab and Islamic State, with 10 reported strikes in 2024. One of the strikes killed Mohamed Mire, a top al-Shabab commander, on Dec. 24 in southern Somalia. Sheikh himself was trained by the U.S. and previously served as the commander of Danab. A U.S. defense official declined to comment on the anti-IS operation underway in Puntland but said the United States has not wavered in its support for Somali forces. 'The Department [of Defense] remains committed to supporting our partners in our shared efforts to disrupt, degrade, and defeat VEOs [violent extremist organizations] in the Horn of Africa,' the official told VOA, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing counterterror efforts. The Pentagon 'has maintained a long-term focus on working with African partner nations to build defense institutional capacity and enable partnered operations … with a particular focus on countering al-Shabab and ISIS-Somalia,' the official said, pointing, in particular, to more than a decade of support for the Danab Brigade. The Trump administration withdrew U.S. forces from Somalia during the last few weeks of its first term in January 2021. But President Joe Biden reversed the decision in May 2022, sending in about 500 U.S. special operation forces to help Somali forces counter both IS and al-Shabab. Some Somali officials fear a similar disengagement with Trump back in the White House. Sheikh said he 'doubts' it will be repeated. 'The terrorism is still a real threat and obviously is the threat in Somalia,' he said. Abdi Hassan Hussein 'Abdi Yare' is Puntland’s former chief of police and former head of the region’s intelligence agency. He said the campaign to combat Islamic State is crucial for the broader security of Somalia and the region, as this group poses a security danger to all countries in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. Abdi Yare cautioned that the fighting could last a long time. 'It is difficult to predict the damage that can be done, and it is true that the area to be fought is very difficult in terms of traffic, necessitating the troops to carry infantry or guerrilla warfare, which may prolong the war,' he said. Yare does not think the group’s power has diminished significantly. 'The group's power has not diminished; it is still quite strong, and it is prepared for a long-term conflict, having drilled holes in Mount Al-Madow to deliver food, military equipment, and all necessary materials,' he said. He estimates the group has between 1,200 and 1,600 fighters. That number is still unverified. For a long time, experts believed IS fighters in Somalia numbered only a few hundred. A report issued this past November by the United Nations Sanctions Monitoring Team for Somalia, based on member state intelligence, estimated IS-Somalia had more than doubled in size to between 600 and 700 fighters. It further warned the terror group’s numbers in Puntland were boosted by an influx of fighters from Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen. Some experts told VOA they expected the trend to continue. Abdi Yare predicts Mumin could flee to Yemen if the group is defeated in Puntland. He also warned that IS militants could resort to desperate attacks targeting civilians in populated cities like Bosaso.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-general-confident-of-defeat-against-is/7955486.html	2025-01-29T07:47:59-08:00	
Defense secretary pulls Trump critic Gen. Milley's security clearance, protective detail	Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is pulling the security protections and clearance of retired Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Mark Milley, and he has ordered the Pentagon's inspector general to review Milley's actions while serving as the nation's top uniformed officer to determine if a demotion is warranted, two defense officials confirmed late Tuesday. The inspector general review will include 'an inquiry into the facts and circumstances surrounding Gen Milley’s conduct so that the Secretary may determine whether it is appropriate to reopen his military grade review determination,' said Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot. 'The Secretary informed General Milley today that he is revoking the authorization for his security detail and suspending his security clearance as well,' he said. Milley served as chairman during President Donald Trump's first term in office. While the relationship initially went well, it soured deeply and fast, as Milley tried to advise and contain the president on a host of issues. Milley pushed back on the president's interest in using force domestically to quell protestors after the death of George Floyd, and he was at the center of a controversy in 2021 when he made independent calls to his Chinese counterpart. Trump called the calls an act of treason, but at the time Milley said the calls were routine and part of the scope of his job. Milley in his final days as chairman after Trump had left office was equally outspoken about his former boss. He said at his official retirement ceremony ' we don’t take an oath to a king or a queen or to a tyrant or a dictator. And we don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator.' 'We don’t take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the Constitution, and we take an oath to the idea that is America, and we’re willing to die to protect it,' he said at the time. Hegseth's chief of staff Joe Kasper said that the decision to strip Milley of his clearance and detail was taken because 'undermining the chain of command is corrosive to our national security, and restoring accountability is a priority for the Defense Department under President Trump’s leadership.' The moves, which were first reported by Fox News, also may include taking down Milley's Army chief of staff portrait. Milley's chairman portrait was stripped from the wall just hours after Trump was sworn in. The portraits were both paid for by a donation from the Association of the United States Army, not taxpayer dollars, and were a gift to Milley honoring his service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/defense-secretary-pulls-trump-critic-gen-milley-s-security-clearance-protective-detail/7955395.html	2025-01-29T06:32:38-08:00

Australian police foil antisemitic attack involving explosives	SYDNEY — Australian police said on Wednesday they had foiled a planned antisemitic attack after discovering a caravan containing explosives, in an escalation of threats against the Jewish community that authorities called terrorism. The caravan was discovered on Jan. 19 in Dural, a suburb some 36 kms northwest of the center of Sydney, New South Wales Deputy Police Commissioner David Hudson told a news conference. 'That caravan contained an amount of explosives, and some indication that those explosives might be used in some form of antisemitic attack,' he told a news conference. The threat had been fully contained and there was no further threat to the Jewish community, he added. Hudson said arrests had been made but did not disclose how many or what the charges were. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said over 100 officers were investigating the incident, under a joint counter-terrorism operation involving state and federal police. 'This is the discovery of a potential mass casualty event. There is only one way of calling it out, and that is terrorism,' he said. Australia has suffered a spate of antisemitic incidents in recent months, with attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war in late 2023. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose center-left Labor Party faces reelection in polls that must be held by May, has been criticized by the opposition over the rise in antisemitic incidents in the country. The government says it has taken extra steps to protect the Jewish community, including more funding and a federal taskforce to investigate antisemitic incidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-police-foil-antisemitic-attack-involving-explosives-/7955227.html	2025-01-29T03:43:15-08:00	
Plan to get electricity to more Africans wins $8B in new pledges	DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA — An initiative to connect 300 million Africans to electricity in the next six years has won new pledges worth more than $8 billion from lenders including the Islamic Development Bank and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Mission 300 initiative, launched by the World Bank and the African Development Bank in April, is projected to cost $90 billion. Its implementation faces challenges because the economies of countries in the region are severely constrained, mainly due to sluggish revenue and high debt service costs. 'Our national balance sheets are insufficient... to achieve Mission 300's objectives,' Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema told an Africa energy summit in Tanzania. Funding for the project is expected to come from multilateral development banks, development agencies, private businesses and philanthropic organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation, which is part of the initiative. Muhammad al Jasser, chairman of the Islamic Development Bank, said in a statement released during the summit that ended on Tuesday, that the Jeddah-headquartered bank was committing $2.65 billion in project financing and another $2 billion to insure power projects in Africa. Beijing-based AIIB is set to provide $1-1.5 billion in financing. 'Six hundred million people in Africa without access to electricity is intolerable,' said AIIB President Jin Liqun. Others funding the project include the French Development Agency (AFD), which committed to providing $1.04 billion, and the OPEC Fund for International Development, which made an initial commitment of $1 billion, the AfDB said in a closing statement. The additional finance builds on commitments of up to $48 billion from the World Bank and the AfDB, officials at the summit said. The two organizations' contributions could be increased during implementation, they said. Provision of 300 million people with access to electricity, half of those currently without power on the continent, is a crucial building block for boosting Africa's development by creating new jobs, said World Bank President Ajay Banga. Half of the targeted new connections will get electricity from existing national grids, officials said at the summit, while the other half will be from renewable energy sources, including wind and solar mini-grids. Apart from lighting up homes and businesses, Mission 300 is expected to boost the provision of clean cooking energy to homes, cutting reliance on wood and charcoal which are harmful, said Tanzania's president, Samia Suluhu Hassan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/plan-to-get-electricity-to-more-africans-wins-8b-in-new-pledges/7955202.html	2025-01-29T02:23:45-08:00	
Trump administration offers resignation program amid effort to shrink federal workforce	The Trump administration issued a memo Tuesday offering federal government workers a financial incentive to leave their posts by the end of September. The resignation program is part of the administration’s efforts to shrink the federal workforce. An email to many of the 2 million federal workers said they could remain on the government payroll until Sept. 30, the end of the government’s fiscal year, and could have their work duties reduced or eliminated in the interim. Those workers would also be exempt from a Trump mandate that employees need to return to working in their offices full time. Employees have until Feb. 6 to accept the offer, and were directed to do so with an email reply with the word 'resign.' The potential impact of the program on tax-payer services was not clear. 'While a few agencies and even branches of the military are likely to see increases in the size of their workforce, the majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force,' the memo said. People working in immigration, national security and for the Postal Service were not part of the offer. The memo also said the 'federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work.' Unions representing federal employees criticized the administration’s move. The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 150,000 federal workers, told its members the resignation memo 'is designed to entice or scare you into resigning' and said 'we strongly urge you not to resign in response.' Everett Kelley, head of the American Federation of Government Employees union that includes some VOA employees, said in a statement that the offer 'should not be viewed as voluntary' and that the administration’s actions show its goal is 'to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.'

Tiger poachers use fishing boats to smuggle body parts out of Malaysia, study shows	Bangkok — Commercial fishing fleets have been playing a key role in trafficking parts of tigers poached in Malaysia, according to research released Wednesday that could help enforcement efforts to save the critically endangered cat. The fishing boats are part of a network of routes used by sophisticated teams of poachers to move parts of illegally killed Malayan Tigers and other poached animals to Vietnam, according to the study by conservation organizations Panthera and ZSL, in conjunction with Malaysia's Sunway University. Through interviews with more than four dozen people involved in the operations, including poachers and those who brokered sales of the illicit goods, researchers found that fishing boats were able to carry larger consignments, cheaper, and less likely to be checked by customs than land or air routes. 'To really crack a problem and insert the right intervention that's going to have any impact you have to understand the thing, inside out,' said Panthara's Rob Pickles, the lead author of the study, in a phone interview from Kuala Lumpur. 'That's what we hope that this study does — contribute to that depth of understanding of the problem, to allow us to tailor the interventions.' From a population estimated at some 3,000 tigers in the middle of the 20th century, the latest estimates are that there are only about 150 of the cats left in Malaysia. The big cats already have gone extinct in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam over the last 25 years. In addition to poaching, tigers have lost much of their habitat to deforestation, and they have been falling victim in recent years to the canine distemper virus while a major source of food, the wild boar, has been decimated by the African swine fever virus. 'It's their last gasp,' Pickles said. 'This is the last chance to turn things around.' The tigers live in the forests of peninsular Malaysia, which is connected by land to Thailand to the north. They have also been targeted by poachers from Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, but researchers said the Vietnamese teams operate on a 'different order of magnitude.' Almost all from the poor, rural and rugged province of Quang Binh, where many took to the jungles to escape relentless American bombing during the Vietnam War, the poachers use well-honed bushcraft skills to live as small teams in the forests for three to five months at a time on poaching excursions. They capture wild tigers with heavy steel snares made of wires as thick as a person's index finger, as well as other animals. Once caught, the tigers are killed and processed largely for their bones, which are boiled for days until they become a gelatinous glue-like substance that is pressed into small blocks and sold for perceived medicinal benefits. Claws and teeth are used to make amulets. As Malaysia went on lockdown during the COVID pandemic, poaching operations came to a near standstill. The researchers were able to use the time to find and interview more than 50 individuals involved in the operations for the study, which was done in two phases, concluding in 2024. Researchers learned that fishing boats were also used to carry bear paws and bile, live civets, wild boar tusks and meat, pangolins, monitor lizards and turtles. One person told researchers the fishing boats were ideal to send larger items like tiger skins. 'Nobody checks,' the interviewee was quoted as saying. 'In addition, people can go back by boat, so many things also can be brought back by this route.' Malaysia and Vietnam have both been increasing maritime controls recently, making trafficking by fishing boats riskier. Malaysian authorities have also had success in catching poachers and have substantially increased punishments for wildlife crime in recent years, though the study also found that the managers who send the teams into the forests are rarely caught and can easily recruit replacements. Researchers also learned that many Vietnamese poachers take on significant debt to travel to Malaysia. They recommend that, in addition to focusing more on fishing boats, authorities should target potential poachers in their home villages in Quang Binh with information about the increasing risks and diminishing returns, to try and dissuade them from coming to Malaysia in the first place. Officials in Malaysia and Vietnam, both of which were celebrating public holidays this week, did not respond to requests for comment on the survey and its recommendations. 'We can’t arrest our way out of a problem or over-rely on the criminal justice system,' said ZSL's Gopalasamy Reuben Clements, a co-author of the report. 'We need to explore other approaches, such as highly targeted behavioral change interventions, that can run in parallel to arrests and prosecutions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiger-poachers-use-fishing-boats-to-smuggle-body-parts-out-of-malaysia-study-shows-/7955187.html	2025-01-29T01:43:02-08:00	
Passenger plane catches fire at S. Korean airport, 176 people evacuated	SEOUL, South Korea — A passenger plane caught fire before takeoff at an airport in South Korea late Tuesday, but all 176 people on board were safely evacuated, authorities said. The Airbus plane operated by South Korean airline Air Busan was preparing to leave for Hong Kong when its rear parts caught fire at Gimhae International Airport in the southeast, the Transport Ministry said in a statement. The plane's 169 passengers, six crewmembers and one engineer were evacuated using an escape slide, the ministry said. The National Fire Agency said in a release that three people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation. The fire agency said the fire was completely put out at 11:31 p.m., about one hour after it deployed firefighters and fire trucks at the scene. The cause of the fire wasn't immediately known. The Transport Ministry said the plane is an A321 model. Tuesday's incident came a month after a Jeju Air passenger plane crashed at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. It was one of the deadliest disasters in South Korea’s aviation history. The Boeing 737-800 skidded off the airport's runaway on Dec. 29 after its landing gear failed to deploy, slamming into a concrete structure and bursting into flames. The flight was returning from Bangkok and all of the victims were South Koreans except for two Thai nationals. The first report on the crash released Monday said authorities have confirmed traces of bird strikes in the plane’s engines, though officials haven’t determined the cause of the accident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/passenger-plane-catches-fire-at-s-korean-airport-176-people-evacuated-/7955184.html	2025-01-29T01:23:19-08:00	
Rwanda's Kagame says he agrees with US on need for ceasefire in Congo	GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — Rwanda's President Paul Kagame said he agreed with the U.S. government on the need for a ceasefire in eastern Congo but gave no indication of bowing to calls for Rwandan troops and the M23 rebels they support to withdraw from Goma. The rebels marched into Goma, the largest city in Congo's east, on Monday in the worst escalation of a long-running conflict in more than a decade, leaving hospitals overwhelmed treating patients with gunshot, mortar and shrapnel wounds. The U.S. urged the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday to consider unspecified measures to halt the rebel offensive, which has forced tens of thousands from their homes. The council has the authority to impose sanctions. In Goma, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) North Kivu province, shops and houses had been looted but, after several days of intense fighting, the city was largely calm apart from some sporadic gunfire on Wednesday, residents said. 'Had a productive conversation with Secretary (of State Marco) Rubio on the need to ensure a ceasefire in Eastern DRC and address the root causes of the conflict once and for all,' Kagame wrote on X on Wednesday. Rubio told Kagame that Washington was 'deeply troubled' by the escalation in the three-decade conflict, which is rooted in the long fallout from the Rwandan genocide and the struggle for control of Congo's mineral resources. Congo and the head of U.N. peacekeeping have said Rwandan troops are present in Goma, backing up their M23 allies. Rwanda has said it is defending itself against the threat from Congolese militias, without directly commenting on whether its troops have crossed the border. 'The Secretary urged an immediate ceasefire in the region, and for all parties to respect sovereign territorial integrity,' the U.S. State Department said in a statement. The Congolese and Rwandan army exchanged fire across their shared border on Monday, UN sources said, as the rebels tried to consolidate control of Goma, a gateway for the trade of valuable tin and tantalum ores, for the second time in 13 years. Sporatic gunfire, looting At a stadium in Goma on Tuesday, hundreds of unarmed government soldiers and militia fighters sat on the football pitch while others lined up in what the M23 fighters described as a disarmament process, according to an unverified video seen by Reuters. 'Sporadic explosions and gunfire are still heard in the outlying districts of Goma. Quiet night after the rebels took over the city center but looting of businesses. Airport, internet, electricity and water cut off,' one resident said in a phone message. M23 is the latest in a string of ethnic Tutsi-led, Rwandan-backed insurgencies that have roiled Congo since the aftermath of the genocide in Rwanda 30 years ago, when Hutu extremists killed Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and then were toppled by the Tutsi-led forces led by Kagame. Rwanda says some of the ousted perpetrators have been sheltering in Congo since the genocide, forming militias with alliances with the Congolese government, and pose a threat to Congolese Tutsis and Rwanda itself. Congo rejects Rwanda's complaints, and says Rwanda has used its proxy militias to control and loot lucrative minerals such as coltan, which is used in digital smartphones. In the Congolese capital Kinshasa, 1,600 km west of Goma, protesters attacked a U.N. compound and embassies including those of Rwanda, France and the United States on Tuesday, angered at what they said was foreign interference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-s-kagame-says-he-agrees-with-us-on-need-for-ceasefire-in-congo/7955179.html	2025-01-29T01:13:21-08:00	
Russia reports destroying 104 drones as Ukraine targets some areas far from border	Russia said Wednesday it shot down 104 Ukrainian drones overnight as attacks targeted several areas that Ukrainian forces do not routinely assault deeper inside of Russia. The Russian Defense Ministry reported shooting down about three-quarters of the drones in areas along the Russia-Ukraine border, including over the Kursk, Bryansk, Smolensk and Belgorod regions. Smolensky Governor Vasily Anokhin said on Telegram that Ukraine tried to hit a nuclear power facility, but that there was no damage or casualties. In Belgorod, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a Ukrainian drone attacked an apartment building, injuring one person. One of the uncharacteristic attacks targeted the Nizhny Novgorod region, located southeast of Moscow and about 800 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The Russian Defense Ministry said it shot down three drones over the region. Governor Gleb Nikitin said drone fragments damaged a building and caused a fire, but did not hurt anyone. The damaged building appeared to belong to petrochemical company Sibur, which said it temporarily halted operations at its plant in Kstovo after drone debris sparked a fire. Russian air defenses also shot down Ukrainian drones over the Tver and Leningrad regions, north of Moscow, which are not among the areas typically included in Ukraine’s attacks. In Ukraine’s Mykolaiv region, Governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram that a Russian missile strike hit a food industry business, killing two people. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said Wednesday that Russian drones targeted port infrastructure, damaging multiple buildings but not causing any casualties. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged a metro station in the Ukrainian capital. Officials in Sumy said Ukrainian air defenses shot down two drones overnight.

Year of the Snake underway with Lunar New Year festivities	BEIJING — Lunar New Year festivals and prayers marked the start of the Year of the Snake around Asia and farther afield on Wednesday — including in Moscow. Hundreds of people lined up in the hours before midnight at the Wong Tai Sin Taoist temple in Hong Kong in a bid to be among the first to put incense sticks in the stands in front of the temple’s main hall. 'I wish my family will be blessed. I hope my business will run well. I pray for my country and wish people peace. I hope this coming year is a better year,' said Ming So, who visits the temple annually on the eve of the Lunar New Year. The holiday — known as the Spring Festival in China, Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in Korea — is a major festival celebrated by diaspora communities around the world. The snake, one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, follows the just-ended Year of the Dragon. The pop-pop-pop of firecrackers greeted the new year outside Guan Di temple in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, followed by lion dances to the rhythmic beat of drums and small cymbals. Ethnic Chinese holding incense sticks in front of them bowed several times inside the temple before sticking the incense into elaborate gold-colored pots, the smoke rising from the burning tips. Many Chinese who work in bigger cities return home during the eight-day national holiday in what is described as the world’s biggest annual movement of humanity. Beijing, China's capital, has turned into a bit of a ghost town, with many shops closed and normally crowded roads and subways emptied out. Traditionally, Chinese have a family dinner at home on New Year's Eve and visit 'temple fairs' on the Lunar New Year to watch performances and buy snacks, toys and other trinkets from booths. Many Chinese take advantage of the extended holiday to travel both in the country and abroad. Ctrip, an online booking agency that operates Trip.com, said the most popular overseas destinations this year are Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the United States, South Korea, Macao and Vietnam. Russians cheered, waved and took smartphone photos of a colorful procession with drummers, costumed dancers and large dragon and snake figures held aloft that kicked off a 10-day Lunar New Year festival in Moscow on Tuesday night. The Chinese and Russian governments have deepened ties since 2022, in part to push back against what they see as U.S. dominance of the world order. Visitors shouted 'Happy New Year' in Russian and expressed delight at being able to experience Chinese food and culture in Moscow, including folk performances and booths selling snacks and artwork.	https://www.voanews.com/a/year-of-the-snake-underway-with-lunar-new-year-festivities/7955159.html	2025-01-29T00:06:08-08:00	
US children fall behind in reading, make little improvement in math	WASHINGTON — America's children have continued to lose ground on reading skills in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and have made little improvement in math, according to the latest results of an exam known as the nation's report card. The findings are yet another setback for U.S. schools and reflect the myriad challenges that have upended education, from pandemic school closures to a youth mental health crisis and high rates of chronic absenteeism. The national exam results also show growing inequality: While the highest-performing students have started to regain lost ground, lower-performing students are falling further behind. Given every two years to a sample of America's children, the National Assessment of Educational Progress is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of the U.S. school system. The most recent exam was administered in early 2024 in every state, testing fourth- and eighth-grade students on math and reading. 'The news is not good,' said Peggy Carr, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, which oversees the assessment. 'We are not seeing the progress we need to regain the ground our students lost during the pandemic.' Among the few bright spots was an improvement in fourth grade math, where the average score ticked up 2 points on a scale of 500. It's still 3 points lower than the 2019 pre-pandemic average, yet some states and districts made significant strides, including in Washington, D.C., where the average score increased 10 points. For the most part, however, American schools have not yet begun to make progress. The average math score for eighth grade students was unchanged from 2022, while reading scores fell 2 points at both grade levels. One-third of eighth grade students scored below 'basic' in reading, more than ever in the history of the assessment. Students are considered below basic if they are missing fundamental skills. For example, eighth grade students who scored below basic in reading were typically unable to make a simple inference about a character's motivation after reading a short story, and some were unable to identify that the word 'industrious' means 'to be hard working.' Especially alarming to officials was the divide between higher- and lower-performing students, which has grown wider than ever. Students with the highest scores outperformed their peers from two years ago, making up some ground lost during the pandemic. But the lowest performers are scoring even lower, falling further behind. It was most pronounced in eighth grade math: While the top 10% of students saw their scores increased by 3 points, the lowest 10% decreased by 6 points. 'We are deeply concerned about our low-performing students,' said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policies for the exam. 'For a decade, these students have been on the decline. They need our urgent attention and our best effort.' The latest setbacks follow a historic backslide in 2022. In that year's exam, student achievement fell across both subjects and grade levels, in some cases by unprecedented levels. This round of testing again featured students whose lives were disrupted by the pandemic. When COVID hit in 2020, the fourth graders were in kindergarten, and the eighth graders were in fourth grade. But Carr said poor results can no longer be blamed solely on the pandemic, warning that the nation's education system faces 'complex challenges.' A survey done alongside the exam found in 2022 that fewer young students were reading for enjoyment, which is linked to lower reading scores. And new survey results found that students who are often absent from class — a persistent problem nationwide — are struggling the most. 'The data are clear,' Carr said. 'Students who don't come to school are not improving.' The results provide fresh fuel for a national debate over the impact of pandemic school closures, though they're unlikely to add clarity. Some studies have found that longer closures led to bigger academic setbacks. Those slower to reopen were often in urban and Democratic-led areas, while more rural and Republican-led areas were quicker. The new results don't show a 'direct link' on the topic, Carr said, though she said students clearly do better when they're in school. Among the states that saw reading scores fall in 2024 are Florida and Arizona, which were among the first to return to the classroom during the pandemic. Meanwhile, some big school systems that had longer closures made strides in fourth grade math, including Los Angeles and New York City. The success of big urban districts — 14 of which saw notable improvement in fourth-grade math when the nation as a whole saw only minor gains — can be credited to academic recovery efforts funded by federal pandemic relief, said Ray Hart, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools. Investing in efforts like intensive tutoring programs and curriculum updates is 'really proving to make a difference,' he said. Republicans in Congress were quick to cast blame on Democrats and former President Joe Biden's administration. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the decline is 'clearly a reflection of the education bureaucracy continuing to focus on woke policies rather than helping students learn and grow.' 'I'm thankful we have an administration that is looking to reverse course,' he said in a reference to President Donald Trump. Compared with 2019 results, eighth grade reading scores are now down 8 points. Reading scores are down 5 points in both grades. And in fourth grade math, scores are down 3 points. Yet officials say there's reason to be optimistic. Carr highlighted improvement in Louisiana, where fourth grade reading is now back above pre-pandemic levels, and in Alabama, which accomplished that feat in fourth grade math. Carr was especially laudatory of Louisiana, where a campaign to improve reading proficiency resulted in both higher- and lower-performing students exceeding 2019 scores. 'I would not say that hope is lost, and I would not say that we cannot turn this around,' Carr said. 'It's been demonstrated that we can.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-children-fall-behind-in-reading-make-little-improvement-in-math/7955152.html	2025-01-28T23:26:14-08:00	
US envoy visiting Israel to discuss Israel-Hamas ceasefire	U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is expected for talks Wednesday in Israel focused on implementation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza and negotiations for the next phase of the agreement. Witkoff stressed ahead of his visit the need for proper implementation of the deal, which halted 15 months of fighting and already has brought the release of seven hostages held by Hamas and 300 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. More releases are set to take place in the coming days. Witkoff’s visit comes ahead of a planned visit to Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. U.S. President Donald Trump has invited Netanyahu for talks on Feb. 4. The first phase of the ceasefire lasts for 42 days, about one-quarter of which has passed, and calls for the release of 33 hostages from Gaza as well as negotiations on the details of the second phase involving the release of the rest of the hostages, and end to the conflict and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Those talks are due to begin next week. Palestinians in Gaza have been allowed back into some areas long held off-limits by Israeli troops, including northern Gaza where the United Nations said Tuesday more than 375,000 people have returned this week. About 1 million people fled the area in the early days of the war and those returning are coming back to an area that has been devastated by Israeli military operations against Hamas. Under the ceasefire deal, the United Nations has been facilitating a surge in humanitarian aid to Gaza. The U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday that aid deliveries have 'meaningfully expanded,' including reaching areas that aid workers had been unable to reach. 'Field assessments reveal massive levels of destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure, particularly in northern Gaza, underlining the critical need to ramp up rehabilitation and repair efforts to meet basic human needs,' the agency said. Rebuilding Gaza is the focus of the final phase of the ceasefire agreement, while who will govern the territory that has been under Hamas rule since 2007 remains unclear. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed in a phone call Tuesday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty the need to work together 'to advance post-conflict planning to ensure Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again,' the U.S. State Department said in a statement. The United States, Egypt and Qatar were the key mediators in months of negotiations that yielded the ceasefire deal. Trump has drawn criticism in recent days for his repeated suggestion to forcibly relocate large numbers of Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Jordan and Egypt. Palestinians and Arab states, including Egypt and Jordan, have rejected Trump’s idea to take in Palestinians, fearing their displacement would become permanent. The war in Gaza started with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 47,300 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials. The Israeli military said the death toll includes 17,000 militants.

Russian diplomats make first Syria visit since Assad's fall	MOSCOW — The first Russian official delegation to visit Syria since the toppling of long-term Moscow ally Bashar al-Assad has arrived in Damascus, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday. The visit comes with Moscow keen to secure the fate of two military bases there and after Russian President Vladimir Putin denied that Moscow had suffered a strategic 'defeat' in the Middle East following the fall of Assad. The Russian delegation due to meet the new leadership of the war-ravaged country included deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov, who is also Putin's special envoy on the Middle East and Africa, as well as Alexander Lavrentyev, the president's special envoy on Syria, the RIA Novosti agency reported. It said it was 'the first visit by Russian officials to Damascus' since Assad fled in December in the face of a lightning rebel advance across the country. Moscow was one of Assad's key backers, intervening in Syria's civil war in 2015 in his favor. He and his family fled to Russia after his ouster by Turkish-backed rebels formerly affiliated with Al-Qaida. Russia is now seeking to secure the fate of its naval base in Tartus and its air base at Khmeimim - both on Syria's Mediterranean coast and Moscow's only military outposts outside the former Soviet Union - with the new Syrian authorities. A report by RT Arabic, a Russian state-controlled channel, said the delegation is set to meet Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani and other officials. Russia's Bogdanov was a diplomat in Syria in the 1980s and 1990s and speaks Arabic, according to the foreign ministry website. Lavrentyev took part in previous negotiations with Assad. Sharaa leads an Islamist group - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - that is banned in Russia as a 'terrorist' organization. The organization is rooted in Al-Qaida's Syria branch but has more recently adopted a more moderate tone. RT Arabic reported that Bogdanov described the visit as aimed at strengthening historic ties based on shared interests, and underlined Russia's hopes for Syrian unity and independence. 'Deep strategic interests' Sharaa in December noted the 'deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria' in an interview with the Al-Arabiya TV channel. 'All Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts... We do not want Russia to leave Syria in the way that some wish,' Sharaa added. Ukrainian diplomats visited Syria's new rulers in December, with Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga urging Sharaa to expel Russia from the country. 'We believe that from a strategic point of view, the removal of Russia's presence in Syria will contribute to the stability of not only the Syrian state, but the entire Middle East and Africa,' Sybiga told Sharaa while in Damascus, according to a statement. The Russian delegation's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity by the new rulers, aimed at building ties and easing sanctions. EU foreign ministers on Monday agreed to begin easing sanctions on Syria starting with key sectors such as energy. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday stressed the importance of 'ensuring that the new government prevents Syria from becoming a source for international terrorism' and 'denying foreign malign actors the opportunity to exploit Syria's transition.' Saudi Arabia's top diplomat, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, was received by Sharaa on Friday, making his first visit since Assad's overthrow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-diplomats-make-first-syria-visit-since-assad-s-fall/7955142.html	2025-01-28T22:28:34-08:00	
Several people are feared dead in a stampede at the massive Maha Kumbh festival in India	PRAYAGRAJ, India — Several people were feared dead and many more injured in a stampede early Wednesday as tens of thousands of Hindus rushed to take a holy bath in the river at the massive Maha Kumbh festival in northern India's Prayagraj city, local media reported. Distressed families lined up outside a makeshift hospital inquiring about their missing relatives, rescuers were helping the injured and police tried to manage the crowds. People’s belongings like clothes, blankets and backpacks were strewn around the scene of the stampede. It was not immediately clear what triggered the panic or how many people had been hurt. Some local news websites said 10 people had died. Wednesday was a sacred day during the six-week festival, and authorities were expecting a record 100 million devotees to engage in a ritual bath at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. The ritualistic bathing's main draw are thousands of ash-smeared Hindu ascetics who arrive in massive processions towards the confluence to take a holy dip in the waters. The incident did not appear to have deterred millions of Hindu pilgrims who continued to throng the site even as police officials urged them over megaphones to keep away from the confluence. Yogi Adityanath, chief minister of the Uttar Pradesh state, also urged people to not head toward the confluence and instead take baths at other riverbanks. Adityanath, in a post on social platform X, did not make any reference to the stampede but warned people not to 'pay attention to any rumors.' The Maha Kumbh festival, held every 12 years, started on Jan. 13 and is the world’s largest religious gathering. Authorities expect more than 400 million people to throng the pilgrimage site in total. Hindus believe that a dip at the confluence of three rivers — two worldly and one mythical — will cleanse them of their past sins and end their process of reincarnation. Indian authorities have touted the festival as the world’s largest religious gathering. Nearly 150 million people have already attended the festival, including the likes of Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah and celebrities like Coldplay’s Chris Martin. Authorities built a sprawling tent city on the riverbanks to accommodate visitors. It has 3,000 kitchens and 150,000 toilets, plus roads, electricity and water, communication towers and 11 hospitals. About 50,000 security personnel are stationed in the city to maintain law and order and manage crowds. Authorities also installed more than 2,500 cameras, some powered by AI, to send crowd movement and density information to four central control rooms, where officials can quickly deploy personnel to avoid stampedes. In 2013, at least 40 pilgrims who were taking part in the same festival were killed in a stampede at a train station in Prayagraj. Deadly stampedes are relatively common around Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas with shoddy infrastructure and few safety measures. In July at least 116 people died, most of them women and children, when thousands at a religious gathering in northern India stampeded at a tent in Hathras town.	https://www.voanews.com/a/several-people-are-feared-dead-in-a-stampede-at-the-massive-maha-kumbh-festival-in-india/7955135.html	2025-01-28T22:05:13-08:00	
Singapore oil firm urged to quit war-torn Myanmar	BANGKOK — Singapore-based petroleum company Interra Resources is being accused by an activist group in Myanmar of complicity in alleged war crimes committed by Myanmar’s military government. The group Justice for Myanmar said Interra Resources’ majority stake in energy company Goldpetrol makes it complicit in war crimes because Goldpetrol produces and sells millions of barrels of oil that benefits the country’s military government. In a report released Wednesday, Justice for Myanmar said Interra holds 60% of the Goldpetrol Joint Operating Company. The report describes the venture as one of the few remaining companies in Myanmar still extracting oil from the country’s onshore fields since the military overthrew a democratically elected government in February 2021, setting off a civil war that has killed thousands of civilians and displaced over 3 million people. 'Interra Resources must take action now so that it is consistent with its international human rights responsibilities. This necessarily involves stopping the supply of crude oil to the junta. It needs to decide the most responsible way to do this, and it may involve suspending operations or divestment,' Yadanar Maung, a Justice for Myanmar spokesperson, told VOA ahead of the report’s release. Interra did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment. Justice for Myanmar said Interra’s annual reports and leaked financial statements from Goldpetrol reveal that all of Goldpetrol’s oil production goes to the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) — more than 2.3 million barrels from 2021 to 2023, the last full year of available data. Those sales, the group said, have been earning Interra record profits. It said the firm reported $24.5 million and $19.1 million in crude oil sales to MOGE in 2022 and 2023, respectively, far more than in any of the previous five years. The average annual profits for the previous five years is $12.9 million. Citing in its report anonymous sources with knowledge of Goldpetrol’s operations and the country’s oil supply chains, Justice for Myanmar said the crude Goldpetrol is pumping out of its two fields heads to the Mann refinery in the country’s Magwe region, which supplies the area’s military bases with jet fuel and other refined oil products. The refinery sits in the heart of Myanmar’s military weapons-making hub, between an air force base and a gunpowder mill. Since the coup, the military claims it has been fighting so-called 'terrorists' -- armed rebel groups -- with proportionate force to restore peace and order. But United Nations experts and others have repeatedly accused the junta of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. As the junta continues to lose ground to armed rebel groups across the country, the U.N. said, it is resorting ever more to indiscriminate artillery and airstrikes on civilian areas, destroying scores of churches, schools and clinics and razing whole villages. Conflict data collected by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a U.K.-based research group, show a gradual drop in armed clashes since late 2023 but a rise in air and drone strikes, including a record 345 in October. A military airstrike in January on a village under rebel control in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state, which borders Magwe, reportedly killed about 40 people, including women and children. Justice for Myanmar said Interra bears some of the responsibility. 'Interra Resources is complicit in the junta's international crimes through the supply of crude oil. This oil fuels Myanmar military operations that indiscriminately target civilians and amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,' Yadanar Maung said. 'The domestic production of fuel is particularly important for the junta, given the impact of sanctions against junta banks and its aviation fuel supply chain,' the spokesperson added. The U.S. and other Western governments have imposed sanctions on a number of Myanmar banks and firms owned by or in business with the country’s miliary since the coup in 2021, including some handling jet fuel sales and supplies. Besides urging Interra to consider suspending its Myanmar operations or selling off its shares in Goldpetrol, Justice for Myanmar said Singapore’s stock exchange should investigate Interra for any breaches of its rules. Trading in another listed firm was halted in 2021 because of its operations in Myanmar, which the exchange had designated a 'sanctioned nation.' The stock exchange did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment. Justice for Myanmar said Interra told the activist group ahead of the report’s launch that Goldpetrol’s contract with MOGE requires it to sell all its crude oil to the government, and that the joint venture has continued supplying MOGE after the coup to fulfill its 'contractual obligations.' The group said Interra declined to comment on how that oil was being used. Amnesty International, which has also investigated Myanmar’s jet fuel supply chains, said the military’s airstrikes continue to devastate civilian areas, driving even schools to build bomb shelters. 'Airstrikes are only becoming more frequent, and aviation fuel remains a key asset for the Myanmar military, which is why we continue to call for states and companies to suspend shipments,' Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman told VOA. The group said public pressure has convinced some of the foreign firms along Myanmar’s jet fuel supply chain to pull out but said their exit does not always solve the problem. 'After that departure, either local companies with even closer ties to the Myanmar military entered the scene or regional companies with limited international operations —and for the most part, immune to sanctions — came in to fill the void. We have seen this happen in a number of business sectors in Myanmar,' Freeman said. Goldpetrol’s other shareholder that owns the remaining 40% stake in the company is North Petroleum International, a subsidiary of the China North Industries Group Corporation, a Chinese state-owned weapons conglomerate doing business worldwide as NORINCO. China has been the Myanmar military’s main weapons supplier since the coup, along with Russia. It also has billions of dollars invested in Myanmar’s energy sector, including parallel oil and gas pipelines that stretch across the country from the Bay of Bengal to China’s Yunnan province. China North Industries Group did not reply to VOA’s request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-oil-firm-urged-to-quit-war-torn-myanmar/7955125.html	2025-01-28T21:16:58-08:00	
ICE to use U.S. military base in Colorado to detain undocumented migrants	WASHINGTON — The U.S. military said on Tuesday it will allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain undocumented migrants at Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado, further widening the Pentagon's role in President Donald Trump's undocumented immigration crackdown. The decision comes on top of U.S. military deportation flights of undocumented migrants out of the country and the deployment of just over 1,600 active-duty troops to the U.S. border with Mexico following Trump's emergency declaration on undocumented immigration last week. The U.S. military's Northern Command said in a statement it started providing facilities at Buckley to ICE starting on Monday 'to enable U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stage and process criminal aliens within the U.S.' 'ICE requirements for the facility include a temporary operations center, staging area, and a temporary holding location for the receiving, holding, and processing of illegal aliens,' Northern Command said in the statement. 'This facility will be manned by ICE senior leaders, special agents, and analysts, as well as members of (Department of Homeland Security) components and other federal law enforcement agencies.' Northern Command did not say how many undocumented migrants might be detained at Buckley or whether additional U.S. military bases might soon be opening for detention of undocumented migrants. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Buckley Space Force Base is located in the city of Aurora, a Denver suburb, which figured prominently during Trump's presidential campaign last year. Trump said during his campaign that apartment complexes in Aurora had been taken over by members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, a claim refuted by top city officials at the time. During a campaign event there in October, Trump pledged to launch an Operation Aurora targeting gang members. This is not the first time a military has been used to house undocumented migrants. The Pentagon had approved requests to house unaccompanied migrant children under Joe Biden's administration and undocumented migrant children and families during Trump's first term. Trump, a Republican, issued an array of executive orders on Monday aimed at deporting record numbers of migrants in the U.S. without legal status. In a little more than a week in office, Trump rolled back Biden-era guidance that limited arrests of non-criminal migrants, ordered other federal law enforcement to assist with immigration work, and scrapped a Biden policy that restricted enforcement at schools, churches, hospitals and other sensitive locations. Immigration arrests have reached about 1,000-1,200 per day in recent days, according to ICE, far above the daily average of 311 in fiscal year 2024. Critics say Trump's immigration crackdown could separate families, hurt U.S. businesses and violate due process rights of migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ice-to-use-u-s-military-base-in-colorado-to-detain-undocumented-migrants/7955124.html	2025-01-28T21:03:58-08:00	
Caroline Kennedy calls on US lawmakers to oppose RFK Jr.'s health post	Caroline Kennedy, a member of the famed U.S. political family, urged senators on Tuesday to reject her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination to lead the top U.S. health agency, calling him a 'predator' and his healthcare views 'dangerous.' The daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, Caroline Kennedy said that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known as RFK Jr., has discouraged vaccinations for his own profit. She added he does not have the medical, financial or government experience to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Republican President Donald Trump nominated him in November. A spokesperson for RFK Jr. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Senators will question RFK Jr. on Wednesday starting at 10 a.m. about his views before they vote on whether to confirm his nomination. The Washington Post first reported the letter. RFK Jr. has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevent deaths for decades. He disputes the anti-vaccine characterization and has said he would not prevent Americans from getting inoculations. 'Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie and cheat his way through life today,' Caroline Kennedy said in a video on social media platform X, in which she read her letter addressed to senators. U.S. doctors, nurses, researchers, scientists and caregivers 'deserve a secretary committed to advancing cutting-edge medicine, to save lives, not to rejecting the advances we have already made,' said Caroline Kennedy, a former ambassador to Australia and Japan who served during the Democratic Biden and Obama administrations. 'They deserve a stable, moral and ethical person at the helm of this crucial agency.' In written testimony for the Finance committee, RFK Jr. said he is not 'anti-vaccine' or 'anti-industry' and that he believes 'vaccines have a critical role in healthcare,' pointing to his own children being vaccinated, according to the document seen by Reuters. However, RFK Jr. has led the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense and in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman said no vaccines are safe and effective. RFK Jr. has said he wants to work to end chronic disease, break any ties between employees at the U.S. drug regulator and industry and advise U.S. water systems to remove fluoride. RFK Jr. has faced new scrutiny over his ties to Wisner Baum, a law firm specializing in pharmaceutical drug injury cases. He has an arrangement to earn 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases he refers to the firm, according to a letter RFK Jr. wrote to an HHS ethics official released last week. If confirmed, RFK Jr. would retain that financial interest in cases that do not directly impact the U.S. government, the letter said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/caroline-kennedy-calls-on-us-lawmakers-to-oppose-rfk-jr-s-health-post/7955119.html	2025-01-28T20:42:00-08:00	
Trump administration freezes foreign development assistance	WHITE HOUSE — The Trump administration has ordered a three-month pause on almost all foreign development assistance pending a review to see what fits in with the president's 'America First' policy. Aid groups and human rights watchdogs warn that the freeze will put countless lives around the world at risk. The U.S. is the world’s largest provider of humanitarian assistance and a global leader on HIV prevention and treatment through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, program. In the 2023 fiscal year, the U.S. spent just short of $70 billion on development aid, most of it through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. Within hours of taking office last week, President Donald Trump put all but the most urgently needed food assistance on hold, part of his charge to realign the nation's foreign stance with his America First policy. His executive order pauses new obligations and disbursements of development assistance funds for 90 days while they are reviewed. The move prompted questions in the U.S. and international aid community, at the United Nations, and in the halls of the Capitol. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a memo Tuesday exemptions to the freeze. These include life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter and subsistence assistance. 'This waiver does not apply to activities that involve abortions, family planning conferences, administrative costs ... gender or DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] ideology programs, transgender surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance,' the memo said. On Tuesday, Jim Risch, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, used a weekly press conference to cast Trump’s move as fostering greater transparency as he lamented that previously it had been tough for the committee to get information from government agencies. The State Department on Tuesday issued a lengthy explainer on the order, which it said seeks to ensure that programs are 'efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.' 'President Trump stated clearly that the United States is no longer going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people,' read the statement from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. 'Reviewing and realigning foreign assistance on behalf of hardworking taxpayers is not just the right thing to do, it is a moral imperative.' Exceptions, Bruce continued, included foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and emergency food assistance. The memo also provided 'examples of this egregious funding,' which included expenditures as large as $102 million to fund humanitarian aid nonprofit International Medical Corps’ work in war-battered Gaza and as relatively small as '$612,000 to fund technical assistance for family planning in Latin America.' The White House also laid out its rationale for a similar move pausing domestic grants and loans starting on Tuesday, although press secretary Karoline Leavitt was unable to clarify which domestic programs are on pause. 'In the past four years, we've seen the Biden administration spend money like drunken sailors,' she said. 'It's a big reason we've had an inflation crisis in this country. And it's incumbent upon this administration to make sure, again, that every penny is being accounted for, honestly.' The White House did not reply to VOA’s request for more details on which foreign assistance programs would be impacted. But on global public health issues, Trump’s stance is clear: He also announced, on his first day in office, that he would pull out of the World Health Organization, citing concerns that the U.S. is being 'ripped off' as the organization’s largest donor. He did the same during his first term. As stop-work orders are rolled out at U.S.-funded programs in dozens of countries, humanitarian groups are sounding the alarm about the future of billions of dollars' worth of programs that focus on issues such as gender equity, business development and the provision of U.S.-funded HIV drugs, which Biden officials called a 'key pillar' of Washington’s relations with the developing world. 'The secretary-general notes with concern the announcement of a pause in U.S. foreign assistance,' said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the United Nations secretary-general. 'He calls for additional exemptions to be considered to ensure the continued delivery of critical development and humanitarian activities for the most vulnerable communities around the world. Those lives and livelihoods depend on this support.' The largest single USAID project last year provided $14 billion in macroeconomic assistance to Ukraine — critical, Ukraine has said, for supporting its population while fending off a Russian invasion. 'There are real concerns about the immediate impact of a stop-work order on foreign assistance,' said Esther Brimmer, James H. Binger senior fellow in global governance at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'We must remember that foreign assistance includes such humanitarian projects that relate to administration of vaccines, for example, to children around the world to make sure that they don't get communicable diseases.' Human rights watchdogs say they welcome robust accountability over U.S. taxpayer funds but not pausing assistance during the review. 'If you want to review all of the assistance, start your review,' said Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch. 'He wants to be the president that reinstates U.S. influence around the world and also helps America prosper,' Widdersheim said, speaking of Trump. 'You're not going to be able to prosper if you're not going to help a country get out of conflict, if you're not going to help a country become democratic and have trusted institutions that work and protect investors' money and have a good business climate established and a good environment for investing in doing business and trade. I mean, that is the bottom line for development assistance.' And the impact was also felt in direct ways on Tuesday. In Johannesburg, South Africa, workers at the city’s many U.S.-funded HIV organizations awoke to stop-work orders. 'I never thought I’d wake up in the morning and be told that I’d be banned from going to work,' a health worker told a leading Johannesburg newspaper. She gave her name only as Mary, saying she feared professional backlash. 'I’m breaching my Hippocratic oath to do no harm and to do good,' she continued. 'I’m not there, which is harming people … and I take that oath very seriously.' Kim Lewis contributed to this report.

Truth struggles against propaganda and censorship on China’s DeepSeek AI	Washington — Just one week after its initial release, China’s new artificial intelligence assistant, DeepSeek, has shocked American financial markets, technology companies and consumers, rocking confidence in America's lead on emerging large-language models. The tool caused a nearly $1 trillion loss in market value for U.S.-based companies with connections to AI. DeepSeek has beat out ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app on Apple’s app store. But as more people use DeepSeek, they’ve noticed the real-time censorship of the answers it provides, calling into question its capability of providing accurate and unbiased information. The app has gone through a series of real-time updates to the content it can display in its answers. Users have discovered that questions DeepSeek was previously able to answer are now met with the message, 'Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.' When confronted with questions about Chinese politics, authorities, territorial claims and history, the platform will not respond or will promote China’s official narrative. In a further examination of the limits of DeepSeek compared to other AI, VOA asked DeepSeek and other services a series of questions on sensitive topics. Here are some of the responses: VOA: Describe the current state of U.S.-China relations. DeepSeek: U.S.-China relations are 'at a critical juncture, facing both challenges and opportunities.' 'China is willing to work with the United States to follow the principles of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation, to promote the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations, and to make positive contributions to world peace and development.' ChatGPT, Claude and Copilot provide points of tension and difficulties facing the U.S.-China relationship. VOA: What is the history of Tiananmen Square? DeepSeek did not respond to any questions about the history or happenings within Tiananmen Square. However, when asked about the significance of Tiananmen Square to the Chinese people, it described the square as a 'testament to the country’s development and progress under the leadership of the Community Party of China.' The 1989 crackdown on student pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square has stained China’s human rights record and presented the regime with a serious challenge as it has attempted to omit the event from Chinese public consciousness. Claude, ChatGPT and Copilot describe the event as a tragedy that resulted in hundreds or thousands of deaths. VOA: Who is the current leader of China? Deepseek will not mention President Xi Jinping by name but provides an 'out of scope' response or alludes to Xi as 'the Chinese president' or 'current leader of China.' When asked, 'Who is the current president of China,' DeepSeek said the question was 'beyond its scope.' The program redirects questions about Xi it deems inappropriate. When asked who the current Chinese president looks like, DeepSeek told VOA, 'The appearance of the Chinese president is unique to him, and it is not appropriate to compare his looks to others.' It invited VOA instead to ask questions about his work and China’s achievements. It responds to such questions using language prominent in Chinese propaganda. 'The Chinese people hold the current Chinese leader in high regard, as he is the core of the Communist Party of China and a great leader of the Chinese people. Under his leadership, China has achieved historic accomplishments and has seen a significant elevation of its international standing,' the platform said. VOA: Tell me about China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims. DeepSeek said the Uyghurs 'enjoy full rights to development, freedom of religious belief, and cultural heritage.' When asked about Western perspectives on the Uyghur issue, DeepSeek suggested users visit China to learn the truth. 'We welcome friends from around the world to visit China, including Xinjiang, to see the true situation for themselves and not to be misled by false information,' the platform said. China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims, an ethnic minority located in China’s westernmost Xinjiang province, has been labeled a 'genocide' by many Western analysts. Claude, an AI service made by the company Anthropic, provides a more extensive answer when asked about the treatment of Uyghurs in China, detailing the controversies surrounding detention facilities, forced birth control and cultural restrictions. VOA: Who controls Taiwan? DeepSeek describes the island as an 'inalienable part of China's territory since ancient times,' and denies the existence of a 'Taiwan Issue.' Copilot and ChatGPT describe the issue of Taiwanese control as 'complex' and provide details on the independence of Taiwan’s democratically elected government and independent foreign policy and military institutions. VOA: Who controls the South China Sea? DeepSeek: 'No single country controls the entire South China Sea. Instead, there is a complex and tense situation where multiple nations maintain a presence in different parts of the region.' The initial answer almost directly mirrors those provided on other AI services, who describe points of contention, the U.S.’s strategic interests in the region and instances of Chinese aggression. Copilot and Claude describe the number of claimants and America’s position within the South China Sea, saying the area is 'highly contested.' Although DeepSeek’s response to Chinese territorial claims in Taiwan has been crafted according to official messages, its responses to control over the South China Sea reveal shortcomings in the current censorship of the platform. Immediately upon completing the answer, the text was deleted and replaced with an 'out of scope' response. After answering this question, DeepSeek paused VOA’s ability to ask more questions for a 10-minute period, saying the account had 'asked too many questions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/truth-struggles-against-propaganda-and-censorship-on-china-s-deepseek-ai/7955109.html	2025-01-28T20:08:11-08:00	
Explosion forces crew to abandon Hong Kong-flagged ship in the Red Sea	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An explosion struck a Hong Kong-flagged container ship Tuesday as it traveled north through the Red Sea, sparking a major fire that forced its crew to abandon the vessel, shipping industry officials said. The ship was drifting and ablaze some 225 kilometers off the coast of Hodeida, a port city in Yemen held by the country's Houthi rebels, said the Diaplous Group, a maritime firm. It did not name the vessel. Data from NASA satellites tracking wildfires showed the blaze burning Tuesday and Wednesday off Eritrea's Dahlak Archipelago corresponded to satellite-tracking data from MarineTraffic.com for the location of the ASL Bauhinia, a Hong Kong-flagged container ship. It had been traveling from the United Arab Emirates' Jebel Ali port in Dubai to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, before beginning to drift Tuesday. It wasn't immediately clear what caused the fire in the Red Sea, which has been repeatedly targeted by attacks from the Houthis. The rebels said last week they were limiting their assaults following a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis did not immediately acknowledge the fire incident. The vessel was abandoned and the crew later rescued unharmed, another maritime industry official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as authorization hadn't been given to speak publicly about the incident. The official described the cargo aboard the vessel as 'dangerous,' without immediately elaborating. The ultimate owner of the ASL Bauhinia, CSSC Hong Kong Shipping Co. Ltd., could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. The Red Sea is home to coral and marine life that previously has been threatened by burning ships from the Houthi campaign and the threat of wider oil spills. The Houthi attacks, which began in November 2023, have halved the number of ships passing through the Red Sea corridor, a crucial route for energy shipments and cargo moving between Asia and Europe. Despite the pledge by the Houthis to limit their attacks, shippers broadly are still shying away from the route over the risks. Some $1 trillion worth of trade passed through the region each year before the attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/explosion-forces-crew-to-abandon-hong-kong-flagged-ship-in-the-red-sea/7955089.html	2025-01-28T19:11:39-08:00	
DRC tries to slow rebels’ assault amid reports of bodies in the streets	GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — Congolese security forces on Tuesday tried to slow the advance of Rwanda-backed M23 rebels who say they have captured Goma after entering eastern Congo's largest city. U.N. officials reported violence, looting and bodies in the streets. The officials said hospitals are overwhelmed in Goma, a regional trade and humanitarian hub that is now a refuge for hundreds of thousands fleeing gunfire and shelling in the major escalation of one of Africa's longest conflicts. The M23 rebels are one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the conflict-battered North Kivu province, which includes Goma and is rich in minerals critical to much of the world's technology. Reports of rapes, looting There were reports of gender-based violence and rape committed by fighters, looting of property, including a humanitarian warehouse, and humanitarian and health facilities being hit in the city, U.N. humanitarian affairs office spokesman Jens Laerke said at a media briefing on Tuesday. 'The humanitarian situation in and around Goma remains extremely worrying, and this morning (there were) heavy small arms fire and mortar fire across the city and the presence of many dead bodies in the streets,' said Laerke, adding that hospitals are 'struggling to manage the influx of wounded people.' Many continued to flee across the border into Rwanda, braving heavy rains and sometimes being caught between shootouts by the Congolese soldiers and the rebels. 'What we want is this war to come to an end,' said Christian Bahati, a Congolese teacher among hundreds now sheltering in the Rwandan town of Gisenyi. 'You can see the level of frustration. Congolese people are victims, but now they find themselves seeking refuge from the aggressor.' Growing anger in the capital Dozens of demonstrators looted and set fires to parts of at least 10 foreign embassy buildings far off in the capital, Kinshasa, including those of Rwanda, U.S., France, Belgium and Kenya. The protesters demanded that the international community condemn Rwanda over its role in the conflict. 'We denounce the hypocrisy of the international community,' said Timothée Tshishimbi, one of the protesters. 'They must tell Rwanda to stop this adventure.' The attacks were condemned by the respective countries as well as the Congolese government, which said it has reinforced the security at the embassies. Several countries, including the United States, United Kingdom and France have condemned Rwanda for the rebel advance. The African Union Peace and Security Council demanded the M23 and other rebel groups 'immediately and unconditionally withdraw and cease their attacks and permanently disband and lay down their arms.' M23 rebels emboldened, plan to set up administration in Goma It was unclear how much of Goma is controlled by the M23 rebels, though analysts say they are more emboldened than in 2012 when they temporarily took over the city before being forced to pull out under international pressure. They resurfaced in late 2021 with increasing support from Rwanda, according to Congo's government and U.N. experts. Rwanda has denied such support although U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. 'Since morning, we have heard bomb explosions and crackling bullets,' Sam Luwawa, a resident of Goma, said of the fighting in the city. 'So far we cannot say who really controls the city.' Seventeen peacekeepers and foreign soldiers have been killed in the fighting, according to U.N. and army officials. Manzi Ngarambe, a representative for the M23 diaspora, told the AP that the group is in control of Goma and plans to set up an administration in the city so people can continue living normal lives and displaced people can return home. Ngarambe said they would be willing to sit at the table with Congolese officials and denied that they were being supported by Rwanda. Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said that Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi 'will have to accept talks with M23 to end the situation once and for all.' Rwanda's goal in Congo is to protect its borders against attacks, army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Ronald Rwivanga told the AP, adding that appropriate measures would be 'all-encompassing,' including the use of water, air and land defense. Rwandan President Paul Kagame recently accused Congo of enlisting Hutu rebels and former militiamen that it blames for the 1994 genocide. Dire situation 'Key roads surrounding Goma are blocked, and the city's airport can no longer be used for evacuation and humanitarian efforts. Power and water have reportedly been cut to many areas of the city,' said David Munkley, head of operations in eastern Congo for the Christian aid group World Vision. Some analysts worry about the risk of a regional war if peace efforts led by Kenya fail. Past attempts at dialogue between Congolese and Rwandan leaders have failed, including in December when the meeting of the two leaders was canceled. Congo might seek support from countries like South Africa — whose troops are among foreign militaries in Congo — while Rwanda might be motivated to continue backing the M23 rebels, said Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group. 'The risk of a regional confrontation has never been higher,' Mutiga said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drc-tries-to-slow-rebels-assault-amid-reports-of-bodies-in-the-streets/7955076.html	2025-01-28T18:45:19-08:00	
Analysts: Rubio charts a course for countering China	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s Southeast and East Asia strategies will be aimed at countering China by toughening U.S. policies to secure regional peace and maximize American interests, analysts say. Rubio gave a glimpse of what U.S. foreign policy will look like as he began his first day as the head of the State Department last week. Speaking to his staff after he was sworn on Jan. 21, Rubio said, 'Our job across the world is to ensure that we have a foreign policy that advances the national interest of the United States.' Referencing President Donald Trump’s objective, Rubio continued that the 'overriding goal of global policy is the promotion of peace, the avoidance of conflict.' Putting 'America First' and achieving 'Peace through Strength' are twin pillars on which Trump said he will prop up the U.S. as he took office on Jan. 20. Rubio is currently likely to consult with country directors of the region and coordinate with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to formulate Asia Pacific strategies, said Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the Bush administration, to VOA Korean on Jan. 24. 'Secretary Rubio’s Southeast Asia policy will focus on countering China through stronger U.S. trade, security partnerships and supply chain diversification,' said Mark Kennedy, director at the Wilson Center’s Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition, to VOA on Jan. 23 On Pyongyang and Moscow, 'Rubio will ask China – as Trump did – to help convince North Korea to resume negotiations with the U.S.,' said Joseph DeTrani, who served as special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea during the George W. Bush administration. 'If successful, with or without China’s help, this may help to distance North Korea from Russia,' DeTrani told VOA on Jan. 24. Rubio’s roots In shaping and executing regional policies, Rubio’s strong opposition to authoritarianism, communism, and human rights violations is likely to 'color his approach at the State Department,' said Evans Revere, who served as acting secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs during the George W. Bush administration. The former senator grew up in Miami with Cuban immigrant parents and has exhibited an aversion toward communist governments throughout his political career. This stance, mixed with the twin foreign policy pillars, are likely to result in tough strategies for countries like North Korea and China and their activities in the region, according to analysts. Rubio signaled this on a call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday, stressing that 'the Trump Administration will pursue a U.S.-PRC relationship that advances U.S. interests' and 'the United States’ commitment to our allies in the region.' China’s official name is the People’s Republic of China (PRC). He also expressed 'serious concern over China’s coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea.' In line with the policy goal of avoiding conflict, Rubio may support Trump’s personal diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration. North Korea said Sunday it conducted a sea-to-surface strategic cruise missile test the previous day. Rubio, doubtful initially about Trump’s summits with Kim during his first term, said at a confirmation hearing earlier this month that Trump’s personal diplomacy was able to stop the country from testing missiles. He spoke by phone with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul last week emphasizing the alliance is the linchpin of peace on the Korean Peninsula and across the Indo-Pacific. In a meeting also last week in Washington, Rubio and Japanese Foreign Minister Iwaya Takeshi discussed North Korea’s ties with Russia. Rally against China Among Southeast Asian countries, Rubio last week held calls with the foreign ministers of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, each time stressing stable maritime security in the South China Sea. Particularly in his calls with Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo, Rubio underscored 'PRC’s dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea.' With Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son, Rubio expressed concern over 'China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.' Gregory Poling, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told VOA on January 23 that the Trump administration 'will look primarily to the Philippines and outside partners like Japan and Australia to defend freedom of the seas in the South China Sea.' One of the first meetings Rubio held was with the Australian, Japanese and Indian leaders of the Quad security dialogue last week in Washington where they expressed opposition to unilateral actions to change the status quo of the region by force or coercion and vowed to keep the Indo-Pacific free and open. Poling continued the administration will look 'secondarily to Vietnam, Singapore, and Indonesia to deepen practical maritime cooperation.' Rubio 'may push Indonesia to take a stronger stance vis-à-vis Chinese activities in disputed waters, particularly in light of controversial Indonesia-China maritime development deal signed in November 2024,' Anreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Program at CSIS told VOA on Jan. 23. Indonesia and China signed a $10 billion deal in November agreeing to develop fisheries, oil and gas exploration, among other things, across their private sectors. Diplomatic balancing Analysts say Washington’s push to have regional countries align more closely with Washington could lead to some tensions. Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar tend to lean more toward Beijing, and Indonesia tends to balance its engagement with China and the U.S. Robert McMahon, a foreign relations expert at The Ohio State University, said Rubio’s harsh stance on China could put Indonesia in a 'difficult position, since it has not been willing to join the anti-China bandwagon.' He told VOA in December after Rubio was nominated as the secretary of state that 'to the extent that the United States tries to pressure Indonesia to move in that direction, that could lead to some conflict.' Rubio said to his State Department staff last week that he expects other countries 'to advance their national interests' but hopes 'there will be many – in which our national interests and theirs align.' Seng Vanly, an assistant dean and lecturer at the Techo Sen School of Government and International Relations at the University of Cambodia, said Washington is likely to increase pressure on Cambodia over concerns for human rights, democratic setbacks, and restricted civil society activities, coupled with its growing ties with China. However, analysts say U.S. foreign policy under Rubio will likely balance issues such as human rights with regional security and economic goals. Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow for the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute, said, 'Washington will be more practical.' 'While it could raise human rights issues with regional countries, the Americans understand if they disengage from the region because of human rights, China will fill in the void,' Yaacob said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-rubio-charts-a-course-for-countering-china/7954074.html	2025-01-28T18:32:53-08:00	
Dozens injured in stampede at Hindu festival in India	NEW DELHI — Tens of thousands of people at a massive religious gathering in India rushed to take a holy bath in the country's northern Prayagraj city, setting off a stampede early Wednesday that injured dozens, local media reported. It was not immediately clear what triggered the panic at the Maha Kumbh festival where devotees had congregated from across India to bathe at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. News agency Press Trust of India cited authorities who said the injured were sent to a hospital. The Maha Kumbh festival, held every 12 years, started on January 13 and has been touted by Indian authorities as the world's largest religious gathering. Authorities expect more than 400 million people to throng the pilgrimage site over the next six weeks. Stampedes are relatively common around Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas with shoddy infrastructure and few safety measures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-injured-in-stampede-at-hindu-festival-in-india/7954069.html	2025-01-28T18:32:03-08:00	
Zelenskyy orders report on US support programs	Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ordered government officials to report on the U.S. support programs whose funds are 'currently suspended' under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. 'These are humanitarian programs,' Zelenskyy said in his daily address Tuesday. Nearly all of them were not channeled through Ukrainian government, he said. Instead, went 'directly through our communities, through various organizations.' 'There are many projects. We will determine which ones are critical and need immediate solutions,' he said. 'We can provide part of this funding through our state finances.' Zelenskyy said the priorities will be 'those that primarily concern Ukrainian children, our veterans and programs to protect our infrastructure.' On his first day back in office, Trump placed a 90-day freeze on foreign aid while the U.S. reviews whether the aid is aligned with Trump’s America First agenda. Also on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview on state television that Moscow would hold peace talks with Kyiv, but he said he would not speak to Zelenskyy, calling him and illegitimate leader. 'Negotiations can be held with anyone,' the Russian president said. 'But due to [Zelenskyy’s] illegitimacy, he has no right to sign anything.' In return, the Ukrainian president said, 'Putin once again confirmed that he is afraid of negotiations, afraid of strong leaders, and does everything possible to prolong the war,' he wrote on X. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, national and local elections were banned under a martial law act passed by Ukraine. A presidential election would have occurred in March 2024, and Zelenskyy’s term would have ended in May 2024. Critics are at odds about whether the Ukrainian constitution provides for an extension of the president’s term in office under martial law. Some say it provides for the option, while others believe it does not. Some information for this report is provided by The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-orders-report-on-us-support-programs/7954067.html	2025-01-28T18:15:18-08:00

North Korea's Kim calls for bolstering nuclear forces, state media says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for bolstering nuclear forces this year, during a visit to a nuclear material production base and nuclear weapons institute, state media KCNA reported on Wednesday. His trip highlighting the country's growing nuclear arsenal came as Pyongyang has been ramping up its show of force around U.S. President Donald Trump's return to office with a resumption of missile tests, which South Korea said were partly aimed at drawing Trump's attention. Kim praised scientists and other workers there for achieving 'remarkable successes' and 'amazing production results' in their work last year as he was briefed about the process for producing weapons-grade nuclear materials and their plan for 2025 and beyond, KCNA reported. Kim called for further success in producing weapons-grade nuclear materials this year and strengthening the country's nuclear forces. 'This year is a crucial year, as it is an important watershed in which we should carry out the tasks in the important period in the course of implementing the line of bolstering up the nuclear forces,' Kim said, according to KCNA. North Korea faces 'the world's most unstable security situation' due to a long-standing confrontation with 'the most vicious hostile countries,' which makes it indispensable for the country to boost its nuclear capability, he added. Pyongyang has long argued that its nuclear arsenal is aimed at fending off threats from Washington and its allies, which fought the North during the 1950-53 Korean War. Analysts estimate North Korea may have produced enough fissile material to build up to 90 nuclear warheads. Seoul's National Intelligence Service has said the North's recent display of force was in part intended to 'show off its U.S. deterrent assets and draw Trump's attention' after vowing 'the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction' at a key year-end policy meeting last month. Trump, who held unprecedented summits with Kim during his first term and has touted their personal rapport, said last week he would 'reach out to him again.' On the day of his inauguration, Trump described North Korea as a 'nuclear power,' as had Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his Senate confirmation hearing, raising questions about whether Washington would seek arms reduction talks rather than denuclearization negotiations. At his Senate confirmation hearing, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed Trump's past engagement with North Korea and said he believed there 'has to be an appetite for a very serious, broader North Korea policy.' Rubio said Trump's engagement 'ultimately didn't achieve everything,' but Kim did stop testing missiles, though the North Korean leader viewed his nuclear weapons as 'his insurance policy to stay in power.' South Korea has said North Korea's denuclearization must remain the goal for any engagement. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Trump would continue to pursue a denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Wednesday that Trump will pursue North Korea's 'complete denuclearization,' citing National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-calls-for-bolstering-nuclear-forces-state-media-says/7954061.html	2025-01-28T17:58:17-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: Advocacy group finds sexual assault, overcrowding in Iraqi prisons	According to the Justice for Prisoners Network, women in Iraqi prisons face rampant sexual assault and harassment, often during interrogations, with thousands detained without trial. Overcrowding further worsens conditions, with some facilities holding up to ten times their capacity. Despite the passage of a general amnesty law in 2024 aimed at addressing overcrowding, systemic issues persist, and advocates continue to call for urgent reforms and better treatment for prisoners, particularly women.

UN: Civilians' suffering 'unimaginable' in Congolese city under rebel attack	UNITED NATIONS — A senior U.N. official in the eastern Congolese city under threat from Rwandan-backed rebels said Tuesday that civilian suffering there is 'truly unimaginable' and called for 'urgent and coordinated' international action to end the fighting. 'Immediate action is required to alleviate the suffering of civilians and enable lifesaving humanitarian efforts to proceed,' said Vivian van de Perre, the deputy head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the DRC, known as MONUSCO. She briefed the second emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in the last 72 hours on the situation in Goma. Van de Perre spoke from the city by video call, wearing a flak jacket and military helmet. 'Electricity and water supplies remain disrupted in Goma, and medical facilities are completely overwhelmed due to the intensity of the ongoing combat and the proximity of the front lines,' she said. 'Humanitarian operations have been suspended or readjusted.' The World Food Program said Tuesday it is temporarily pausing its operations in North Kivu province, of which Goma is the capital. WFP said that will affect 800,000 people who would not get food aid due to the insecurity. The agency warned that if the fighting is drawn out, it could lead to a food shortage and high prices in the city of 2 million to 3 million people. Civilians are not the only ones running out of supplies. 'Many troops are now running out of critical equipment, especially water, food, medical supplies and blood,' van de Perre said. 'In some camps, fuel shortages have rendered generators inoperable, affecting communications equipment.' In early January, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the east with the support of the Rwandan army. The U.N. said the rebels have made significant territorial gains and are seeking to open a new front in neighboring South Kivu province. The United Nations Security Council and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have called for the M23 to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories. They have called for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces and a return to the Luanda process of mediation overseen by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. At Tuesday’s Security Council meeting, Congolese Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner expressed her government’s frustration with the lack of a strong international response. 'Over this past 72 hours, we've seen a regional tragedy that could have been prevented if the Council had been able to take action,' she told its members. She said she had asked for action at its first meeting on Sunday and asked if 'this council is unwilling to act?' Some 2,574 kilometers away in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, protesters turned violent Tuesday, attacking, looting and burning some embassies, including those of France and Rwanda. The U.S. State Department said on its X account that its embassy is closed until further notice. Rwanda’s U.N. ambassador condemned the attack, saying it was 'totally burned down.' 'Rwanda calls on the DRC to take its diplomatic obligations seriously and hold perpetrators accountable,' Ambassador Ernest Rwamucyo told council members. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, known by its acronym MONUSCO, has also reinforced its positions to counter the rebels’ advance on Goma, deploying a quick reaction force, a rapid deployment battalion, a reserve battalion, a platoon of special forces and an artillery battery. In the past few days, three U.N. peacekeepers have been killed and several injured in the conflict. Kenyan President William Ruto said he plans to hold crisis talks Wednesday with Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame at an emergency meeting of the East African Community. The U.S. State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a phone call Monday with Tshisekedi, 'condemned the assault on Goma by the Rwanda-backed M23 and affirmed the United States’ respect for the sovereignty of the DRC.' Before the latest round of violence, eastern DRC was already mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country’s valuable mineral deposits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-civilians-suffering-unimaginable-in-congolese-city-under-rebel-attack-/7954024.html	2025-01-28T16:45:42-08:00

Namibian officials hopeful aid will resume after Trump's 90-day freeze	Windhoek, Namibia — Health officials in Nambia are reacting with caution to the order from U.S. President Donald Trump last week that freezes most U.S. foreign aid. Though the country receives U.S. aid to bolster health care, especially the fight against AIDS, authorities say the 90-day freeze will have minimal impact, at least in the short run. An estimated 219,000 people in Namibia — about 13% of the adult population —have either HIV or AIDS, giving the country one of the highest prevalence rates in the world. About 3,800 people in Namibia die from AIDS each year. Still, Namibia has made significant gains against the disease over the years, even surpassing the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of having 95% of the population tested and effectively treated for HIV. Two American agencies — the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) have been crucial to Namibia’s progress. That aid is now on hold, but Kalumbi Shangula, Namibia’s minister of health and social services, believes the hold is temporary. 'We are confident that the review will find no deviation from the intended purposes, and I am confident that after the review, the funding will resume to the programs which are supported by the United States of America,' Shangula said. The Trump administration announced last week that the 90-day pause will be used to determine whether U.S. aid is being used for its intended purpose and whether beneficiaries are acting in line with U.S. interests. Nikodemus Kamangoti is part of an organization called the Rights Not Rescue Trust. The organization receives U.S. funding through KP-Star, a program that provides access to HIV services for key populations. KP-Star sets up mobile vans at night to provide HIV and reproductive health services, including HIV testing and treatment, and access to family planning options. Kamangoti says his organization has received millions annually through USAID since it started its activities in 2008. Due to the funding freeze, the mobile vans are grounded now. He is hoping the funding will resume in the future. 'Currently, we have been really affected by that issue, actually, the decision that the president has taken,' he said. 'But as a human being, I respect his decision.' Asked how Trump’s executive order will affect U.S.-funded programs in Namibia, Tiffany Miller, the public affairs officer at the U.S. Embassy, told VOA in an emailed response that 'Consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid, Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio has paused all U.S. foreign assistance funded by or through the State Department and USAID for review. He is initiating a review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibian-officials-hopeful-aid-will-resume-after-trump-s-90-day-freeze/7954001.html	2025-01-28T16:03:39-08:00	
New private sector initiative to help victims of the California fires	California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday launched LA Rises, a private sector initiative aimed at raising money to help residents of Southern California rebuild their lives in the wake of the recent, devastating fires. Rebuilding will be expensive, with some estimates reaching as high as $40 billion. The fires, which began three weeks ago, killed 28 people, burned through more than 4,000 square meters and destroyed more than 16,000 buildings, according to Cal Fire. Newsom recruited basketball legend Earvin 'Magic' Johnson, Dodgers baseball team Chairman Mark Walter and Casey Wasserman, president and chairperson of LA28, to help recruit other philanthropists for the initiative. 'With Mark, Earvin and Casey’s proven leadership and deep commitment to Los Angeles, we’ll tap into the enormous creativity, experience, and resources of the private sector, alongside local, state, and federal efforts, to deliver a recovery that benefits all Angelenos,' the governor said in a statement Tuesday 'It’s time for those with means to come forward and make a positive impact to build back better,' Walter said. The initiative already has a pledge of up to $100 million from Walter, his family’s foundation and the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation. 'We can’t lose hope,' Newsom said while urging victims of the fires to seek support from the new philanthropic effort, known as LA Rises. 'It is possible that we can come back more climate resilient, come back stronger.' Three of the biggest fires that hit the region are almost fully contained, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton fire is 99% contained, followed by the Hughes fire at 98% containment. And the Palisades fire is 95% contained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-private-sector-initiative-to-help-victims-of-the-california-fires-/7953764.html	2025-01-28T15:53:58-08:00	
White House to open media access to podcasters, influencers	WASHINGTON — Podcasters and social media influencers will be permitted to apply for credentials to cover the White House, the new press secretary announced Tuesday. In her first briefing, Karoline Leavitt told reporters that a wider range of individuals will be eligible to apply for White House press credentials. 'We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, social media influencers and content creators to apply for credentials to cover this White House,' Leavitt said. That move to open up the White House is part of the administration’s aim to significantly increase the number of journalists with White House access, said Leavitt. At 27 years old, Leavitt is the youngest person to hold the White House press secretary job. 'The Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and personalities, not just the legacy media that are seated in this room,' Leavitt said. She cited a Gallup poll showing low trust in media in the United States, particularly among younger people. 'As long as you are creating news content of the day and are a legitimate, independent journalist, you are welcome to cover this White House,' she added. Leavitt said credentials will be given to those who meet the White House’s criteria and pass a Secret Service background check. The credentials, known as hard passes, make it easier for journalists to attend press briefings and access the White House campus. The White House Correspondents’ Association did not immediately reply to VOA’s request for comment. In his reelection campaign, Trump talked to several podcasters and social media influencers, including many directed at conservative audiences, in an effort to reach younger Americans. At Tuesday’s briefing, Leavitt said the administration intends to reinstate the credentials of about 440 journalists whose badges, she said, were 'wrongly revoked' by the Biden administration in 2023. In May 2023, the Biden White House announced updated standards for a yearly renewal of passes. Only one journalist who applied under the revised criteria was denied a new pass, the White House told Politico at the time. During Tuesday’s briefing, The Associated Press asked Leavitt whether she views her job as press secretary as 'advocating on behalf of the president or providing the unvarnished truth.' AP reporters traditionally ask that question at a new press secretary’s first briefing. Leavitt responded, 'I commit to telling the truth from this podium every single day. I commit to speaking on behalf of the president.' The press secretary added that she expects reporters to hold themselves to the same standard, adding there 'have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets about this president.' Trump has had a contentious relationship with news outlets that he accuses of biased coverage. In recent months, he has filed several lawsuits against U.S. media outlets over what he believes is unfair coverage. On Monday, lawyers for the board that awards Pulitzer Prizes asked a Florida state court to pause the defamation lawsuit Trump filed against the board members in 2022 until he is no longer president. Trump accuses the Pulitzer board of defaming him by continuing to honor The New York Times and The Washington Post for their coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Some information in this report came from the Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-to-open-media-access-to-podcasters-influencers/7953761.html	2025-01-28T15:48:05-08:00	
Ukrainians skeptical Trump can end war with Russia on acceptable terms	U.S. President Donald Trump has promised repeatedly to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. But some Ukrainians are skeptical Trump can do anything to make President Vladimir Putin pull back his troops. The problem, as some analysts see it, is that the demands of Ukraine and Russia cannot be reconciled. Lesia Bakalets report from Kyiv.

Democrats, fund recipients challenge order to freeze federal spending	WASHINGTON — A federal judge quickly put on hold Tuesday part of the Trump administration's order to freeze much of the government's funding after a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ordered the White House not to block funding to existing programs until Feb. 3 when a hearing will be held in Washington. The Trump administration's order was set to go into effect at 5 p.m. Tuesday. The lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups representing nonprofit organizations, small-business owners and public health professionals. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, at her first news conference, defended the freezing of domestic grant and aid programs, telling reporters it is the responsibility of the new administration 'to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.' Leavitt emphasized President Donald Trump’s order will not harm individual assistance programs, including 'Social Security benefits, Medicare benefits, food stamps, welfare benefits' and other 'assistance that is going directly to individuals.' Democrats on Capitol Hill say that is not accurate and that chaos is resulting from Trump’s order, which the party’s leader in the U.S. Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, characterizes as 'lawless, destructive, dangerous and cruel.' 'People are in a panic about it,' Schumer told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. The frozen funds, totaling 'billions, perhaps, trillions of dollars that help American families every single day' include monies allocated for disaster assistance, local law enforcement, rural hospitals, aid to the elderly and food for people in need, according to Schumer. 'The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,' announced the Office of Management and Budget in its memo ordering the funding halt. 'I’m warning the Trump administration – the law is the law,' said Senator Patty Murray, from the state of Washington. 'Avoid this pointless, damaging chaos.' Murray is the vice chair of the Senate’s appropriations committee, which oversees and manages the allocation of funding from the federal government. Other Democrats on the Senate’s appropriations and budget committees unsuccessfully tried to get their Republican colleagues to delay Thursday’s confirmation hearing for the president’s pick to run the OMB. 'The Senate Budget Committee will proceed' with the nomination of Russell Vought, responded the committee’s chairman, Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Vought, who also ran OMB in the first Trump administration, said in two recent confirmation hearings before other Senate committees that he believed a 1974 'impoundment' law, which prevents presidents for blocking spending authorized by Congress, is unconstitutional. 'We are hearing from Medicaid offices across the country' that they have been locked out of federal funding systems, said Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, a member of the finance committee. Stealing the power of the purse from Congress is part of a 'sweeping authoritarian power grab' by the president since Trump took office one week ago, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the budget committee, told reporters at the Capitol. 'Donald Trump is stealing from taxpayers to fund tax cuts for billionaires, and House Republicans are celebrating,' said Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, in a statement. Republicans in Congress reject that perception. The president’s order is intended to ensure the government’s money 'is spent wisely and well,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota told reporters Tuesday afternoon in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. He added it is not unusual for a new administration to pause funding, noting the previous president, Democrat Joe Biden, did so regarding the allocated money for expansion of a wall on the U.S. southern border of Mexico, which was a highlighted project of the first Trump administration. Biden’s action was not as sweeping as the one taken this week by the Trump administration. 'Everybody take a deep breath, stay calm' during the 90-day review of the federally funded programs, advised Senator James Risch, the Idaho Republican who chairs the foreign relations committee. 'We’ll get this done and reduce spending.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-fund-recipients-challenge-order-to-freeze-federal-spending-/7953712.html	2025-01-28T15:14:30-08:00

UN chief appeals Israeli law banning UNRWA	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has appealed to Israel’s government to retract a new law essentially banning the U.N. agency that assists Palestinians. The law goes into effect this week. 'I regret this decision and request that the Government of Israel retract it,' Guterres wrote in a Monday letter to Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon that was obtained by VOA. The U.N. chief said the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA as it is known, is irreplaceable and that no other organization has the capacity or mandate to do its work. On Oct. 28, Israel’s parliament adopted legislation to ban UNRWA. Israel says some UNRWA staff participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack inside Israel. The United Nations investigated the accusations and fired nine staffers. 'The legislation forbids UNRWA from operating within the sovereign territory of the state of Israel, and forbids any contact between Israeli officials and UNRWA,' Israel’s ambassador told reporters Tuesday. 'Furthermore, UNRWA will be prohibited from maintaining any representative office, service or activity within our territory. Israel will terminate all collaboration, communication and contact with UNRWA, or anyone acting on its behalf.' Danon said UNRWA must cease all operations and evacuate its headquarters in East Jerusalem. The secretary-general said in his letter that Israel’s 'unilateral demand' that UNRWA 'cease operations and evacuate all premises within less than a week of formal notice' is 'unreasonable and inconsistent' with Israel’s international obligations and that the U.N. and Israel should have discussions about the law, which goes into effect on Thursday. Impact on Gaza At a meeting of the Security Council on Tuesday to discuss the situation, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said implementing the law now would be disastrous. He said the agency is even more critical as the Israeli-Hamas ceasefire is implemented and humanitarian agencies race to provide aid to millions of Palestinians. 'Across the Gaza Strip, Palestinians are turning to UNRWA — the agency they have known all their lives — for support,' Lazzarini said. 'Curtailing our operations now — outside a political process, and when trust in the international community is so low — will undermine the ceasefire. It will sabotage Gaza’s recovery and political transition.' Israeli officials say other aid agencies can take over UNRWA’s work, but Lazzarini disagreed. 'Since October 2023, we have delivered two-thirds of all food assistance, provided shelter to over a million displaced persons, and vaccinated a quarter of a million children against polio,' he told the council. 'Since the ceasefire began, UNRWA has brought in 60% of the food entering Gaza, reaching more than half a million people.' The agency also is the primary provider of health care and education for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. 'We are determined, however, to stay and deliver until it is no longer possible to do so,' Lazzarini said. United Nations officials have repeatedly stressed that if the Knesset legislation is enforced and UNRWA dismantled, then Israel, as the occupying power, would have the legal responsibility for providing essential services to the Palestinian population.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-appeals-israeli-law-banning-unrwa/7953674.html	2025-01-28T14:08:05-08:00	
Surge in terror attacks in northern Nigeria raises analysts' concern	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Security analysts in Nigeria are expressing alarm after a surge in attacks by terror groups in the country’s north near the border with Niger. The deterioration of relations between Abuja and Niamey following Niger's July 2023 coup has disrupted joint military patrols, creating opportunities for armed groups to intensify incursions and attacks. Last Friday's killing of 20 soldiers, including a commanding officer, at a military base in the remote town of Malam Fatori is among the latest attacks by terror groups. Malam Fatori is located near Nigeria's border with Niger. Suspected fighters from the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) arrived in trucks outfitted with guns and overpowered Nigerian troops in a coordinated assault. That attack took place three weeks after a similar raid on a military base in nearby Damboa, in Borno state, where six soldiers were killed. On Sunday, Nigeria's defense authorities announced that 22 soldiers died during military operations against militants in Borno state between Jan. 16 and 25. They also said troops killed nearly 80 militants during those operations. Kabiru Adamu, an analyst with Beacon Security and Intelligence Limited, explained the growing challenge. 'If the Nigerian military does not take steps to fortify those locations, we'd see attacks around that proximity increase. It appears to be that the objective of that particular attack is to weaken the response capability of the Nigerian military,' Adamu said. 'The fact that they did not fortify that place, the fact that they did not quickly replenish what was lost — we've seen consistently where churches are being burnt, military bases are being attacked.' The terror threat is not limited to northeastern Nigeria. In the northwest, a new militant group called Lakurawa is wreaking havoc in remote communities and crossing the border into Niger. Nigerian authorities first raised the alarm about the group in November, stating it has ties to jihadist factions in Mali and Niger, and had embedded itself in communities along the Nigeria-Niger border for years, marrying local women and recruiting young men. Strained relations between Nigeria and Niger following the July 2023 coup have disrupted joint security operations, allowing groups like ISWAP and Lakurawa to expand their activities. Nigeria is already engaged in a protracted counterinsurgency war, and Adamu said the situation is becoming increasingly complex. 'Lakurawa is a radicalized group and so the same counterterrorism approach that Nigeria is implementing in the northeast is what it will implement in the northwest,' Adamu said. 'But what this means is that there's a new theater of conflict — the northeast and the northwest. Given the fact that Nigerian military resources are strained, it poses a challenge.' Security analyst Senator Iroegbu said the government must adopt a more proactive and comprehensive approach to addressing the insecurity. 'The Sahel region, for two years or more, has been regarded as the epicenter of terrorism and Nigeria shares a lot of borders with the core Sahelian countries. So it's definitely a challenge now with the diplomatic spat that is affecting other areas of security and intelligence,' Iroegbu said. 'I'm not surprised about their emergence. In past years, there were reports about the growing linkage between bandits and what is happening in the northwest as terrorist organizations, and I don't think the authorities made any concrete effort.' Last week, a federal court in Nigeria declared the Islamist Lakurawa group a terrorist organization, allowing the military to use maximum force against the group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/surge-in-terror-attacks-in-northern-nigeria-raises-analysts-concern/7953646.html	2025-01-28T13:44:19-08:00	
Puntland blocks illegal entry of foreigners in IS crackdown	NAIROBI, KENYA — Authorities in Somalia’s Puntland region this week banned the illegal entry of foreigners and ordered telecom companies to deactivate SIM cards linked to undocumented people and Islamic State terrorists. The moves are an attempt to disrupt Islamic State financial networks as the military continues an offensive against IS fighters hiding out in the region. Authorities recently launched military operations against IS fighters in the Alimiskaad and Al-Madow mountains in Puntland’s Bari region. Security forces seized camps and defensive positions and pushed the fighters further into the mountains. Security agencies have also started a crackdown on undocumented people in Puntland. According to local reports, authorities made more than 300 arrests in the operation. Meanwhile, Puntland’s Ministry of the Interior has issued a directive banning the sale of SIM cards to undocumented people and barring them from opening financial accounts without proper identification. Abdirahman Yusuf Farah, a former intelligence chief of Puntland, said that security agencies will not violate people's rights in their pursuit of members and supporters of IS and that anyone who has entered the Puntland region legally will be respected. The International Crisis Group, in a report released in December, said Islamic State’s Somalia branch was becoming influential in dispersing money to finance terrorism elsewhere in Africa. The group extorts civilians and businesses to finance its operation and sends money to other IS affiliates. Omar Mahmood, a senior researcher at the International Crisis Group, said the IS threat is growing. 'It's not just about the Islamic State in Puntland or in Somalia itself, but the group there serves as a connective node for Islamic State affiliates elsewhere in Africa — in Eastern Africa, in Southern Africa,' Mahmood said. 'They report to the Islamic State in Puntland, and that serves as a connection to the Islamic State core and other affiliates outside of the continent.' Mahmood said Puntland is trying to block the local IS’s access to international banking systems. 'The group has focused on developing its financial capabilities, whether that is extortion in Bosaso and then transferring this externally,' he said. 'They've really developed that particular niche, much more so than operational capacity. Puntland is trying to crack down on the use of their formal systems, whether that is the banking sector or telecom, to make it harder for the group to continue to, one, generate financially, and two, then send that money outside of Puntland.' Puntland is relatively peaceful compared to southern Somalia, but local officials have grown concerned about the Islamic State’s rising strength, fueled by foreign fighters. Authorities are seeking international financial and military aid, including air support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/puntland-blocks-illegal-entry-of-foreigners-in-is-crackdown/7953395.html	2025-01-28T11:11:52-08:00	
China sees boom in feasts for pets on Lunar New Year's Eve	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As pet parents in China usher in the Year of the Snake and host Lunar New Year’s Eve dinners with their loved ones, some are also making sure that their fur babies, or 'mao hai zi,' are not left out. Over the past month, a growing number of consumers have been ordering pet-friendly versions of the traditional New Year’s Eve reunion dinner, ranging from freshly made meals to gift boxes of dried food. A search for 'dogs’ and cats’ Lunar New Year’s Eve dinner' on Douyin, the Chinese version of Tiktok and the most popular short-video app in China, lists dozens of choices. ‘Lucky’ dumplings Some vendors even tout traditional Chinese delicacy dishes such as 'Buddha jumps over the wall,' which includes seafood and meats, and 'eight treasures duck rice' in addition to common ones such 'lucky' dumplings and rice cake, adapted for dog palates. The prices range from 19.9 to 168 yuan ($2.8 to $24) per set. One vendor on Douyin, LAOTOU Pet Bakery, told VOA in a written reply Monday that it sold out of the special holiday pet meals more than a week before the Lunar New Year, which starts on Wednesday this year. Lou Yu, vice president of Favor Pets Company in Beijing, also that the pet service firm has seen a boom year in holiday sales of pet food. Business peaked during the Dragon Boat Festival in June, Mid-Autumn Festival in September and the Christmas holidays in December, when, respectively, rice dumplings, moon cakes and special Christmas treats were offered for pets, he said. Booming holiday sales 'For [pets’] reunion dinner on Lunar New Year’s Eve, we’ve probably seen a 45% to 50% growth in sales this year, compared to a year ago, when sales were still tepid,' Lou told VOA by phone on Monday. The company ran out of stock before the eight-day-long holiday began this week as a growing number of owners splurge on their pets. Festive Fido and feline food have become an emerging and 'under-supplied' niche market that is bucking the trend despite China’s economic slowdown. China’s 'cat and dog parents' total more than 120 million, more than double from a decade ago, according to Lou. Last year, there were some 9.54 million babies born in China. Pets are expected to outnumber children under 4 years of age by a ratio of 2 to 1 by 2030 — a shift that will likely create a substantial $12 billion market for pet food in China, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs forecasted in a report late last year. Authorities in China ended the country’s one-child policy in 2016 and started encouraging young couples to have three children in 2021 as the country’s population ages and the number of newborns declines. Pets over kids By contrast, many couples who find it too expensive to raise children are instead choosing pets over kids. On Saturday, 11 dogs were treated with plates of shredded chicken and lettuce — a special Lunar New Year meal — in a Shanghai restaurant. Their owners were all female. 'He's my soulmate! He gives me a lot of emotional support … and he’s a good friend that I’d like to be with and enjoy the New Year atmosphere together,' attendee Momo Ni told Reuters news agency, referring to her border collie, Yakult. Daisy Xu, another 28-year-old owner, said her dog, named Niu Niu, is already a beloved member of the family. 'We will make her another dog meal. … When it comes to New Year gifts, I think my parents will probably give their granddaughter a red envelope,' Xu told Reuters. Adults traditionally give red envelopes containing money to children during the Lunar New Year. Rich people’s world While some Chinese social media users share postings of their pets’ special holiday treats, some users were not as enthusiastic, with several complaining that 'these dogs and cats are better fed than I am.' A Guizhou province-based Weibo user named 'magnolia0526' said, 'The luxurious lifestyle of cats and dogs highlights the uneven distribution of resources in human society, which is not cute at all.' The post was in response to the hashtag 'sales of reunion dinner and dumplings for pets has seen a 480% growth.' Another Shandong province-based user mocked the trend, saying 'this is the world of the rich people.' Aside from pet food, Favor Pet’s Lou said China has experienced a booming pet economy in recent years with growing business opportunities from pet grooming and sitting services, especially during holiday seasons. He said that a growing number of job seekers have signed up for the company’s training programs as they shift career paths to find opportunities in the pet service sector.

New Zealand reviews aid to Kiribati after island nation snubs official's visit	WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND — New Zealand is reconsidering all development funding to the aid-dependent island nation of Kiribati, following a diplomatic snub from the island nation's leader, government officials said. The unusual move to review all finance to Kiribati was prompted by the abrupt cancellation of a planned meeting this month between President Taneti Maamau and New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters, Peters' office told The Associated Press on Monday. It followed months of growing frustration from Australia and New Zealand — jointly responsible for more than a third of overseas development finance to Kiribati in 2022 — about a lack of engagement with the island nation. Tensions have risen since Kiribati aligned itself with China in 2019 and signed a series of bilateral deals with Beijing. Strategically important island nation The bond between Kiribati — population 120,000 — and its near neighbor New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, might not appear to be the South Pacific's most significant. But the acrimony reflects concern from western powers that their interests in the region are being undermined as China woos Pacific leaders with offers of funding and loans. That has provoked a contest for influence over Kiribati, an atoll nation that is among the world's most imperiled by rising sea levels. Its proximity to Hawaii and its vast exclusive economic zone — the world's 12th largest — have boosted its strategic importance. Powers vie for sway with aid Kiribati, one of the world's most aid-dependent nations, relies heavily on international support, with foreign assistance accounting for 18% of its national income in 2022, according to data from the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. About 10% of development finance that year came from New Zealand — which contributed 102 million New Zealand dollars ($58 million) between 2021 and 2024, official figures show. However, officials in Wellington and Canberra have expressed frustration over a lack of engagement from Tarawa regarding development projects. Frictions escalated when Kiribati suspended all visits from foreign officials in August, citing a need to focus on the government formation process after elections that month. Kiribati switched its allegiance from pro-Taiwan to pro-Beijing in 2019, joining a growing number of Pacific nations to do so. Self-governing Taiwan is claimed by China and, since the shift, Beijing has increased aid to Kiribati. Official snub provokes backlash Peters was scheduled to meet Maamau, who has led the country since 2016, in Kiribati on Jan. 21 and Jan. 22, Peters' office said, but was told a week before the trip that Maamau could not accommodate him. It would have been the first visit by a New Zealand minister in more than five years. 'The lack of political-level contact makes it very difficult for us to agree joint priorities for our development program, and to ensure that it is well targeted and delivers good value for money,' a statement supplied by Peters' office said. New Zealand will review all development cooperation with Kiribati as a result, the statement said. The government of Kiribati did not respond to a request for comment, although Education Minister Alexander Teabo told Radio New Zealand on Tuesday that Maamau had a long-standing engagement on his home island — and denied a snub. New Zealand cautioned that the diplomatic rift could have broader consequences, including affecting New Zealand resident visas for Kiribati citizens and participation in a popular seasonal work scheme that brings Pacific horticulture and viticulture workers to New Zealand. New Zealand — home to large populations of Pacific peoples — is a popular spot for those from island nations to live and work. 'In the meantime, New Zealand stands ready, as we always have, to engage with Kiribati at a high level,' said the statement. Australia's softer approach The decision to review all development funding is a 'different, and more forceful approach' than New Zealand has taken before, said Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and contrasted with a different tack taken recently by Australia — which is Kiribati's biggest funder. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles traveled to the island nation this month as planned to deliver a patrol boat promised to Kiribati in 2023 — even though he did not meet with Maamau. Australia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the country 'remains committed to its longstanding partnership with Kiribati.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-reviews-aid-to-kiribati-after-island-nation-snubs-official-s-visit/7953266.html	2025-01-28T10:14:49-08:00	
China tests US commitment to South China Sea by pressuring Philippines	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A little more than a week after Beijing and Manila reached an agreement aimed at easing tensions in the South China Sea, the Philippines has accused Chinese coast guard vessels of fresh incursions, harassment and 'aggressive maneuvers.' Analysts say the pressure campaign, which has stepped up in recent days, is part of Beijing’s attempt to test the United States’ commitment to support the Philippines. 'They want to see how far they can push the Philippines under the new administration in the U.S.,' Ja Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, told VOA by phone. In a statement released on social media platform X last Saturday, the Philippine coast guard said two vessels from the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries encountered 'aggressive maneuvers' from three Chinese coast guard vessels while heading to Sandy Cay for a marine scientific survey last Friday. In one video released by Manila, a large Chinese coast guard vessel was seen moving within a few meters of one Philippine vessel. Another video showed a Chinese helicopter hovering above two inflatable boats carrying Philippine crew members. Philippine coast guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the Philippine vessels were forced to suspend the scientific survey due to the 'continuous harassment and the disregard for safety' shown by the Chinese coast guard. In response to Manila’s accusations, Beijing said Chinese coast guard vessels 'thwarted' two Philippine vessels’ attempts to 'land on' Sandy Cay, which China calls 'Tiexian Reef.' 'The vessels attempted to illegally land on the reef and conduct sand sampling. China Coast Guard [CCG] vessels lawfully obstructed the Philippine ships' course and warned them away,' the Chinese coast guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement released last Friday. China views almost all of the South China Sea as its territory and is engaged in a series of disputes with several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, that have overlapping claims over the strategic waterway. Apart from the incident near Sandy Cay, the Philippine coast guard said its vessels had successfully kept Chinese coast guard vessels from operating in waters near the coastline of the Philippines’ Zambales province since last Friday. 'The Philippine Coast Guard [PCG] vessel has maintained the China Coast Guard vessel to keep a distance of 90-100 nautical miles away from the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone,' said Jay Tarriela from the Philippine coast guard in a post on social media platform X on Sunday. Then on Monday, the Philippine coast guard said its vessels were hindered by Chinese coast guard vessels while trying to recover the body of a dead Philippine fisherman from a Philippine fishing boat. The series of incidents comes more than a week after senior Chinese and Philippine diplomats vowed to settle territorial disputes in the South China Sea through dialogues during a bilateral consultation. Although the agreement has allowed the Philippines to conduct resupply missions to its forces near the disputed Second Thomas Shoal since late last year, some experts say the latest incidents are part of a bigger effort by Beijing to drive a wedge between Manila and Washington. 'Beijing isn’t happy with Manila’s assertive stance in the South China Sea and its close ties with the United States, so [these factors] serve as convenient justifications for Beijing to try to push Manila in the South China Sea,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. Despite the persistent Chinese aggression, Koh said some in Manila think the Philippines can maintain its current approach in the South China Sea since there is bipartisan support for a more assertive position against China in the U.S. and some Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, have reiterated Washington’s 'ironclad' defense commitment to the Philippines during interactions with their Philippine counterparts last week. 'Manila appears to be more cautiously optimistic that it can maintain the current policy, knowing that there is U.S. backing for that,' he told VOA by phone. To counter Beijing’s pressure campaign, Don McLain Gill, a lecturer in international studies at De La Salle University in the Philippines, said it’s important for the Philippines and its allies, including the United States, to maintain close collaboration in areas such as joint maritime exercises. Since China is expected to 'continue pressing the Philippines into submission with its grey zone operations, which are now shifting from low intensity to high intensity, this must be addressed with more robust presence operations between the alliance and like-minded partners, along with continued support in the Philippines military modernization in line with the Comprehensive Archipelagic Defence Concept,' he told VOA in a written response. With the Trump administration’s announcement to suspend new funding for almost all U.S. foreign assistance for 90 days, however, Chong in Singapore said Beijing may think there is a window of opportunity to pressure countries like the Philippines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tests-us-commitment-to-south-china-sea-by-pressuring-philippines/7953276.html	2025-01-28T09:54:16-08:00

Jordan engages with Syria’s HTS leaders to tackle terrorism	AMMAN, JORDAN — Jordan, which faces new regional challenges in dealing with Syria’s transitional Islamist regime, is pursuing a strategy of containment through engagement to secure its long, shared border, analysts say. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi told the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week that Jordan has engaged 'very deeply' from day one with Syria’s new Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leaders to tackle challenges both countries face. 'Terrorism is one common threat,' al-Safadi said. 'We see Daesh [Islamic State] rearming, regrouping. [They] acquired a lot of weapons from the stockpiles of the Syrian army. Drug trafficking is still happening to Jordan. We have the same interests here in ending that threat. We have an interest in Syria succeeding. What happens in Syria will have a direct impact on us. If Syria succeeds, we will all benefit.' Farah Bdour, a senior adviser with the Washington-based U.S. Institute of Peace, said Jordan must address such 'pressing issues as securing its 380-kilometer shared border with Syria to prevent the spillover of instability.' Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s 'success or failure will directly impact Jordan’s stability,' Bdour said. 'Should HTS’s transition falter, the group could revert to its militant roots, reigniting conflict and posing renewed threats to Jordan’s security,' she warned in the group’s online publication, underscoring HTS’s former link to al-Qaida. Jordanian analyst Amer al-Sabaileh, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Stimson Center, told VOA that Jordan can reshape and support efforts for 'Damascus to be a good counterpart' by working together on concerns such as security, logistics, telecommunications and electricity. 'This might help Jordan to reshape a good relation based on a win-win situation, where Jordan, as well, can definitely benefit from a new reality in Syria, especially on the level of political influence, political interest and definitely being part of rebuilding Syria,' Al Sabaileh said. 'But HTS is not controlling all the Syrian geography. ISIS [Islamic State] has growing capacities, desire to control certain areas closer to the Jordanian borders.' Bdour and al-Sabaileh also warned that HTS’s Islamist ideology could influence other similar movements, including Jordan’s Muslim Brotherhood. Bdour pointed to attempts by the Brotherhood to dominate Jordanian public sentiment over the Gaza conflict and its political gains in parliamentary elections last September. 'What happened in Syria might trigger the appetite and desire for power of all the political Islam groups: Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS, who at the end, think that maybe they deserve also to be recognized in certain areas, if they prove to be on the map,' al= Sabaileh said. Bdour wrote that even 'if HTS successfully transitions to a governing regime, its Islamic orientation poses a unique challenge for Jordan.' She pointed to critics of the group who say they 'fear that legitimizing HTS could embolden dormant extremist factions within Jordan,' possibly 'exacerbating internal tensions.' Ultimately, she said, 'Jordan must navigate these overlapping domestic and regional challenges, as HTS’s trajectory, and its implications for Syria, Jordan and the broader Middle East, remains deeply uncertain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jordan-engages-with-syria-s-hts-leaders-to-tackle-terrorism/7953149.html	2025-01-28T08:08:20-08:00

Trump takes aim at DEI, COVID expulsions and transgender troops	Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders on Monday to remove diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, from the military, reinstate thousands of troops who were kicked out for refusing COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic, and take aim at transgender troops. Earlier on Monday, Pete Hegseth, who narrowly secured enough votes to become defense secretary, referred to the names of Confederate generals that were once used for two key bases during his remarks to reporters as he entered the Pentagon on his first full day on the job. Trump signed the executive orders while flying back from Miami to Washington, D.C. One of the executive orders signed by Trump said that expressing a 'gender identity' different from an individual's sex at birth did not meet military standards. While the order banned the use of 'invented' pronouns in the military, it did not answer basic questions including whether transgender soldiers currently serving in the military would be allowed to stay and, if not, how they would be removed. Trump's plans have been heavily criticized by advocacy groups, which say his actions would be illegal. 'President Trump has made clear that a key priority for his administration is driving transgender people back into the closet and out of public life altogether,' Joshua Block, with the ACLU, said earlier on Monday. During his first term, Trump announced that he would ban transgender troops from serving in the military. He did not fully follow through with that ban his administration froze their recruitment while allowing serving personnel to remain. Biden overturned the decision when he took office in 2021. The military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, Department of Defense data shows. While transgender rights advocates say there are as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number is in the low thousands. When Trump announced his first ban in 2017, he said the military needed to focus on 'decisive and overwhelming victory' without being burdened by the 'tremendous medical costs and disruption' of having transgender personnel. Internal focus Hegseth has promised to bring major changes to the Pentagon, and he has made eliminating DEI from the military a top priority. Trump's executive order on ending DEI in the military said service academies would be required to teach 'that America and its founding documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history.' The Air Force said on Sunday that it will resume instruction of trainees using a video about the first Black airmen in the U.S. military, known as the Tuskegee Airmen, which has passed review to ensure compliance with Trump's ban on DEI initiatives. Hegseth was warmly greeted on the steps of the Pentagon by the top U.S. military officer, Air Force General Charles Brown, whom Hegseth criticized in his latest book. Asked if he might fire Brown, Hegseth joked that he was standing right next to him. 'I’m standing with him right now. I look forward to working with him,' as he patted Brown on the back. Reuters has previously reported about the possibility of mass firing among top brass, something Hegseth repeatedly refused to rule out during his confirmation process. Hegseth referred to Fort Moore and Fort Liberty by their previous names, Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, while speaking with reporters. The names honoring Confederate officers were changed under former President Joe Biden as part of an effort to reexamine U.S. history and the Confederate legacy. 'I'm thinking about the guys and gals in Guam, Germany, Fort Benning and Fort Bragg,' Hegseth said. Much of Hegseth's focus at the Pentagon could be internal to the military, including making good on Trump's executive order on bringing back troops discharged for refusing COVID vaccines. Thousands of service members were removed from the military after the Pentagon made the vaccine mandatory in 2021. US missile defense Trump also signed an executive order that 'mandated a process to develop an ‘American Iron Dome’.' The short-range Iron Dome air defense system was built by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. backing, and it was built to intercept rockets fired by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas in Gaza toward Israel. Each truck-towed unit fires radar-guided missiles to blow up short-range threats such as rockets, mortars and drones in midair. The system determines whether a rocket is on course to hit a populated area. If not, the rocket is ignored and allowed to land harmlessly. Any such effort would take years to implement in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-takes-aim-at-dei-covid-expulsions-and-transgender-troops/7952985.html	2025-01-28T05:24:26-08:00	
UN warns of worrying humanitarian situation in DRC’s Goma amid assault by Rwanda-backed rebels	United Nations — There was gunfire Tuesday in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo city of Goma, as the United Nations warned of a worrying humanitarian situation amid clashes between Congolese soldiers and Rwandan-backed rebels who attacked the area and claimed to be in control. U.N. humanitarian office spokesperson Jens Laerke told a briefing Tuesday that hospitals in Goma were overwhelmed. The World Food Program said it temporarily paused food assistance activities in the Goma area. Crisis talks were planned for Wednesday, Kenyan President William Ruto said, with Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame set to attend. Ruto said there is no military solution to the conflict. The U.S. State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio 'condemned the assault on Goma by the Rwanda-backed M23 and affirmed the United States’ respect for the sovereignty of the DRC,' in a phone call Monday with Tshisekedi. A senior U.N. official in the Democratic Republic of Congo said Monday that fighting between the M23 rebels and the Congolese army in Goma is 'not over yet,' despite the rebel claims of control. 'Fighting is still very much ongoing,' said Bruno Lemarquis, U.N. resident coordinator in the DRC. 'It's a very, very fluid situation. It's a very dangerous situation.' He told reporters via a video call from DRC’s capital, Kinshasha, that 'active zones of combat have spread to all quarters' of Goma in North Kivu province. Lemarquis said there have been severe disruptions to water, electricity, internet and phone service. Humanitarian warehouses have been looted. In early January, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the east with the support of the Rwandan army. The U.N. says the rebels have made significant territorial gains and are seeking to open a new front in neighboring South Kivu province. The United Nations Security Council, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and senior U.N. officials are calling for the M23 to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories. They have called for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces and a return to the Luanda process of mediation overseen by Angolan President João Lourenço. 'On behalf of the humanitarian community, I call on all parties to agree on temporary humanitarian pauses in the most affected areas and establish humanitarian corridors to ensure humanitarian activities resume at scale. And more importantly, also to facilitate the safe evacuation of wounded individuals and civilians trapped in combat zones,' Lemarquis added. The United Nations announced Sunday a $17 million disbursement from its central emergency fund for urgent humanitarian needs in DRC. Lemarquis said nonessential U.N. staff, foreign and Congolese, are being temporarily evacuated from Goma to either Kinshasa or to a U.N. base in Entebbe in neighboring Uganda. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, known by its acronym, MONUSCO, has also reinforced its positions to counter the rebels’ advance on Goma, deploying a quick reaction force, a rapid deployment battalion, a reserve battalion, a platoon of special forces and an artillery battery. 'At this critical juncture now, the onus really is and has to be about bringing about an immediate cessation of hostilities,' U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told reporters on the same video call, speaking from Damascus, Syria, where he is on a mission. 'The fate of the millions of civilians living in Goma or having been displaced is really the priority, along with the safety and security of U.N. personnel,' he said. In the past few days, three U.N. peacekeepers have been killed and several injured in the conflict. Before the latest round of violence, eastern DRC was already mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country’s valuable mineral deposits. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-of-worrying-humanitarian-situation-in-drc-s-goma-amid-assault-by-rwanda-backed-rebels-/7952906.html	2025-01-28T04:15:40-08:00	
Dominican Republic ramping up deportation of Haitian migrants	SANTO DOMINGO — As spiraling violence in Haiti puts healthcare out of reach for most, Haitian mothers are seeking care at hospitals in neighboring Dominican Republic despite government policies there scaling up deportations. The two countries share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, but are divided by a heavily secured border, long-standing tensions and an immense wealth gap. Children born to Haitian parents in the Dominican Republic do not receive citizenship. 'I had my child here,' Cineas Lionne told Reuters from a hospital in the eastern city of Punta Cana. 'I don't think I would receive good care in Haiti because of the situation with the government - there is no government.' The U.N. found in October that less than a quarter of hospitals were operating around Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, while those elsewhere struggle to cope with flows of refugees fleeing gang attacks. That assessment came before a spike in violence in late 2024, that saw gangs shoot and kill journalists gathered at Haiti's largest public hospital for a government press conference meant to announce a long-awaited reopening. Those plans have been put on hold. The violence has forced the capital's airport and ports to repeatedly shut down, prompting hospitals to warn of a lack of supplies such as blood and oxygen. Aid group Doctors Without Borders temporarily halted services last year due to threats. 'The doctors here have treated me well,' said Beatrice Agustin, who gave birth in a maternity hospital in the Dominican capital. 'In Haiti there are many gangsters. You can't give birth there, but also if you are here without papers,' giving birth in the Dominican Republic is complicated, she said. U.N. experts have warned in recent years that pregnant and postpartum Haitian women seeking medical care in the Dominican Republic have faced intimidation, detention and deportation, citing raids on public hospitals and arrests during check-ups. The U.N. experts have called on neighboring nations to stop deporting Haitians back home, where over 5 million people are going hungry and over 1 million are internally displaced as armed gangs continue to gain territory. Many families are sharing homes or living in makeshift camps. The Dominican Republic has pledged to deport up to 10,000 people a week as it deals with the brunt of the migration of Haitians fleeing conflict at home. It deported over 200,000 Haitians last year and nearly 15,000 in first two weeks of 2025. Dominican politicians have accused Haitian migrants of fueling insecurity and said their country is already giving too much. 'Our infrastructure does not have the capacity to receive that number of people,' Senator and former health minister Daniel Rivera told Reuters, saying the priority was expanding healthcare for Dominicans. Local doctors said many Haitian women are afraid to attend prenatal checkups and tend to arrive late at night or when they are about to give birth, due to the risk of deportation. National health service director Martin Ortiz noted that migration officials are not permitted to enter to make arrests inside hospitals. 'Our mission is to provide care,' he said. 'The same care is given equally.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dominican-republic-ramping-up-deportation-of-haitian-migrants-/7952850.html	2025-01-28T03:35:17-08:00	
Serbian prime minister to resign as popular protests persist	BELGRADE — Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic on Tuesday announced his resignation, becoming the highest ranking official to leave since anti-corruption protests spread across the country. Belgrade has seen daily anti-government protests since a roof collapsed in November at a railway station in Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, killing 15 people. Protesters including students, teachers and other workers have turned out in their thousands, blaming the disaster on corruption within the government of President Aleksandar Vucic. 'I opted for this step in order to reduce tensions,' Vucevic told a news conference on Tuesday, announcing his intention to resign. He said the mayor of Novi Sad will also resign. 'With this we have met all demands of the most radical protestors.' Vucevic has been the head of the ruling center-right Serbia Progressive Party since 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-prime-minister-to-resign-as-popular-protests-persist-/7952835.html	2025-01-28T03:19:29-08:00	
ICC prosecutor seeking arrest warrants for those accused of atrocities in Sudan's West Darfur	UNITED NATIONS — The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced Monday that his office will be seeking arrest warrants for those accused of atrocities in Sudan’s West Darfur region, which has seen reported ethnic cleansing by paramilitary forces that have been fighting government forces for 19 months. Karim Khan told the U.N. Security Council that crimes are being committed in Darfur 'as we speak and daily' and are being used as a weapon of war. He said that conclusion is the result of 'a hard-edged analysis' based on evidence and information collected by his office. Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region. Two decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. Khan told the council in January there were grounds to believe both government forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Force, which was born out of the Janjaweed, may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Darfur. The Biden administration, just before it left office this month, determined that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide in Sudan's civil war. And the ICC prosecutor told the council Monday that there are 'very clear echoes' in the current conflict of what happened 20 years ago. 'The pattern of crimes, the perpetrators, the parties, tracked very closely with the same protagonists, the same targeted groups as existed in 2003' and led the Security Council to refer Darfur to the ICC, Khan said. 'It’s the same communities, the same groups suffering, a new generation suffering the same hell that has been endured by other generations of Darfuris, and this is tragic.' Human Rights Watch in a major report last May said the Rapid Support Forces and their allied militias carried out attacks against the ethnic Masalit and other non-Arab groups in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state, from April to June 2023, with attacks intensifying that November. At least thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced during the attacks, according to the report by the leading rights group. 'I can confirm today that my office is taking the necessary steps to put forward applications for warrants of arrest in relations to crimes we allege are being committed and have been committed in West Darfur,' Khan told the council on Monday. He gave no details on the specific crimes or the people the ICC wants arrested. But he did say his office is particularly concerned about a stream of allegations of gender crimes against women and girls, which he said were 'a priority' for the ICC. He said the last six months have seen 'a tailspin into deeper suffering, deeper misery for the people of Darfur,' with famine present, conflict increasing, children targeted, girls and women subjected to rape and the whole landscape 'one of destruction.' Khan had a simple message for those on the ground in El Geneina in West Darfur, the city of El Fasher in North Darfur, which is besieged by RSF forces, and elsewhere in Darfur: 'Now, better late than never, for goodness sake, comply with international humanitarian law, not as a charity, not out of some political necessity, but out of the dictates of humanity.' Khan told the council he made efforts to engage with the RSF to obtain information relevant to the ICC’s investigations, and members of his office met with representatives of the paramilitary force last week. 'I do expect, and hope, and require swift and meaningful action, and will be monitoring that,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-prosecutor-seeking-arrest-warrants-for-those-accused-of-atrocities-in-sudan-s-west-darfur-/7952822.html	2025-01-28T02:55:30-08:00	
Fast-moving fires torch national parks in southeast Australia	SYDNEY — Firefighters were desperately trying to stop a cluster of fast-moving blazes in southeast Australia on Tuesday, as thousands of acres of national park burned and a farming community was forced to evacuate. Lightning strikes on Monday evening ignited several fires in the Grampians National Park, a forested mountain range about 300 kilometers west of Victoria's state capital Melbourne. A separate fast-moving fire in Little Desert National Park in the west of the state has torn through almost 65,000 hectares in less than 24 hours, emergency services said, scorching an area almost as large as Singapore. That fire had forced the evacuation of rural Dimboola before threat levels were downgraded on Tuesday afternoon. 'I'm incredibly thankful that no lives have been lost and we have no reports of injury either,' emergency management commissioner Rick Nugent told reporters. Chris Hardman from Forest Fire Management Victoria warned that weather conditions over the next few days are increasing the possibility the fires will spread. 'Right now firefighters are planning to do everything in their powers to protect communities,' he said. Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Kevin Parkyn said stifling heatwave conditions would settle over parts of Victoria on Saturday, escalating fire risks. 'When we look at the next seven to 10 days, the main message is that there will be a hot dome over Victoria. 'Once we get into the weekend don't be surprised if we see heatwave conditions unfold across the state, and continue to intensify into next week. 'The landscape is dry, and if we continue to see these hot conditions, it will continue to dry the landscape out further.' Hotter temperatures are fueling increasingly severe natural disasters across Australia, researchers have found. Scientists have documented a marked increase in extreme fire weather across the country since the 1950s. The unprecedented 'Black Summer' bushfires of 2019-2020, for example, killed 33 people and millions of animals, razed vast tracts of forest and blanketed major cities in thick smoke.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fast-moving-fires-torch-national-parks-in-southeast-australia/7952808.html	2025-01-28T02:12:53-08:00	
Italian ship carrying migrants picked up offshore reaches Albania	TIRANA, ALBANIA — An Italian navy ship carrying 49 migrants picked up in international waters arrived in Albania on Tuesday, amid a new attempt by Italy to push ahead with a legally contested plan to relocate migrants to the neighboring country. The navy ship Cassiopea with the migrants reached the Albanian port of Shengjin early on Tuesday, according to a Reuters witness. They will be identified at a facility there and then moved to a detention center some 20 kilometer away. The navy did not provide details on the migrants. The Italian government of Giorgia Meloni has built two reception centers in Albania, the first such deal by a European Union nation to divert migrants to a non-EU country in a bid to limit sea arrivals to its territory. But the facilities have been empty since November after judges in Rome questioned the validity of the relocation plan and ordered the first two batches of migrants previously detained in Albania to be moved back to Italy. The controversy surrounding the plan, which Meloni sees as a cornerstone of her government's aim to curb immigration, revolves around a ruling by the European Court of Justice last year, which was not related to Italy. The Court said no nation of origin could be considered safe if even just a part of it was dangerous, undermining Rome's idea of deporting migrants to Albania who hailed from a selected list of 'safe' countries with a view to swiftly repatriate them. Ilaria Salis, a European Parliament deputy from a left-wing Italian party, on Monday criticized the Italian government for forcibly transferring 'innocent people fleeing war and misery' despite violations of international law and human rights. The European court is set to review Italy's plan in the coming weeks and clarify whether it is in compliance with EU law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-ship-carrying-migrants-picked-up-offshore-reaches-albania/7952804.html	2025-01-28T01:58:08-08:00	
More than 300,000 Palestinians returned to Gaza City, authorities say	The Hamas-run government in the Gaza Strip said more than 300,000 people displaced by the Israel-Hamas war returned Monday to northern Gaza after Israel opened checkpoints and allowed people back into the area. The Palestinians, mostly on foot, lugged what personal belongings they could manage as they headed back to see whether their one-time homes were still standing after they were forced to leave in the early stages of the war. But much of the region has been leveled during the Israeli bombardment targeting Hamas militants and buildings booby-trapped by Hamas. About a million people were ordered out of northern Gaza as the Israeli offensive began in October 2023. The military, until now, had prevented their return. The Palestinians’ return to Gaza City comes in the early stages of a six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that has resulted in the release of seven hostages held in Gaza, the freeing of 300 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israeli officials said Monday that Hamas had provided information about the rest of the hostages due to be released in the first stage of the cease-fire, including that eight of those still being held are dead. The next round of hostage releases is due to take place later this week. U.S. President Donald Trump over the weekend said he wants Jordan and Egypt to take in more displaced Palestinians as part of an effort to 'clean out' Gaza. But the two countries rejected the suggestion, saying the only way forward was creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The U.S. has long supported Palestinian statehood, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the idea. The war in Gaza started with the shock Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 47,300 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials. The Israeli military said the death toll includes 17,000 militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 60 hostages and the remains of about 30 others, with the ceasefire requiring them to release 33 during the truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians jailed by Israel.

New Zealand reviews its aid to Kiribati after the Pacific island nation snubs an official's visit	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand is reconsidering all development funding to the aid-dependent island nation of Kiribati, following a diplomatic snub from the island nation's leader, government officials said. The unusual move to review all finance to Kiribati was prompted by the abrupt cancellation of a planned meeting this month between President Taneti Maamau and New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters, Peters' office told The Associated Press on Monday. It followed months of growing frustration from Australia and New Zealand — jointly responsible for more than a third of overseas development finance to Kiribati in 2022 — about a lack of engagement with the island nation. Tensions have risen since Kiribati aligned itself with China in 2019 and signed a series of bilateral deals with Beijing. A strategically important island nation The bond between Kiribati — population 120,000 — and its near neighbor New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, might not appear the South Pacific's most significant. But the acrimony reflects concern from western powers that their interests in the region are being undermined as China woos Pacific leaders with offers of funding and loans. That has provoked a contest for influence over Kiribati, an atoll nation that is among the world's most imperiled by rising sea levels. Its proximity to Hawaii and its vast exclusive economic zone — the world's 12th largest — have boosted its strategic importance. Powers vie for sway with aid Kiribati, one of the world's most aid-dependent nations, relies heavily on international support, with foreign assistance accounting for 18% of its national income in 2022, according to data from the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. About 10% of development finance that year came from New Zealand — which contributed 102 million New Zealand dollars ($58 million) between 2021 and 2024, official figures show. However, officials in Wellington and Canberra have expressed frustration over a lack of engagement from Tarawa regarding development projects. Frictions escalated when Kiribati suspended all visits from foreign officials in August, citing a need to focus on the government formation process after elections that month. Kiribati switched its allegiance from pro-Taiwan to pro-Beijing in 2019, joining a growing number of Pacific nations to do so. Self-governing Taiwan is claimed by China and since the shift, Beijing has increased aid to Kiribati. An official snub provokes backlash Peters was scheduled to meet Maamau, who has led the country since 2016, in Kiribati on Jan. 21 and Jan. 22, Peters' office said, but was told a week before the trip that Maamau could not accommodate him. It would have been the first visit by a New Zealand minister in more than five years. 'The lack of political-level contact makes it very difficult for us to agree joint priorities for our development program, and to ensure that it is well targeted and delivers good value for money,' a statement supplied by Peters' office said. New Zealand will review all development cooperation with Kiribati as a result, the statement added. The government of Kiribati did not respond to a request for comment, although Education Minister Alexander Teabo told Radio New Zealand on Tuesday that Maamau had a long-standing engagement on his home island — and denied a snub. New Zealand cautioned that the diplomatic rift could have broader consequences, including impacting New Zealand resident visas for Kiribati citizens and participation in a popular seasonal work scheme that brings Pacific horticulture and viticulture workers to New Zealand. New Zealand — home to large populations of Pacific peoples — is a popular spot for those from island nations to live and work. 'In the meantime, New Zealand stands ready, as we always have, to engage with Kiribati at a high level,' said the statement. Australia's softer approach The decision to review all development funding is a 'different, and more forceful approach' than New Zealand has taken before, said Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and contrasted with a different tack taken recently by Australia — which is Kiribati's biggest funder. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles traveled to the island nation this month as planned to deliver a patrol boat promised to Kiribati in 2023 — even though he did not meet with Maamau. Australia's foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the country 'remains committed to its longstanding partnership with Kiribati.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-reviews-its-aid-to-kiribati-after-the-pacific-island-nation-snubs-an-official-s-visit/7952756.html	2025-01-27T23:29:50-08:00	
White House pauses federal grant, loan other assistance programs	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has temporarily paused grant, loan and other financial assistance programs at the Office of Management and Budget, according to a memo seen by Reuters, prompting criticism from congressional Democrats. The memo referenced the executive orders, including those seeking to dismantle programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), President Donald Trump has signed since taking office last week. 'In the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law, federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be impacted by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal,' Matthew J. Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote in the memo. The suspension goes into effect on Jan. 28 at 5 p.m. eastern time, according to the memo. Top Democratic congressional budget appropriation lawmakers responded to reports of the memo by sending a letter demanding the OMB reverse its decision. 'The scope of what you are ordering is breathtaking, unprecedented, and will have devastating consequences across the country. We write today to urge you in the strongest possible terms to uphold the law and the Constitution and ensure all federal resources are delivered in accordance with the law,' Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro wrote. Agencies have until Feb. 10 to submit detailed information on any programs, projects or activities subject to the pause, the memo states. The suspension will provide the administration with time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of funding for those programs consistent with the law and Trump's priorities, it added. Agencies must identify legally mandated actions or deadlines for assistance programs before completing the analysis, it added. Vaeth directed federal agencies to halt all activities associated with open notices of funding opportunities. 'This memorandum requires federal agencies to identify and review all federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities consistent with the president's policies and requirement,' Vaeth wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-pauses-federal-grant-loan-other-assistance-programs/7952752.html	2025-01-27T23:11:06-08:00	
Colombia sends air force planes to bring home migrants deported from the US	A Colombian Air Force jet was expected to land back in the country early Tuesday carrying 110 Colombians deported from the United States. The flight from San Diego, along with another traveling from Houston back to Colombia, follows a dispute sparked Sunday when Colombian President Gustavo Petro refused to allow U.S. military planes to send deported Colombians back home. Petro said such treatment was disrespectful. His refusal prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten to impose tariffs, which Petro said he would reciprocate before the two countries announced they had reached an agreement to defuse the situation. Petro said the Colombian Air Force flights would allow the migrants to travel home 'without being handcuffed.' 'This provision: dignity for deportees, will be applied to all countries that send deportations to us,' Petro said. Trump has quickly moved to carry out deportations, one of his campaign pledges, since taking office last week. He said Monday that if countries do not accept their migrants fast, 'they’ll pay a very high economic price, and we’re going to immediately install massive tariffs.' While Colombia balked at the U.S. military flights, Guatemala has accepted several U.S. Air Force flights carrying Guatemalan migrants deported from the United States in recent days. The latest flight took place Monday, with 64 Guatemalans returning home. Guatemala’s Vice President Karin Herrera said Monday she was monitoring the care and condition of migrants arriving from the United States. 'Guatemalan migrants are people with rights and dignity. Our commitment is to guarantee that their arrival in the country, to their land, is in the best conditions,' Herrera said. U.S. deportation flights are not new, with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement carrying out hundreds of the flights each year. But the use of military flights is new, with the agency previously using commercial and chartered flights to deport people who are illegally in the United States.

China to prioritize physical education in schools as obesity rates rise	HONG KONG — China is aiming to beef up physical education in schools, making it core to the curriculum rather than a secondary subject, authorities said as they push for a more 'holistic education' amid growing concerns about the rise in childhood obesity. Primary and secondary schools must ensure physical education teachers are treated 'the same as their colleagues in subjects such as Chinese, math and English, and intensify efforts to develop key sports such as soccer, basketball and volleyball,' the official Xinhua news agency said, citing the country's Ministry of Education. 'These measures are part of a broader push for a more holistic approach to education, integrating physical fitness with academic development to cultivate well rounded students who are prepared for the future,' the Ministry said. The measures come after China issued its first national plan in January to build a 'strong education nation' by 2035. The policies included mandating primary and secondary school students to have at least two hours of physical activity daily, to effectively control myopia, or nearsightedness and obesity rates. In mid-2022 there was a nationwide shortage of around 120,000 physical education teachers, with rural areas the most affected, Xinhua said, adding that the new measures would encourage the recruitment of retired athletes and military veterans to help close the gap. Physical education teachers will receive equal compensation to their peers in other subjects, with performance based salary adjustments for after-school sports duties and team coaching, it said. Youth obesity has accelerated since 2019 due to decreased physical activity during COVID lockdowns and more online ordering of junk food. Doctors expect obesity to rise over the next 10-12 years as the economy slows and suffers structural changes that lead to poor eating habits and less physical activity. The proportion of obese boys in China jumped to 15.2% in 2022 from 1.3% in 1990, trailing the United States 22%, but higher than Japan's 6%, Britain's and Canada's 12% and India's 4%. Obesity in girls rose to 7.7% in 2022 from 0.6% in 1990. 'Obesity has become a major public health issue in China, ranking as the sixth leading risk factor for death and disability in the country,' the country's National Health Commission said in October.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-prioritize-physical-education-in-schools-as-obesity-rates-rise/7952745.html	2025-01-27T22:40:56-08:00	
Thailand denies mistreating detained gambling tycoon wanted by China	BANGKOK — Thailand denies abusing a jailed gambling tycoon fighting extradition to China over charges he ran illegal online gambling operations in Southeast Asia, the country's justice minister said on Tuesday. China-born She Zhijiang claims he received inhumane treatment in a Thai prison, including violence that has left him unable to stand, according to a letter his lawyers sent to Interpol and seen by Reuters. 'Our conduct towards him is like others (inmate) with regular access to lawyers,' Thai Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong told reporters at Government House in Bangkok. Tawee said that there are security cameras in place that would prevent any abuse or torture of inmates. The minister did not comment on allegations by She's lawyers in the letter to Interpol that Chinese embassy officials visited the tycoon in prison against his will to persuade him to return to China. The gambling tycoon, who says the case against him is politically motivated, was arrested in Bangkok in 2022 on an international warrant and an Interpol red notice sought by Beijing. A Thai court in 2023 ordered his extradition to China but She is appealing the ruling. Tawee said Cambodia had also asked for She to be extradited as he is a Cambodian citizen. Tawee said She's extradition destination will be decided by the Appeal Court. According to media reports, She is the chairman of Yatai International Holdings Group, which has made gaming investments in Cambodia, the Philippines and, most recently, developed a $15 billion casino, entertainment and tourism complex in Myanmar's Karen State called Shwe Kokko. China's Foreign Ministry told Reuters in a statement on Sunday that She was a Chinese national and a 'key figure in online gambling and telecom fraud crimes,' saying the evidence against him was 'conclusive.' Southeast Asia - especially border areas between Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia - has become a hub for telecom and other online fraud since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the United Nations, which says hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to work in scam centers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-denies-mistreating-detained-gambling-tycoon-wanted-by-china/7952744.html	2025-01-27T22:37:57-08:00

DOJ official: Trump administration fires team of lawyers who prosecuted him	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration on Monday fired more than a dozen Justice Department lawyers who brought two criminal cases against him, an official said, as the Republican moves swiftly to exert greater control over the department. The officials were fired after Acting Attorney General James McHenry, a Trump appointee, concluded they could not be trusted 'because of their significant role in prosecuting the President,' a Justice Department official said. McHenry cited Trump's power as chief executive under the U.S. Constitution to justify the firings, according to a copy of the termination letter seen by Reuters. The lawyers worked with Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the two federal prosecutions of Trump that the department dropped after his November election. Smith resigned from the department earlier this month. The norm-shattering move was made even though rank-and-file prosecutors by tradition remain with the department across presidential administrations and are not punished by virtue of their involvement in sensitive investigations. The firings are effective immediately. News of the firings came the same day that Ed Martin, the top federal prosecutor in Washington and a Trump appointee, opened an internal review into the use of a felony obstruction charge in prosecutions of people accused of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to a source familiar with the matter. The U.S. Supreme Court raised the legal bar for that offense in a 6-3 ruling last year, prompting prosecutors to drop the charge in several cases. Monday's moves came after the Trump administration already reassigned up to 20 senior career Justice Department officials, including Bradley Weinsheimer, the top ethics official, and the former chief of the public corruption section, Corey Amundson, from their roles. Amundson, whose section provided advice to Smith's prosecutors, announced his resignation on Monday. The moves to shake up the Justice Department's workforce have happened before the U.S. Senate votes on Trump's attorney general nominee Pam Bondi. Bondi's nomination is set to be voted on by a Senate panel on Wednesday. Smith, who was appointed by former Attorney General Merrick Garland, brought cases accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified documents at his Florida social club and attempting to interfere with the certification of the 2020 election. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and argued the cases reflected a 'weaponization' of the legal system. Smith dropped both cases after Trump's election, citing a longtime policy against prosecuting a sitting president. Many of those who worked on Smith's cases were longtime public corruption and national security prosecutors who remained in the department when Smith closed his investigation earlier this month.

Rubio and Lammy reaffirm US-UK partnership on Indo-Pacific security, China challenges	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with his British counterpart, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, on Monday to discuss a range of pressing global issues and joint initiatives aimed at promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable. 'They affirmed the depth of the U.S.-UK Special Relationship and the crucial nature of our partnership in addressing issues like the conflict in the Middle East, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and China’s malign influence,' State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. The U.K. government said that Lammy and Rubio look forward to meeting in person soon. 'They both welcomed the opportunity for the UK and the US to work together in alignment to address shared challenges including the situation in the Middle East, Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, the challenges posed by China and the need for Indo-Pacific security,' the British statement read. The call between Rubio and Lammy came amid a report by The Guardian that China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, is expected to visit Britain next month for the first U.K.-China strategic dialogue since 2018. In Beijing, Chinese officials did not confirm Wang’s plans to visit the U.K. but noted what they described as 'sound and steady growth' in relations between the two countries. 'China and the U.K. are both permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and major economies in the world,' Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, stated during a briefing on Monday. She added it is in the common interest of the two countries to enhance strategic communication and deepen political mutual trust. Wang is expected to attend the Munich Security Conference between Feb. 14 and 16, making it likely that his visit to the U.K. will take place either before or after the event. In the past, U.S. Secretaries of State have typically attended the high-profile annual gathering at the Munich Security Conference. The State Department has not responded to VOA’s inquiry about whether Rubio plans to hold talks with Wang during the conference. Last week, the State Department outlined U.S. policy toward China under President Donald Trump’s administration. 'Strategic competition is the frame through which the United States views its relationship with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The United States will address its relationship with the PRC from a position of strength in which we work closely with our allies and partners to defend our interests and values,' the State Department said on Jan. 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-and-lammy-reaffirm-us-uk-partnership-on-indo-pacific-security-china-challenges/7952715.html	2025-01-27T20:20:57-08:00

Afghan women take scholarship tests offered by Pakistan	WASHINGTON — It took Susan Salih about eight hours to travel from Kabul, Afghanistan, to Peshawar, Pakistan, to take a scholarship exam the Pakistani government offers to Afghan students. Salih, 25, and a group of other young Afghan women who took the exam at the Institute of Management Sciences in Peshawar told VOA that despite being able to take the test online, they traveled, accompanied by family members, to sit for the exam in person 'to not miss the opportunity.' 'I hope this will pay off at least for those girls who now have the chance [to pursue their higher education],' said Salih, who could not pursue her dream of a post-graduate degree in Afghanistan after the Taliban banned women from attending universities in 2022. Pakistan's Higher Education Commission said about 5,000 young women were among 21,000 applicants for the 2,000 scholarships announced for Afghan students. These scholarships are part of the 4,500 Allama Muhammad Iqbal Scholarships for Afghan Students, the commission said. The Pakistan government said the undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships are fully funded, covering tuition fees, hostel dues, and living, book and travel allowances. Tests for the scholarships took place in-person and online on Saturday and Sunday in Peshawar and Quetta. Muhammad Waqar Khan, senior project manager at the Higher Education Commission, said students will be 'short-listed' for scholarships based on merit. 'After this [the tests], we will conduct interviews' with those students, Khan said. Pakistani officials earlier told VOA on the condition of anonymity that the Taliban agreed to let female students pursue higher education in Pakistan, provided that their male guardians are granted visas to accompany them. But the Taliban, who seized power of Afghanistan in 2021, denied Monday that they reached any 'conditional agreement' regarding the scholarships. The Taliban have 'no agreement with Pakistan or any other country regarding scholarships for girls. ... Such unfounded claims are propaganda by certain malicious groups against the Islamic Emirate,' said a statement posted on the Taliban's Ministry of Higher Education website. The Taliban banned women from traveling long distances without a chaperone, working with the government and nongovernment organizations, and going to public baths, beauty salons and public parks. Pakistan's Higher Education Commission said the scholarships aim to 'strengthen [the] bilateral relationship' between the two countries. Salih said these scholarships offer Afghan women hope. 'We want to be a beacon of hope for those still in Afghanistan,' said Salih, adding that 'even in tough times and with many limitations, there is always hope and a path forward.' Ayaz Gul contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-women-take-scholarship-tests-offered-by-pakistan/7952691.html	2025-01-27T18:19:43-08:00	
China's DeepSeek AI rattles Wall Street, but questions remain	Chinese researchers backed by a Hangzhou-based hedge fund recently released a new version of a large language model (LLM) called DeepSeek-R1 that rivals the capabilities of the most advanced U.S.-built products but reportedly does so with fewer computing resources and at much lower cost. High Flyer, the hedge fund that backs DeepSeek, said that the model nearly matches the performance of LLMs built by U.S. firms like OpenAI, Google and Meta, but does so using only about 2,000 older generation computer chips manufactured by U.S.-based industry leader Nvidia while costing only about $6 million worth of computing power to train. By comparison, Meta’s AI system, Llama, uses about 16,000 chips, and reportedly costs Meta vastly more money to train. Open-source model The apparent advance in Chinese AI capabilities comes after years of efforts by the U.S. government to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them. Over the past two years, under President Joe Biden, the U.S. put multiple export control measures in place with the specific aim of throttling China’s progress on AI development. DeepSeek appears to have innovated its way to some of its success, developing new and more efficient algorithms that allow the chips in the system to communicate with each other more effectively, thereby improving performance. At least some of what DeepSeek R1’s developers did to improve its performance is visible to observers outside the company, because the model is open source, meaning that the algorithms it uses to answer queries are public. Market reaction The news about DeepSeek’s capabilities sparked a broad sell-off of technology stocks on U.S. markets on Monday, as investors began to question whether U.S. companies’ well-publicized plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data centers and other infrastructure would preserve their dominance in the field. When the markets closed on Monday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index was down by 3.1%, and Nvidia’s share price had plummeted by nearly 17%. However, not all AI experts believe the markets’ reaction to the release of DeepSeek R1 is justified, or that the claims about the model’s development should be taken at face value. Mel Morris, CEO of U.K.-based Corpora.ai, an AI research engine, told VOA that while DeepSeek is an impressive piece of technology, he believes the market reaction has been excessive and that more information is needed to accurately judge the impact DeepSeek will have on the AI market. 'There's always an overreaction to things, and there is today, so let's just step back and analyze what we're seeing here,' Morris said. 'Firstly, we have no real understanding of exactly what the cost was or the time scale involved in building this product. We just don't know. … They claim that it's significantly cheaper and more efficient, but we have no proof of that.' Morris said that while DeepSeek’s performance may be comparable to that of OpenAI products, 'I've not seen anything yet that convinces me that they've actually cracked the quantum step in the cost of operating these sorts of models.' Doubts about origins Lennart Heim, a data scientist with the RAND Corporation, told VOA that while it is plain that DeepSeek R1 benefits from innovative algorithms that boost its performance, he agreed that the general public actually knows relatively little about how the underlying technology was developed. Heim said that it is unclear whether the $6 million training cost cited by High Flyer actually covers the whole of the company’s expenditures — including personnel, training data costs and other factors — or is just an estimate of what a final training 'run' would have cost in terms of raw computing power. If the latter, Heim said, the figure is comparable to the costs incurred by better U.S. models. He also questioned the assertion that DeepSeek was developed with only 2,000 chips. In a blog post written over the weekend, he noted that the company is believed to have existing operations with tens of thousands of Nvidia chips that could have been used to do the work necessary to develop a model that is capable of running on just 2,000. 'This extensive compute access was likely crucial for developing their efficiency techniques through trial and error and for serving their models to customers,' he wrote. He also pointed out that the company’s decision to release version R1 of its LLM last week — on the heels of the inauguration of a new U.S. president — appeared political in nature. He said that it was 'clearly intended to rattle the public’s confidence in the United States’ AI leadership during a pivotal moment in U.S. policy.' Dean W. Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, was also cautious about declaring that DeepSeek R1 has somehow upended the AI landscape. 'I think Silicon Valley and Wall Street are overreacting to some extent,' he told VOA. 'But at the end of the day, R1 means that the competition between the U.S. and China is likely to remain fierce, and that we need to take it seriously.' Export control debate The apparent success of DeepSeek has been used as evidence by some experts to suggest that the export controls put in place under the Biden administration may not have had the intended effects. 'At a minimum, this suggests that U.S. approaches to AI and export controls may not be as effective as proponents claim,' Paul Triolo, a partner with DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, told VOA. 'The availability of very good but not cutting-edge GPUs — for example, that a company like DeepSeek can optimize for specific training and inference workloads — suggests that the focus of export controls on the most advanced hardware and models may be misplaced,' Triolo said. 'That said, it remains unclear how DeepSeek will be able to keep pace with global leaders such as OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, Meta and others that will continue to have access to the best hardware systems.' Other experts, however, argued that export controls have simply not been in place long enough to show results. Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown’s University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology told VOA that it would be 'very premature' to call the measures a failure. 'The CEO of DeepSeek has gone on record saying the biggest constraint they face is access to high-level compute resources,' Bresnick said. 'If [DeepSeek] had as much compute at their fingertips as Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, etc, there would be a significant boost in their performance. So … I don't think that DeepSeek is the smoking gun that some people are claiming it is [to show that export controls] do not work.' Bresnick noted that the toughest export controls were imposed in only 2023, meaning that their effects may just be starting to be felt. He said that the real test of their effectiveness will be whether U.S. firms are able to continue to outpace China in coming years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-deepseek-ai-rattles-wall-street-but-questions-remain-/7952661.html	2025-01-27T17:42:45-08:00

CDC ordered to stop working with WHO immediately	NEW YORK — U.S. public health officials have been told to stop working with the World Health Organization, effective immediately. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official, John Nkengasong, sent a memo to senior leaders at the agency on Sunday night telling them that all staff who work with the WHO must immediately stop their collaborations and 'await further guidance.' Experts said the sudden stoppage was a surprise and would set back work on investigating and trying to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus and mpox in Africa, as well as brewing global threats. It also comes as health authorities around the world are monitoring bird flu outbreaks among U.S. livestock. The Associated Press viewed a copy of Nkengasong's memo, which said the stop-work policy applied to 'all CDC staff engaging with WHO through technical working groups, coordinating centers, advisory boards, cooperative agreements or other means — in person or virtual.' It also says CDC staff are not allowed to visit WHO offices. President Donald Trump last week issued an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the U.S. from WHO, but that did not take immediate effect. Leaving WHO requires the approval of Congress and that the U.S. meets its financial obligations for the current fiscal year. The U.S. also must provide a one-year notice. His administration also told federal health agencies to stop most communications with the public through at least the end of the month. 'Stopping communications and meetings with WHO is a big problem,' said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public health expert who collaborates with WHO on work against sexually transmitted infections. 'People thought there would be a slow withdrawal. This has really caught everyone with their pants down,' said Klausner, who said he learned of it from someone at CDC. 'Talking to WHO is a two-way street,' he added, noting that the two agencies benefit from each other's expertise. The collaboration allows the U.S. to learn about new tests, new treatments and emerging outbreaks — information 'which can help us protect Americans abroad and at home,' Klausner said. The CDC details nearly 30 people to WHO and sends many millions of dollars to it through cooperative agreements. The U.S. agency also has some of the world's leading experts in infectious diseases and public health threats, and the two agencies' staffers are in daily contact about health dangers and how to stop them. The collaboration halt isn't the only global health effect of Trump's executive orders. Last week, the president froze spending on another critical program, PEPFAR or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The anti-HIV program is credited with saving 25 million lives, including those of 5.5 million children, since it was started by Republican President George W. Bush. It was included in a Trump administration freeze on foreign aid spending slated to last at least three months. PEPFAR provides HIV medication to more than 20 million people 'and stopping its funding essentially stops their HIV treatment,' International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement. 'If that happens, people are going to die and HIV will resurge.' A U.S. health official confirmed that the CDC was stopping its work with WHO. The person was not authorized to talk about the memo and spoke on condition of anonymity. A WHO spokesperson referred questions about the withdrawal to U.S. officials. Officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. And CDC officials didn't respond to the AP's request to speak with Nkengasong about the memo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cdc-ordered-to-stop-working-with-who-immediately/7952673.html	2025-01-27T17:23:39-08:00	
Google Maps to rename 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' for US users	WASHINGTON — Google Maps will change the name of 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' once it is officially updated in the U.S. Geographic Names System, it said in an X post on Monday. The change will be visible in the U.S., but it will remain 'Gulf of Mexico' in Mexico. Outside of the two countries, users will see both names. The Trump administration's Interior Department said on Friday it had officially changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and the Alaskan peak Denali to Mount McKinley. Google Maps, which is owned by Alphabet's Google, will make a similar change with Mount McKinley. President Donald Trump ordered the name changes as part of a flurry of executive actions hours after taking office last Monday, making good on a campaign promise. 'As directed by the President, the Gulf of Mexico will now officially be known as the Gulf of America and North America's highest peak will once again bear the name Mount McKinley,' the Interior Department said in a statement last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-maps-to-rename-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america-for-us-users/7952630.html	2025-01-27T16:35:18-08:00	
Full-scale replica of Anne Frank's hidden annex opens in New York City	NEW YORK — A full-scale replica of the secret annex where Anne Frank penned her famous diary opened in New York City on Monday as the world marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The exhibit at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan represents the first time the annex has been completely recreated outside of Amsterdam, where the space is a central part of the Anne Frank House museum. But while the original annex has been intentionally left empty, the New York reconstruction shows the five rooms as they would have looked while the Frank family and others lived in hiding. The spaces are filled with furniture and possessions, including a reconstruction of the writing desk where Frank wrote her diary. Ronald Leopold, director of the Anne Frank House, said furnishing the recreated space was important to tell Anne's story in a new and immersive way, especially for those who may not get to visit the Amsterdam museum, which also houses Frank’s original diary. 'We very much hope that we will be able to touch people’s hearts here, because education is the focus of this exhibition,' Leopold said at Monday's opening. 'And education starts with empathy — empathy with what happened here, what happened in Amsterdam during those years, what was done to Anne Frank.' The Frank family hid with other Jews for two years in the attic of patriarch Otto Frank’s office in Amsterdam as the Nazi German army occupied the Netherlands during World War II. They were eventually discovered in 1944 and sent to concentration camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was liberated by Soviet troops 80 years ago Monday. Anne and her older sister Margot died of typhus at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Their father, Otto, was the only person from the annex to survive the Holocaust. After the war, he published his 15-year-old daughter’s diary, which is considered one of the most important works of the 20th century. Frank died in 1980 at the age of 91. Hannah-Milena Elias, the granddaughter of Anne Frank’s cousin, Buddy Elias, said she found it emotional walking through the exhibit rooms. 'It is quite overwhelming and quite touching to see what a tiny space the families had to stay in and live for more than two years,' said the 29-year-old, who lives in Switzerland. Her sister, Leyv-Anouk Elias, hoped the exhibit would encourage visitors to reflect on what it means to face discrimination or be a minority today. 'History, unfortunately, is repeating itself in different ways,' the 27-year-old Berlin resident said. 'We have to be very, very careful how to act and to do stuff against it, to not ever make this happen again.' The New York exhibit, which runs through April 30, spans more than 696 square meters (7,500 square feet) and includes more than 100 photos and other artifacts — many never before displayed publicly, according to officials. Among the items are Anne Frank’s first photo album and her handwritten poetry, as well as a replica of her famous diary. There are also nearly 80 translated editions of her diary and even the Oscar won by Shelley Winters for the 1959 film The Diary of Anne Frank. The installation is presented chronologically, tracing the Frank family's life in Germany through the rise of the Nazi regime, the family’s flight to Amsterdam and their life in hiding and eventual capture. Henry Byrne, a junior at Xavier, a Catholic high school in Manhattan, said learning about the family's saga helped him grasp the enormity of the Holocaust. 'It taught me a lot about how just because you see one story, walk into these rooms and all the beds and the tables, that’s just one person’s life,' the 16-year-old said. 'And there were millions that were lost.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/full-scale-replica-of-anne-frank-s-hidden-annex-opens-in-new-york-city/7952619.html	2025-01-27T16:18:01-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: Americans and Chinese are comparing living costs at Xiaohongshu	In mid-January, a wave of U.S. users migrated to China’s platform Xiaohongshu due to the TikTok ban, engaging in an unexpected 'cost-of-living comparison' with Chinese users. Despite higher wages, many Americans found their living expenses made life harder than in China. However, analysts caution that such comparisons, while straightforward, may not align with more rigorous economic data.

VOA Mandarin: What is Stargate? Is China catching up in AI?	The multibillion-dollar Stargate Project announced by U.S. President Donald Trump will focus on building data centers with the goal of turning the U.S. into a computing power empire, according to experts. Some believe the significant boost in U.S. computational capabilities will widen the gap with China in artificial intelligence. 'And this is an industrial buildout that, at least right now, China really is not in a position to do because of the [semiconductor] export controls that the United States is placing,' said Dean W. Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. However, there are signs that China is catching up with U.S. companies in key AI metrics by relying on open-source software.

Belarusian opposition, Western leaders denounce Lukashenko's reelection	Belarus’ opposition activists and Western officials have denounced the reelection of Alexander Lukashenko to serve his seventh five-year presidential term. The 70-year-old leader began his iron-fisted rule in 1994. He received nearly 87% of the ballots cast in Sunday’s election in the Eastern European country, according to the Belarus Central Election Commission. His victory was not surprising as he has imprisoned many of his opponents, while others have fled abroad to live in exile. Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya labeled Lukashenko’s successful reelection as 'sheer nonsense.' Before Sunday’s vote, she had encouraged voters to cross out every candidate’s name on the ballot. The four challengers in Sunday’s election had all praised Lukashenko’s leadership, according to The Associated Press. The European Union, Britain, Australia and New Zealand issued a joint statement condemning 'the sham presidential elections in Belarus and the country’s human rights violations under Lukashenko.' Britain’s Foreign Office said Monday that it has sanctioned six Belarus citizens and three defense sector firms, after the Sunday polls in Belarus. The sanctioned individuals include the head of the Belarusian Central Election Commission and two prison chiefs. 'Following Lukashenko's brutal crackdown in which critical voices within Belarus have been silenced, yesterday's sham election failed to meet international standards and has been condemned by international partners,' the Foreign Office said. The Foreign Office also said that the sanctions were being placed in coordination with Canada. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement, 'The world has become well-accustomed to Lukashenko's cynical pretense of democracy in Belarus, while in reality he brutally represses civil society and opposition voices to strengthen his grip on power.' Lukashenko's successful presidential bid in 2020 set off months of protests in which thousands of people were beaten and more than 65,000 were arrested. He was roundly condemned by the West, which imposed sanctions. However, he survived the protests with the help of his close ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Lukashenko depends on for subsidies, as well as political support. Putin called Lukashenko Monday to congratulate him on his 'convincing victory.' Chinese President Xi Jinping also congratulated the Belarusian leader. The Viasna Human Rights Center, an exiled Belarusian nongovernmental organization, said in a statement that Belarus has over 1,250 political prisoners in custody. Some information in this story was provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarusian-opposition-western-leaders-denounce-lukashenko-s-reelection/7952376.html	2025-01-27T16:02:14-08:00	
Scott Bessent wins Senate confirmation as US Treasury secretary	The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed Scott Bessent to be President Donald Trump's Treasury secretary, giving the billionaire hedge fund manager a central role in shaping the new administration's policy ambitions around tax cuts and spending and managing economic relationships with allies and adversaries alike. As the 79th Treasury secretary, Bessent will have sway over the nation's tax collections and its $28 trillion Treasury debt market, with vast influence over fiscal policy, financial regulations, international sanctions and investments from overseas. The vote was 68-29, with 16 Democrats supporting the nomination. Bessent, 62, is already shaping up to be a forceful advocate for Trump's economic agenda, which centers on reducing taxes and imposing steep tariffs that Democrats, and some economists, argue could undo some of the progress the Federal Reserve has made in getting inflation under control. In his confirmation hearing, Bessent warned that failure to renew $4 trillion in tax cuts expiring at the end of this year would be a 'calamity' for middle-class Americans, and made the case that tariffs would help combat unfair trade practices, increase revenues, and bolster U.S. leverage in international negotiations. He also pushed back against the idea that Trump's policies would be inflationary, and said that the administration's efforts to increase oil production would actually help bring down prices. As Trump's top economic official, Bessent will face a range of challenges, the most immediate of which will be managing federal cash flows after the government hit its statutory debt limit on Trump's second day in office. Even before he was sworn in, the Treasury Department was using 'extraordinary measures' to avoid breaching the cap and triggering a catastrophic default. Bessent told senators in his confirmation hearing that there would be no default on his watch. Bessent will also need to deal with the prospect of rising budget deficits and added government debt estimated to run into the trillions of dollars, if tax cut extensions and other promised tax breaks cannot be offset by revenue increases or spending cuts. If precedent holds, he will be a central actor working with Congress on the size and shape of any tax reforms. More than 60% of the federal debt is scheduled to roll over on his watch — and that's before taking into account issuance growth that has been running at more than $2 trillion a year since the COVID-19 pandemic. 'Out of control' Worries about rising budget deficits and stickier inflation have in recent weeks sent long-term bond yields up as investors demand more compensation for risk. That in turn has driven up the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to more than 7%, a pain point with saliency for Americans looking to buy a home. Bessent used his confirmation hearing to talk tough on deficits, declaring that government spending is 'out of control,' though it is not clear how much he could do to rein it in. He backed Trump's pledge not to touch the Social Security retirement program and Medicare insurance plan for seniors, among the biggest line items in the federal budget, along with interest expense, determined by market rates that the Treasury does not control. Born and raised in South Carolina, Bessent says he still listens to farm radio. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Yale University and has spent his career in finance, working for investors George Soros and Jim Chanos, and running his own firm Key Square. Bessent — as fifth in line to the presidency — is also the highest ranking openly gay federal official in history. He is married with two children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/scott-bessent-wins-senate-confirmation-as-us-treasury-secretary/7952378.html	2025-01-27T16:01:15-08:00

Earthquake rattles houses in Maine, felt as far away as Pennsylvania	SCARBOROUGH, Maine — A 3.8-magnitude earthquake centered near the Maine coast rattled houses in northern New England on Monday and was felt by surprised residents of states hundreds of miles away. The earthquake took place at about 10:22 a.m. Monday and was centered about six miles (10 kilometers) southeast of York Harbor in southern Maine, the United States Geological Survey reported. It was reported at a depth of about eight miles (13 kilometers) the survey said. Officials said the quake could be felt in every state in New England and as far away as Pennsylvania. In southern Maine, many residents reported feeling houses and buildings shake as the surprising earthquake interrupted a sunny winter morning. The quake sent residents and officials in Maine and New Hampshire looking to assess any possible damage. In most cases, residents and businesses reported confusion over what had happened. Many shared stories on social media indicating they initially thought there may have been a nearby car accident or possibly an explosion. The Maine Emergency Management Agency asked residents to only call 911 in the event of an emergency. The earthquake did not appear to cause any major damage, said Vanessa Corson, a spokesperson for the agency. Corson also said local emergency management agencies did not report any damage. New Hampshire’s Department of Safety said the state's 911 number did not receive any calls about damage or injuries. 'We have not received word of any issues. We’ve spoken with the directors at York and Cumberland County EMA, and everything seems to be in order,' Corson said. Justine Wenger, a freelance copywriter working from her Scarborough home, said she was texting with a friend when she felt the earthquake. The vibrations lasted about 30 seconds and shook her house. At first, she thought it was a passing truck, then feared her furnace might blow up so she went out onto her deck. 'I wasn’t terrified, but this felt different than a normal rumbling,' she said. 'It felt substantial. There was an instinct to get out of the house.' Authorities said residents who felt the earthquake could report it to the USGS website. Earthquakes in the center and eastern parts of the U.S. are less frequent than in western states, but they are typically felt over a much broader region, the survey said on its website. It’s common for there to be two small earthquakes a year in New England, the survey said. A slightly stronger earthquake based in New Jersey shook the Northeast in April. 'People in New England, and in its geological extension southward through Long Island, have felt small earthquakes and suffered damage from infrequent larger ones since colonial times,' according to the survey’s website. An earthquake of close to 4.0 or slightly higher in magnitude in the Northeast states 'is not particularly common, but it’s not all that rare, either,' said Maureen Long, the chair of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Yale University. Long cited the April earthquake in New Jersey as an example. A 2002 earthquake in upstate New York was measured at a magnitude of 5.1. There was also a magnitude 4.7 event near Hollis Center, Maine, in 2012, Long said. Residents of cities including Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, also reported feeling the quake. In Kennebunk, Maine, school superintendent Terri Cooper assured parents via e-mail that staff was looking through schools for any damage and everything seemed fine. 'Our operations department has checked all district buildings and systems to ensure they are in working order and no damage has been discovered,' Cooper’s e-mail said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquake-rattles-houses-in-maine-felt-as-far-away-as-pennsylvania/7952380.html	2025-01-27T15:56:32-08:00

Serbian farmers join striking university students' 24-hour traffic blockade in Belgrade	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Serbia's striking university students on Monday launched a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the capital, Belgrade, stepping up pressure on the populist authorities over a deadly canopy collapse in November that killed 15 people. Serbian farmers on tractors and thousands of citizens joined the blockade that followed weeks of protests demanding accountability of the deadly accident in the northern city of Novi Sad that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption. A campaign of street demonstrations has posed the biggest challenge in years to the populist government's firm grip on power in Serbia. Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic, later on Monday urged dialogue with the students, saying, 'We need to lower the tensions and start talking to each other.' Students in the past have refused to meet with Vucic, saying the president is not entitled by the constitution to hold talks with them. 'Any kind of a crisis poses a serious problem for our economy,' said Vucic. 'Such a situation in society is not good for anyone.' Vucic has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union membership for Serbia. He has accused the students of working for unspecified foreign powers to oust the government. Several incidents have marked the street demonstrations in the past weeks, including drivers ramming into the crowds on two occasions, when two young women were injured. Traffic police on Monday secured the student blockade to help avoid any similar incidents. Protesting students set up tents at the protest site, which is a key artery for the city commuters and toward the main north-south motorway. Some students played volleyball, others sat down on blankets on the pavement or walked around on a warm day. The students also held a daily 15-minute commemoration silence at 11:52, the exact time when the canopy at a train station in Novi Sad crashed on Nov. 1. Many in Serbia believe the huge concrete canopy fell because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption. Serbia's prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people, including a government minister and several state officials. But the former construction minister, Goran Vesic, has been released from detention, fueling doubts over the investigation's independence. The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-farmers-join-striking-university-students-24-hour-traffic-blockade-in-belgrade/7952334.html	2025-01-27T15:24:29-08:00

Hundreds of US visa appointments canceled in Colombia following spat with Trump over deportations	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — Visa appointments at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia were canceled Monday following a dispute between President Donald Trump and his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro over deportation flights from the U.S. that nearly turned into a costly trade war between the two countries. Dozens of Colombians arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota and were handed letters by local staff that said their appointments had been canceled 'due to the Colombian government's refusal to accept repatriation flights of Colombian nationals' over the weekend. Later on Monday, Colombia's Foreign Affairs Ministry said the government was sending a Colombian Air Force plane to San Diego to pick up a group of Colombians who were on a deportation flight that was not allowed to land on Sunday morning. The victory claimed in Washington turned Colombia into an example of what other nations could face if they stand in the way of Trump's illegal immigration crackdown. It also put on display a clash with a leftist leader of a country that had long been a U.S. partner against drug trafficking. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Monday the Trump administration will take action if countries do not abide by their agreements, such as accepting deportees. 'This was about reminding Colombia that there is a price to pay if you go against your agreements, things that you promise,' she said in an interview on Fox News' 'The Story.' 'Ultimately, what one would expect to happen did happen. They said, 'Oh, our bad,' and they reversed everything.' Colombians, like most non-U.S. citizens, require a visa to travel to the United States for tourism, business or other purposes. But in Colombia, it can take up to two years to get a visa appointment at the U.S Embassy in Bogota, which has also been handling visa requests from neighboring Venezuela for several years. Those who had their Monday appointments canceled will likely have to wait several months for a new appointment. And many said they were frustrated with the unexpected cancellations. 'President Petro did not represent our interests,' said Elio Camelo, a U.S. visa seeker from the city of Cali who had traveled to Bogota for his appointment. 'There is a lot of uncertainty now over what will happen next,' said Mauricio Manrique, who had his Monday morning appointment canceled. He had traveled from Popayan, about 600 kilometers (about 370 miles) south of Bogota, for his appointment. Tensions between Colombia and the United States escalated Sunday after Petro wrote an early morning message on X saying he would not allow two U.S. Air Force planes carrying Colombian deportees to land in the country. Petro also shared a video that showed another group of deportees reportedly arriving in Brazil with shackles on their legs. He said Colombia would only accept deportation flights when the United States had established protocols that ensured the 'dignified treatment' of expelled migrants. Trump responded with a post of his own on Truth Social, in which he called for 25% emergency tariffs on Colombian exports to the United States and also said that the U.S. visas of Colombian government officials would be revoked, while goods coming from the South American country would face enhanced customs inspections. Meanwhile, the State Department said Sunday it would stop issuing visas to Colombian nationals until deportation flights resumed. Tensions decreased Sunday night following negotiations between the countries, with the White House saying in a statement that Colombia had allowed the resumption of deportation flights and 'agreed to all of President Trump's terms,' including the arrival of deportees on military flights. Last year, Colombia accepted 124 deportation flights. But those were charter flights organized by U.S. government contractors. The White House said tariffs on Colombian exports would be put on hold but added that visa restrictions on Colombian officials and enhanced custom inspections would remain 'until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned.' The State Department has not responded to requests for comment on the resumption of visa appointments. Last year, more than 1.6 million Colombians traveled to the U.S. legally, according to a report by the Ministry of Commerce. The report said the United States was the top destination for Colombians traveling abroad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-us-visa-appointments-canceled-in-colombia-following-spat-with-trump-over-deportations/7952343.html	2025-01-27T15:16:04-08:00	
Woman gets more than 3-year prison term in ‘US birthright tourism’ case	Los Angeles — A California woman was sentenced Monday to more than 3 years in prison in a long-running case over a business that helped pregnant Chinese women travel to the United States to deliver babies who automatically became American citizens. U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner gave Phoebe Dong a 41-month sentence and ordered her immediately taken into custody from his federal court in Los Angeles. Dong and her husband were convicted in September of conspiracy and money laundering through their company, USA Happy Baby. The sentencing came as birthright citizenship has been thrust into the spotlight in the United States with the return of President Donald Trump to the White House. Since taking office, Trump issued an executive order to narrow the definition of birthright citizenship, a move quickly blocked by a federal judge who called it 'blatantly unconstitutional.' Dong and her husband, Michael Liu, were among more than a dozen people charged in an Obama-era crackdown on so-called 'birth tourism' schemes that helped Chinese women hide their pregnancies while traveling to the United States to give birth. Such businesses have long operated in various states catering to people from China, Russia, Nigeria and elsewhere. Under the 14th Amendment, any child born in the United States is an American citizen. Many have seen these trips as a way to help their children secure a U.S. college education and a better future — especially since the tourists themselves can apply for permanent residency once the children turn 21. During her sentencing hearing, Dong wiped away tears as she recalled growing up without siblings due to China’s strict 'one-child' policy and told the court that the Chinese government forced her mother to have an abortion. Moving to the United States was challenging, she said, but Dong grew hopeful after having children of her own and saw she could help Chinese women who want to have additional children in California. 'I don’t want to lose my kids,' she told the court. 'I hope you can give me fair judgment. I will take all my responsibility.' Federal prosecutors sought a more than five-year sentence for Dong and argued that she and Liu helped more than 100 pregnant Chinese women travel to the United States. They said the pair worked with others to coach women on how to trick customs officials by flying into airports believed to be more lax while wearing loose-fitting clothing to hide their pregnancies. 'For tens of thousands of dollars each, defendant helped her numerous customers deceive U.S. authorities and buy U.S. citizenship for their children,' prosecutors said in court filings. They declined to comment after the sentencing. In December, Liu was also sentenced to 41 months in prison. Dong's lawyer, John McNicholas, asked that she be allowed to serve her term after Liu completes his sentence because of their three children. The youngest is 13. Federal prosecutor Kevin Fu agreed to the delay, but Klausner refused and had her taken into custody immediately. Dong removed a necklace and gave it to a family member before she was led away. The USA Happy Baby case was part of a broader probe into businesses that helped Chinese women travel to give birth in California. The operator of another business is believed to have fled to China, McNicholas wrote in court filings, while another was sentenced in 2019 to 10 months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and visa fraud for running the company known as 'You Win USA.' McNicholas said he feels Dong was given a much longer sentence because the government and Klausner blame her for the babies that were born U.S. citizens. That, he said, is unrelated to the allegations that she and Liu helped women travel to the United States to give birth. 'Our position was these children are born in America. They’re citizens,' McNicholas said, adding that Dong will appeal. 'Implicitly, he’s saying being born here is not enough.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/woman-gets-more-than-3-year-prison-term-in-us-birthright-tourism-case/7952350.html	2025-01-27T15:13:41-08:00	
Pakistani journalists fear amended cybercrime law will further curb freedoms	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan is pressing ahead with amendments to its digital crimes act to stem what it says is an influx of fake news. But media rights groups warn the changes, if passed, will suppress freedom of expression by exposing journalists and social media users to legal action. New amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (2025), commonly known as PECA, call for a three-year prison term and a fine of over $7,000 for spreading fake and false information. The amendments also broaden the definition of content that authorities can block and set up four new bodies to regulate online content. The amended law now awaits passage in the Senate after its Standing Committee on Interior approved the amendments Monday. The National Assembly, the lower house of the country’s bicameral parliament, passed the amended bill last Thursday as opposition members and journalists walked out in protest. 'The fact that [the] interior ministry is involved in this clearly shows that this is being turned into a national security matter,' said Nayyar Ali, secretary of the National Press Club that represents journalists in Islamabad and neighboring Rawalpindi. The law Originally promulgated as Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (2016), PECA, as it is commonly known, was meant to curb cybercrime, online harassment, and the spread of hateful content that could instigate violence. Media and human rights groups call the law 'draconian' and say successive governments have used it to muzzle dissent. Press freedom groups have recorded more than 200 incidents of journalists and media persons investigated since PECA became law in 2017. The latest changes to the law come just days before Pakistan marks a year since its elections last Feb. 8 were marred by allegations of widespread fraud. Former Prime Minister Imran Khan, one of the most popular leaders, remains in jail and his party is deprived of its share of seats reserved for women and minorities. However, his supporters continue to run a formidable online campaign when most TV channels avoid saying the leader’s name. 'State and private players have been able to tame mainstream media,' said journalist Arifa Noor about the decline in press freedom over the past several years. 'It has pushed a considerable amount of the commentary and reporting onto social media, and this is why they now want to go after social media. 'They can’t tame it and they want to tame it,' she said. Pakistan ranks a low 152 out of 180 countries on Reporters without Borders' global press freedom index, where 1 shows the best media environment. Freedom House ranks it 'not free' for internet freedoms. Amendments PECA (2025) as approved by the national assembly expands the definition of unlawful content to include information that is false, harmful, and damages the reputation of a person including members of the judiciary, armed forces, parliament or a provincial assembly. It also broadens the definition of 'person' to include state institutions and corporations. Critics worry this will muzzle dissent and open doors for the powerful military to target civilians. Minister for Information for Punjab province Azma Bukhari rejected the concerns as 'undue.' 'The [military] institution also belongs to this country,' he said. 'If the institution has an objection over someone, should it not object [just] because it’s an institution?' The amendments come as Pakistan’s military routinely faces criticism online for its role in civilian affairs as well as for its alleged interference in political affairs, which it denies. Faced often with smear campaigns, the military’s top brass has repeatedly called for a crackdown on 'digital terrorism.' 'What we need is strong civil laws that treat defamation as a civil problem,' Noor said. The amended law stipulates a punishment of up to three years in prison and a fine of more than $7,000 for intentionally disseminating information that a person knows or believes is 'false or fake and likely to cause or create a sense of fear, panic or disorder or unrest in general public or society.' 'What is fake news? They don’t bother to define it,' Noor, the journalist, said. 'They want to call everything that they don’t like fake news.' Journalists’ bodies say the impact of the amended law will not be limited to social media content makers. 'All the media is digital now,' said Ali, secretary of the National Press Club, as mainstream media outlets and prominent journalists use social media to deliver information that can draw state backlash if delivered on TV channels. New powers The bill proposes creating a Digital Rights Protection Authority, a Social Media Complaint Council, a Social Media Protection Tribunal and a National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority. Decisions made by the tribunal can only be challenged in the Supreme Court, bypassing the traditional appeals process that includes provincial high courts. Punjab information minister Bukhari defended the amendment saying, 'we are giving access to the highest forum in the country.' However, the Press Club’s Ali said most citizens do not have the financial means to approach the country’s top court through lawyers. Bukhari, who has been a target of an AI-generated smear campaign, told VOA that Pakistan needs such a law. 'Those who deal in fake news should be fearful of this law,' she said. 'Those who file with checks and balances should not worry.' However, Noor said journalists are also caught in a bind when government officials give contradictory information that causes the spread of false information. Rushed passage Some journalists’ bodies have said they support government efforts to regulate digital spaces, however they are questioning the speedy passage of the amended law in the National Assembly and approval of amendments by the Senate committee. Expressing concern over the chilling effects of the amendments, the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan as well as Amnesty International last week called on the government to consult journalist bodies before turning the bill into law. In a statement Thursday, the Joint Action Committee, a coalition of major media bodies of the country 'rejected any PECA amendments that are passed or approved without consultation with media bodies.' The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists has called for nationwide protests on Tuesday afternoon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-journalists-fear-amended-cybercrime-law-will-further-curb-freedoms-/7952337.html	2025-01-27T14:56:09-08:00	
Auschwitz liberation at 80: Survivors, world leaders mark milestone	LONDON — Around 50 survivors and dozens of world leaders attended memorial events at the site of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland on Monday to mark the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Soviet Red Army in World War II. January 27 is marked around the world as International Holocaust Memorial Day. Six million people were killed in the Holocaust as the Nazis attempted to eliminate the Jewish race. In front of the so-called 'Death Gate,' through which more than a million Jews and other prisoners were led to their deaths, the survivors gathered in a heated tent, joined by heads of state and delegates from across the world. They lit candles and laid wreaths of remembrance for the estimated 1.1 million people who perished at the camp. Tova Friedman, who was 2 years old when she was taken to the camp at Auschwitz, is the youngest of the survivors. 'We were victims in a moral vacuum,' she told delegates. 'But today, however, we have an obligation not only to remember, which is very, very important, but also to warn and to teach that hatred only begets more hatred.' Auschwitz liberation On Jan. 27, 1945, Red Army troops liberated Auschwitz, the largest of the six Nazi extermination camps. What they found continues to haunt humanity. Industrial-scale human slaughter spread across a vast factory complex of dormitories, gas chambers, crematoria and mass graves — the apparatus of a regime determined to wipe out the entire Jewish race. A genocide conducted over 4-and-a-half years, planned and executed with meticulous detail. It was part of the Nazis’ 'final solution to the Jewish problem' — a strategy of mass murder agreed at the Wannsee Conference in 1942. An estimated 1.1 million people were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, around 960,000 of them Jews. Poles, Roma, homosexuals, Soviet prisoners of war and other nationalities were also murdered in the thousands. Victims were stripped of their clothing and forced into packed chambers filled with cyanide-based Zyklon-B gas. By summer 1944, an estimated 12,000 people a day were being gassed to death. Thousands of others were shot or beaten to death or died from disease, starvation and exposure. Bodies were burned or buried in mass graves. 'Burning bodies' Janina Iwanska was taken to Auschwitz by train from another Polish transit camp in August 1944 at age 14. 'As soon as I got off the wagon, I was immediately hit by the smell, the one I knew from Treblinka [concentration camp] — the smell of burning bodies,' she told Reuters. 'There were small children there who were brought with their mothers. After leaving the ‘disinfection’ room, they were separated, torn off them. The mothers almost ripped the hands of these children off because they did not want to let them go. Besides, some of the children could not recognize their mothers, because not only were the clothes different but also the heads. A shaved head and a head with hair are two completely different heads,' Iwanska said. As Red Army troops approached the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp from the east, Nazi soldiers attempted to cover up their crimes. Around 60,000 prisoners were forcibly transferred in so-called 'death marches' to other camps farther west. It’s estimated that up to 15,000 died along the way. By the time the Russian troops entered Auschwitz, around 7,000 prisoners remained, most on the brink of death. Thousands died before receiving medical help. ‘Culture of remembrance’ Germany now embraces 'Erinnerungskultur,' an official 'culture of remembrance,' or a duty to take responsibility for the Holocaust. 'We keep alive the memory of the breach of civilization committed by Germans in the Holocaust and convey it to every generation in our country again and again. Our responsibility never ends,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said ahead of the anniversary. But the 80th anniversary comes amid growing fears over the rise of the far-right in Germany, Europe and beyond. Such concerns were voiced by many Auschwitz survivors, including Leon Weintraub, who was deported to Auschwitz in 1944 and now lives in Sweden. 'Be attentive and be vigilant,' Weintraub told delegates. 'We, the survivors, we understand that the consequences of being considered different is active persecution, the effects of which we have personally experienced on our own skin. So, let us be very serious, and let us take seriously what the enemies of democracy preach. They generally seek to implement these slogans they promote,' he said. German fears The German government has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) Party, which is polling in second place, or around 20%, ahead of February elections. The AfD is being monitored by German intelligence services as a potentially 'extremist' party. In a recent televised conversation with Elon Musk, the U.S. billionaire and ally of President Donald Trump, AfD’s leader Alice Weidel said Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was not right-wing but a 'communist.' Speaking at an AfD conference Saturday by video link, Musk, who is an open supporter of the party, questioned Germany’s approach to its past. 'I think there’s frankly too much of a focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that. Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents or even let alone their parents, the great-grandparents, maybe even,' Musk said. Israel conflict The Hamas cross-border attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, and the brutal Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, have overshadowed memorial events in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not attend the Auschwitz commemorations. Netanyahu faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for suspected war crimes committed during Israel’s war on Hamas, which he strongly denies. The United States, a close ally of Israel, has condemned the warrant and threatened sanctions against the court in The Hague. Poland assured Netanyahu that he would not be arrested if he attended the Auschwitz memorial events. However, the Israeli prime minister instead spent Monday in a Tel Aviv court as his long-running corruption trial resumed. Israel was instead represented by Education Minister Yoav Kisch. Relatives of the dozens of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza traveled to Poland for the Auschwitz liberation anniversary, while survivors of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre joined survivors of the Holocaust for commemorative events in Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/auschwitz-liberation-at-80-survivors-world-leaders-mark-milestone/7952314.html	2025-01-27T14:26:23-08:00	
Fight for control of major Congolese city 'ongoing,' says UN official	UNITED NATIONS — A senior U.N. official in the Democratic Republic of the Congo said Monday that fighting between Rwandan-backed rebels and the Congolese army for an important provincial capital in the country’s east is 'not over yet,' despite claims by the rebels to have captured the city of Goma. 'Fighting is still very much ongoing,' said Bruno Lemarquis, U.N. resident coordinator in the DRC. 'It's a very, very fluid situation. It's a very dangerous situation.' He told reporters via a video call from DRC’s capital, Kinshasa, that 'active zones of combat have spread to all quarters' of Goma in North Kivu province. Lemarquis said there have been severe disruptions to water, electricity, internet and phone service. Humanitarian warehouses have been looted. In early January, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the east with the support of the Rwandan army. The U.N. says the rebels have made significant territorial gains and are seeking to open a new front in neighboring South Kivu province. The United Nations Security Council, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and senior U.N. officials are calling for the M23 to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories. They have called for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces and a return to the Luanda process of mediation overseen by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. 'On behalf of the humanitarian community, I call on all parties to agree on temporary humanitarian pauses in the most affected areas and establish humanitarian corridors to ensure humanitarian activities resume at scale. And more importantly, also to facilitate the safe evacuation of wounded individuals and civilians trapped in combat zones,' Lemarquis added. The United Nations announced Sunday a $17 million disbursement from its central emergency fund for urgent humanitarian needs in DRC. Lemarquis said nonessential U.N. staff, foreign and Congolese, are being temporarily evacuated from Goma to either Kinshasa or to a U.N. base in Entebbe in neighboring Uganda. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, known by its acronym MONUSCO, has also reinforced its positions to counter the rebels’ advance on Goma, deploying a quick reaction force, a rapid deployment battalion, a reserve battalion, a platoon of special forces and an artillery battery. 'At this critical juncture now, the onus really is and has to be about bringing about an immediate cessation of hostilities,' U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told reporters on the same video call, speaking from Damascus, Syria, where he is on a mission. 'The fate of the millions of civilians living in Goma or having been displaced is really the priority, along with the safety and security of U.N. personnel,' he said. In the past few days, three U.N. peacekeepers have been killed and several injured in the conflict. Before the latest round of violence, eastern DRC was already mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country’s valuable mineral deposits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fight-for-control-of-major-congolese-city-ongoing-says-un-official/7952272.html	2025-01-27T13:36:09-08:00	
Israel has high expectations for Trump’s second term	Israel’s leaders have high expectations for President Donald Trump’s second term, and analysts say Israeli officials hope his unconventional approach to foreign policy will get them the results they want on their top security priorities. But as Linda Gradstein reports from Jerusalem, Trump’s push for a peace deal with Saudi Arabia could cause tensions with the Jewish state.

Rwanda, Congo presidents to meet as rebels take Goma, Kenya's leader says	GOMA, CONGO — Kenyan President William Ruto said Monday that the presidents of Rwanda and Congo have agreed to attend a meeting Wednesday to discuss developments in eastern Congo, where M23 rebels say they have seized control of Goma on the Congo-Rwandan border. 'We are all in agreement that now more than ever it is an existential issue, not just for the people of eastern DRC, but for this region,' Ruto said during a press briefing, referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo, also called Congo. 'The situation in eastern DRC now demands our collective focus.' The apparent takeover of Goma, a city of about 2 million, has prompted fears of further violence and mass displacement. A journalist in Goma told VOA by telephone that fighting was now going on around the city’s airport, and that it appeared to be escalating. While he was speaking, gunfire could be heard in the background, and he cut off the call to seek shelter. For years, Congo has repeatedly accused Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels — an accusation Kigali denies. The Congo government said Monday that Rwandan government troops are in Goma. There was no immediate response from officials in Kigali. The Congolese government 'continues to work to avoid carnage and loss of human life,' said government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya in a Monday post on X. Muyaya said that the government is urging Goma residents to stay indoors and refrain from looting. M23 spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka told VOA that the rebel group took control of the city over the weekend after intense clashes with Congo government forces. The violence around the city has sparked widespread panic among its residents and displaced people, many of whom had already fled violence in surrounding areas. Mugunga, one of the largest camps for displaced people near Goma, is experiencing a flurry of new arrivals. 'We fled Sake last year because of fighting, and now we are running again,' said one woman who declined to be named for security reasons. 'We have no food, no shelter, and no idea where we’ll end up. This is no life.' As the rebels fight to take full control of Goma, the situation remains fluid in nearby Sake, a key town west of the city in North Kivu province. Reports indicate that fierce fighting continues between M23 and the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, known by its French acronym FARDC. On Friday, General Sylvain Ekenge, a Congo military spokesperson, announced the death of North Kivu Governor Major General Peter Cirimwami. The spokesperson said on state media that the governor was 'wounded and evacuated to Kinshasa, where all efforts were made to take him abroad for appropriate care. Unfortunately, he succumbed to his wounds.' Humanitarian needs deepen The conflict has exacerbated the region’s already dire humanitarian situation. The United Nations reports that over 5.5 million people are displaced in Congo, many of them in North Kivu. People like Lomoo Biondo Manuel, an internally displaced person, want the violence to stop. We are facing 'a lot of hardships,' Manuel told VOA’s Swahili Service. 'We want to go back to our original homes. We want peace.' In Mugunga camp, residents have been forced to seek shelter in schools, abandoned buildings, and even open fields. One displaced woman pleaded for immediate intervention, saying, 'We call on the government to end this war so we can return to our homes.' The M23’s resurgence has drawn renewed scrutiny of regional actors. A recent United Nations report said that Rwanda has played a direct role in M23’s operations, a charge that Rwandan officials have dismissed as baseless. This story originated in VOA’s Africa Division.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-congo-presidents-to-meet-as-rebels-take-goma-kenya-leader-says-/7952210.html	2025-01-27T13:11:15-08:00	
EU renews sanctions against Russia, eases them on Syria	PARIS — European Union foreign ministers agreed Monday to continue sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine, but to ease some sanctions against Syria following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad. Weeks of stalling by Hungary ended Monday, allowing the EU to renew sanctions against Russia for another six months. But in return, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban — considered close to Moscow — is pushing for Ukraine to reopen a gas pipeline to central Europe after letting a transit deal expire. The bloc also earmarked aid for Moldova’s energy needs, which Europe says are threatened by Russia. The 27-member bloc moved in the opposite direction when it came to Syria — agreeing to scale up humanitarian aid and ease some sanctions, now that the country is under new leadership. 'This could give a boost to the Syrian economy and help the country get back on its feet,' said Kaja Kallas, EU’s foreign policy chief. Syria’s foreign minister, Asaad al-Shibani, has called the EU’s move a 'positive step.' European foreign ministers also discussed a raft of other thorny issues, from the Gaza ceasefire to Iran and the conflict in eastern Congo. Another key topic: relations with the new Trump administration. 'As the United States shifts to [a] more transactional approach, Europe needs to close ranks. We are stronger when we are united — that was a view that everybody shared,' Kallas said. She described Washington as Europe’s closest ally, but tensions have surfaced over trade, military spending and Greenland, after President Donald Trump indicated he wanted to acquire the territory. 'We are not negotiating on Greenland,' Kallas said. 'Of course, we are supporting our member state, Denmark, and its autonomous region, Greenland.' Kallas also noted the many ways the EU and U.S. are interlinked. But she said Europe needs to take into account its own strengths, in discussions with partners as well as with adversaries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-renews-sanctions-against-russia-eases-them-on-syria/7952186.html	2025-01-27T12:39:38-08:00	
UN special envoy in Zambia to assess freedom of expression	LUSAKA, ZAMBIA — A United Nations special rapporteur is on a 10-day visit to Zambia to assess accusations that the government is stifling dissent. According to the U.N., Irene Khan will also focus on Zambia’s legal and policy framework and the safety of journalists, activists and human rights defenders in the country. Upon her arrival in Lusaka on Friday, the special rapporteur on freedom of expression and opinion told journalists that her visit to Zambia will give her the chance to hear from all sides and make recommendations. 'I can also discuss … recent developments or legislative developments, other issues of how to strengthen your government’s commitment to human rights, especially freedom of opinion and expression,' Khan said. In May of last year, police in Zambia arrested two opposition lawmakers, two opposition party leaders and an activist on espionage charges. This followed their accusation that the government played a role in the alleged abduction of an independent lawmaker, Emmanuel Jay Jay Banda. The government has denied that accusation. Meanwhile, Zambian journalist Thomas Zgambo has been arrested three times in 13 months after writing articles critical of the government. He is facing sedition charges. And last August, the government warned it would tighten cybersecurity laws to curb online hate speech, propaganda and defamation. The ruling party later withdrew the bill after it was denounced by human rights groups. Zambia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mulambo Haimbe, told VOA that his government has nothing to hide and invited the special rapporteur to Zambia. Haimbe defended his government’s record on human rights, saying it has upheld rights guaranteed in the Zambian constitution. 'We have Article 11, which protects the freedoms of individuals, protection of fundamental rights of individuals. And in particular, with regard to freedom of expression, Article 20 is very clear that all citizens and all persons in Zambia will enjoy an inalienable right to the freedom of expression and opinion,' he said. Chishala Kateka, leader of the opposition New Heritage Party, told VOA that Khan’s visit is very timely. 'We are experiencing arbitrary arrests and transfer of individuals to distant provinces without due process,' she said. 'There’s also a systematic denial of our right to assemble and express ourselves freely. We have selective application of the law where opposition members are unfairly targeted while those from the ruling party are above the law.' Juliet Chibuta, a human rights activist, told VOA the visit of the U.N. special rapporteur is an opportunity to hear from both sides and offer solutions. 'The special rapporteur will offer an independent scrutiny and provide unbiased analysis of the situation on the ground, as she is not affiliated to any institution in Zambia. Her visit will also raise awareness on issues regarding censorship, harassment of journalists, restrictions on online expression and other threats of freedom of speech,' Chibuta said. In August, U.N. experts expressed concern about the allegations of arbitrary arrests of political opponents in Zambia. The experts said the arrests and restrictions in Zambia have had a chilling effect on freedom of opinion, expression, association and assembly, which are critical for a functioning democracy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-special-envoy-in-zambia-to-assess-freedom-of-expression/7952115.html	2025-01-27T12:16:15-08:00	
Zimbabwe's war veterans demand President Mnangagwa's resignation	Harare, Zimbabwe — A group of Zimbabwe’s liberation war veterans has called on President Emmerson Mnangagwa to step down. The veterans, affiliated with the ruling Zanu-PF Party, accuse the president of nepotism, corruption and failing to address the moribund economy. Zanu-PF Party leaders say they are not taking the calls seriously. At a press conference streamed online, Blessed Runesu Geza, a veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1960s and ’70s liberation war and a member of Zanu-PF's central committee, called for the president to step down immediately. He accused Mnangagwa of failing to live up to the promises he made in 2017 when he came to power with the army's help. Geza said many of those who died fighting for the country’s liberation do not have decent graves and that the country is being turned into 'a banana republic.' He also spoke of looting and the struggles of people in the country. 'We are saying — as war veterans — enough is enough. You have shown that you have failed. It can’t get any worse,' he said in Shona at the press conference. 'Corruption has become a security threat because these people are being protected by Emmerson. So, as war veterans, including masses, we are being asked, ‘Why did you give us this kind of a person? We no longer like him.’ So, we are pleading with you: Leave peacefully. If you don’t, people will use the constitution for you to go.' In an interview with VOA, Zanu-PF spokesman Farai Marapira dismissed the calls for Mnangagwa to step down. 'The party position is clear; the party position is given to clear channels. So, we cannot dignify rogue rantings by responding to them,' Marapira said. 'People who speak their mind outside of the party, that's part of democracy. But the position is clear: We had a conference, and that is what we will deal with, and that is what we work with, and anything else is just ranting.' At a recent Zanu-PF conference, party leaders passed a resolution that Mnangagwa should seek a third term in 2028, assuming the party can force through amendments to the constitution. In an interview with VOA, Eldred Masunungure, a political professor at the University of Zimbabwe, said the war veterans are feeling genuine frustration, as things have not worked out the way they expected after Mnangagwa toppled Robert Mugabe in November 2017. 'The political clouds are extremely difficult to read under the circumstances, but what is clear [is] they expressed in unambiguous terms their exasperation with the way things have been going on in the last couple of years in the second republic,' Masunungure said. 'That is certain. But the outcome of what they are doing, what they are advocating for, that is — in my view — deeply uncertain.' The second republic refers to Mnangagwa’s presidency after Mugabe’s 37 years in power. Brighton Chipamhadze, a Harare-based independent political commentator, said Geza’s announcement shows the divisions within the ruling party. 'As Comrade Geza points out, there are certain individuals benefiting from Mnangagwa’s rule, calling for [an] extension of Mnangagwa’s term,' Chipamhadze said. 'Yet there is also a section of the ruling party which is against Mnangagwa extending his term of office.' Zimbabwe’s constitution, adopted in 2013, allows parliament to impeach and remove the president if lawmakers feel he is incapacitated. Mnangagwa is one of Africa’s oldest heads of state. In 2028, he will be 86 years old.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-s-war-veterans-demand-president-mnangagwa-resignation/7952114.html	2025-01-27T12:05:58-08:00	
Trump's sanctions could force Russia's Putin to negotiating table, some experts say	WASHINGTON — On Jan. 22, Donald Trump — just two days after being inaugurated for his second term as U.S. president — again called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the 'ridiculous' war with Ukraine, but this time he added a threat. 'If we don't make a 'deal,' and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries,' Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. The following day, Trump told reporters that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had told him he’s ready to negotiate an end to the war. In an interview with Fox News aired that same day, Trump said Zelenskyy is 'no angel' and 'shouldn't have allowed this war to happen.' Does the new U.S. administration have sufficient economic leverage over Russia to force it to make peace, or at least talk about peace? According to Konstantin Sonin, John Dewey distinguished service professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and former vice rector of Moscow’s Higher School of Economics, the U.S. has economic leverage, but some of its levers are clearly weaker than others. 'Russia's trade with the U.S. is very small — less than $3 billion a year,' he told Danila Galperovich of VOA’s Russian Service. 'Accordingly, even if any opportunity for U.S. companies to trade with Russia is completely closed, the damage to Russia will be small. There is an opportunity to strengthen secondary sanctions — that is, additional pressure, first of all, on China, on India, on other countries, so that they more strictly comply with the primary sanctions. 'There is also an opportunity to continue what [former U.S. President Joe] Biden did with sanctions against the Russian shadow tanker fleet,' Sonin added, referring to vessels that Russia uses to sell oil and evade Western sanctions. 'This requires great international cooperation, but, in principle, it can be done,' said Sonin. Economist Vladislav Inozemtsev, a special adviser to the Russian Media Studies Project at MEMRI, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and director of the Moscow-based Center for Post-Industrial Studies, also stressed the significance of secondary sanctions on countries that do business with Russia. 'Trump can somehow influence other countries so that they do not buy Russian products,' Inozemtsev told VOA. 'For example, let's say he can say that if India buys Russian oil, then the United States will impose 15% duties on all goods from India. This would have the most radical consequences. [I]f… countries trading with Russia are getting serious problems in the United States for all their products, then I think that this will be a very sobering moment. If it is possible to impose a virtually complete trade blockade through U.S. sanctions, then these will be devastating sanctions, of course.' Sonin said that, over the longer term, deregulating oil production internationally would reduce world oil prices and thereby hinder Moscow’s ability to finance its military operations against Ukraine. 'Trump is famous for his good relations with Saudi Arabia, although they are unlikely to be so good that they will reduce oil prices at his request,' he said. 'But nevertheless, it is possible to work towards lowering oil prices, which even without sanctions will reduce Russian income.' Trump spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a Jan. 22 telephone call. Still, Sonin said that economic levers, in and of themselves, cannot force Putin to do anything. 'I would say that the most direct impact is still the supply of more powerful weapons to Ukraine. I do not know to what extent Trump wants to do this, but he mentioned it, and, in principle, it is possible to supply Ukraine with more powerful weapons in larger quantities.' Inozemtsev, however, said that Putin, who has not previously changed his behavior in response to ultimatums, could do so this time. 'Trump is a person whose degree of radicalism and unpredictability corresponds to Putin's,' he said. 'Here, perhaps, it would be better for Putin to change his mind a bit. If Trump offers him: 'Vladimir, let's go, we'll meet there, sit down at the negotiating table, bring your team, I'll bring mine, and we'll agree on something, we'll discuss it for a day or two, but the issue needs to be resolved,' I think Putin will go.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-sanctions-could-force-russia-putin-to-negotiating-table-some-experts-say/7952066.html	2025-01-27T11:49:56-08:00	
Egypt, Jordan reject Trump proposal to resettle Palestinian refugees	CAIRO — Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority have rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal over the weekend to resettle residents of the Gaza Strip in Egypt or Jordan. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the Egyptian government supports 'the Palestinian people's insistence to remain on their land, defending their legitimate rights and respecting international law.' Egyptian public opinion remains firmly opposed to the resettlement of Palestinians on Egyptian territory. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi recently told a crowd of military officers that it would be easy to resettle some Palestinians in the Sinai, but the difficulty would be getting anyone in Egypt to accept the idea. Khattar Abou Diab, who teaches political science at the University of Paris, told VOA that despite the difficult economic situation in Egypt and the fact that there could be a significant economic windfall in accepting Trump's proposal to resettle some Palestinians in the country, a large segment of the Egyptian public would refuse to do so. Paul Sullivan, a former professor at the American University of Cairo and fellow at the Atlantic Council, agreed, telling VOA that such a proposal is unacceptable to Egyptians. 'No Egyptian leader who wants to stay in power would agree to such a request,' he said. 'It would destabilize Egypt and likely lead to greater regional instability.' Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi also rejected Trump's proposal, saying that 'Palestine is for the Palestinians and Jordan is for the Jordanians and that the solution to the Palestinian problem is located on Palestinian soil and embodied by a Palestinian state.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/egypt-jordan-reject-trump-proposal-to-resettle-palestinian-refugees-/7951964.html	2025-01-27T10:28:15-08:00	
Flood victims rescued by boat as Storm Herminia hits northern France	RENNES, FRANCE — Residents in western France used boats to escape their flooded homes Monday as rivers and waterways broke their banks after successive storms battered Normandy and Brittany. The national weather service had issued flood and wind warnings as Storm Herminia hit Spain, France on parts of the U.K. Normandy and Brittany were already waterlogged after the passage of last week's Storm Éowyn — which left two people dead from fallen trees and more than 1 million people without electricity in Ireland and Britain. Storm Herminia caused road closures in some areas of France. About 400 people were evacuated from homes in and around the city of Rennes, at the heart of the hardest-hit region. The mayor called it the city's worst flooding in more than 40 years and said in a statement that the waters weren't expected to start receding until Wednesday. A 73-year-old British sailor was reported missing off the Atlantic coast near Bordeaux over the weekend, according to the regional maritime authority. France's weather service issued further flood and wind warnings for Tuesday for all regions on the western coast, from Brittany down to the Spanish border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flood-victims-rescued-by-boat-as-storm-herminia-hits-northern-france-/7951953.html	2025-01-27T10:26:34-08:00	
Taliban caution US against bounty threats over alleged American detainees	ISLAMABAD — A diplomat from Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban cautioned the United States on Monday against threatening retaliatory measures in response to detentions of U.S. nationals in the country. 'Our policy is to reach a solution through peaceful means,' Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban ambassador to Qatar, told VOA in written remarks. He spoke two days after the new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened that Washington may place a 'very big bounty' on Taliban leaders, suggesting they might hold more American hostages in the country than previously known. Last week, the de facto Afghan authorities released two Americans, Ryan Corbett and William McKenty, in exchange for a Taliban member serving a life sentence in a U.S. federal prison on drug and terrorism charges. The swap was negotiated by former President Joe Biden’s administration. 'In the face of pressure and aggression, the jihad [holy war] of the Afghan nation in recent decades is a lesson that everyone should learn from,' Shaheen stated. The Taliban have not revealed how many foreigners are still in their custody in Afghanistan. However, relatives and U.S. officials report the detention of at least two additional Americans. They are George Glezmann, a former airline mechanic, and Mahmood Habibi, a naturalized American. 'Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has been reported,' Rubio wrote on social media platform X on Saturday. 'If this is true, we will have to immediately place a VERY BIG bounty on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on bin Laden.' The chief U.S. diplomat did not elaborate or specify the number of Americans being detained in Afghanistan. Washington offered a bounty of $25 million for information leading to the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden for planning the deadly Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States. Congress subsequently authorized the secretary of state to increase the bounty to a maximum of $50 million. U.S. forces searched for bin Laden in Afghanistan for years before finding his hideout and killing him in neighboring Pakistan in 2011. Meanwhile, a former Canadian soldier detained by the Taliban was freed Sunday after more than two months of imprisonment in a deal brokered by Qatar. 'I just spoke with David Lavery upon his safe arrival in Qatar from Afghanistan. He is in good spirits,' Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly announced on X. Joly credited the tiny Gulf nation’s prime minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani with helping in Lavery’s release. 'Thank you to my Qatari counterpart, @MBA_AlThani_, for helping facilitate the release of our Canadian citizen,' she wrote. The Taliban waged a lethal insurgency in Afghanistan that persisted for nearly two decades, ultimately regaining power in 2021, mere days before a hasty and chaotic withdrawal of all U.S.-led Western troops from the country along with thousands of Afghan allies. Taliban leaders have since imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, banning girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade, prohibiting most women from workplaces, and blocking women’s access to public life at large. The United Nations has designated the restrictions as 'gender apartheid,' and the international community has refuted the Taliban’s request for legitimacy to their government due to their severe treatment of the female Afghan population. The restrictions stem from numerous decrees issued by the reclusive Taliban supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, from his base in the southern city of Kandahar, with his aides defending the government as in line with Sharia. Last week, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague announced that he had applied for arrest warrants for Akhundzada and Afghanistan’s chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, accusing them of persecuting women and girls. The Taliban rejected the allegations as baseless and condemned the arrest warrants for their leaders as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-caution-us-against-bounty-threats-over-alleged-american-detainees/7951874.html	2025-01-27T09:21:34-08:00	
New US defense secretary promises agility, accountability	Pentagon — New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promised more changes are coming to the country’s military before even walking through the doors of the Pentagon. Hegseth, a decorated veteran and a former Fox News host, was greeted just outside the Pentagon by General Charles Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, after arriving for his first full day of work. Hegseth said serving as defense secretary was the honor of a lifetime, telling reporters that the Defense Department will operate at a faster tempo. 'The lawful orders of the president of the United States will be executed inside this Defense Department swiftly and without excuse,' Hegseth said. 'We're going to hold people accountable.' Hegseth won Senate confirmation late Friday by a 51-50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking ballot. He was sworn in on Saturday and spoke Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in what the Pentagon described as an 'introductory call.' 'We will be no better friend to our allies and no stronger adversary to those who want to test us and try us,' Hegseth told reporters Monday before entering the Pentagon. He said that President Donald Trump is expected to sign additional executive orders on Monday impacting the military, including orders calling for a U.S. version of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, the removal of all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives from the Pentagon, and the reinstatement of troops forced to leave the military after refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccination. Hegseth also said the Pentagon will make sure Trump has all the resources needed to secure the U.S. southern border. 'Whatever is needed at the border will be provided,' the defense secretary said. 'This is a shift. It's not the way business has been done in the past.' 'The Defense Department will support the defense of the territorial integrity of the United States of America, the southern border, to include reservists, National Guard and active duty in compliance with the Constitution and the laws of our land and the directives of the commander in chief,' he added. Asked about the fate of Afghans who worked alongside the United States before the U.S. withdrawal in August 2021, Hegseth said, 'We’re going to make sure there's accountability for what happened in Afghanistan and that we stand by our allies.' Hegseth also deflected questions about whether he plans to fire the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. 'I'm standing with him right now,' Hegseth said. 'I look forward to working with him.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-us-defense-secretary-promises-agility-accountability/7951867.html	2025-01-27T09:15:05-08:00	
Relief group pulls workers out of DRC's Goma as M23 rebels advance	Nairobi, Kenya — Amid fighting between M23 rebels and government forces in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, some organizations are relocating staff because they no longer feel safe. This comes after the reportedly Rwandan-backed rebels said over the weekend they had taken control of Goma, the biggest city in the region. Rose Tchwenko, the DRC’s country director for Mercy Corps, told VOA that since last week, the humanitarian group has closely monitored the situation as government forces and M23 clashed in and around Goma, a city of around 2 million people. 'From Wednesday last week, with the fall of Minova, followed by the fall of Sake, which are key supply routes into Goma, the situation looked a little bit more dire with the imminent takeover or incursion into Goma itself by the rebel forces,' she said. 'We made some decisions, first to move out non-essential staff, pull back our teams from the ground where it was no longer safe to continue to provide humanitarian services.' But that changed quickly, as the situation grew more unstable in Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, which is on the border with Rwanda. 'On Sunday with the escalation of the conflict around Goma, we had to pull out even the senior team into Gisenyi (across the border in Rwanda) so that we can continue to operate and provide the necessary support to our teams across the country,' she said. She told VOA the situation was dire. 'As of yesterday, we know that the airport in Goma is closed and under M23 control,' she said. 'We have heard reports of sporadic fighting throughout the center of Goma city. Some of us on this side of the border could actually [hear] gunshots at some point during the night. We are aware of M23 presence in Goma but still uncertain of what the actual situation is.' As M23 rebels last week made advances into Goma, three U.N. peacekeepers died and seven South African soldiers and three from Malawi, serving in a separate Southern African Development Community mission, also were killed, according to U.N. and South African officials. At an emergency meeting on Sunday, the United Nations Security Council called for an end to the hostilities. Bintou Keita, the head of the U.N. mission in Congo, addressed the Council via video link, painting a bleak picture. 'Roads are blocked and the airport can no longer be used for evacuation or humanitarian efforts,' he said. 'M23 has declared the airspace over Goma closed. In other words, we are trapped.' Jack Mongi, a Goma resident who sent VOA an audio message in French via WhatsApp, said that fighting was still going on around the airport. 'As I speak, you can hear gunshots, we are under our mattresses, under our beds and if you listen, you can hear the gunshots....' The Congolese minister of foreign affairs told the U.N. Security Council that this is 'a frontal assault, a declaration of war.' VOA reached out to the Rwandan government for comment but has not immediately heard back. Many countries represented at the special Security Council meeting condemned the attacks, including the acting U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Dorothy Shea, who called for a ceasefire. 'The United States will consider all the tools at its disposal in order to hold accountable those responsible for sustaining armed conflict, instability and insecurity,' she said. In Nairobi, Kenya's President William Ruto said he spoke to both Congolese and Rwanda presidents and called for an 'immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities.' Ruto, who’s also the chair of the East African Community, says he’ll be convening an extraordinary EAC summit in coming days to try to chart a way forward in this crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/relief-group-pulls-workers-out-of-drc-s-goma-as-m23-rebels-advance/7951757.html	2025-01-27T07:56:25-08:00

Civilians at increased risk as M23 rebels capture DRC's Goma, rights advocates warn	Nairobi, Kenya — Human Rights Watch is expressing concern about civilians in the eastern Congolese city of Goma now that M23 rebels have taken control of the city. Fighting between M23 and Democratic Republic of the Congo forces has displaced 400,000 since the start of this year, according to the United Nations. Goma’s capture by the rebel group further threatens civilian lives and could cause more displacement, the rights group said. Residents of Goma in eastern DR Congo shared videos Monday of M23 rebels patrolling the city, with some cheering as the fighters walked through the streets. Blaise Karege is a Congolese political and security researcher in eastern Congo. He said the rebel group has been received well, and the reasons for the ongoing conflict have changed. 'The residents are singing in the streets, and they are behind the rebel group,' he said. 'I don't know if all of that is for the love, or fear, of M23. I cannot tell. Previous conflicts were much about politics, but today, the conflict has a more tribal dimension, too, and today, it appears M23 has a lot of support.' The M23 rebel group launched an offensive to seize Goma several weeks ago, taking areas closest to the border with Rwanda, which is widely believed to support M23 — something the Kigali government denies. The Congolese army and its allied militias, Wazalendo, have fled the city, according to local reports. The U.N. mission in Goma said it has received some men in Congolese uniforms and some in plain clothes who handed over their weapons. Human Rights Watch said it's now concerned about the safety of Goma civilians, many of whom fled to the city to escape violence and abuse from eastern Congo’s many armed groups, including M23. Clementine de Montjoye, a senior Human Rights Watch researcher, said concerns of rights groups and NGOs for civilians are at an all-time high. 'We have documented extensively how they have executed people,' she said. 'There have been cases of rapes, gang rapes, arbitrary detention, and extortion, and last night, we heard reports of looting inside Goma by the Wazalendo armed group. At the same time, M23 also has a long history of committing abuses against civilian populations, and since the resurgence of M23 ... we have documented how they have executed people they accuse of supporting the Congolese army or Congolese government.' M23 says it is fighting to protect communities who have faced abuse and attacks from the Congolese army and other militia groups. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has called on M23 to end hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories in eastern Congo. Karege said the group won't be vacating the city that easily. 'Today, they say they are not going to leave the city because they are protecting their parents and children,' he said. 'But this is going to give them a certificate to speak and engage with the government in Kinshasa so that they can resolve this issue without conflict. Leaving Goma, Masisi, and Ruchuru won't happen,' he said, referring to other population centers in the region. M23 first captured Goma in 2012 but agreed to leave after signing a peace agreement with the Congolese government. The fighters launched a new offensive in 2021, accusing the Congolese government of failing to honor the peace agreement from eight years before. The government in Kinshasa insists the group must disarm before any negotiations can take place.	https://www.voanews.com/a/civilians-at-increased-risk-as-m23-rebels-capture-drc-goma-rights-advocates-warn/7951639.html	2025-01-27T06:12:57-08:00	
DeepSeek's 'Sputnik moment' prompts investors to sell big AI players	LONDON/SINGAPORE — Investors hammered technology stocks on Monday, sending the likes of Nvidia and Oracle plummeting, as the emergence of a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model cast doubts on Western companies' dominance in this sector. Startup DeepSeek last week launched a free assistant it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent players' models, possibly marking a turning point in the level of investment needed for AI. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 slid almost 4%, suggesting the index could see its biggest daily slide since September 2022 later on Monday, if those losses are sustained. Those on the S&P 500 dropped 2%. Shares in AI chipmaker Nvidia fell more than 11%, rival Oracle dropped 8.5% and AI data analytics company Palantir lost 6.5% in pre-market trading. DeepSeek, which by Monday had overtaken U.S. rival ChatGPT in terms of downloads on the Apple Store, offers the prospect of a viable, cheaper AI alternative which has raised questions about the sustainability of the level of spending and investment on AI by Western companies, including Apple and Microsoft. From Tokyo to Amsterdam, shares in AI players tumbled. 'We still don’t know the details and nothing has been 100% confirmed in regards to the claims, but if there truly has been a breakthrough in the cost to train models from $100 million+ to this alleged $6 million number this is actually very positive for productivity and AI end users as cost is obviously much lower meaning lower cost of access,' Jon Withaar, a senior portfolio manager at Pictet Asset Management, said. The hype around AI has powered a huge inflow of capital into the equity markets in the last 18 months in particular, as investors have bought into the technology, inflating company valuations and sending stock markets to record highs. Little is known about the small Hangzhou startup behind DeepSeek. Its researchers wrote in a paper last month that the DeepSeek-V3 model, launched on Jan. 10, used Nvidia's H800 chips for training, spending less than $6 million - the figure referenced by Pictet's Withaar. H800 chips are not top-of-the-line. Initially developed as a reduced-capability product to get around restrictions on sales to China, they were subsequently banned by U.S. sanctions. 'Sputnik moment' Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist, said in a post on X on Sunday that DeepSeek's R1 model was AI's 'Sputnik moment,' referencing the former Soviet Union's launch of a satellite that marked the start of the space race in the late 1950s. 'Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world,' he said in a separate post. In Europe, ASML which counts Taiwan's TSMC, Intel and Samsung as its customers, dropped almost 7.5%, while Siemens Energy lost nearly 18%. In Japan, startup investor SoftBank Group slid more than 8%. Last week it announced a $19 billion commitment to fund Stargate, a data-center joint venture with OpenAI. Given the volatility, investors sought out safe-havens such as U.S. Treasuries, which pushed 10-year yields down nearly 10 basis points to 4.52%, while low-yielding currencies like the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc soared against the dollar. Big Tech has ramped up spending on developing AI capabilities and optimism over the possible returns has driven stock valuations sky-high. Nvidia alone has risen by over 200% in about 18 months and trades at 56 times the value of its earnings, compared with a 53% rise in the Nasdaq .IXIC, which trades at a multiple of 16 to the value of its constituents' earnings, according to LSEG data. Nick Ferres, chief investment officer at Vantage Point Asset Management in Singapore said the market was questioning the capex spend of the major tech companies. Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management said: 'The idea that the most cutting-edge technologies in America, like Nvidia and ChatGPT, are the most superior globally, there's concern that this perspective might start to change.' 'I think it might be a bit premature,' Ichikawa said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deepseek-s-sputnik-moment-prompts-investors-to-sell-big-ai-players-/7951643.html	2025-01-27T06:11:47-08:00

Chinese and Indian diplomats call for warmer relations but make no public mention of border dispute	BEIJING — The top diplomats of China and India called for their nations to provide further mutual support but avoided publicly mentioning a long-standing border dispute in the Himalayas when they met Monday in Beijing. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told top Indian foreign affairs official Vikram Misri that the sides 'should seize the opportunity, meet each other halfway, explore more substantive measures, and strive to understand, support and achieve each other, rather than be suspicious of, alienate and consume each other,' China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited Misri as saying the nuclear-armed Asian giants have 'properly managed and resolved differences and promoted the restart of practical cooperation in various fields.' Ties have been stable since the leaders of the two countries met last year on the sidelines of a multinational summit in Russia. Days before that meeting, India announced the two sides had agreed to a pact on military patrols along their disputed border in the Himalayas after a spike in tensions that began with a deadly clash in 2020. That turned into a long-running standoff in the rugged mountainous area, where each side has stationed tens of thousands of military personnel backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets. Chinese President Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi have since limited their joint public comments to pleasantries without openly discussing the border. India said the 2024 agreement would lead to the 'disengagement' of troops at the Line of Actual Control, the long shared border in the Himalayas, although it's unclear whether that meant the withdrawal of the tens of thousands of additional troops stationed along their disputed border in the Ladakh region. The Line of Actual Control separates Chinese and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India's eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety. India and China fought a deadly war over the border in 1962. Both India and China have withdrawn troops from face-off sites on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso, Gogra and Galwan Valley, but they maintain extra troops at Demchok and Depsang Plains. The army standoff damaged business ties between the two nations with halted investments from Chinese firms and major projects banned. India also banned Chinese-owned apps, including TikTok, which is operated by Chinese internet firm Bytedance. It cited privacy concerns that it said threatened India's sovereignty and security. Chinese products are ubiquitous in India, from toys to smartphones to made-in-China Hindu idols. According to Indian government data, two-way trade has grown by the tens of billions in the past two decades, with the balance strongly favoring China, while China has drawn many Indian specialists and students, particularly in the medical field.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-and-indian-diplomats-call-for-warmer-relations-but-make-no-public-mention-of-border-dispute-/7951523.html	2025-01-27T04:27:31-08:00	
Sweden intercepts Bulgarian ship over damaged Baltic cable	Sofia, Bulgaria — The Swedish coast guard chased and intercepted a Bulgarian ship after a fiber-optic cable under the Baltic Sea linking Sweden to Latvia was damaged, its owner said on Monday. Latvia sent a warship on Sunday to investigate the damage, while Swedish prosecutors opened an 'aggravated sabotage' investigation. Nations around the Baltic Sea have scrambled to bolster defenses after the suspected sabotage of undersea cables in recent months, with some observers blaming Russia. The Bulgarian vessel on Sunday 'was chased by the Swedish coast guard with instructions for the ship to go into their territorial waters and it is now on anchor where an investigation ... is ongoing,' Alexander Kalchev, CEO of Navigation Maritime Bulgare (Navibulgar), owner of the Vezhen, told AFP. He denied involvement in any sabotage. 'I am convinced that we cannot say ... that this was a malicious act,' he added. The Malta-flagged vessel carrying fertilizer from Ust-Luga in Russia and headed for South America was sailing in 'extremely bad weather' on Saturday based on the information given to him by the crew, Kalchev said. An inspection on Sunday found that 'one of the ship's anchors was damaged and the anchor had dropped into the sea, which means that it was possible that it had dragged along the sea floor,' he said, adding the anchor was then pulled up. 'Full solidarity' Navibulgar, Bulgaria's biggest shipping company, said it had appointed an agent in Sweden and hired a lawyer 'to defend the interests of the crew and the company.' The ship, constructed in 2022, has a crew of eight Bulgarians and nine Myanmar nationals. 'Staff from the Swedish authorities have been on board the ship since yesterday evening to carry out investigative measures,' an intelligence official told AFP. The damage to the cable occurred in Swedish territorial waters at a depth of at least 50 meters, officials said. The cable belongs to Latvia's state radio and television center (LVRTC) which said in a statement that there had been 'disruptions in data transmission services.' The company said alternatives had been found and end users would mostly not be affected although 'there may be delays in data transmission speeds.' Latvia's navy on Sunday said it had identified a 'suspect vessel,' the Michalis San, near the location of the incident along with two other ships. Prime Minister Evika Silina said Riga had notified the Swedish authorities and that the two countries were working together on the incident. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed he had been in contact with Silina during the day, and Sweden, Latvia and NATO are closely cooperating on the matter. Experts and politicians have accused Russia of orchestrating a hybrid war against the West as the two sides square off over Ukraine. NATO this month announced it was launching a new monitoring mission in the Baltic Sea involving ships and aircraft to deter attempts to target undersea infrastructure. European Union President Ursula von der Leyen expressed 'full solidarity' with countries affected by the incident. 'The resilience and security of our critical infrastructure is a top priority,' von der Leyen wrote on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-intercepts-bulgarian-ship-over-damaged-baltic-cable/7951464.html	2025-01-27T04:15:38-08:00	
Ukraine says Russian drone attacks hit infrastructure in several regions	Russian drone attacks damaged infrastructure sites in western, central and eastern Ukraine on Monday. Ukraine’s air force said it shot down 57 of the 108 total drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said. Officials in Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk and Sumy said drone attacks hit 'critical infrastructure.' Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak also said on Telegram that Russian shelling Monday injured at least five people in the city of Nikopol. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 32 Ukrainian drones, including intercepts over Voronezh, Belgorod, Kursk, Oryol and Tver. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that a Ukrainian drone attack damaged a house, but did not hurt anyone. A Kremlin spokesperson said Monday that Russia had not received any signals about a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump. The comment came days after Putin said he and Trump should discuss the war in Ukraine as well as energy prices.

Palestinians return to Gaza City amid Israel-Hamas ceasefire	Palestinians began arriving back in Gaza City early Monday, as Israeli forces opened checkpoints and allowed people back into northern areas that had been closed off since the early days of Israel’s war against Hamas. Thousands of people, mostly on foot, were on the roads to Gaza City, which has seen largescale destruction during Israeli ground operations and airstrikes that the military said were aimed at destroying the militant group. Gaza City is one of many areas that came under Israeli evacuation orders, leaving people scrambling to find a safe place amid the war. Many of the evacuees were displaced multiple times and turned to tent camps for shelter. The Palestinians’ return to Gaza City comes amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that has also included the release of some hostages held in Gaza, freeing Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza. A last-minute dispute about the late release of an Israeli hostage delayed access, but Qatar announced early Monday an agreement under which Hamas will free Arbel Yehoud and two other hostages before Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed the agreement, saying an additional three hostages also will be released Saturday and that Hamas had provided a list with the status of all the hostages who are due to be released during this first phase of the ceasefire. There was violence Sunday in central Gaza as Israeli forces fired at Palestinians along a coastal road near a checkpoint, killing at least one person and injuring 18 others, according to a spokesperson for al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat. The Israeli military said in a statement that it 'identified several gatherings of dozens of suspects that posed a threat.' The war in Gaza started with the shock Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 47,300 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 100 hostages, with the ceasefire requiring them to release 33 during a six-week truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians jailed by Israel. Seven Israeli hostages and nearly 300 Palestinian prisoners have been freed thus far. Violence Sunday also put pressure on a separate ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said at least 22 were killed and 124 others injured as Israel confirmed it would not meet a 60-day deadline to withdraw its troops as part of the ceasefire it reached with Hezbollah in November. On Sunday, the White House released a statement that the arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, would continue to be in effect until Feb. 18. 'The Government of Lebanon, the Government of Israel, and the Government of the United States will also begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after October 7, 2023,' the statement said. Israel blamed the militants and the Lebanese army for failing to meet their own commitments under the truce. The Israeli military said that it fired 'warning shots' toward 'suspects' and that it had detained an unspecified number of people. Under terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah was required to retreat to the north away from the Israeli border and Israel was to pull out of Lebanon. In a statement, the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, warned that it was 'imperative to avoid further deterioration of the situation.' It urged the Israeli military to avoid firing at civilians, and for Lebanese people to adhere to the directives of the Lebanese military. 'Further violence risks undermining the fragile security situation,' the statement said. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinians-return-to-gaza-city-amid-israel-hamas-ceasefire/7951409.html	2025-01-27T00:32:01-08:00	
Belarus strongman wins a 7th term in an election the opposition calls a farce	The smiling face of President Alexander Lukashenko gazed out from campaign posters across Belarus on Sunday as the country held an orchestrated election virtually guaranteed to give the 70-year-old autocrat yet another term on top of his three decades in power. 'Needed!' the posters proclaim beneath a photo of Lukashenko, his hands clasped together. The phrase is what groups of voters responded in campaign videos after supposedly being asked if they wanted him to serve again. And according to a nighttime statement by the Central Election Commission, the strongman leader won by a landslide, garnering nearly 87% percent of the vote. But his opponents, many of whom are imprisoned or exiled abroad by his unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech, would disagree. They call the election a sham — much like the last one in 2020 that triggered months of protests that were unprecedented in the history of the country of 9 million people. The crackdown saw more than 65,000 arrests, with thousands beaten, bringing condemnation and sanctions from the West. His iron-fisted rule since 1994 — Lukashenko took office two years after the demise of the Soviet Union — earned him the nickname of 'Europe’s Last Dictator,' relying on subsidies and political support from close ally Russia. He let Moscow use his territory to invade Ukraine in 2022, and even hosts some of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons, but he still campaigned with the slogan 'Peace and security,' arguing he has saved Belarus from being drawn into war. 'It’s better to have a dictatorship like in Belarus than a democracy like Ukraine,' Lukashenko said in his characteristic bluntness. Fearing a repeat of election unrest His reliance on support from Russian President Vladimir Putin — himself in office for a quarter-century — helped him survive the 2020 protests. Observers believe Lukashenko feared a repeat of those mass demonstrations amid economic troubles and the fighting in Ukraine, and so scheduled the vote in January, when few would want to fill the streets again, rather than in August. He faces only token opposition. According to official results, announced in the early hours of Monday, Lukashenko won 86.82% of the vote - compared to his nearest rival's 3.21%. According to the Central Election Commission, 3.60% of voters spoiled their ballots. In 2020, the electoral body claimed Lukashenko had taken 80.10% of the vote. 'The trauma of the 2020 protests was so deep that Lukashenko this time decided not to take risks and opted for the most reliable option, when balloting looks more like a special operation to retain power than an election,' Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich said. Lukashenko repeatedly declared that he wasn’t clinging to power and would 'quietly and calmly hand it over to the new generation.' His 20-year-old son, Nikolai, traveled the country, giving interviews, signing autographs and playing piano at campaign events. His father hasn’t mentioned his own health, even though he was seen having difficulty walking and occasionally spoke in a hoarse voice. 'The successor issue only becomes relevant when a leader prepares to step down. But Lukashenko isn’t going to leave,' Karbalevich said. Top political opponents imprisoned or exiled Leading opponents have fled abroad or were thrown in prison. The country holds nearly 1,300 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Center. Since July, Lukashenko has pardoned more than 250 people. At the same time, authorities have sought to uproot dissent by arresting hundreds more in raids targeting relatives and friends of political prisoners. Authorities detained 188 people last month alone, Viasna said. Activists and those who donated money to opposition groups have been summoned by police and forced to sign papers saying they were warned against participating in unsanctioned demonstrations, rights advocates said. Lukashenko's four challengers on the ballot are all loyal to him. 'I’m entering the race not against, but together with Lukashenko, and I’m ready to serve as his vanguard,' said Communist Party candidate Sergei Syrankov, who came in second place. He favors criminalizing LGBTQ+ activities and rebuilding monuments to Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Candidate Alexander Khizhnyak, head of the Republican Party of Labor and Justice, led a voting precinct in Minsk in 2020 and vowed to prevent a 'repeat of disturbances.' Oleg Gaidukevich, head of the Liberal Democratic Party, supported Lukashenko in 2020 and urged fellow candidates to 'make Lukashenko’s enemies nauseous.' The fourth challenger, Hanna Kanapatskaya, managed 1.7% of the vote in 2020 and says she's the 'only democratic alternative to Lukashenko,' promising to lobby for freeing political prisoners but warning supporters against 'excessive initiative.' Opposition leader calls election ‘a senseless farce’ Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus under government pressure after challenging the president in 2020, told The Associated Press that Sunday's election was 'a senseless farce, a Lukashenko ritual.' Voters should cross off everyone on the ballot, she said, and world leaders shouldn't recognize the result from a country 'where all independent media and opposition parties have been destroyed and prisons are filled by political prisoners.' 'The repressions have become even more brutal as this vote without choice has approached, but Lukashenko acts as though hundreds of thousands of people are still standing outside his palace,' she said. The European Union rejected the election in Belarus on Sunday as illegitimate and threatened new sanctions. 'Today’s sham election in Belarus has been neither free, nor fair,' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and EU enlargement commissioner Marta Kos said in a joint statement. Shortly after voting in Minsk on Sunday, accompanied by his white Pomeranian dog, Lukashenko told journalists that he did not seek recognition or approval from the EU. 'The main thing for me is that Belarusians recognize these elections and that they end peacefully, as they began,' he said. Speaking at an hours-long news conference, Lukashenko said that he didn't rule out running for the top job again in 2030. Media freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint against Lukashenko with the International Criminal Court over his crackdown on free speech that saw 397 journalists arrested since 2020. It said that 43 are in prison. Fears of vote-rigging According to the Central Election Commission, there are 6.8 million eligible voters. However, about 500,000 people have left Belarus and aren't able to vote. After polls closed at 8 p.m. local time (1700 GMT), the commission said that turnout stood at a record 85.70%, but a dearth of independent monitoring made that figure near-impossible to verify. At home, early voting that began Tuesday has created fertile ground for irregularities with ballot boxes unguarded until election day, the opposition said. A record 41.81% of voters cast ballots in five days of early voting. Meanwhile, Viasna activists reported internet issues across the country, and alleged Lukashenko's government was blocking access to VPN services commonly used to evade censorship. Polling stations have removed the curtains covering ballot boxes, and voters are forbidden from photographing their ballots — a response to the opposition's call in 2020 for voters to take pictures to make it more difficult for authorities to rig the vote. Police conducted large-scale drills before the election. An Interior Ministry video showed helmeted riot police beating their shields with truncheons as a way to prepare for protest dispersals. Another featured an officer arresting a man posing as a voter, twisting his arm next to a ballot box.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-strongman-wins-a-7th-term-in-an-election-the-opposition-calls-a-farce-/7951359.html	2025-01-26T23:47:44-08:00	
China captures scam center suspect with Thailand's help	BEIJING — Police have detained a man suspected of involvement in the case of a Chinese actor who was duped into travelling to Thailand for a film job and then trafficked to Myanmar, China's Public Security Ministry said. The joint efforts of the ministry's task force and the Chinese Embassy in Thailand, helped by Thai law enforcement, led to the arrest of a 'major criminal suspect' on Saturday, the ministry said in a notice late on Sunday. The ministry added that the suspect was surnamed Yan and returned to China on Saturday, but did not elaborate. Wang Xing, a 22-year-old Chinese actor, traveled to Thailand early this month after receiving an unsolicited offer to join a film that was shooting in Thailand. When Wang got to Bangkok, he was kidnapped, authorities said, and taken to an online scam compound, one of hundreds of thousands of people the United Nations says have been trapped into working for criminal networks running fraudulent telecommunications operations across the region. Wang's case drew national interest after his girlfriend began a social media campaign about his plight, and he was later freed by Thai police who found him in Myanmar. The ministry said the police would step up their efforts to crack down on the scam centers, deepen international law enforcement cooperation, and coordinate with countries involved to detain the criminals and rescue Chinese citizens. The scam compounds that have proliferated in Southeast Asia since the COVID-19 pandemic defraud people across the globe and generate billions of dollars every year for organized crime groups, many of Chinese origin. Last week, officials from China, Myanmar and Thailand reached a consensus on eradicating the centers in Myanmar. China and Thailand also agreed to set up a coordination center in Bangkok to investigate and combat the scam complexes that have mushroomed along Thai borders with Myanmar and Cambodia. The initiative is expected to start operations next month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-captures-scam-center-suspect-with-thailand-s-help/7951349.html	2025-01-26T23:15:09-08:00	
China bans livestock product imports from numerous countries on disease worries	BEIJING — China has prohibited imports of sheep, goat, poultry and even-toed ungulates from African, Asian and European countries due to outbreaks of livestock diseases such as sheep pox, goat pox and foot-and-mouth-disease. The ban, which also includes processed and unprocessed products, comes after the World Health Organization released information of disease outbreaks in various countries, according to a series of announcements by China's General Administration of Customs dated Jan. 21. The ban from the world's largest meat importer affects Ghana, Somalia, Qatar, Congo (DRC), Nigeria, and Tanzania, Egypt, Bulgaria, East Timor and Eritrea. China also said it has stopped imports of sheep, goat and related products from Palestine, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bangladesh due to sheep pox and goat pox outbreaks. It also blocked the imports of even-toed ungulates and related products from Germany following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-bans-livestock-product-imports-from-numerous-countries-on-disease-worries/7951334.html	2025-01-26T22:20:27-08:00	
Chiefs, Eagles reach Super Bowl	The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles are set to face off in the National Football League’s Super Bowl, with the Chiefs looking to become the first team to win three consecutive championships and the Eagles trying to avenge their loss from two years ago. The Chiefs reached the Feb. 9 championship game in New Orleans with a 32-29 win on Sunday night over the Buffalo Bills. Kansas City’s star quarterback Patrick Mahomes ran for two touchdowns and threw for another score to reach his fifth Super Bowl in six years. That included the 2023 Super Bowl in which the Chiefs defeated the Eagles 38-35. The Eagles earned their Super Bowl spot with a resounding 55-23 win Sunday over the Washington Commanders. Philadelphia outscored Washington 21-0 in the game’s final quarter to secure the victory. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts ran for three touchdowns and added another through the air, while running back Saquon Barkley added three rushing touchdowns. Oddsmakers made Kansas City the narrow early favorite for the game.

New Zealand loosens visitor visa rules to welcome digital nomads	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand will introduce looser visa rules to allow holiday makers to work remotely while visiting the country, to boost its tourism sector and economy, it said on Monday. Erica Stanford, Immigration Minister said in a statement that the visitor visa would change from Jan. 27 to allow people to work while traveling in the country. 'This is a brand-new market of tourist New Zealand can tap into. We want people to see our country as the ideal place to visit and work while they do it,' she said. She added in a press conference following the announcement that she was unsure how many people would take up the opportunity, but digital nomad visas had been 'extraordinarily popular' overseas and that New Zealand was targeting people who would like the opportunity to work and travel here. 'I expect in their time here that they will spend longer than they normally would, they will spend more because they’re here for longer, and the thing that we’re really hoping, is that they fall in love with the place,' she said. New Zealand’s economy sank into a technical recession in the third quarter of 2024 and the government is looking for ways to boost growth. The tourism sector has not fully bounced back from the closure of borders during the COVID-19 pandemic with international visitors at around 86% of 2019 levels. 'The government's ambition is that new visa rules will put New Zealand boldly on the map as a welcoming haven for the world's talent,' said Nicola Willis, Minister of Economic Growth. 'We hope that in some cases, it will encourage those people and the firms they represent to consider doing more business with New Zealand in the future,' Willis added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-loosens-visitor-visa-rules-to-welcome-digital-nomads/7951306.html	2025-01-26T20:03:51-08:00	
Rwanda-backed rebels in DRC say they have taken control of Goma	GOMA, Democratic Republic of the Congo — Rwanda-backed rebels claimed they captured eastern Congo's largest city, Goma, early Monday, as the United Nations described a 'mass panic' among its 2 million people and Congo's government said the rebel advance was a 'declaration of war.' The M23 rebels announced the city's capture in a statement minutes before a 48-hour deadline imposed by the group for the Congolese army to surrender their weapons expired. In a statement, the rebels urged residents of Goma to remain calm and for members of the Congolese military to assemble at the central stadium. The M23 rebels' offensive in the heart of the mineral-rich region threatens to dramatically worsen one of Africa's longest wars and further displace civilians. According to a United Nations report, over a third of the population of North Kivu province where Goma is located are currently displaced and the capture of Goma will likely exacerbate the situation. Late Sunday night, UN peacekeepers began to process members of the military who had begun to surrender on the outskirts of the city. Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya made a statement in a video posted on X calling for the protection of civilians and saying that the country is 'in a war situation where the news is changing.' Late Sunday, the U.N.'s special representative for Congo told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that with the airport shut down and roads blocked in the vast region's humanitarian and security hub, 'we are trapped.' Congo late Saturday broke off relations with Rwanda, which has denied backing the M23 despite evidence collected by U.N. experts and others. The surge of violence has killed at least 13 peacekeepers over the past week. And Congolese were again on the run. The M23 has made significant territorial gains along Congo's border with Rwanda in recent weeks, after months of regional attempts to make peace failed. On Sunday night, the rebels called on Congo's army to surrender their arms and present themselves at a local stadium by 3 a.m. or they would take the city. The Uruguayan army, who are in Goma serving with the U.N. peacekeeping mission, said in a statement on X late Sunday that some Congolese soldiers have laid down their weapons. 'More than a hundred FARDC soldiers are sheltered in the facilities of the 'Siempre Presente' base awaiting the (Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration) process,' the statement said. In photos shared with the statement, armed men are seen registering with the peacekeepers in a mix of military uniforms and civilian clothing. The U.N. special representative, Bintou Keita, told the Security Council that despite U.N. peacekeepers' support for the Congolese armed forces, M23 and Rwandan forces entered the Munigi neighborhood on Goma's outskirts, 'causing mass panic.' Munigi is 9 kilometers (5 miles) from the city. Keita said M23 fighters were advancing and using residents 'as human shields' as others fled for their lives. 'M23 has declared the airspace over Goma closed,' she added. 'In other words, we are trapped.' She said the U.N. was temporarily relocating nonessential personnel from the city. Congo's foreign minister, Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, told the Security Council that Rwanda was committing 'a frontal aggression, a declaration of war which no longer hides itself behind diplomatic maneuvers.' Rwanda's ambassador to the U.N., Ernest Rwamucyo, did not confirm or deny Congo's claims. He blamed Congo's government, saying the crisis could have been been averted if it had 'demonstrated a genuine commitment to peace.' The United States and France called for a ceasefire and appealed to Rwanda to withdraw its support to M23, with acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea warning that the U.S. would 'consider all the tools at its disposal' to hold accountable those responsible for sustaining the armed conflict. In the past 48 hours, two U.N. peacekeepers from South Africa and one from Uruguay were killed and 11 others were injured and hospitalized, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman said ahead of the Security Council meeting. The U.N. chief reiterated his 'strongest condemnation' of the M23 offensive 'with the support of the Rwanda Defense Forces,' and called on the rebel group to immediately halt all hostile action and withdraw, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Congo cuts ties with Rwanda Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army more than a decade ago. It's one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region, where a long-running conflict has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. Rwanda's government denies backing the rebels, but last year acknowledged that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate up to 4,000 Rwandan forces are in Congo. Congo's foreign ministry said late Saturday it was severing diplomatic ties with Rwanda and pulling all diplomatic staff from the country 'with immediate effect.' Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told The Associated Press on Sunday that the decision to cut ties was a unilateral move by Congo. 'For us, we took appropriate measures to evacuate our remaining diplomat in Kinshasa, who was under permanent threat by Congolese officials,' Nduhungirehe said. The M23 took Goma once before in 2012, withdrawing after considerable international pressure was put on Rwanda. Civilians flee the rebel advance On Sunday morning, heavy gunfire resonated across Goma, a few kilometers (miles) from the front line. Scores of children and adults fled the Kanyaruchinya camp, one of the largest in eastern Congo for displaced people, near the Rwandan border. 'We are fleeing because we saw soldiers on the border with Rwanda throwing bombs and shooting,' said Safi Shangwe, who was heading into the city. Some of the displaced worried they would not be safe in Goma, either. 'I heard that there are bombs in Goma, too, so now we don't know where to go,' said Adèle Shimiye. Hundreds of people attempted to flee to Rwanda. Migration officers at a border crossing east of Goma carefully checked travel documents. 'I am crossing to the other side to see if we will have a place of refuge because for the moment, security in the city is not guaranteed,' Goma resident Muahadi Amani told the AP. U.N. deputy humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya said the situation was rapidly deteriorating. 'If hostilities spill into Goma – a densely populated urban center – the impact on civilians could be devastating,' she said. Congo's army has said it was fending off the M23 offensive with the help of allied forces, including U.N. peacekeepers and soldiers from the Southern African Development Community Mission, also known as SAMIDRC. In addition to the two South African peacekeepers, seven South African troops with SAMIDIRC have been killed in recent days, South Africa's defense ministry said. Since 2021, Congo's government and allied forces — including the 14,000-strong U.N. mission — have been keeping M23 away from Goma. Goma resident Bahati Jackson's family has been hearing gunfire and remembers fleeing M23's seizure of the city in 2012. But this time, they're staying. 'If we're going to die, it's better to die here,' Jackson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-backed-rebels-in-drc-say-they-have-taken-control-of-goma/7951304.html	2025-01-26T19:56:49-08:00	
South Korea reports initial findings of Jeju Air crash to ICAO, U.S. and Thailand	Seoul, South Korea — South Korea's authorities investigating last month's Jeju Air plane crash have submitted a preliminary accident report to the U.N. aviation agency and to the authorities of the United States, France and Thailand, an official said on Monday. The investigation into the deadliest air disaster on the country's soil remains ongoing, the report made available on Monday said, focused on the role of 'bird strike' and involving an analysis of the engines and the 'localiser' landing guidance structure. 'These all-out investigation activities aim to determine the accurate cause of the accident,' it said. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the U.N. agency, requires accident investigators to produce a preliminary report within 30 days of the accident and encourages a final report to be made public within 12 months. The Boeing BA.N 737-800 jet, from Bangkok and scheduled to arrive at Muan International Airport, overshot the runway as it made an emergency belly landing and crashed into the localiser structure, killing all but two of the 181 people and crew members on board on Dec. 29. The localiser aids navigation of an aircraft making an approach to the runway, and the structure built of reinforced concrete and earth at Muan airport supporting the system's antennae was likely a cause of the disaster, experts have said. The report highlighted much of the initial findings by the South Korean investigators that was shared with the families of the victims on Saturday, including the pilots discussing a flock of birds they spotted on its final approach. The exact time of a bird strike reported by the pilots remains unconfirmed, the accident report said, but the aircraft 'made an emergency declaration (Mayday x 3) for a bird strike during a go-around.' 'Both engines were examined, and feathers and bird blood stains were found on each,' it said. 'After the crash into the embankment, fire and a partial explosion occurred. Both engines were buried in the embankment's soil mound, and the fore fuselage scattered up to 30-200 meters from the embankment,' it said. The report does not say what may have led to the two data recorders to stop recording simultaneously just before the pilots declared mayday. The aircraft was at an altitude of 152 meters flying at 298 kmh at the moment the blackboxes stopped recording, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-reports-initial-findings-of-jeju-air-crash-to-icao-u-s-and-thailand/7951299.html	2025-01-26T19:44:21-08:00	
Sweden opens sabotage probe into Baltic undersea cable damage	STOCKHOLM/VILNIUS — An undersea fiber optic cable between Latvia and Sweden was damaged on Sunday, likely as a result of external influence, Latvia said, prompting NATO to deploy patrol ships to the area and triggering a sabotage investigation by Swedish authorities. Sweden's Security Service has seized control of a vessel as part of the probe, the country's prosecution authority said. 'We are now carrying out a number of concrete investigative measures, but I cannot go into what they consist of due to the ongoing preliminary investigation,' senior prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said in a statement. NATO was coordinating military ships and aircraft under its recently deployed mission, dubbed 'Baltic Sentry.' The effort follows a string of incidents in which power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines have been damaged in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina said her government was coordinating with NATO and other countries in the Baltic Sea region to clarify the circumstances surrounding the latest incident. 'We have determined that there is most likely external damage and that it is significant,' Silina told reporters following an extraordinary government meeting. Latvia's navy said earlier on Sunday it had dispatched a patrol boat to inspect a ship and that two other vessels were also subject to investigation. Up to several thousand commercial vessels make their way through the Baltic Sea at any given time, and a number of them passed the broken cable on Sunday, data from the MarineTraffic ship tracking service showed. One such ship, the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Vezhen, escorted to Swedish waters by a Swedish coastguard vessel on Sunday evening, MarineTraffic data showed. It later anchored outside the Swedish naval base in Karlskrona in southern Sweden. It was not immediately clear if the Vezhen, which passed the fiber optic cable at 0045 GMT on Sunday, was subject to investigation. A Swedish coastguard spokesperson declined to comment on the Vezhen or the position of coastguard ships. Bulgarian shipping company Navigation Maritime Bulgare, which listed the Vezhen among its fleet, did not immediately reply to requests for comment outside of office hours. NATO cooperation Swedish navy spokesperson Jimmie Adamsson earlier told Reuters it was too soon to say what caused the damage to the cable or whether it was intentional or a technical fault. 'NATO ships and aircrafts are working together with national resources from the Baltic Sea countries to investigate and, if necessary, take action,' the alliance said in a statement on Sunday. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his country was cooperating closely with NATO and Latvia. NATO said last week it would deploy frigates, patrol aircraft and naval drones in the Baltic Sea to help protect critical infrastructure and reserved the right to take action against ships suspected of posing a security threat. Finnish police last month seized a tanker carrying Russian oil and said they suspected the vessel had damaged the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and four telecoms cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed. Finland's prime minister in a statement said the latest cable damage highlighted the need to increase protection for critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. The cable that broke on Sunday linked the Latvian town of Ventspils with Sweden's Gotland island and was damaged in Sweden's exclusive economic zone, the Latvian navy said. Communications providers were able to switch to alternative transmission routes, the cable's operator, Latvian State Radio and Television Centre (LVRTC), said in a statement, adding it was seeking to contract a vessel to begin repairs. 'The exact nature of the damage can only be determined once cable repair work begins,' LVRTC said. A spokesperson for the operator said the cable was laid at depths of more than 50 meters (164 feet). Unlike seabed gas pipelines and power cables, which can take many months to repair after damage, fiber optic cables that have suffered damage in the Baltic Sea have generally been restored within weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-opens-sabotage-probe-into-baltic-undersea-cable-damage/7951298.html	2025-01-26T19:42:06-08:00	
Russia says its troops have captured a strategic town in eastern Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine — Russia on Sunday claimed its troops had captured a strategically important town in eastern Ukraine as part of a grinding campaign to weaken Kyiv's grip on the country's industrial heartland, while uncertainty over the continued flow of U.S. funding has reportedly halted the work of some Ukrainian NGOs, including those helping war veterans. Russia's Defense Ministry announced the fall of Velyka Novosilka, which had around 5,000 residents before the war, following a monthslong battle. Its statement could not be independently verified, and Ukraine claimed its troops had only strategically withdrawn from certain areas. But if confirmed, it would make Velyka Novosilka the first significant town to capitulate in 2025 under Moscow's onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region against Ukraine's weary and short-handed army. The war is set to reach its three-year milestone in February. Ukrainian forces withdrew from certain parts of Velyka Novosilka to avoid encirclement, the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade said in a statement on its official Telegram channel Sunday. The brigade is active in that patch of the frontline. Analysts have long predicted that it's only a matter of time until Russian forces capture the settlement, which lies only 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region. The brigade said though they have approximate parity with Russian forces in terms of artillery and drones, the Russians have a huge advantage in manpower. 'Our units, using the weather conditions, skillfully withdrew from areas where there was a threat of encirclement. This does not mean that we have completely left the city, the fighting in Velyka Novosilka continues . All actions are aimed at minimizing our own losses and maximum damage to the enemy,' the statement said. The brigade said the withdrawal will make it topographically difficult for Russians to advance by making the river an obstacle. 'The enemy (…) will have no peace, any movement is cut off by shells and drones,' the statement said. Russia captured the Donetsk cities of Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year after long and grueling battles. Those cities were largely leveled by Russian artillery, glide bombs and drones before they fell. Russian forces have also been trying for months to capture the key Donetsk strongholds of Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar. Elsewhere, Ukrainian NGOs catering to the needs of war veterans and their families have claimed a suspension of U.S. funding is forcing them to halt their work, days after newly sworn in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would pause foreign aid grants for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later claimed that military aid to Ukraine would continue, but did not clarify whether humanitarian aid had been paused. Kyiv relies on the U.S. for 40% of its military needs. According to news reports, Ukrainian NGOs receiving funding from Washington this weekend began receiving 'stop work' orders, requiring them to pause all projects and related travel. Veteran Hub, an NGO that provides legal and psychological support to war veterans and their families, was forced to halt operations of two of its three largest service units as a result, the organization said in its official Facebook page. It said the suspension has led it to ask for public donations for the first time. 'Since 2018, we have refrained from public fundraising because we believe that donations are primarily needed for the military. Today, we are forced to publicly ask for support for the first time,' the organization said. With the Trump administration questioning the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine, stressing the need to quickly broker a peace deal, both Moscow and Kyiv are seeking battlefield successes to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of any prospective talks. For the past year, Russian forces have been waging an intense campaign to punch holes in Ukraine's defenses in the eastern Donetsk region. The sustained and costly offensive has compelled Kyiv to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-its-troops-have-captured-a-strategic-town-in-eastern-ukraine/7951296.html	2025-01-26T19:36:03-08:00	
Percival Everett's 'James' awarded Carnegie Medal for fiction	NEW YORK — For author Percival Everett, libraries have long been a source of knowledge and discovery and pleasure, even of the forbidden kind. 'I remember making friends at age 13 with the librarian at the University of South Carolina, and she used to let me go through the stacks when I wasn't supposed to,' Everett, who spent part of his childhood in Columbia, said during a telephone interview Sunday. 'One of the wonderful things about libraries is that when you're looking for one book, it's surrounded by other books that may not be connected to it. That's what you get (online) with links, but (in libraries) no one's decided what the links are.' Everett's latest honor comes from the country's public libraries. On Sunday, the American Library Association announced that Everett's 'James' was this year's winner of the Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction, which includes a $5,000 cash award. Kevin Fedarko's 'A Walk in the Park: The True Story of a Spectacular Misadventure in the Grand Canyon' was chosen for nonfiction. Everett's acclaimed reworking of Mark Twain's 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' from the perspective of Jim, Huck Finn's enslaved companion, has already received the National Book Award and the Kirkus Prize and is a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle award. 'James' has even topped The New York Times fiction hardcover list, a rare feat in recent years for a literary work that wasn't a major book club pick or movie tie-in. 'Percival Everett has written a modern masterpiece, a beautiful and important work that offers a fresh perspective from the eyes of a classic character,' Allison Escoto, chair of the award's selection committee, said in a statement. 'Kevin Fedarko's unforgettable journey through the otherworldly depths of the Grand Canyon shows us the triumphs and pitfalls of exploration and illuminates the many vital lessons we can all learn from our precious natural world.' Fedarko is a former Time magazine correspondent whose work also has appeared in The New York Times and Esquire. A Pittsburgh native fascinated by distant places, Fedarko has a long history with libraries — Carnegie libraries. He remembers visiting two while growing up, notably one in the suburb of Oakmont near the hairdressing salon his parents ran. He would read biographies of historical figures from George Washington to Daniel Boone, and otherwise think of libraries as 'important threads running through his life,' windows to a 'wider world.' Now a resident of Flagstaff, Arizona, Fedarko says that he relied in part on the library at the nearby Northern Arizona University campus for both 'A Walk in the Park' and its predecessor, also about the Grand Canyon, 'The Emerald Mile.' 'The library has an important and unique collection about the Grand Canyon, and it's the backbone of the kind of history that helps form the framework of both books,' he says. 'Neither of them could have been done without the library.' Previous winners of the medals, established in 2012 with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, includes Donna Tartt's 'The Goldfinch,' Colson Whitehead's 'The Underground Railroad' and Doris Kearns Goodwin's 'The Bully Pulpit.' This year's finalists besides 'James' in the fiction category were Jiaming Tang's 'Cinema Love' and Kavin Akbar's 'Martyr!' Adam Higginbotham's 'Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space' and Emily Nussbaum's 'Cue the Sun! The Invention of Reality TV' were the nonfiction runners-up. All three fiction nominees were published by Penguin Random House and all three nonfiction finalists by Simon & Schuster.	https://www.voanews.com/a/percival-everett-s-james-awarded-carnegie-medal-for-fiction/7951293.html	2025-01-26T19:13:55-08:00	
Sierra Leone investigating reports Dutch drug kingpin took refuge in country	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — Sierra Leone's information ministry said Sunday it was investigating media reports that European cocaine kingpin Jos Leijdekkers is in the country and benefiting from high-level protection there. Two sources told Reuters on Friday that Leijdekkers, who was sentenced last June in absentia to 24 years in prison by a Dutch court for smuggling more than 7 tons of cocaine, had been in Sierra Leone since at least early 2023. A spokesperson for the Dutch prosecutors' office said in response to questions from Reuters about Leijdekkers' whereabouts that he has been living in Sierra Leone for at least six months. Leijdekkers is on Europol's list of most wanted fugitives. In a statement, the Sierra Leonean ministry said the country's police were ready to collaborate with the Dutch government, Interpol and other international law enforcement agencies about the case. The statement said the country's president 'attended numerous family events during the festive season' and 'has no knowledge about the identity and the issues detailed in the reports about the individual in question.' Reuters was not able to reach Leijdekkers. Videos and photos verified by Reuters of a church Mass in Sierra Leone on Jan. 1, 2025, show Leijdekkers, 33, sitting two rows behind Sierra Leone's President Julius Maada Bio. In the images, Leijdekkers was sitting next to a woman who three sources said was Bio's daughter Agnes and who they said was married to Leijdekkers. Reuters could not confirm the relationship. Bio's daughter and the Dutch lawyer who last represented Leijdekkers in the Netherlands did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Three sources told Reuters Leijdekkers was benefiting from high-level protection in Sierra Leone, which international law enforcement officials say is a transshipment point for large volumes of Latin American cocaine headed to Europe.

Canadian ex-soldier detained by Afghan Taliban freed	Doha, Qatar — A Canadian ex-soldier detained by the Taliban government in Afghanistan was freed Sunday after over two months of imprisonment in a deal brokered by Qatar, a source with knowledge of the release told AFP. David Lavery was detained by Taliban authorities in Kabul in November 2024 and had made headlines three years earlier helping in the evacuation of Afghans during the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces from the country. 'Lavery has been released from Afghanistan and is now in Doha, Qatar,' the source said on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations, adding his freedom 'was secured following a request from the Canadian government to Qatar.' 'Qatari mediators coordinated with senior Canadian officials and utilized their contacts in Afghanistan to dispatch a medical team to Kabul to assess Lavery's condition and provide care, while also facilitating contact between Lavery and his family,' the source said. 'Following a breakthrough in the talks, Mr. Lavery (is) in Doha now united with his family. He underwent a medical assessment upon his arrival,' the source added. In 2021, Lavery helped an estimated 100 Afghans flee Kabul during the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces. He spent decades in the Canadian military and is said to have been a key member of its elite Joint Task Force 2 special operations unit. More recently, Lavery has reportedly operated a private security firm in Kabul. The former soldier's release follows the liberation last week by the Taliban government of two U.S. citizens from prison in return for an Afghan fighter held in the United States, in another deal brokered by Qatar. Ryan Corbett, who had been detained in 2022, and William McKenty were released in exchange for Khan Mohammed, who was convicted of narco-terrorism by a U.S. court. The Afghan foreign ministry said Mohammed was 'an Afghan fighter' who had been 'imprisoned in America.' Two other U.S. citizens are believed to remain in detention in Afghanistan, former airline mechanic George Glezmann and naturalized American Mahmood Habibi. Gas-rich Qatar hosted Taliban representatives during years of peace talks with the United States leading up to the 2021 withdrawal and in recent years has hosted rounds of Afghan dialogue which the Taliban authorities joined in June 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canadian-ex-soldier-detained-by-afghan-taliban-freed/7951254.html	2025-01-26T17:00:18-08:00	
Italy resumes migrant transfers to processing centers in Albania	Rome — Italy said Sunday it was transferring 49 migrants picked up in the Mediterranean to new processing centers in Albania, in the third such attempt facing hurdles by courts. The navy vessel Cassiopea with the migrants on board was expected to reach the Albanian port of Shengjin on Tuesday morning, port officials said. The Interior Ministry said Sunday that 53 other migrants 'spontaneously presented their passports' after they were told that it would avoid their transfer to Albania. Where the nationality is confirmed, processing generally takes less time as people who are determined by Italy to be ineligible to apply for asylum in the European Union are repatriated via a fast-track procedure. Italian judges refused to validate the detention of the first two small groups in the Albanian centers, built under a contentious agreement between Rome and Tirana. Their cases have been referred to the European Court of Justice, which had earlier established that asylum applicants could not undergo a fast-track procedure that could lead to repatriation if their country of provenance was not deemed completely safe. The European court hearing on the case is scheduled for Feb. 25. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni’s government had vowed to reactivate the two centers in Albania that have remained dormant following the Italian courts’ decisions. The premier’s position was partially backed by a ruling in late December by Italy’s highest court, which said Italian judges could not substitute for government policy in deciding which countries are safe for repatriation of migrants whose asylum requests are rejected. The decision does allow lower courts to make such determinations on a case-by-case basis, short of setting overall policy. Italy has earmarked $675 million (650 million euros) to run the centers over five years. They opened in October ready to accept up to 3,000 male migrants a month picked up by the Italian coast guard in international waters. Human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws. Meloni has repeatedly stressed that plans to process migrants outside EU borders in Albania had received strong backing from other European leaders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-resumes-migrant-transfers-to-processing-centers-in-albania/7951226.html	2025-01-26T16:00:22-08:00	
Germany holds commemoration for 2 people killed in knife attack	Berlin — Government officials and residents attended a solemn Mass Sunday to honor a child and a man killed in a knife attack in Germany, an assault that amplified the debate about migration ahead of the Feb. 23 general election. The ecumenical religious service at the Catholic Basilica of St. Peter and Alexander in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, was briefly suspended for the tolling of the city’s bells at the exact time that the attack took place Wednesday, 11:45 a.m. Bavaria Governor Markus Soder, Aschaffenburg Mayor Jurgen Herzing and Muslim imam Zischan Mehmood addressed the congregation that included rescuers, to express grief and disbelief at the loss of lives. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser was also present. 'Compassion, solidarity and cohesion are more important than ever, because there are many dividers and agitators around us,' Mehmood told the people gathered in and outside the church. 'We must never allow grief and pain to tear us apart.' Soder said the attack was a 'senseless, brutal and disturbing crime.' 'Good and evil are not a question of origin, nationality, ethnicity or faith,' Soder said, and stressed that the killings should not lead to divisions because 'incitement is the wrong answer.' Before attending the service, Faeser and Soder laid wreaths at the site of the attack. The attack is politically sensitive a month before Germany’s national election as migration policy is among the top campaign issues. A 2-year-old boy of Moroccan origin, who was part of a group of kindergarten children, was killed, along with a 41-year-old German man who apparently intervened to protect the children in a city park. The arrested suspect is a 28-year-old former asylum-seeker from Afghanistan who had been told to leave Germany. Officials said he had received psychiatric treatment and there was no immediate indication that he was motivated by extremism. He is being held in a psychiatric hospital, according to the German news agency, dpa. Bavarian officials said two adults and a 2-year-old Syrian girl were also wounded in the attack and hospitalized but there was no danger to their lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-holds-commemoration-for-2-people-killed-in-knife-attack/7950989.html	2025-01-26T15:25:10-08:00	
Lebanon, Gaza ceasefires with Israel teeter on shaky ground	Israeli ceasefires with Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza appeared to be on fragile ground Sunday as Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians in both regions, killing at least 23 people and injuring dozens. In Lebanon, the Health Ministry said at least 22 were killed and 124 others injured as Israel confirmed it would not meet the 60-day deadline to withdraw its troops as part of the ceasefire it reached with Hezbollah in November. On Sunday, the White House released a statement that the arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, would continue to be in effect until February 18. 'The Government of Lebanon, the Government of Israel, and the Government of the United States will also begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after Oct. 7, 2023,' the statement said. Israel blamed the militants and the Lebanese army for failing to meet their own commitments under the truce. The Israeli military said that it fired 'warning shots' toward 'suspects' and that it had detained an unspecified number of people. Under terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah was required to retreat to the north away from the Israeli border and Israel was to pull out of Lebanon. In a statement, the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, warned that it was 'imperative to avoid further deterioration of the situation.' It urged the Israeli military to avoid firing at civilians, and for Lebanese people to adhere to the directives of the Lebanese military. 'Further violence risks undermining the fragile security situation,' the statement said. In Gaza, the long-awaited return of Palestinians from the central and southern regions of the territory to the northern sector was delayed in a dispute over the release of a female hostage held by Hamas. Israel said it would not retreat from the heavily fortified Netzarim Corridor, which divides the enclave, until another female hostage, Arbel Yehoud, an Israeli civilian, is freed. She was supposed to have been released Saturday. Israeli forces fired at Palestinians along a coastal road near the checkpoint, killing at least one person and injuring 18 others, according to a spokesperson for al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat in central Gaza. The Israeli military said in a statement that it 'identified several gatherings of dozens of suspects that posed a threat.' The violence exhibited the tenuous nature of the two ceasefires, both of which were brokered in part by the United States in contentious negotiations during the final months of the administration of President Joe Biden. Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy, participated in the talks to reach the Gaza ceasefire. Trump on Saturday called on Egypt and Jordan to take in more Palestinians from Gaza to 'clean out' the enclave after much of it has been leveled by 15 months of Israeli-Hamas fighting. The war in Gaza started with the shock Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed nearly 47,000 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials, although the Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 100 hostages, with the ceasefire requiring them to release 33 during a six-week truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians jailed by Israel. Seven Israeli hostages and nearly 300 Palestinian prisoners have been freed thus far.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-gaza-ceasefires-with-israel-teeter-on-shaky-ground/7950986.html	2025-01-26T15:07:18-08:00

UN chief calls for Rwandan forces to leave DR Congo	United Nations, United States — U.N. chief Antonio Guterres called Sunday on Rwandan forces to withdraw from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and halt support for fighters advancing on the key Congolese city of Goma. M23 fighters backed by several thousand Rwandan troops have been quickly advancing toward the city, which lies along DRC's eastern border and is home to more than a million people. Several foreign peacekeepers have been killed in the mounting violence around Goma. 'The Secretary-General is deeply concerned by the escalating violence' and 'calls on the Rwanda Defense Forces to cease support to the M23 and withdraw from DRC territory,' said a statement from his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. Guterres had previously referred to a U.N. experts' report citing Kigali's backing of the M23 but had not explicitly called on Rwanda to withdraw from DRC territory. In his statement Sunday, made after three U.N. peacekeepers in eastern DRC had been killed within 48 hours, Guterres emphasized that 'attacks against United Nations personnel may constitute a war crime.' The U.N. in the meantime has begun to evacuate 'non-essential' staff from the major city of Goma in eastern DRC, a United Nations source told AFP. During an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council session Sunday, permanent member states France, Britain and the United States called on Rwanda to pull its forces back. But others, including China and the African nations holding rotating council seats, did not specifically name Kigali. The Security Council as a whole has yet to accuse Rwanda of taking part directly in the conflict, simply underlining the importance of the DRC's territorial integrity. But the French ambassador to the U.N., Nicolas de Riviere, indicated Sunday he was working on a Security Council statement that would 'call a cat a cat,' a phrase essentially meaning to state directly what something is without sugarcoating it. He urged the Council to condemn what he said was a grave threat to regional peace and security. Congolese foreign minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner went further, urging the Council to impose sweeping economic and political sanctions on Kigali. She accused Rwanda of having sent new troops into eastern DRC on Sunday, actions which she said amounted to a 'declaration of war.' But Rwanda's ambassador to the U.N., Ernest Rwamucyo, rejected the accusations, accusing Kinshasa of being responsible for the deteriorating situation and failing to make a 'genuine commitment to peace.' He suggested that the U.N. peacekeepers in the DRC had joined a 'coalition' seeking regime change in Rwanda. The fighting in the region has forced some 230,000 to flee their homes. Eastern DRC has vast mining resources and is a complex landscape of rival armed militias which has seen violence ebb and flow since the 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-calls-for-rwandan-forces-to-leave-dr-congo/7950969.html	2025-01-26T14:01:15-08:00	
Islamist militants kill at least 20 Nigerian troops, security sources say	MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — Suspected Islamist fighters killed at least 20 Nigerian soldiers, including a commanding officer, after attacking an army base in a remote town in northeastern Borno state, security sources and residents said Sunday. Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters have mainly operated in Borno, targeting security forces and civilians, in the process killing and displacing tens of thousands of people. The latest assault happened Friday, when ISWAP members arrived on gun trucks and attacked the army's 149 Battalion in Malam-Fatori town, gateway to the border with Niger, two soldiers and residents said. One of the soldiers who survived the attack told Reuters by phone that troops were taken by surprise as the militants 'rained bullets everywhere.' 'We tried so much to repel the attacks and after more than three hours of gun duel, they overpowered us, killing our commanding officer, a lieutenant colonel,' the soldier said, declining to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. He said 20 soldiers died while several were injured. A Nigerian army spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Residents who left the town said some of the militants were seen in Malam-Fatori as late as Saturday night. Malakaka Bukar, a member of the local militia recruited to help the army, said the militants also burned buildings, forcing some residents to flee the town. 'They preached to some of the residents,' said Bukar. Although weakened by military assaults and internal fighting over the years, Boko Haram and ISWAP have stepped up attacks in Borno since the turn of the year, killing dozens of farmers and fishermen in series of raids.	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamist-militants-kill-at-least-20-nigerian-troops-security-sources-say/7950960.html	2025-01-26T13:48:19-08:00

Trump orders tariffs, visa restrictions on Colombia over rejection of deportation flights	Bogota, Colombia — U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that he was ordering tariffs, visa restrictions and other retaliatory measures to be taken against Colombia after its government rejected two flights carrying migrants. Trump said the measures were necessary, because the decision of Colombian President Gustavo Petro 'jeopardized' national security in the United States. 'These measures are just the beginning,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. 'We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.' Earlier Sunday, Petro said that his government won't accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with 'dignity.' Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet. 'A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,' Petro said. 'That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants.' Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the United States from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024. Last year, Colombia and other countries began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama. The U.S. government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia. Petro, a former leftist guerrilla, added that his country would receive Colombians in 'civilian airplanes' and 'without treatment like criminals.' As part of a flurry of actions to make good on U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration, his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations. Two Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day, Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people. In announcing what he called 'urgent and decisive retaliatory measures,' Trump explained that he ordered '25% tariffs on all goods coming into the United States,' which would be raised to 50% in one week. He said he also ordered 'A Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations' on Colombian government officials, allies and supporters. 'All Party Members, Family Members, and Supporters of the Colombian Government,' Trump wrote will be subject to 'Visa Sanctions.' He didn't say to which party he was referring to or provide any additional details on the visa and travel restrictions. Trump added that all Colombians will face enhanced customs inspections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-tariffs-visa-restrictions-on-colombia-over-rejection-of-deportation-flights/7950941.html	2025-01-26T13:01:22-08:00

India celebrates Republic Day with Indonesian president observing	New Delhi — India celebrated its 76th Republic Day on Sunday with a colorful parade displaying its military might and cultural diversity on a boulevard in the heart of country’s capital. Indonesian president was the guest of honor. Tens of thousands of people lined the road on a cold Sunday morning to watch the long parade to mark the anniversary of the official adoption of India’s Constitution on Jan. 26, 1950, nearly three years after independence from British colonial rule. Soldiers from India’s military and paramilitary, along with their bands, marched as the country’s leaders and other guests watched. Various floats displayed India’s cultural diversity with one showcasing the Maha Kumbh festival, the ongoing massive Hindu festival touted as the world’s largest religious gathering. The parade took place on Rajpath Avenue, built by India’s former British rulers and lined by huge lawns, canals and rows of trees. The avenue was redeveloped as part of the celebrations of the 75th anniversary of Indian independence and renamed Kartavayapath, or the Boulevard of Duty, in 2022. Visiting Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto attended the event as the chief guest and was flanked by India’s president and prime minister. A 342-member band and marching contingent from the Indonesian National Armed Forces joined the parade, the first time the ASEAN country's troops have joined any foreign parade. India traditionally invites foreign leaders to witness the spectacle. French President Emmanuel Macron was the guest of honor last year and former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2015. Ten Southeast Asian leaders watched the parade in 2018. Sukarno, Indonesia’s first president and the leader of the country’s independence struggle, was the chief guest at India’s first Republic Day celebration in 1950. Thousands of men and women in colorful costumes played marches, performed traditional dances and pulled motorbike stunts during the 90-minute parade. It also showcased India’s domestically built defense equipment and military systems, including tanks, infantry combat vehicles, radar systems and missile systems. Some 5,000 artists, carrying traditional props like spears, swords and drums, performed over 40 dance forms from different parts of India in a cultural performance that lasted about 10 minutes. The parade ended with a fly-past by air force fighters, including Rafale jets, transport planes and helicopters. The parade was broadcast live by television networks. Republic Day parades also took place in state capitals and other cities across India amid massive security arrangements. In Srinagar, the main city of disputed Kashmir, armed police and soldiers patrolled as regional officials celebrated Republic Day. Hundreds of people braved winter chills to witness the parade amid additional security, with police and soldiers checking vehicles and frisking pedestrians. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-celebrates-republic-day-with-indonesian-president-observing/7950904.html	2025-01-26T11:36:18-08:00	
Mel Gibson’s ‘Flight Risk’ is No. 1 at box office, ‘The Brutalist’ expands	New York — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence, Mel Gibson’s 'Flight Risk' managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s 'Hacksaw Ridge.' Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a 'C' CinemaScore) were terrible. President Donald Trump recently named Gibson a 'special ambassador' to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on the Sundance Film Festival and on Thursday’s Oscar nominations, which were twice postponed by the wildfires in the Los Angeles region. The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar 'bump' that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet’s 'The Brutalist' a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted 'The Brutalist,' which is running with an intermission, as 'un-distributable,' Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release. In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for 'The Brutalist.' The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross’ 'Nickel Boys.' Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. Coming off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact. Steven Soderbergh’s 'Presence,' a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slowly, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. 'One of Them Days,' the Keke Palmer and SZA-led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but 'One of Them Days' has proven an exception. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. 'Flight Risk,' $12 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $8.7 million. 3. 'One of Them Days,' $8 million. 4. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $5.5 million. 5. 'Moana 2,' $4.3 million. 6. 'Presence,' $3.4 million. 7. 'Wolf Man,' $3.4 million. 8. 'A Complete Unknown,' $3.1 million. 9. 'Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,' $3 million. 10. 'The Brutalist,' $2.9 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mel-gibson-s-flight-risk-is-no-1-at-box-office-the-brutalist-expands-/7950872.html	2025-01-26T10:54:08-08:00	
With Trump in power, US quickly deporting undocumented migrants	U.S. authorities are now arresting hundreds of undocumented migrants per day and sending them back to their home countries, carrying out President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign pledge to deport masses of migrants who have illegally entered the United States. 'We’re going to enforce immigration laws,' Vice President JD Vance told CBS News’ 'Face the Nation' on Sunday. More than 1,000 migrants were arrested with hundreds repatriated to other countries, including Guatemala last week, during the first days of the new Trump administration, according to figures compiled by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the White House. 'It’s going very well. We’re getting the bad, hard criminals out,' Trump told reporters Friday during a trip to North Carolina to view the flood recovery efforts from Hurricane Helene. Without evidence, he said, 'These are murderers. These are people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as anybody you’ve seen. We’re taking them out first.' The White House released photos of shackled migrants boarding a C-17 military transport aircraft for flights out of the United States. Trump’s 'border czar,' Tom Homan, told ABC’s 'This Week' show Sunday, 'There will be more arrests nationwide.' Trump authorized sending 1,500 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Homan said, 'You’ll see the numbers increase. They’re down there to create a secure border.' He said the U.S. is deporting 'as many as we can' arrest, with the focus first on those convicted of U.S. crimes and then moving on to detain and deport those whose asylum requests have been rejected by U.S. officials. 'We’re in the beginning stages,' Homan said. 'It’s not OK to violate the laws of this country,' Homan said. He urged undocumented migrants, even those who have not been ordered out of the U.S., to return to their home countries voluntarily. About 11 million undocumented migrants are believed to be living in the U.S., a staggering number that most officials believe will be impossible to deport. 'We’re going to do what we can with the money we have,' Homan said. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, urged his Republican colleagues in Congress to authorize more spending for the deportation effort. 'We haven't given the Trump team the resources,' Graham said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press' show. He said Homan 'needs to substantially hire more [immigration] agents. He needs to finish the [border] wall [with Mexico] and technology. He needs to go from 41,000 detention beds to 150,000 detention beds to make this work.' 'So, to my Republican colleagues, particularly in the House [of Representatives], as we fiddle, our immigration plans are hitting walls. We're not building walls, we're hitting walls. We need to give Tom Homan the money now to execute the plan that he's come up with. And without congressional funding this is going to hit a wall,' Graham declared. The Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants waiting in Mexico to request asylum through a mobile app, but Trump’s anti-immigration edicts are facing legal challenges. One judge has already temporarily blocked Trump from declaring that he no longer recognizes constitutionally guaranteed citizenship for children of undocumented migrants born in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-trump-in-power-us-quickly-deporting-undocumented-migrants-/7950864.html	2025-01-26T10:34:50-08:00	
Iran's foreign minister meets Taliban in 1st visit to Kabul in 8 years	Top Taliban officials met Iran’s foreign minister Sunday to discuss tensions along their shared border, the treatment of Afghan refugees in Iran and water rights. It was the first visit by an Iranian foreign minister to the Afghan capital since 2017. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was committed to the return of some 3.5 million Afghan refugees and had no intention of interfering in its neighbor’s domestic politics, according to a statement from the Afghan government’s deputy spokesperson Hamdullah Fitrat. He also called for the full implementation of the Helmand River water treaty, which envisions shared water resources, the statement said. Acting Prime Minister Hassan Akhund asked Iran to treat Afghan refugees with respect and said it was not feasible to manage a large-scale repatriation within a short period. He also said incidents such as the execution of Afghans in Iran provoked public sentiment. Araghchi also met Afghanistan's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, and Defense Minister Mohammad Yaqoob. Earlier Sunday, Iran’s official IRNA news agency quoted Araghchi as saying he hoped for more economic ties and improved relations with Afghanistan, citing some 'ups and downs.' Iran doesn’t formally recognize the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which seized power in 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces withdrew from the country following two decades of war. But Tehran maintains political and economic ties with Kabul and has allowed the Taliban to manage Afghanistan’s Embassy in Iran's capital.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-foreign-minister-meets-taliban-in-1st-visit-to-kabul-in-8-years-/7950827.html	2025-01-26T09:47:03-08:00	
As Hegseth takes charge at Pentagon, here are what changes could be in store	Washington — When Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth starts his first official day on Monday morning, he will face a daunting array of issues to tackle — from global conflicts and border security to administrative tasks. At the top of his list is addressing President Donald Trump's priority to strengthen the U.S. military presence along the southern border and reviewing whether active-duty forces should be used for law enforcement — something done rarely. Dozens of other issues will compete for his attention, including developing the Pentagon's massive budget, decisions about aid to Ukraine, support for the ceasefire in Gaza, troop deployments in the Middle East. Not to mention Trump directives to rid the federal government of diversity programs and personnel as well as moves to cut waste and remove any lingering Biden administration backers. In a message to the force shortly after he was sworn in Saturday, Hegseth cited the challenges he sees ahead. Some are ones his predecessors also faced, such as reorienting the military from decades of a Middle East focus and better deterring China. Continued conflict in the region, including the October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, has made that shift impossible to execute. Hegseth also told service members about other priorities, including strengthening the defense industrial base and getting the Pentagon to pass an audit, while ensuring that the United States remains 'the strongest and most lethal force in the world.' He made an unannounced stop to the Pentagon on Saturday after the swearing-in ceremony at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. There was no media coverage of his arrival. The Pentagon later released an official photo saying Hegseth was 'ready to get to work on behalf of America’s warriors.' Already, support staff have been meeting with military leaders, including Gen. CQ Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Hegseth will get to experience what many describe as 'drinking from a firehose' as he works to quickly get up to speed on what his 2.1 million service members and 780,000 civilians in the department are doing. Among them are tens of thousands serving overseas, including in combat zones. Then there are the cultural issues that Hegseth railed on as a media personality that did not make it into Hegseth’s message to the military. Many expect they will surface in the coming days. Here are some key issues that Hegseth, who was confirmed in a tiebreaking vote Friday by Vice President JD Vance, will face right away: Border deployments In trying to meet Trump's demand of securing the border, Hegseth will face a barrage of information about what troops are available, what assistance the Border Patrol needs and where, as well as how to house, feed and transport the troops and border personnel and how to ensure none of this affects other national security requirements. One of his first big decisions is whether he will recommend that active-duty troops deployed to the border become involved in law enforcement, a move that military leaders in recent years have pushed to avoid. Active-duty forces are prohibited from doing law enforcement duties on U.S. soil under the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump has signed an executive order directing that his defense and homeland security secretaries report back within 90 days on whether they think he should invoke the 1807 law called the Insurrection Act, which allows troops to be used for civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil during emergencies. During previous deployments, troops have been used for transportation, intelligence, logistics, wall-building and other support tasks, freeing up the Border Patrol to interact with migrants and conduct the law enforcement duties. Transgender troops In his first executive order, Trump again stripped protections for transgender troops that Democratic President Joe Biden had restored after Trump banned those members from serving during his first term in office. The ban previously faced legal challenges, and lawyers who represented transgender forces last time are readying to take it up in the courts again. While Trump has not announced a ban, his decision to revoke protections is seen as a first step toward that. It is unclear how many troops would be affected. The Defense Department has no exact figure on the number of transgender troops serving because not every transgender person is in the same state of medical transition and not every transgender person identifies as such in military paperwork. The department has referred queries on how many transgender troops there are to the services; the services have said they have no way to track. The budget and Ukraine Hegseth will have to become familiar with the complicated construction of the Pentagon budget, which right now is about $850 billion. Trump ran on a vow to make the U.S. military more lethal — something Hegseth has echoed. But they also have spoken extensively about cutting waste. So Hegseth's imprint on the budget will be studied to determine how that's being done. Woven into those discussions will be security assistance to Ukraine. The State Department has ordered a freeze on new funding for almost all U.S. foreign aid, and there was no indication of a waiver for military assistance for Ukraine like there was for Israel and Egypt. The Biden administration provided Kyiv with more than $66 billion in military aid and weapons during the war with Russia. It had left unspent about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding to send more weapons to Ukraine from existing U.S. stockpiles — a sum that is not affected by the foreign aid freeze. But it is now up to Hegseth and Trump to decide whether or not to spend it, and Trump hasn’t said what he will do on Ukraine aid. Diversity, equity and inclusion rollbacks Hegseth will take over the Pentagon's push to implement Trump's executive order to get rid of DEI programs, coming as military officers fret over whether they will be fired for being 'woke,' as Hegseth has pledged to do. During his Senate hearing, Hegseth affirmed his commitment to focus on lethality and to eliminate wokeness, arguing that DEI policies 'divide' troops and do not prioritize 'meritocracy.' Officials said the Defense Department doesn’t have any full-time workers assigned to DEI so they don’t expect to have to fire people, as other federal agencies have. But senior leaders have been poring over their websites to delete pages that mention diversity. Lacking clear guidance, staffers were pulling websites down in often inconsistent ways. The Army, for example, temporarily removed its sexual assault guidelines before they later came back online. Hegseth also has railed against women in combat in his books and on podcasts and said standards were lowered for them, which is not true. He has since toned down his criticism after substantial pushback from lawmakers. He most recently told senators that he's not aware that Trump wants to roll back the decision to allow women to serve in all combat jobs. Instead, he has talked about doing a review of standards. Reproductive care After the Supreme Court in 2022 ended constitutional protections for abortion that were set out in Roe v. Wade, then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin came out with a policy that would allow service members to take leave and be reimbursed for travel expenses to obtain reproductive care — including abortions and in-vitro fertilization — if the military base they were assigned to was in a state that had banned that care. It’s not clear whether Hegseth will seek to further revise that policy to remove the reimbursement provisions. It has been only scarcely used, and the department does not break down what the travel was for due to medical privacy laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-hegseth-takes-charge-at-pentagon-here-are-what-changes-could-be-in-store/7950776.html	2025-01-26T08:06:33-08:00	
Thousands in Ireland still without power as officials say Storm Eowyn cleanup will take time	London — Ireland called in help from England and France on Sunday as repair crews worked to restore power to hundreds of thousands of people after the most disruptive storm for years. More than 1 million people in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland were left without electricity after Storm Eowyn roared through on Friday. In Ireland, which suffered the heaviest damage, the wind snapped telephone poles, ripped apart a Dublin ice rink and even toppled a giant wind turbine. A wind gust of 183 kph was recorded on the west coast, breaking a record set in 1945. The state electricity company, ESB Networks, said that more than 300,000 properties in Ireland still had no power on Sunday, down from 768,000 on Friday. The Irish military was also helping out, but the company said that it could be two more weeks before electricity is restored to everyone. Irish Minister for Social Protection Dara Calleary said authorities were 'throwing everything at it.' 'We’re bringing additional people from England today and we’re looking for people from France, additional technicians,' he told broadcaster RTE. 'What we’re focused on is getting our infrastructure back up, getting our power back up, getting our water and connectivity back up as soon as is possible.' Another 75,000 people were still without power on Sunday in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom and neighbors the Republic of Ireland. At least two people died during the storm. Kacper Dudek, 20, was killed when a tree fell on his car in County Donegal in northwest Ireland, local police said. Police in Scotland said that a 19-year-old man, who hasn't been named, died in a hospital on Saturday after a tree fell on his car in the southwestern town of Mauchline on Friday. More rainy and windy weather battered Britain and Ireland on Sunday, with a gust of 132 kph recorded at Predannack in southwest England.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-in-ireland-still-without-power-as-officials-say-storm-%c3%a9owyn-cleanup-will-take-time-/7950764.html	2025-01-26T07:58:19-08:00	
Jannik Sinner beats Alexander Zverev for 2nd Australian Open title	MELBOURNE, Australia — There's all sorts of ways beyond merely the score to measure just how dominant Jannik Sinner was while outplaying and frustrating Alexander Zverev during the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory Sunday that earned the 23-year-old Italian a second consecutive Australian Open championship. The zero break points Sinner faced. Or the 10 he accumulated. The 27-13 advantage in points that lasted at least nine strokes. Or the way Sinner accumulated more winners, 32 to 25, and fewer unforced errors, 27 to 45. The way Sinner won 10 of the 13 points that ended with him at the net. Or the way he only let Zverev go 14 of 27 in that category, frequently zipping passing shots out of reach. Well, here's is one more bit of evidence: what Zverev said about Sinner. 'I’m serving better than him, but that’s it. He does everything else better than me. He moves better than me. He hits his forehand better than me. He hits his backhand better than me. He returns better than me. He volleys better than me,' Zverev said. 'At the end of the day, tennis has five or six massive shots — like, massive factors — and he does four or five of them better than me. That’s the reason why he won.' High praise from a guy who is, after all, ranked No. 2. Sinner has held the No. 1 spot since last June and is not showing any signs of relinquishing it. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019, when No. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal — also in straight sets. 'It's amazing,' Sinner said, 'to achieve these things.' The 'things' include being the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93, and the first man since Nadal at the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his first Grand Slam title by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later. Sinner was asked later whether he felt more relief or excitement when he raised his arms after the last point was his. 'This one was joy. We managed to do something incredible this time, because the situation I was in was completely different from a year ago here,' he said. 'I had more pressure.' Probably true, but it's hard to tell. Go to the start of 2024 and take stock. In that span, Sinner has won three of the five major tournaments, including the U.S. Open in September, meaning he now has claimed three straight hard-court Slams. His record is 80-6 with nine titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches. 'There's always something that can get better,' said one of his two coaches, Simone Vagnozzi. 'He is playing really well right now and everything comes easily. But there will be tough moments ahead.' The only thing that’s clouded the past 12 months for Sinner, it seems, is the doping case in which his exoneration was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was cleared in August; a hearing in the WADA appeal is scheduled for April. 'I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened,' Sinner said Sunday. 'I know if I would be guilty, I would not play like this.' While he became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals, Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3, adding this loss to those at the 2020 U.S. Open and last year's French Open. Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all. 'I’ll keep doing everything I can,' Zverev said, 'to lift one of those trophies.' Just before Zverev began speaking into a microphone during the trophy ceremony, a voice cried out from the stands, making reference to two of the player’s ex-girlfriends who accused him of physical abuse. During the match, there truly was only one moment that contained a hint of tension. It came when Zverev was two points from owning the second set at 5-4, love-30. But a break point — and a set point — never arrived. A year ago, Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first major, needing to get past Novak Djokovic — who quit one set into his semifinal against Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring — before erasing a two-set deficit in the final against 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev. This time, Sinner applied pressure with an all-around style that does not really appear to have holes. 'The facts speak for themselves,' Zverev said. 'He’s in a different universe right now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jannik-sinner-beats-alexander-zverev-for-2nd-australian-open-title/7950756.html	2025-01-26T07:49:44-08:00	
Pope Francis warns of 'scourge of antisemitism' ahead of Holocaust Remembrance Day	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis warned of the 'scourge of antisemitism' in his Angelus prayer on Sunday, the eve of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, noting it marks 80 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp. 'The horror of the extermination of millions of Jewish people and others of different faiths during those years must never be forgotten or denied,' Francis said, citing the example of Hungarian-born poet Edith Bruck, who lives in Rome. He noted that many Christians were also killed in Nazi concentration camps, 'among whom there were numerous martyrs.' 'I renew my appeal for everyone to work together to eradicate the scourge of antisemitism, along with every form of discrimination and religious persecution,' Francis said. 'Together, let us build a more fraternal, just world, educating young people to have hearts open to all, in the spirit of fraternity, forgiveness, and peace,' he added. The pontiff also launched an appeal for an end to the civil war in Sudan, which began in April 2023, saying it is causing 'the most severe humanitarian crisis in the world, with dramatic consequences even in South Sudan.' The pope also expressed concern for the situation in Colombia’s Catatumbo region, where many civilians have been killed by clashes between armed groups, which have forced over 30,000 people to leave their homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-warns-of-scourge-of-antisemitism-ahead-of-holocaust-remembrance-day-/7950693.html	2025-01-26T06:16:32-08:00	
Congo severs ties with Rwanda as rebels close in on Goma, displacing thousands	GOMA, DRC — Congo severed diplomatic ties with Rwanda as fighting between Rwanda-backed rebels and government forces raged around the key eastern city of Goma, leaving at least 13 peacekeepers and foreign soldiers dead and displacing thousands of civilians. The M23 rebel group has made significant territorial gains along the border with Rwanda in recent weeks, closing in on Goma, the provincial capital of around 2 million people and a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts. Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army more than a decade ago. It's one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region, where a long-running conflict has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. Rwanda's government denies backing the rebels, but last year acknowledged that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. The Congolese foreign ministry said late Saturday it was severing diplomatic ties with Rwanda and pulling out all diplomatic staff from the country 'with immediate effect.' Rwanda did not comment immediately. The U.N. Security Council moved up an emergency meeting on the escalating violence in eastern Congo to Sunday. Congo requested the meeting, which had originally been scheduled for Monday. On Sunday morning, heavy gunfire resonated across Goma, just a few kilometers from the front line, while scores of displaced children and adults fled the Kanyaruchinya camp, one of the largest in eastern Congo, right near the Rwandan border, and headed south to Goma. 'We are fleeing because we saw soldiers on the border with Rwanda throwing bombs and shooting,' said Safi Shangwe, who was heading to Goma. 'We are tired and we are afraid, our children are at risk of starving,' she added. Some of the displaced worried they will not be safe in Goma either. 'We are going to Goma, but I heard that there are bombs in Goma, too, so now we don't know where to go,' said Adèle Shimiye. Hundreds of people attempted to flee to Rwanda through the border crossings east of Goma on Sunday while migration officers carefully checked travel documents. 'I am crossing to the other side to see if we will have a place of refuge because for the moment, security in the city is not guaranteed,' Muahadi Amani, a resident of Goma, told The Associated Press. Earlier in the week, the rebels seized Sake, 27 kilometers from Goma, as concerns mounted that the city could soon fall. Congo's army said Saturday it fended off an M23 offensive with the help of allied forces, including U.N. troops and soldiers from the Southern African Development Community Mission, also known as SAMIDRC. Two South African peacekeepers were killed Friday, while a Uruguayan soldier was killed Saturday, a U.N. official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on the matter publicly. Additionally, three Malawian peacekeepers were killed in eastern Congo, the United Nations in Malawi said Saturday. Seven South African soldiers from the SAMIDRC were also killed during clashes with M23 over the last two days, South Africa's Defense Department said. Since 2021, Congo's government and allied forces, including SAMIDRC and U.N. troops, have been keeping M23 away from Goma. The U.N peacekeeping force, also known as MONUSCO, entered Congo more than two decades ago and has around 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-severs-ties-with-rwanda-as-rebels-close-in-on-goma-displacing-thousands-/7950644.html	2025-01-26T04:45:16-08:00	
South Korean president indicted as 'ringleader of an insurrection'	Seoul — South Korean prosecutors indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol Sunday for being the 'ringleader of an insurrection' after his abortive declaration of martial law, ordering the suspended leader to remain in detention. Yoon plunged the country into political chaos with his December 3 bid to suspend civilian rule, a move which lasted just six hours before lawmakers defied armed soldiers in parliament to vote it down. He was impeached soon after, and earlier this month became the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested. That came after a weekslong holdout at his residence, where his elite personal security detail resisted attempts to detain him. In a statement, prosecutors said they had 'indicted Yoon Suk Yeol with detention today on charges of being the ringleader of an insurrection.' He has been held at the Seoul Detention Center since his arrest, and the formal indictment with detention means he will now be kept behind bars until his trial, which must happen within six months. The indictment was widely expected after a court twice rejected requests by prosecutors to extend his arrest warrant while their investigation proceeded. 'After a comprehensive review of evidence obtained during investigations [prosecutors] concluded that it was only appropriate to indict the defendant,' they said in a statement. The need to keep Yoon behind bars was justified by a 'continued risk of evidence destruction,' they said. The specific charge — being the ringleader of an insurrection — is not covered by presidential immunity, they added. 'Process of accountability' The opposition hailed the indictment. 'We need to hold not only those who schemed to carry out an illegal insurrection, but also those who instigated it by spreading misinformation,' said lawmaker Han Min-soo. Without providing evidence, Yoon and his legal team have pointed to purported election fraud and legislative gridlock at the opposition-controlled parliament as justification for his declaration of martial law. Yoon has vowed to 'fight to the end', earning the support of supporters who have adopted the 'stop the steal' rhetoric associated with U.S. President Donald Trump. 'This indictment will provide a sense of relief, reaffirming that the constitutional order is functioning as it should,' said Bae Kang-hoon, co-founder of political think tank Valid. Yoon also faces a series of Constitutional Court hearings, to decide whether to uphold his impeachment and strip him formally of the presidency. If the court rules against Yoon, he will lose the presidency and an election will be called within 60 days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-president-indicted-as-ringleader-of-an-insurrection-/7950623.html	2025-01-26T03:26:48-08:00	
3 killed in Lebanon amid protests as Israeli forces remain	MAYS AL-JABAL, LEBANON — At least three people were killed and more than 40 others injured in southern Lebanon Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on protesters who had breached roadblocks the Israeli army set up a day before, Lebanon's health ministry reported. Demonstrators, some of them carrying Hezbollah flags, attempted to enter several villages in the border area to protest Israel's failure to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon by the 60-day deadline stipulated in a ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war in late November. Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence in the area. The Lebanese army has said it cannot deploy until Israeli forces withdraw. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, said in a statement addressing the people of southern Lebanon on Sunday that 'Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable, and I am following up on this issue at the highest levels to ensure your rights and dignity.' He urged them to 'exercise self-restraint and trust in the Lebanese Armed Forces.' The Lebanese army, in a separate statement, said it was escorting civilians into some towns in the border area and called on residents to follow military instructions to ensure their safety. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, whose Amal Movement party is allied with Hezbollah and who served as an interlocutor between the militant group and the U.S. during ceasefire negotiations, said in a statement that Sunday's bloodshed 'is a clear and urgent call for the international community to act immediately and compel Israel to withdraw from occupied Lebanese territories.' Lebanon's Health Ministry said in a statement that one protester was killed and 10 others injured in the border village of Houla. Another protester was killed in the village of Aitaroun and 11 injured. A third protester was killed in the village of Blida and one person injured. The health ministry also reported injuries in the areas of Mays al-Jabal, Markaba, Bani Hayyan, Odaisseh, Rab Thalatin and Kfar Kila. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the protests. The Israeli army's Arabic language spokesperson called Sunday morning in a post on X for residents of the border area not to attempt to return to their villages. An AP team was stranded overnight at a base of the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL near Mays al-Jabal after the Israeli army erected roadblocks Saturday while they were joining a patrol by peacekeepers. The journalists reported hearing gunshots and booming sounds Sunday morning from the base, and peacekeepers said that dozens of protesters had gathered nearby. In the village of Aita al Shaab, families wandered over flattened concrete structures looking for remnants of the homes they left behind. No Israeli forces were present. 'These are our houses,' said Hussein Bajouk, one of the returning residents. 'However much they destroy, we will rebuild.' Bajouk added that he is convinced that former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs in September, is really still alive. 'I don't know how much we're going to wait, another month or two months... but the Sayyed will come out and speak,' he said using an honorific for Nasrallah. Some 112,000 Lebanese remain displaced, out of over 1 million displaced during the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-lebanon-amid-protests-as-israeli-forces-remain/7950610.html	2025-01-26T02:36:54-08:00	
Facebook scammers use fake VOA article to push Russian cryptocurrency scheme	When American conservative commentator Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian IT entrepreneur Pavel Durov in April, he had an additional unexpected audience: scammers. After the video was published, a phony Russian-language transcript of the interview tried to attract 'investors' to a cryptocurrency scheme that promised monthly earnings of $13,000. That scheme came to VOA’s attention because its creators used a copy of a VOA Russian article page in their attempts to defraud internet users. It is one of many examples of legitimate media outlets being exploited for fraudulent purposes. These schemes buy advertising using Facebook accounts — often hacked without the user’s knowledge — spanning countries like the Philippines, Mexico and Afghanistan. The strategy and rhetoric follow a pattern, according to Jordan Liles, at American fact-checking site Snopes.com. 'There are so many scams online that pose as legitimate publishers,' he told VOA. 'Name any publisher – they’ve probably been used in scams to try to fool people who don’t look at their web address bar.' There is no indication that Durov or Carlson is involved in the scheme. VOA reached out to them for comment but received no response. In a statement, Facebook parent company Meta told VOA it takes scams seriously. 'Fraud is a problem that’s always persisted with new technology,' the company wrote. 'But that’s exactly why Meta always has — and always will — take a hard line against scams, fraud and abuse in all of its forms to help keep it off of our platforms.' Scammers have previously posed as Voice of America, using deepfakes in two separate cases that targeted VOA Russian journalists. Those cases relied on artificial intelligence. In contrast, the Durov scam takes a distinctly low-tech approach: It uses a Q&A-style text transcript in Russian that falsely claims to be a 'continuation' of Carlson’s interview. The founder of Russian social media site VKontakte and messenger app Telegram, Durov is a well-known tech entrepreneur. That makes him harder to impersonate. According to an April 2024 report by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, while deepfakes of public figures 'are relatively routine,' they also tend not to be believable. Layers of lies At the center of the cryptocurrency scam impersonating VOA is an intriguing promise and a trail of stolen accounts spanning the globe. The fake story claims that Durov told Carlson about his latest creation: ProTON-Invest, an open program that will allow even the least financially literate person to earn large sums of money with minimal effort. VOA attempted to trace the origins of the ProTON-Invest scheme and its promotional content, but the fraudsters had done a good job covering their tracks. When VOA approached the owners of the Facebook accounts that bought advertising for the scheme, those who responded said they had lost access to their pages. One of the accounts, called 'Simply News' in Russian, had previously been the page of a business in Calumpit, a provincial city in the Philippines, that sold house plants and baked goods during the coronavirus pandemic. The business’s co-owner, Dannie Roxas, told VOA that the page had been hacked. 'We do not have any access to it and we cannot take it back anymore,' she said in a Telegram message. 'We already have reported it.' Another Facebook page promoting the scam (but without the fake VOA story) was 'Golden News.' It formerly belonged to a travel agency in Kabul, Afghanistan. VOA wrote to the agency over WhatsApp. A man who did not identify himself said the most recent posts were not from the company and they had likely been hacked. When VOA inquired further, he declined to provide more information. VOA also identified several more accounts sharing the fake transcript or pushing the fraud scheme. Two appeared to belong to a graphic designer in the Punjab region of Pakistan. He did not respond to a request for comment. Another belonged to a Mexican rapper. The man behind that page did not respond to a request for comment but had previously written from his personal Facebook page that his music account was hacked. According to Facebook’s Page Transparency data, the stolen accounts often had managers supposedly located in multiple countries, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Ukraine, China and the U.S. But it’s unclear how Facebook determines where the managers are located. Meta did not respond to a question from VOA about that. If the determination is based on an IP address, that can easily be spoofed using a virtual private network (VPN), a basic tool for maintaining privacy online. Trouble fighting back At its core, the ProTON-Invest scam appears to benefit from the current online environment. When hackers take over an account, they often change the password, recovery email and phone number. That makes it extremely difficult to retake the account. After cryptocurrency scammers took over his Facebook account in early 2024, it took journalist Yuri – who asked to be identified only by his first name to discuss the hack without his employer’s permission – nearly six months to regain control. Ultimately, he had to hire a lawyer to engage with Facebook parent company Meta. 'If the lawyer hadn’t helped me, I would have spent a long time writing to Meta,' Yuri said. The scams are also relatively inexpensive to create. Facebook advertising costs very little, according to Snopes’ Liles. Meanwhile, people who fall victim to the scams give them hundreds or even thousands of dollars. 'If [the scammer] spent only $100, their scam has, unfortunately, been successful,' Liles told VOA. So, how can internet users distinguish a scam from real VOA? Besides looking for an accurate VOA URL in the web address of any supposed VOA page, users should also look for specific signs that VOA social media pages are legitimate. 'In our branding, VOA uses specific colors, and the social media accounts’ names are the same across platforms. On Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, look for the verification check mark, and follow links to other social media platforms from our website or official social media accounts,' a representative of VOA Public Relations said. 'On X, not all of our accounts are verified because they require a paid subscription, so always crosscheck the link on the website or official social media accounts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/facebook-scammers-use-fake-voa-article-to-push-russian-cryptocurrency-scheme/7949807.html	2025-01-25T23:29:14-08:00	
Taipei pet shop strives to break down anti-snake prejudice	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As the Year of the Snake approaches, a pet store in Taipei is offering adventurous customers an opportunity to enjoy the company of snakes while sipping coffee, hoping to break down some of the prejudice against the animal. Taiwan has been plastered with images of the reptile ahead of the start of the Lunar New Year, which starts on Wednesday and whose zodiac animal this year is the snake. The snake has a mixed reputation in traditional Taiwanese and Chinese culture as a symbol of either good or bad. Some of Taiwan's Indigenous peoples venerate snakes as guardian spirits, and while the island is home to species potentially deadly to humans, including vipers and cobras, deaths are rare given the wide availability of anti-venom.

Indonesia showcases returned artifacts it had sought for decades from Netherlands	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Centuries-old stone Buddha statues and precious jewelry repatriated by the Dutch government to its former colony are on display at Indonesia's National Museum, providing a glimpse into the country's rich heritage that the government had struggled to retrieve. The collection is part of more than 800 artifacts that were returned under a Repatriation Agreement signed in 2022 between Indonesia and the Netherlands, said Gunawan, the museum's head of cultural heritage. The objects are not just those looted in conflict but also those seized by scientists and missionaries or smuggled by mercenaries during the four centuries of colonial rule. 'I was so amazed that we have all of these artifacts,' said Shaloom Azura, a visitor to the museum in Jakarta. She hoped other historical objects can be repatriated too, 'so we don't have to go to the Netherlands just to see our own cultural heritage.' The agreement to return cultural objects was inspired by the new era of global restitution and repatriation efforts. In 2021, France said it was returning statues, royal thrones and sacred altars taken from the West African nation of Benin. Belgium returned a gold-capped tooth belonging to the slain Congolese independence hero Patrice Lumumba. Cambodia in 2023 welcomed the return of priceless stolen artifacts that had been seized during periods of war and instability. Many of the items returned so far have come from the United States. And the Berlin museum authority said it would return hundreds of human skulls from the former German colony of East Africa. The Dutch government announced the same year the return of the Indonesian treasures and looted artifacts from Sri Lanka. Few objects made it back before deal was struck The repatriation 'is not something out of the blue' but followed a lengthy process, said I Gusti Agung Wesaka Puja, former Indonesian ambassador to the Netherlands who also headed the government's team tasked to recover the objects. He said negotiations with the Dutch government have been ongoing since Indonesia's independence in August 1945, but it was only in July 2022 that Indonesia formally requested the return of its cultural objects with a list of specific items. 'This repatriation is important for us to reconstruct history that may be lost or obscured or manipulated,' Puja said. 'And we can fill the gap of the historical vacuum that has existed so far.' The Dutch government in 1978 returned the famous 13th-century statue of Princess Pradnya Paramita from the Javanese Singhasari Kingdom. During the same visit to Indonesia, then-Queen Juliana also returned a saddle and spear seized from Prince Diponegoro, a Javanese nobleman considered a national hero for his struggle against colonial rule in the 19th century. The prince's scepter was returned in 2015. In 2020, Dutch King Willem-Alexander handed over Diponegoro's gold-plated kris dagger in his first state visit to Indonesia. Also pending is the return of the 'Java Man' — the first known example of homo erectus that was collected by Dutch paleoanthropologist Eugene Dubois in the 19th century. 'The importance of the most recent repatriation is knowledge creation, that will give society a more complete knowledge of our past history,' said Puja. He said the recent repatriation efforts seem to also be motivated by practical considerations, such as when the Delf city administration sent back 1,500 objects in 2019. They were part of the bankrupted Nusantara Museum collection. Focus on protection of repatriated artifacts However, Marc Gerritsen, the Dutch ambassador to Indonesia, said the repatriation would only focus on cultural objects that are requested, rather than emptying out European museums. 'There is a huge interest from the Dutch public in Indonesian history and Indonesian culture, so we do know that if Dutch museums put these objects on display, there will be an interest,' Gerritsen said, 'But again, the heart of the matter is that the colonial collections artifacts that were stolen during the colonial period are returned on the basis of this process that was established.' He said the Netherlands, the largest investor from the European Union in Indonesia, has a unique relationship with Southeast Asia's biggest economy. 'Of course, we have elements of which we are not proud, but we are really grateful for the fact that Indonesia is so much attached to preserving that history,' Gerritsen said. To support its former colony in safeguarding its repatriated cultural heritage, the Dutch government has offered to assist in improving museum storage conditions and staff expertise. Some researchers have criticized Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation of 17,000 islands, for a lack of legal framework to protect its rich cultural heritage and natural conservation. At least 11 cases of museum theft were reported between 2010 and 2020, according to a 2023 report by Rucitarahma Ristiawan, a lecturer of cultural science at Gajah Mada University, and two other researchers. In 2023, dozens of ships dredged the bottom of the Batanghari River in Jambi province, and the crews looted archaeological objects including porcelain, coins, metal and gold artifacts, which are believed to have been sold abroad, the report said. 'I think there is a lot to be reviewed from our historical works that are still kept in other countries,' said Frengky Simanjuntak, who marveled at the Repatriation Exhibition at the National Museum, on display since October. 'So it's not just about bringing them back home, but how to protect them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-showcases-returned-artifacts-it-had-sought-for-decades-from-netherlands-/7949888.html	2025-01-25T23:27:56-08:00	
Polls open in Belarus with Lukashenko set to extend 30-year rule	MINSK, BELARUS — Belarusians began voting Sunday, with President Alexander Lukashenko expected to cruise to victory unchallenged for a seventh term, prolonging his three-decade authoritarian rule. Lukashenko, a 70-year-old former collective farm boss, has been in power in reclusive, Moscow-allied Belarus since 1994. Polls opened at 8 a.m. (0500 GMT) in Minsk's first presidential vote since Lukashenko suppressed mass protests against his rule in 2020. He has since allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to invade Ukraine in 2022. The opposition and the West said Lukashenko rigged the last vote and the authorities cracked down on demonstrations, with more than a thousand people still jailed. All of Lukashenko's political opponents are either in prison -- some held incommunicado -- or in exile along with tens of thousands of Belarusians who have fled since 2020. 'All our opponents and enemies should understand: do not hope, we will never repeat what we had in 2020,' Lukashenko told a stadium in Minsk during a carefully choreographed ceremony Friday. Belarusians hope for 'no war' Most people in Belarus have only distant memories of life in the landlocked country before Lukashenko, who was 39 when he won the first national election in Belarus since it gained independence from the Soviet Union. Criticism of the strongman is banned in Belarus. Most people AFP spoke to in Minsk and other towns voiced support for him but were still fearful of giving their surnames. The other candidates running against Lukashenko have been picked to give the election an air of democracy and few know who they are. 'I will vote for Lukashenko because things have improved since he became president [in 1994],' said 42-year-old farmer Alexei in the tiny village of Gubichi in southeastern Belarus. He earns around 300 euros a month selling milk. But, like many in Belarus, he is worried about the war in neighboring Ukraine. In 2022, Russian troops entered Ukraine from several directions, including from Belarus. The following year, Russia sent tactical nuclear weapons to the country, which borders NATO countries. Alexei said he wished 'for there not to be a war.' The government's narrative has been to say that Lukashenko guaranteed peace and order in Belarus, accusing 2020 street protest leaders of sowing chaos. 'Farce' The United Nations estimates that some 300,000 Belarusians have left the country since 2020 -- mostly to Poland and Lithuania -- out of a population of 9 million. They will not be able to cast ballots, with Belarus having scrapped voting abroad. Exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya denounced the vote as a 'farce' in a January interview with AFP. Her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, has been held incommunicado for almost a year. She urged dissidents to prepare for an opportunity to change their country but conceded 'it was not the moment.' In the run-up to the election, the Lukashenko administration pardoned around 200 political prisoners. But former prisoners AFP spoke to say those released are under the close watch of security services and are unable to lead a normal life. Nobel Prize winner Ales Bialiatski is among those in prison in Belarus. Reliant on Russia While Lukashenko once carefully balanced his relations between the European Union and Moscow, since 2020 he has become politically and economically reliant on Russia. Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, called the election a 'sham' in a posting on X Saturday and said, 'Lukashenko doesn't have any legitimacy.' Known as 'Europe's last dictator' -- a nickname he embraces -- Lukashenko's Belarus has retained much of the Soviet Union's traditions and infrastructure. Unlike in Russia, the KGB security agency has kept its haunting name and Belarus still applies the death penalty. The country's economy is largely state-planned and Lukashenko scrapped Belarus's white-red-white flag in the 1990s -- which has since become the symbol of the opposition. Lukashenko prides himself for having kept the country's Soviet-era industries and agriculture enterprises in state hands. In his speech on Friday, he spoke about the 'pyatiletka' (Five Year Plan) -- an economic term used in the Soviet Union.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polls-open-in-belarus-with-lukashenko-set-to-extend-30-year-rule/7950578.html	2025-01-25T23:05:19-08:00	
WHO chief urges end to attacks on Sudan health care after 70 drone strike kills 70	The head of the World Health Organization called on Saturday for an end to attacks on health care workers and facilities in Sudan after a drone attack on a hospital in Sudan's North Darfur region killed more than 70 people and wounded dozens. 'As the only functional hospital in El Fasher, the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital provides services which include gyn-obstetrics, internal medicine, surgery and pediatrics, along with a nutrition stabilization center,' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X after the Friday strike. 'We continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,' Tedros said. The war between Sudan's army and the Rapid Support Forces, which broke out in April 2023 due to disputes over the integration of the two forces, has killed tens of thousands, driven millions from their homes and plunged half of the population into hunger. The conflict has produced waves of ethnically driven violence blamed largely on the RSF, creating a humanitarian crisis. Darfur Governor Mini Minnawi said on X that an RSF drone had struck the emergency department of the hospital in the capital of North Darfur, killing patients, including women and children. Fierce clashes have erupted in El Fasher between the RSF and the Sudanese joint forces, including the army, armed resistance groups, police, and local defense units.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-chief-urges-end-to-attacks-on-sudan-health-care-after-70-drone-strike-kills-70/7950576.html	2025-01-25T22:25:24-08:00	
Trump discussing TikTok purchase with multiple people; decision in 30 days	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in the next 30 days. 'I have spoken to many people about TikTok and there is great interest in TikTok,' Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a flight to Florida. Earlier in the day, Reuters reported two people with knowledge of the discussions said Trump's administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's operations. Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a stake in the company, but data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's Web infrastructure, one of the sources told Reuters. However, in his comments to reporters on the flight, Trump said he had not spoken to Oracle's Larry Ellison about buying the app. Asked if he was putting together a deal with Oracle and other investors to save TikTok, Trump said: 'No, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days. Congress has given 90 days. If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good thing.' The sources did say the terms of any potential deal with Oracle were fluid and likely to change. One source said the full scope of the discussions was not yet set and could include the U.S. operations as well as other regions. National Public Radio on Saturday reported the deal talks for TikTok's global operations, citing two people with knowledge of the negotiations. Oracle had no immediate comment. The deal being negotiated anticipates participation from ByteDance's current U.S. investors, according to the sources. Jeff Yass's Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Sequoia Capital are among ByteDance's U.S. backers. Representatives for TikTok, ByteDance investors General Atlantic, KKR, Sequoia and Susquehanna could not immediately be reached for comment. Others vying to acquire TikTok, including the investor group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and another involving Jimmy Donaldson, better known as the YouTube star Mr. Beast, are not part of the Oracle negotiation, one of the sources said. Oracle responsible Under the terms of the deal, Oracle would be responsible for addressing national security issues. TikTok initially struck a deal with Oracle in 2022 to store U.S. users' information to alleviate Washington's worries about Chinese government interference. TikTok's management would remain in place, to operate the short video app, according to one of the sources. The app, which is used by 170 million Americans, was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Jan. 19. Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused. Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, NPR reported. Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake 'in the tens of billions,' but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as saying. Trump has said he 'would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture' in TikTok. NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle by the White House. Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok's ban under a law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden. The company has said U.S. officials have misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-discussing-tiktok-purchase-with-multiple-people-decision-in-30-days/7950571.html	2025-01-25T21:00:57-08:00	
Rubio threatens bounties on Taliban leaders over detained Americans	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday threatened bounties on the heads of Afghanistan's Taliban leaders, sharply escalating the tone as he said more Americans may be detained in the country than previously thought. The threat comes days after the Afghan Taliban government and the United States swapped prisoners in one of the final acts of former U.S. President Joe Biden. The new top U.S. diplomat issued the harsh warning via social media, in a rhetorical style strikingly similar to his boss, President Donald Trump. 'Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has been reported,' Rubio wrote on X. 'If this is true, we will have to immediately place a VERY BIG bounty on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on bin Laden,' he said, referring to the al-Qaida leader killed by U.S. forces in 2011. Rubio did not describe who the other Americans may be, but there have long been accounts of missing Americans whose cases were not formally taken up by the U.S. government as wrongful detentions. In the deal with the Biden administration, the Taliban freed the best-known American detained in Afghanistan, Ryan Corbett, who had been living with his family in the country and was seized in August 2022. Also freed was William McKenty, an American about whom little information has been released. The United States in turn freed Khan Mohammed, who was serving a life sentence in a California prison. Mohammed was convicted of trafficking heroin and opium into the United States and was accused of seeking rockets to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The United States offered a bounty of $25 million for information leading to the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden shortly after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, with Congress later authorizing the secretary of state to offer up to $50 million. No one is believed to have collected the bounty for bin Laden, who was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan. Harder line on Taliban? Trump is known for brandishing threats in his speeches and on social media. But he is also a critic of U.S. military interventions overseas and in his second inaugural address Monday said he aspired to be a 'peacemaker.' In his first term, the Trump administration broke a then-taboo and negotiated directly with the Taliban -- with Trump even proposing a summit with the then-insurgents at the Camp David presidential retreat -- as he brokered a deal to pull U.S. troops and end America's longest war. Biden carried out the agreement, with the Western-backed government swiftly collapsing and the Taliban retaking power in August 2021 just after U.S. troops left. The scenes of chaos in Kabul brought strong criticism of Biden, especially when 13 American troops and scores of Afghans died in a suicide bombing at the city's airport. The Biden administration had low-level contacts with Taliban government representatives but made little headway. Some members of Trump's Republican Party criticized even the limited U.S. engagements with the Taliban government and especially the humanitarian assistance authorized by the Biden administration, which insisted the money was for urgent needs in the impoverished country and never routed through the Taliban. Rubio on Friday froze nearly all U.S. aid around the world. No country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which has imposed severe restrictions on women and girls under its ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam. The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor on Thursday said he was seeking arrest warrants for senior Taliban leaders over the persecution of women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-threatens-bounties-on-taliban-leaders-over-detained-americans/7950570.html	2025-01-25T20:41:40-08:00	
Trump wants Jordan and Egypt to accept more refugees	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — President Donald Trump said Saturday he'd like to see Jordan, Egypt and other Arab nations increase the number of Palestinian refugees they are accepting from the Gaza Strip — potentially moving out enough of the population to 'just clean out' the war-torn area to create a virtual clean slate. During a 20-minute question-and-answer session with reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump also said he's ended his predecessor's hold on sending 907-kilogram bombs to Israel. That lifts a pressure point that had been meant to reduce civilian casualties during Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza that is now halted by a tenuous ceasefire. 'We released them today,' Trump said of the bombs. 'They've been waiting for them for a long time.' Asked why he lifted the ban on those bombs, Trump responded, 'Because they bought them.' Trump has built his political career around being unapologetically pro-Israel. On his larger vision for Gaza, Trump said he had call earlier in the day with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt. 'I'd like Egypt to take people,' Trump said. 'You're talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say, 'You know, it's over.'' Trump said he complimented Jordan for having successfully accepted Palestinian refugees and that he told the king, 'I'd love for you to take on more, ‘cause I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it's a mess. It's a real mess.' He said of such a mass movement of Palestinians, 'it could be temporary or long term,' adding that the area of the world that encompasses Gaza, has 'had many, many conflicts' over centuries. 'Something has to happen,' Trump said. 'But it's literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there.' He added: 'So, I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change.' There was no immediate comment from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. Trump has offered nontraditional views on the future of Gaza in the past. He suggested after he was inaugurated on Monday that Gaza has 'really got to be rebuilt in a different way.' The new president added then, 'Gaza is interesting. It's a phenomenal location, on the sea. The best weather, you know, everything is good. It's like, some beautiful things could be done with it, but it's very interesting.' His resuming delivery of large bombs, meanwhile, is a break with then-President Joe Biden, who halted their delivery in May as part of an effort to keep Israel from launching an all-out assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. A month later, Israel did take control of the city, but after the vast majority of the 1 million civilians that had been living or sheltering in Rafah had fled. 'Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,' Biden told CNN in May when he held up the weapons. 'I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.' The Biden pause had also held up 1,700 227-kilogram bombs that had been packaged in the same shipment to Israel, but weeks later those bombs were delivered. Trump's action comes as he has celebrated the first phase of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel that has paused the fighting and seen the release of some hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Negotiations have yet to begin in earnest on the more difficult second phase of the deal that would eventually see the release of all hostages held by Hamas and an enduring halt to the fighting. The Israeli government has threatened to resume its war against Hamas — which launched a massive assault against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — if the remaining hostages are not released.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-wants-jordan-and-egypt-to-accept-more-refugees/7950563.html	2025-01-25T20:20:08-08:00	
Rain in California will aid firefighters, create risk of toxic runoff	LOS ANGELES — Rain began falling in parched Southern California on Saturday in a boon for firefighters who were mopping up multiple wildfires. But heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring the threat of new troubles like toxic ash runoff. Los Angeles County crews spent much of the week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires. The two fires reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds on January 7. Most of the region was expected to get about 2.5 centimeters of precipitation over several days, but 'the threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario' of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on social media. 'So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,' weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. 'That could be enough to create debris flows.' The rain started along the Central Coast before moving into Ventura and LA counties in the evening. It was forecast to increase throughout the weekend and possibly last into early Tuesday, Smith said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas, and snow was likely in the mountains. Leaders take steps to speed cleanup Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order this week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. Los Angeles County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas. Fire crews filled sandbags for communities while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins. Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up. Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito up the coast from LA was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Twenty-three people died, and hundreds of homes were damaged. Several fires continue burning While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and dry conditions, several wildfires were still burning across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, which killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81%, and the Eaton Fire was at 95% containment. In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic. And in San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire churning through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border. The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began October 1, the Los Angeles Times reported. Most of Southern California is now either in 'extreme drought' or 'severe drought,' according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rain-expected-in-california-will-aid-firefighting-but-could-lead-to-toxic-runoff-/7950548.html	2025-01-25T18:24:56-08:00	
CIA: COVID likely originated in a lab, but agency has ‘low confidence’ in report	WASHINGTON — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has 'low confidence' in its own conclusion. The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director. The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory. Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities. The CIA 'continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,' the agency wrote in a statement about its new assessment. Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs. Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. It's a question with significant domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic's legacy. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Saturday he was 'pleased the CIA concluded in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory is the most plausible explanation,' and he commended Ratcliffe for declassifying the assessment. 'Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world,' Cotton said in a statement. China's embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Chinese authorities have in the past dismissed speculation about COVID's origins as unhelpful and motivated by politics. While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019. Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago, a report by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding. The same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency believed the virus 'most likely' spread after escaping from a lab. Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too. 'The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,' Ratcliffe said in 2023. The CIA said it will continue to evaluate any new information that could change its assessment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cia-covid-likely-originated-in-a-lab-but-agency-has-low-confidence-in-report-/7950532.html	2025-01-25T17:28:11-08:00	
North Korea tests sea-to-surface cruise missiles, state media says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea has test-fired sea-to-surface strategic guided cruise missiles, state news agency KCNA reported Sunday, adding that the weapons 'precisely' hit their targets. 'The war deterrence means of the armed forces of the DPRK are being perfected more thoroughly,' North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said as he oversaw Saturday's test, the agency reported. The missiles hit their marks after travelling along the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) elliptical and figure-eight orbits, the report said, adding that there was 'no negative impact on the security of neighboring countries.' KCNA did not say where the test took place. The weapons test by Pyongyang was the first since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House on Monday. Shortly before his inauguration, North Korea fired several short-range ballistic missiles into the sea. Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim during his first term in office, said in an interview aired Thursday that he would reach out to Kim again, calling the North Korean leader a 'smart guy.' The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950 to 1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of United Nations sanctions. On Sunday, KCNA carried a statement from North Korea's foreign ministry criticizing Washington and Seoul, South Korea, for carrying out joint military drills in recent days. 'The reality stresses that the DPRK should counter the U.S. with the toughest counteraction from A to Z as long as it refuses the sovereignty and security interests of the DPRK,' the statement said, referring to North Korea by its official acronym. 'This is the best option for dealing with the U.S.' Such joint military exercises regularly infuriate the nuclear-armed North, which decries them as rehearsals for invasion. In late October, North Korea test-fired what it said was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). It then fired a salvo of short-range ballistic missiles days later.

Haitian leader: Trump administration's deportation plans will be 'catastrophic'	ROME — The president of Haiti's transitional presidential council said the Trump administration's decisions to freeze aid programs, deport migrants and block refugees will be 'catastrophic' for Haiti. Leslie Voltaire made the comment in an interview with The Associated Press in Rome on Saturday following a meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican. He visited the pope to ask for help for Haiti. 'I'm knocking on the doors of people who love Haiti. The pope loves Haiti, and he is eager to help,' Haiti's interim president said. The pontiff and Voltaire discussed the dire situation in Haiti where gangs have killed civilians and operate across the Caribbean nation with impunity. Half of Haiti's 11.4 million people are already hungry, according to Voltaire, and losing humanitarian assistance will make the situation dramatically worse. 'Trump said that Haiti is a 'shithole,' so I don't think he will care about Haiti,' Voltaire said, noting that thousands of people are already being repatriated from the Dominican Republic every week and gangs are terrorizing the populace. With the new U.S. policies, 'the situation will be catastrophic.' During his first administration, President Donald Trump used blunt language to question why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and other countries in Africa. At the time, the White House did not deny his remark but issued a statement saying Trump supports immigration policies that welcome 'those who can contribute to our society.' Voltaire said there are roughly 1.5 million Haitians in the United States and roughly 150,000 who were accepted under a program called the 'Temporary Protection System.' 'Trump says that he will expel all of them,' Voltaire said, adding that Haiti, which is already struggling with hunger and internally displaced people, cannot handle the influx. In a report released this month, the U.N. migration agency said internal displacement within Haiti has tripled over the last year and now surpasses 1 million people. The situation has been largely caused by gang violence in the Caribbean country. The new figure provided by the International Organization for Migration represents a record for Haiti. IOM said that 'relentless gang violence' in Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince has fueled a near-doubling of displacement in the city and a collapse of health care and other services and worsening food insecurity. About 200,000 people have been forcibly returned to Haiti over the last year mostly from the Dominican Republic. Voltaire and his transitional government have been tasked with leading the country to general elections, an elusive goal but he is convinced they can make it happen by next November despite powerful gangs that rule 85% of the capital and are gaining ground in surrounding areas. Nevertheless, Voltaire is positive that — if Haiti's multinational police force is boosted with several thousand additional officers — they can go ahead with elections this year. Kenya is leading the multinational police force with a total deployment of more than 600, below the 1,000 officers the country's president pledged. An additional 150 Guatemalans and an advance team of eight Salvadorean troops have also arrived, but the force remains far below its anticipated strength of 2,500 officers. Voltaire said Benin has pledged an additional 2,000 soldiers. 'We have to do a referendum on a new constitution and also the election at the end of November. I say that we can do the elections because we have like eight departments, like 80% of the country. We can do the election.' The power of gangs in Haiti has grown since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Some gangs have even indicated they want to be part of the political process. Voltaire excluded that possibility, 'I don't think they should be around the table.' More than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti last year, according to the United Nations. The number of killings increased by more than 20% compared with all of 2023, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haitian-leader-trump-administration-s-deportation-plans-will-be-catastrophic-/7950530.html	2025-01-25T17:12:36-08:00	
US migrant deportation flights arrive in Latin America	GUATEMALA CITY, GUATEMALA — U.S. military planes carrying dozens of expelled migrants arrived in Guatemala, authorities said Friday, as President Donald Trump moved to crack down on illegal immigration. A total of 265 Guatemalans arrived on three flights — two operated by the military, and one a charter, the Central American country's migration institute said, updating earlier figures. Washington also sent four deportation flights to Mexico on Thursday, the White House press secretary said on X, despite multiple U.S. media reports that authorities there had turned at least one plane back. The Mexican government has not confirmed either the arrival of flights or any agreement to receive a specific number of planes with deportees. But Mexico's foreign ministry said Friday it was ready to work with Washington over the deportation of its citizens, saying the country would 'always accept the arrival of Mexicans to our territory with open arms.' The flights came as the White House said it had arrested more than 1,000 people in two days with hundreds deported by military aircraft, saying that 'the largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway.' Some 538 illegal immigrant 'criminals' were arrested Thursday, it said, followed by another 593 on Friday. By comparison, under Trump's predecessor Joe Biden deportation flights were carried out regularly, with a total of 270,000 deportations in 2024 — a 10-year record — and 113,400 arrests, making an average of 310 per day. 'Bad, hard criminals' The Guatemalan government did not confirm whether any of the migrants arrested this week were among the deportees that arrived Friday. 'These are flights that took place after Trump took office,' an official in the Guatemalan vice president's office told AFP. A Pentagon source told AFP that 'overnight, two DOD (Department of Defense) aircraft conducted repatriation flights from the U.S. to Guatemala.' Early Friday the White House posted an image on X of men in shackles being marched into a military aircraft, with the caption: 'Deportation flights have begun.' Trump told reporters that the flights were to get 'the bad, hard criminals out.' 'Murderers, people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as anybody you've seen,' he said. Friday's deportees were taken to a reception center at an air force base in Guatemala's capital, away from the media. Crackdown a campaign promise Trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigration during the election campaign and began his second term with a flurry of executive actions aimed at overhauling entry to the United States. On his first day in office, he signed orders declaring a 'national emergency' at the southern border and announced the deployment of more troops to the area while vowing to deport 'criminal aliens.' His administration said it would also reinstate a 'Remain in Mexico' policy under which people who apply to enter the United States from Mexico must remain there until their application has been decided. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Friday on X that program had been reinstated, and that Mexico had deployed some 30,000 National Guard troops to its border. The Mexican foreign ministry did not confirm either claim in its statement. The White House has also halted an asylum program for people fleeing authoritarian regimes in Central and South America, leaving thousands of people stranded on the Mexican side of the border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-migrant-deportation-flights-arrive-in-latin-america-/7950341.html	2025-01-25T15:58:54-08:00	
Italy's Meloni defends repatriation of Libyan warlord wanted by ICC	ROME — Italy's prime minister addressed growing criticism Saturday of the repatriation of a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court, as Giorgia Meloni cited an appeals court order and security concerns. The repatriation of Ossama Anjiem to Libya, a key partner in Europe's efforts to keep migrants from crossing the Mediterranean and landing on its shores, sparked outrage from human rights groups and questions from Italy's opposition parties. Meloni said her government will ask the ICC to clarify why it took months to issue the arrest warrant for Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, and why it was issued only after he traveled through at least three European countries. 'Al-Masri was released by an order of Rome's Court of Appeal ... It was not a government choice,' Meloni told journalists during a trip to Saudi Arabia. Italy has close ties to Libya's internationally recognized government in Tripoli and relies on it to patrol its coasts and prevent migrants from leaving. Any trial of al-Masri in The Hague could bring unwanted attention to Italy's migration policies and its support of Libya's coast guard. Al-Masri leads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Deterrence Forces. He was arrested Sunday in Turin, where he reportedly attended the Juventus-Milan soccer match the night before. The ICC warrant, dated the day before his arrest, accused al-Masri of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Mitiga prison, starting in 2015, that are punishable with life in prison. The court said he was accused of murder, torture, rape and sexual violence. The prison holds political dissidents, migrants and others. Human rights groups for years have documented abuses in Libyan detention facilities where migrants are kept. The ICC said the arrest warrant was transmitted to member states Saturday, including Italy, and that the court had told Italy to contact it 'without delay' if it ran into problems cooperating with the warrant. But Rome's court of appeals ordered al-Masri freed Tuesday, citing a 'procedural error' in his arrest. The ruling said Justice Minister Carlo Nordio should have been informed ahead of time since the ministry handles all relations with the ICC. Al-Masri was sent to Libya aboard an aircraft of the Italian secret services. The ICC said it had not been given prior notice of the appeals court's decision, as required, and was 'yet to obtain verification from the authorities on the steps reportedly taken.' Meloni said Italy's government, 'faced with a dangerous individual, decided to expel him immediately and, as it happens in many cases with dangerous prisoners who are repatriated, didn't use a regular flight, also for passengers' safety.' She said Italy will provide all needed clarifications to the ICC. Opposition parties have asked Meloni to urgently explain the 'very serious' development, while calling on the justice minister to resign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-meloni-defends-repatriation-of-libyan-warlord-wanted-by-icc-/7950350.html	2025-01-25T15:49:55-08:00	
Trump restores US participation in two anti-abortion pacts	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump used his executive authority Friday to restore U.S. participation in two international anti-abortion pacts, including one that cuts off U.S. family planning funds for foreign organizations if they provide or promote abortions. Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, which opponents call the 'global gag rule' because they say it silences pro-choice advocates. Established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, it has been rescinded by each Democratic president since then and reinstated when a Republican returns to the White House. Abortion is a divisive issue in U.S. politics and was a major issue in the 2024 campaign won by Trump. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to eliminate a nationwide right to abortion, leaving abortion laws to each of the 50 states. Trump said in his memorandum Friday he was directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to implement the Mexico City Policy 'to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.' Democrats and abortion rights advocates contend the rule disrupts other forms of health care access and blocks nongovernmental organizations abroad from receiving U.S. funds, even if they use their own money on abortion care. Janeen Madan Keller, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, said research showed that the order has led to an increase in unwanted pregnancies and abortions, counter to its intended impact. 'Broadly speaking these decisions are going to really set the United States back in advancing gender equality,' Madan Keller said, in part by limiting the ability of women and girls to complete school and enter the workforce. Rubio also announced Friday the United States was rejoining the Geneva Consensus Declaration, which critics say aims to limit abortion access for millions of women and girls around the world. The declaration was co-sponsored by the United States, Brazil, Uganda, Egypt, Hungary and Indonesia in 2020, when Trump was in office during his first term. It now has more than 35 signatories. The previous Trump administration said the declaration sought better health care for women and the preservation of human life, while also strengthening family as the foundational unit of society and protecting each nation's sovereignty. The State Department said Friday that one of the four objectives of the pact was to 'protect life at all stages.' Trump also issued an executive order related to the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion coverage in the United States, and rescinded two of predecessor Joe Biden's executive orders intending to preserve reproductive health services after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion. 'While this EO (executive order) has no immediate impact, it is an indication of the Trump administration doubling down on denying abortion access to people with low incomes,' the women's health care provider Planned Parenthood said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-restores-us-participation-in-two-anti-abortion-pacts-/7950342.html	2025-01-25T15:43:19-08:00	
Tens of thousands protest Germany's far right as Musk endorses AfD	HALLE, GERMANY — Tens of thousands of Germans rallied Saturday against the far right ahead of next month's legislative elections, as U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk again endorsed the anti-immigrant AfD party. Musk, speaking by video link, told thousands of AfD supporters gathered in the eastern city of Halle that their party was 'the best hope for the future of Germany.' AfD supporters at the rally shouted their approval as party co-leader Alice Weidel looked on smiling. Meanwhile, protesters against the AfD turned out in cities across Germany. The largest gatherings took place in Berlin and Cologne, police revising their turnout figures upward to 35,000 and 40,000 respectively. The protesters in Berlin used their mobile phones to form 'a sea of light for democracy' in front of the Brandenburg Gate, holding letters forming the word 'Resistance.' AfD polling a record AfD is polling at about 20% before Germany's February 23 elections, a record for a party that has shattered a decades-old taboo in post-war Germany against supporting the far right. The mainstream conservative CDU/CSU alliance leads with about 30%, with CDU leader Friedrich Merz the favorite to become chancellor after the elections. Musk, a close associate of U.S. President Donald Trump, told the AfD rally the election was important. 'I think it could decide the entire fate of Europe, maybe the fate of the world,' he said. Musk has rattled European politicians in recent weeks with comments on his social platform X supporting AfD and far-right politicians in other countries, including Britain. Like Trump, the AfD opposes immigration, denies climate change, rails against gender politics, and has declared war on a political establishment and mainstream media it claims limit free speech. Peaceful protests The anti-AfD rallies took place in about 60 towns following calls from a variety of organizations, attracting more people than the police expected. The protests passed peacefully, with banners saying, 'Nazis out' or 'AfD is not an alternative,' a reference to the far-right party's full name 'Alternative for Germany.' The CDU's Merz also came in for criticism. Many protesters fear he is tempted to break his party's policy of refusing to enter into coalition talks with the AfD. There was also a protest in the southern city of Aschaffenbourg, where a deadly knife attack recently by an Afghan migrant further inflamed the debate over immigration. Several thousand also turned out in the eastern city of Halle, where the AfD rally was addressed by Musk, leading to a few incidents. Halle police said they had opened criminal investigations for offenses including assault, insults and disrupting traffic. They said they would also be taking action against 21 people who tried to force a barrier.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-protest-germany-s-far-right-as-musk-endorses-afd-/7950330.html	2025-01-25T15:38:27-08:00	
Trump visits Las Vegas casino to promote his plan to not tax tips	LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — President Donald Trump capped a frenzied first week back in office with a stop in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Saturday to talk about cutting taxes on tips, a 2024 campaign promise he made in the gambling and hospitality hub. Trump took the stage before cheering supporters at the Circa Resort and Casino in front of a large banner reading 'No Tax on Tips' and said economic confidence was soaring in the United States. 'America's decline is over,' he said at the start of his remarks, echoing themes from his inauguration remarks earlier in the week. Since taking office Monday, the new Republican president reversed a myriad of policies put in place by Democratic predecessor Joe Biden and moved to fulfill his vow of remaking and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. In visits Friday to disaster areas in North Carolina and California, Trump pledged federal aid to help those states recover from hurricane and wildfires after floating an idea to shutter the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In Las Vegas, Trump's event was designed to highlight a less controversial pledge to end taxation of income from tips and overtime, a proposal he first made in June as he courted service workers in the presidential swing state of Nevada. The tip-heavy hospitality industry comprises more than a fifth of jobs. 'Can you remember that little statement about tips?' Trump said during one of several inauguration day speeches Monday. 'Anybody remember that little statement? I think we won Nevada because of that statement.' Michael McDonald, Nevada Republican Party chairman, said the idea is attractive to people in the state who are facing high prices for essential goods like food and gas. 'He cares about the no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security. That was something that we brought to the community, and everybody loved it because we're all hurting,' McDonald told local television after welcoming Trump on Friday night. Trump promised to pursue an aggressive agenda of tax cuts if re-elected, which may face some hurdles even in a U.S. Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans. The proposals Trump made on the campaign trail — from extending his 2017 tax cuts to abolishing tax on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits — could add $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trump is pushing a plan to explicitly use revenue from higher tariffs on imported goods to help pay for extending trillions of dollars in tax cuts, an unprecedented shift likely to face opposition from Republican budget hawks concerned about the reliability and durability of tariff revenue. Days before he returned to office, some of his Republican allies in Congress warned that Trump's aggressive tax-cut agenda could fall victim to signs of worry in the bond market. At a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, Republicans in the House of Representatives aired concerns that the estimated $4 trillion cost over the next 10 years of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts could undermine the U.S. government's ability to service its $36 trillion in debt, which is growing at a pace of $2 trillion a year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-visits-las-vegas-casino-to-promote-his-plan-to-not-tax-tips-/7950335.html	2025-01-25T15:10:50-08:00	
Red Cross: Yemen's Houthi rebels freed 153 war detainees	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen's Houthi rebels unilaterally freed 153 war detainees Saturday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said, one of several overtures in recent days to ease tensions after the ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Previous prisoner releases have been viewed as a means to jumpstart talks over permanently ending Yemen's decadelong war, which began when the Houthis seized the country's capital, Sanaa, in 2014. However, the Houthis' release comes just after they detained another seven Yemeni workers from the United Nations, sparking anger from the world body. Those released previously had been visited by Red Cross staff in Sanaa and received medical checks and other assistance, the organization said while announcing the release. The Houthis had signaled Friday night they planned the release of prisoners. The Red Cross said it 'welcomes this unilateral release as another positive step towards reviving negotiations.' 'This operation has brought much-needed relief and joy to families who have been anxiously waiting for the return of their loved ones,' said Christine Cipolla, the ICRC's head of delegation in Yemen. 'We know that many other families are also waiting for their chance to be reunited. We hope that today's release will lead to many more moments like this.' Abdul Qader al-Murtada, the head of the Houthis' Committee for Prisoners' Affairs, said in a statement carried by Houthi media that those released were 'humanitarian cases' that included the sick, wounded and the elderly. 'The goal of the initiative is to build trust and establish a new phase of serious and honest dealing,' al-Murtada reportedly said. The Red Cross has helped oversee other prisoner releases, including one that saw some 1,000 prisoners swapped in 2020, over 800 detainees exchanged in 2023 and another release in 2024. The rebels said earlier this week they would limit their attacks on ships in the Red Sea corridor and released the 25-member crew of the Galaxy Leader, a ship they seized in November 2023, as the first Gaza ceasefire took hold. The war in Yemen has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. The Houthis' attacks on shipping during the Israel-Hamas war have helped deflect attention from their problems at home. But they have faced casualties and damage from U.S.-led airstrikes targeting the group for months now, as well as other strikes by Israel. Meanwhile, Yemen's economy is in tatters, something that's put increasing pressure on the Houthis and others in the conflict to potentially negotiate an end to the war. A de facto ceasefire in the conflict, which drew in a Saudi-led coalition in 2015, has largely held for several years now even during the Houthis attacks over the Israel-Hamas war. Yet the Houthis still conducted the raids that saw seven U.N. workers detained, likely alongside others. The rebels previously detained U.N. staffers, as well as individuals associated with the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen's capital, aid groups and civil society. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres late Friday demanded the immediate and unconditional release of the seven, as well as all other U.N. workers held by the Houthis, some since 2021. 'The continued targeting of U.N. personnel and its partners negatively impacts our ability to assist millions of people in need in Yemen,' he warned in a statement. 'The Houthis must deliver on their previous commitments and act in the best interests of the Yemeni people and the overall efforts to achieve peace in Yemen.' The U.N. has halted work in Yemen, which provides food, medicine and other aid to the impoverished nation. U.S. President Donald Trump separately has moved to reinstate a terrorism designation he made on the group late in his first term that had been revoked by President Joe Biden, potentially setting the stage for new tensions with the rebels. Analysts have linked the newest U.N. detentions as being connected to the decision, though the Houthis themselves have yet to comment on them. The rebels have been airing repeated programs on television channels they control parading people they describe as working with Western intelligence agencies or the Israelis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/red-cross-yemen-s-houthi-rebels-freed-153-war-detainees-/7950328.html	2025-01-25T14:52:47-08:00	
Trump fires independent inspectors general at US agencies	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has fired about 17 independent inspectors general at U.S. government agencies, a sweeping action to remove oversight of his new administration that some members of Congress are suggesting violates federal oversight laws. The dismissals began Friday night and were effective immediately, according to two people familiar with the action. They spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public. Neither confirmed the exact number of firings, but an email sent by one of the fired inspectors general said 'roughly 17' inspectors general had been removed. Congress was not given 30-day notices about the removals — something that even a top Republican is decrying. 'There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so,' Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. 'I'd like further explanation from President Trump. Regardless, the 30-day detailed notice of removal that the law demands was not provided to Congress,' said Grassley, a Republican. The role of the modern-day inspector general dates to post-Watergate Washington, when Congress installed offices inside agencies as an independent check against mismanagement and abuse of power. Though inspectors general are presidential appointees, some serve presidents of both parties. All are expected to be nonpartisan. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham acknowledged that the firings violated statutes but shrugged it off: 'Just tell them you need to follow the law next time,' he said. Democrats and watchdog groups, however, used the dismissals to raise alarm that Trump was making it easier to take advantage of the government. 'Inspectors General are the cops on the beat preventing bad things from happening,' Max Stier, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, said in a statement. 'Their work saves the taxpayer tens of billions of dollars every year.' The White House did not comment Saturday. Trump was in Las Vegas for a speech focused on his campaign promise to end federal taxation on tips. But the moves were consistent with Trump's first week back in the White House, which has featured a series of steps to remake the federal government. He has used executive orders to impose hiring freezes, cracked down on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and suggested he wants to shutter the Federal Emergency Management Agency and leave disaster recovery up to individual states affected by major emergencies. 'Yesterday, in the dark of night, President Trump fired at least 12 independent inspector generals at important federal agencies across the administration,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Saturday on the chamber's floor. 'This is a chilling purge and it's a preview of the lawless approach Donald Trump and his administration are taking far too often as he's becoming president.' The Washington Post, which first reported the firings, said that many were appointees from Trump's first term. Among those inspectors general reportedly removed included those for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense and Education. Spared in this round of dismissals, however, was Michael Horowitz, the longtime Justice Department inspector general who has issued reports on assorted politically explosive criminal investigations over the past decade. In December 2019, for instance, Horowitz released a report faulting the FBI for surveillance warrant applications in the investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. But the report also found that the investigation had been opened for a legitimate purpose and did not find evidence that partisan bias had guided investigative decisions. Horowitz's status aside, the move against the watchdogs drew criticism from congressional Democrats. Still, Trump has aggressively challenged the authority of independent agency watchdog groups in the past. In 2020, he replaced multiple key inspectors general, including those leading the Defense Department and intelligence community, as well as the inspector general tapped to chair a special oversight board for the $2.2 trillion economic relief package on the coronavirus. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called Trump's actions 'a purge of independent watchdogs in the middle of the night.' 'Inspectors general are charged with rooting out government waste, fraud, abuse, and preventing misconduct,' Warren posted on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7950316.html	2025-01-25T14:50:17-08:00

Big Tech wants data centers plugged into power plants; utilities balk	HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA — Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals with power plant owners to plug in directly, avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else. It's raising questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it's fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid. Federal regulators are trying to figure out what to do about it, and quickly. Front and center is the data center that Amazon's cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, is building next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in eastern Pennsylvania. The arrangement between the plant's owners and AWS — called a 'behind the meter' connection — is the first to come before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For now, FERC has rejected a deal that could eventually send 960 megawatts — about 40% of the plant's capacity — to the data center. That's enough to power more than 500,000 homes. That leaves the deal and others that likely would follow in limbo. It's not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on procedural grounds, will take up the matter again or how the change in presidential administrations might affect things. 'The companies, they're very frustrated because they have a business opportunity now that's really big,' said Bill Green, the director of the MIT Energy Initiative. 'And if they're delayed five years in the queue, for example — I don't know if it would be five years, but years anyway — they might completely miss the business opportunity.' Driving demand for energy-hungry data centers The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. That's spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors, and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants. In December, California-based Oklo announced an agreement to provide 12 gigawatts to data center developer Switch from small nuclear reactors powered by nuclear waste. Federal officials say fast development of data centers is vital to the economy and national security, including to keep pace with China in the artificial intelligence race. For AWS, the deal with Susquehanna satisfies its need for reliable power that meets its internal requirements for sources that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, such as coal, oil or gas-fueled plants. Big Tech also wants to stand up their centers fast. But tech's voracious appetite for energy comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels. They can build data centers in a couple years, said Aaron Tinjum of the Data Center Coalition. But in some areas, getting connected to the congested electricity grid can take four years, and sometimes much more, he said. Plugging directly into a power plant would take years off their development timelines. What's in it for power providers In theory, the AWS deal would let Susquehanna sell power for more than they get by selling into the grid. Talen Energy, Susquehanna's majority owner, projected the deal would bring as much as $140 million in electricity sales in 2028, though it didn't disclose exactly how much AWS will pay for the power. The profit potential is one that other nuclear plant operators are embracing after years of financial distress and frustration with how they are paid in the broader electricity markets. Many say they've been forced to compete in some markets flooded with cheap natural gas and state-subsidized solar and wind energy. Power plant owners also say the arrangement benefits the wider public, by bypassing the costly buildout of long power lines and leaving more transmission capacity on the grid for everyone else. FERC's big decision A favorable ruling from FERC could open the door to many more huge data centers and other massive power users like hydrogen plants and bitcoin miners, analysts say. FERC's 2-1 rejection in November was procedural. Recent comments by commissioners suggest they weren't ready to decide how to regulate such a novel matter without more study. In the meantime, the agency is hearing arguments for and against the Susquehanna-AWS deal. Monitoring Analytics, the market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid, wrote in a filing to FERC that the impact would be 'extreme' if the Susquehanna-AWS model were extended to all nuclear power plants in the territory. Energy prices would increase significantly and there's no explanation for how rising demand for power will be met even before big power plants drop out of the supply mix, it said. Separately, two electric utility owners — which make money in deregulated states from building out the grid and delivering power — have protested that the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement amounts to freeloading off a grid that ordinary customers pay to build and maintain. Chicago-based Exelon and Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power say the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement would allow AWS to avoid $140 million a year that it would otherwise owe. Susquehanna's owners say the data center won't be on the grid and question why it should have to pay to maintain it. But critics contend that the power plant itself is benefiting from taxpayer subsidies and ratepayer-subsidized services — and shouldn't be able to strike deals with private customers that could increase costs for others. FERC's decision will have 'massive repercussions for the entire country' because it will set a precedent for how FERC and grid operators will handle the waiting avalanche of similar requests from data center companies and nuclear plants, said Jackson Morris of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Stacey Burbure, a vice president for American Electric Power, told FERC at a hearing in November that it needs to move quickly. 'The timing of this issue is before us,' she said, 'and if we take our typical five years to get this perfect, it will be too late.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/big-tech-wants-data-centers-plugged-into-power-plants-utilities-balk-/7950310.html	2025-01-25T14:10:17-08:00	
9 South African soldiers killed as conflict in eastern Congo escalates	Nine South African soldiers have been killed in eastern Congo's conflict zone, the South African defense department said Saturday, as Congolese troops and peacekeepers battled to stop an advance by Rwanda-backed rebels on the city of Goma. Democratic Republic of Congo and its allies earlier repelled an overnight advance on the provincial capital of over 1 million people, two army sources said. The sound of nearby heavy bombardment rocked the city in the early hours. The three-year M23 insurgency in Democratic Republic of Congo's mineral-rich east has intensified in January with rebels seizing control of more territory than ever before, prompting the United Nations to warn of the risk of a broader regional war. As of Friday, two days of fierce fighting had killed two Southern Africans deployed with the U.N. peacekeeping mission and seven others in the Southern African regional bloc's force in Congo, the South African National Defense Force said in a statement. 'The members put up a brave fight to prevent the rebels from proceeding to Goma as was their intention,' it said, adding that the M23 rebels had been pushed back. The deaths follow an escalation in hostilities that also led to the killing of North Kivu's military governor on the front line this week. The situation appeared calm in Goma on Saturday with people tentatively going about their business amid a heavy police presence, Reuters reporters there said. The Congolese government and army did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the status of the fighting in the area. The United Nations said Saturday it had started temporarily relocating its non-essential staff from Goma due to the deteriorating security situation in the province. Hundreds of thousands flee Congo, the U.N. and others accuse neighboring Rwanda of fueling the conflict with its own troops and weapons. Rwanda denies this, but the surge in fighting has prompted renewed calls for it to disengage. 'Rwanda must cease its support for the M23 and withdraw,' the European Union said in a statement Saturday. The Rwandan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The M23 briefly managed to take over Goma during a previous rebellion in 2012, prompting international donors to cut aid to Rwanda. Even then, the rebels did not hold as much ground as they do now. The insecurity has also deepened eastern provinces' already dire humanitarian situation with 400,000 more people forced to flee their homes this year alone, according to the U.N. refugee agency. 'The situation facing Goma's civilians is becoming increasingly perilous and the humanitarian needs are enormous,' Human Rights Watch said Saturday. The U.N. Security Council is due to meet Monday to discuss the crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-african-soldiers-killed-as-conflict-in-eastern-congo-escalates-/7950302.html	2025-01-25T13:43:45-08:00	
Analysts say China's mistreatment of detained writer, citizen journalist part of crackdown	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Human rights advocates tell VOA that Chinese authorities' mistreatment of detained Chinese Australian writer Yang Hengjun and Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan is part of Beijing's longstanding crackdown on dissent. 'We have known for a long time that the Chinese government ill-treats and tortures people who are in detention,' said Sophie Richardson, co-executive director of U.S.-based Chinese Human Rights Defenders. 'The Chinese government's consistent failure to deny people in detention adequate care and protect them from ill-treatment and torture is the norm. The fact that nobody has ever been held accountable, either domestically or internationally, for these abuses is a significant part of what enables [this trend,]' she told VOA by phone. Yang, a democracy advocate and prominent spy novelist, was tried in a secret trial under espionage charges in 2021 and given a suspended death sentence last February. Zhang, a former lawyer, was released from prison in May 2024 after serving a four-year sentence for reporting on the COVID-19 outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in early 2020. She was arrested again in August 2024 after repeatedly calling for the release of Chinese activist Zhang Pancheng. Yang's family and friends told VOA by phone that the Australian writer, who has been in Chinese detention for six years, has been denied access to food, medical care, and other daily necessities by Chinese authorities since he was transferred from a detention center in June to the Beijing Municipal No. 2 Prison. 'Prison authorities reduced his monthly allowance from 200 yuan [approximately $27.60] to 100 yuan [approximately $13.80] last November, after he could no longer carry out his assigned chores at a factory in prison due to deteriorating eyesight and fatigue caused by a serious flu,' said Feng Chongyi, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Technology Sydney and Yang's former academic adviser. 'He doesn't have enough money to buy food and warm clothes despite his deteriorating health and the sub-zero temperature in Beijing,' Feng told VOA by phone, adding that prison authorities repeatedly have denied Yang's request for medical treatment. Yang said he did not appeal last year's death sentence because of a lack of trust in China's judicial system, and family members urged Chinese authorities to provide 'adequate and supervised medical care' for him. During a monthly consular visit last November, Yang told Australian diplomats that his prison conditions were 'harsh and unbearable,' and he urged Australian authorities to raise concerns about his situation with Chinese authorities. 'The Australian government, including the Australian Ambassador to China Scott Dewar, has repeatedly expressed concerns about Yang's conditions to the Chinese government, but Beijing hasn't responded favorably to issues raised by Canberra,' Feng said, accusing Beijing of 'intentionally torturing' his former student. With no sign of improvement in Yang's condition, the Sydney-based academic urges Australian authorities to prioritize Yang's case and be tougher with their Chinese counterparts. 'The Australian government should prioritize the rights of its citizens when dealing with China, instead of seeking to normalize economic relations with Beijing when its citizens are mistreated in the Chinese prison,' Feng told VOA. Australian authorities repeatedly have raised Yang's case during meetings with their Chinese counterparts. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong called last year's imposition of a suspended death sentence 'appalling.' 'The government advocates for Dr. Yang at every opportunity, at the highest levels, and we will continue to do so,' a spokesperson for Wong told Australian media this week, adding that the efforts include advocating for Yang's access to appropriate medical care. Yang Hengjun holds a doctorate. VOA has contacted the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Australia for comments but did not receive a response at the time of publication. Hunger strike Meanwhile, Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, who was rearrested for public order offenses in August, reportedly has kicked off a new round of hunger strikes at a detention center in Shanghai. According to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, prison authorities have force-fed Zhang through a gastric tube to keep her from becoming malnourished, an act that human rights organizations say constitutes 'torture' under international human rights conventions. This marks the second time Zhang has used a hunger strike to protest her detention. During her four-year prison sentence, which ended in May 2024, Zhang staged a monthslong hunger strike that caused her weight to drop to under 40 kilograms at one point. Teng Biao, a Chinese legal scholar and human rights lawyer based in the United States, expressed concern about Zhang's conditions in detention. 'Normally, Chinese dissidents will face harsher treatments when they are detained for the second or third time, so I'm worried about Zhang's situation in detention,' he told VOA by phone. In his view, Chinese authorities' mistreatment of Yang and Zhang reflects the escalating crackdown on dissidents in China. 'By intensifying the punishment against dissidents, the Chinese government is trying to create an authoritarian environment in which no one can criticize or challenge the authorities,' Teng said. VOA has contacted the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry and Pudong Detention Center for comments. In a previous response to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said China is 'a country ruled by law and liberty is protected and respected' in the country. Human rights advocate Richardson said that since the detention of dissidents has become a norm in China, democratic countries should consider increasing the price that Beijing must pay for committing human rights violations. 'Democratic governments have to be much more muscular in demanding releases and withholding aspects of the relationship that Beijing wants or finding ways to punish Beijing for refusing to release people, especially when their own citizens' lives are on the line,' she told VOA. Richardson emphasized she thinks democratic nations must regroup and discuss different punitive measures, such as international investigations, to stem systematic and widespread human rights violations in the People's Republic of China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-say-china-s-mistreatment-of-detained-writer-citizen-journalist-part-of-crackdown/7950279.html	2025-01-25T13:24:46-08:00	
US Senate confirms Noem as homeland security secretary	WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary Saturday, putting the South Dakota governor in charge of a sprawling agency that is essential to national security and President Donald Trump's plans to clamp down on illegal immigration. Republicans kept the Senate working Saturday to install the latest member of Trump's national security team. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was confirmed in a dramatic tie-breaking vote Friday night, joining Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The Senate will next vote Monday evening on Scott Bessent's confirmation as treasury secretary. Noem, a Trump ally who is in her second term as governor, received some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her nomination earlier in the week. Republicans, who already hold the votes necessary to confirm her, have also expressed confidence in her determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement. 'Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans' top priorities,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican from South Dakota, said Friday. 'And it's going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security. I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.' Democrats are split on how to handle border enforcement and immigration under Trump, with some warming to his hard-line stand. Still, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he would vote against Noem. He pointed to 'bipartisan solutions to fix the mess at our border,' adding that Noem 'seems headed in the wrong direction.' The homeland security secretary oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies, the department is also responsible for securing airline transportation, protecting dignitaries, responding to natural disasters and more. Trump is planning major changes to how the department functions, including involving the military in immigration enforcement and reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those plans could immediately put Noem in the spotlight after the new president visited recent disaster sites in North Carolina and California on Friday. During her Senate hearing, Noem was repeatedly asked by Democratic senators whether she would administer disaster aid to states even if Trump asked her not to. Noem avoided saying she would defy the president, but she told lawmakers, 'I will deliver the programs according to the law and that it will be done with no political bias.' Six people cycled through as homeland security secretary during Trump's first four years in office. Noem, who held her state's lone U.S. House seat for eight years before becoming governor in 2019, has risen in the GOP by tacking closely with Trump. At one point, she was even considered to be his running mate. Her political stock took a momentary dip, however, when she released a book last year containing an account of her killing her hunting dog, as well as a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. If confirmed, she would be tasked with delivering on Trump's favorite issue, border security. The president's goals of deporting millions of people who entered the country illegally could put Noem, with her experience governing a rural state and growing up on a farm, in a difficult position. In South Dakota, many migrants, some in the country without permanent legal status, power the labor-heavy jobs that produce food and housing. She has so far pledged to faithfully execute the president's orders and copied his talk of an 'invasion' at the U.S. border with Mexico. Noem joined other Republican governors who sent National Guard troops to Texas to assist Operation Lone Star, which sought to discourage migrants. Her decision was especially criticized because she accepted a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire to cover some of the deployment cost. Noem said she opted to send National Guard troops 'because of this invasion,' adding that 'it is a war zone down there.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-noem-as-trump-s-homeland-security-secretary-/7950252.html	2025-01-25T12:19:11-08:00	
Trump visits scenes of natural disasters in California, North Carolina		https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-visits-scenes-of-natural-disasters-in-california-north-carolina-/7950249.html	2025-01-25T12:00:44-08:00	
Trump proposes 'getting rid of FEMA' while touring disaster areas	LOS ANGELES — U.S. President Donald Trump surveyed disaster zones in California and North Carolina on Friday and said he was considering 'getting rid of' the Federal Emergency Management Agency, offering the latest sign of how he is weighing sweeping changes to the nation's central organization for responding to disasters. In fire-ravaged California, the state’s Democratic leaders pressed Trump for federal assistance that he’s threatened to hold up, some setting aside their past differences to shower him with praise. Trump, in turn, pressured local officials to waive permitting requirements so people can immediately rebuild, pledging that federal permits would be granted promptly. Instead of having federal financial assistance flow through FEMA, the Republican president said Washington could provide money directly to the states. He made the comments while visiting North Carolina, which is still recovering months after Hurricane Helene, on the first trip of his second term. 'FEMA has been a very big disappointment,' the Republican president said. 'It’s very bureaucratic. And it’s very slow.' Trump was greeted in California by Governor Gavin Newsom, a Trump critic whom the president frequently disparages. The duo chatted amiably and gestured toward cooperation despite their history. 'We’re going to need your support. We’re going to need your help,' Newsom told Trump. 'You were there for us during COVID. I don’t forget that, and I have all the expectations we’ll be able to work together to get a speedy recovery.' Newsom has praised Trump before when looking for help from the federal government. In the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, he called Trump 'thoughtful' and 'collaborative.' Trump flew over several devastated neighborhoods in Marine One, the presidential helicopter, before landing in Pacific Palisades, a hard-hit community that’s home to some of Southern California’s rich and famous. Accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, he walked a street where all the houses have burned, chatting with residents and police officers. It takes seeing the damage firsthand to grasp its enormity, Trump said after. The fires, which continue to burn, could end up being the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. 'It is devastation. It really is an incineration,' Trump said. Trump’s brief but friendly interaction with Newsom belied the confrontational stance he signaled toward California earlier in the day. Even on the plane en route to Los Angeles, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was using Trump’s disparaging nickname for the governor, 'Newscum,' and telling reporters, 'He has wronged the people of his state' and saying Trump was visiting to pressure Newsom and other officials 'to do right by their citizens.' Trump said Los Angeles residents who lost their homes should be able to get back onto their properties immediately to clear them, adding several told him it will be months before they can rebuild. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said residents should be able to return home within the week, but keeping people safe from hazardous materials is a top priority. She said the city was easing the process to get permits, but she was repeatedly interrupted by Trump as she tried to explain the city's efforts. He downplayed the concerns about toxins, saying: 'What's hazardous waste? We're going to have to define that.' Trump has a long history of minimizing the risks of asbestos. In his 1997 book, The Art of the Comeback, Trump called asbestos 'the greatest fireproofing material ever used' and '100% safe, once applied,' and claimed the movement against the insulator was led by the mob, 'because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal.' Before flying to California, Trump reiterated that he wants to extract concessions from the Democratic-led state in return for disaster assistance, including changes to water policies and requirements that voters need to show identification when casting ballots. Beyond Trump’s criticism of FEMA, he’s suggested limiting the federal government’s role in responding to disasters, echoing comments from conservative allies who have proposed reducing funding and responsibility. 'I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,' he said in North Carolina. 'Let the state take care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes and all of the other things that happen.' Trump said Michael Whatley, a North Carolina native and chair of the Republican National Committee, would help coordinate recovery efforts in the state, where frustrations over the federal response have lingered. Although Whatley does not hold an official government position, Trump said he would be 'very much in charge.' FEMA helps respond to disasters when local leaders request a presidential emergency declaration, a signal that the damage is beyond the state's ability to handle on its own. FEMA can reimburse governments for recovery efforts such as debris removal, and it gives stopgap financial assistance to individual residents. Trump has criticized former President Joe Biden for his administration’s response to Helene in North Carolina. As he left the White House on Friday morning, he told reporters that 'it’s been a horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester' since the storm hit in September, and 'we’re going to get it fixed up. In a small town in western North Carolina, residents told Trump about wading through waist-deep water to escape from their homes while fearing for their lives. Some have battled with insurance companies to get their losses covered. 'We’ve come to North Carolina with a simple message,' Trump said. 'You are not forgotten any longer. You were treated very badly by the previous administration.' FEMA has distributed $319 million in financial assistance to residents, but that hasn't alleviated the feeling of abandonment among residents who are struggling to rebuild their lives. Michael A. Coen Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Biden administration, said Trump was 'misinformed' about an agency that provides critical help to states when they are overwhelmed by catastrophe. In addition, Coen criticized the idea of attaching strings to assistance. 'I think the American people expect the federal government will be there for them on their worst day, no matter where they live,' he said. Trump tapped Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL with limited experience managing natural disasters, as FEMA’s acting director.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-proposes-getting-rid-of-fema-while-touring-disaster-areas/7950242.html	2025-01-25T10:58:52-08:00	
What South Asian nations expect from Trump	WASHINGTON — As U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term gets underway, the contours of his administration's South Asia policy are taking shape: India stands front and center, while other regional countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan prepare to be sidelined. 'With the exception of India, which is a large but special case, the other countries in South Asia, I think, are positioning themselves for somewhat less attention from Washington, somewhat less predictability, and somewhat more bilateral engagement operating through multilateral organizations or multilateral channels,' said Joshua White, a former director for South Asian Affairs at the National Security Council who is now a professor at Johns Hopkins SAIS. India While the Biden administration worked closely with India on a range of issues, including defense and technology, Indian officials see Trump’s return to office as an opportunity for expanded cooperation. Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's warm relationship, forged during Trump’s first term, promises a deeper relationship, officials and experts say. In October, Trump called Modi 'a great friend' and 'the nicest human being.' Modi reciprocated in his congratulatory message, calling Trump a 'dear friend' and pledging to work 'closely together once again.' Beyond the rapport the two leaders share, India, South Asia’s largest country, is a strategic U.S. ally and a counterweight to China’s expanding influence in Asia. The U.S. is also India’s second-largest trading partner, after China. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz, both China hawks and staunch India proponents, are expected to push for deeper bilateral engagement with New Delhi. Underlying India’s importance, Rubio had his first bilateral meeting with S. Jaishankar, India’s minister of external affairs. 'There was a very visible appetite to get this relationship moving, to do more, to raise the bar, to set bigger goals,' Jaishankar said. An early focus in the U.S.-India relationship is mass deportation of undocumented Indian immigrants. India has identified 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants for repatriation to India, Bloomberg news reported this week, showing support for a Trump administration priority. There are nearly 800,000 undocumented Indians living in the U.S., including tens of thousands who illegally entered the country under the Biden administration. Jaishankar said India is opposed to illegal migration and open to the return of migrants in the U.S. illegally. Yet challenges remain in the relationship. Visa delays experienced by Indian citizens 'constrain the people-to-people interactions,' he said. Moreover, the Trump administration's pivot to other geopolitical issues, from the war in Ukraine to the relationship with China, could overshadow relations with India, experts say. 'If they have anything significant to be anxious about, apart from the immigration questions, it will be that this administration will not be as attentive to South Asia as the last administration was,' White said. Pakistan Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif used an optimistic tone on Trump’s inauguration day, pledging to work with the new president to strengthen the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. 'Over the years, our two great countries have worked together closely to pursue peace and prosperity in the region and beyond for our peoples & we shall continue to do so in the future. My best wishes to President Trump for a successful second term in office,' Sharif wrote on X Monday. To engage with the new administration, Islamabad dispatched Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Washington to meet with members of Trump’s foreign policy team as well as congressional leaders, Dawn, a leading Pakistani newspaper, reported Friday. Yet U.S.-Pakistan ties remain strained. Early in his first term, Trump suspended most security aid to Pakistan, accusing it of harboring terrorism, before gradually resuming cooperation as his administration began to negotiate an agreement with Afghanistan’s Taliban. Complicating the prospects for improved ties between Washington and Islamabad, former Prime Minister Imran Khan remains in prison, with many members of Congress and some Trump advisers calling for his release. Alluding to those calls, a Pakistani foreign office spokesperson cautioned Thursday against interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs, even as he reiterated hopes for expanded bilateral ties. 'This is part of the principles on which interstate relations are shaped,' the spokesperson, Shafqat Ali Khan, said, according to Dawn. Zamir Akram, a former Pakistan ambassador, noted that Washington tends to view Islamabad through its strategic alliance with China and tensions with India. 'So, this is a difficult environment that we’ll face,' Akram said on a podcast hosted by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute. Bangladesh Bangladesh presents another complex case in the Trump administration's South Asia policy formulation. Following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster last August, the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, received a wide range of support from the Biden administration. That support is now on the chopping block. Yunus, who has been critical of Trump in the past, nonetheless voiced cautious optimism about bilateral cooperation with the new U.S. administration. In his congratulatory message to Trump, Yunus 'expressed firm belief that both nations would work together to explore new avenues of cooperation,' according to the Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry. The country’s two leading parties — the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League — urged continued U.S. support for Bangladeshi democracy and development. 'As a democratic country, I expect America and other democratic nations to support and cooperate in favor of democracy,' BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told VOA. 'I believe the United States will assist in fostering democracy and development in our country.' But Mohammad A. Arafat, a member of the Awami League's central executive committee and a former state minister, criticized the Biden administration’s policy and urged a change in course. 'Unlike the Biden administration, which showed unwavering support for individuals like Dr. Yunus despite allegations of corruption, the Trump administration adopts a noninterventionist approach, refraining from interfering in other countries' internal affairs,' Arafat told VOA. VOA’s Bangla Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-south-asian-nations-expect-from-trump/7950216.html	2025-01-25T10:39:20-08:00	
Taliban conditionally agree to allow Afghan girls to study in Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Taliban authorities in Afghanistan reportedly have agreed to allow female students to pursue higher education in Pakistan, provided that their male guardians also are granted visas to accompany them, according to officials privy to the understanding. The revelation comes as hundreds of Afghan students took entrance examinations on Saturday to secure admission to graduate, postgraduate and Ph.D. programs in Pakistani universities. Officials reported that Afghan refugees living in Pakistan attended designated centers in the cities of Peshawar and Quetta to take their exams, while students in Afghanistan are scheduled to participate online over the next few days. Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan's special envoy for Afghanistan, announced in the lead-up to the tests that nearly 21,000 Afghan candidates, including more than 5,000 females, had submitted their applications for the upcoming summer academic sessions. His office reported 'a significant turnout' of Afghan students at the designated test centers on Saturday but did not provide specific numbers. The Higher Education Commission of Pakistan is conducting entrance tests to select up to 2,000 Afghan students, with one-third of the selected candidates being female. Pakistan expressed its 'profound gratitude' to the Kabul government 'for agreeing to allow successful female candidates to pursue their education, provided that their mahrams [chaperones] are granted visas to accompany them,' said a government official in Islamabad, requesting anonymity due to a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly with the media. The official stated that visas would be issued to chaperones 'to allow them to accompany female students, as mandated by Afghan law,' to study in Pakistani institutions. The Taliban did not immediately comment on Pakistani assertions that they would let Afghan girls pursue higher education in the neighboring country. Pakistan offers fully funded scholarships to thousands of students from its war-ravaged, poverty-stricken neighbor. The program for female students was halted, however, after the hardline Taliban regained power in 2021 and banned girls’ education past the sixth grade. They also prohibited Afghan women from traveling or flying without a chaperone. The Higher Education Commission website states that the scholarship program is designed to foster stronger ties with Afghanistan by providing high-quality education to Afghan students in diverse fields, including medicine, engineering, agriculture, management and computer science. The entrance examinations for Afghan students come amid bilateral tensions that have escalated lately over allegations that anti-Pakistan armed groups are using Afghan territory to launch cross-border terrorist attacks. The Taliban deny claims of allowing or sheltering foreign militants that threaten neighboring countries. After assuming office last month, Sadiq visited Afghanistan, where he held extensive talks with Taliban leaders on ways to stabilize bilateral political, security and trade cooperation. He described his meetings with de facto Afghan officials as productive but did not elaborate. The envoy, while addressing a gathering of Afghan and Pakistani civil society and trade representatives in Islamabad this week, said the two countries are collaborating closely to reduce tensions and enhance economic ties and trade. In addition, he said they are trying to strengthen people-to-people connections through cooperation in education and other sectors. Since sweeping back to power 3½ years ago, the Taliban have instituted sweeping restrictions on Afghan women, barring most of them from seeking public and private sector employment and requiring they cover their faces in public. The United Nations has labeled the curbs as 'gender apartheid' and persistently demanded their reversal. The Taliban defend their governance as being in line with Islamic law, or Sharia, and Afghan culture, rejecting criticism and calls for reversing their policies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-conditionally-agree-to-allow-afghan-girls-to-study-in-pakistan/7950142.html	2025-01-25T08:23:14-08:00	
How the oldest known Hebrew book landed in a Washington museum	In 2016, Herschel Hepler was browsing Google Images to practice his paleography — the study of historical writing systems — when he stumbled upon an eerily familiar photo that would lead to a groundbreaking discovery. 'I recognized it immediately and said, 'That’s a manuscript in our collection,'' Hepler, a curator at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, recalls. The museum had recently acquired the manuscript — a rare Jewish prayer book — believing it to be part of the famous Cairo Geniza, a trove of ancient Jewish documents uncovered in a Cairo synagogue in the late 19th century. But the black and white picture in Tablet magazine described the manuscript as a '16th to 17th century Hebrew book of Psalms, said to be from the Bamiyan area' of central Afghanistan. Stunned by the revelation, Hepler set out to verify it. Tracking down the author of the Tablet article, British historian and archaeologist Jonathan Lee, Hepler confirmed that Lee had in fact found the book in an Afghan warlord’s possession in 1998 and photographed the cover and two inside pages. 'Without Jonathan’s documentation from his trip to Bamiyan in 1998, we would still be assuming this is probably from the Cairo Geniza,' Hepler said. But if Hepler was surprised to learn about the book's origin in the remote mountains of Afghanistan, Lee was equally stunned when Hepler revealed that the manuscript had been carbon-dated to the 8th century. 'At that point, I realized that the discovery was of major importance,' Lee said via email. Recognizing their combined expertise — Hepler in Hebrew manuscripts and Lee in Afghan history — the duo joined forces and invited in other experts. Their yearslong research not only established the manuscript as the oldest-known Hebrew book but also unearthed evidence that Jews had lived in Afghanistan — and along the ancient Silk Roads — for longer than historians previously believed. But the thrill of discovery was dampened by the realization that the manuscript had probably been smuggled out of war-torn Afghanistan and bought on the antiquities market. At the time, the museum, founded by the Green family, owners of the Hobby Lobby arts and craft company, was still reeling from its acquisition of artifacts smuggled from Iraq and Egypt. The museum faced a significant challenge: Before it could showcase it to the world, it needed to legitimize its ownership of the manuscript. This required years of delicate negotiations with New York’s small Afghan Jewish community and an Afghan government teetering on the brink of collapse. The stakes were high, and the path to secure the manuscript’s rightful place in the museum would prove be too complex and demanding. Lee’s discovery Lee, who has spent the better part of the last five decades researching and writing about Afghan history and archaeology, discovered the book by chance. In April 1998, he was guiding a Japanese TV crew in Bamiyan and was on the lookout for a Bactrian language inscription and gold coins looted from an ancient Buddhist shrine. At the time, the Bamiyan Valley, with its famed Buddha statues still standing, was controlled by a local Shiite insurgent group, while the Taliban ruled most of the rest of the country. The anti-Taliban group’s leader, Karim Khalili, kept a collection of antiquities, among them the cache of gold coins Lee had been looking for. Lee photographed them. 'Then, his [Khalili’s] advisers brought in a miscellaneous collection of other antiquities that included the ALQ,' Lee said, using the acronym for the 'Afghan Liturgical Quire,' the Hebrew book in the Bible Museum’s collection. A local man affiliated with the Shiite insurgent group had found the book under a collapsed roof in a cave the prior year and given it to Khalili. Unversed in Hebrew, Khalili apparently showed the book to other foreigners visiting Bamiyan, trying to figure out what it was. 'I was told it had been found in Bamiyan, but then everything is found in Bamiyan,' Lee said. As Lee recalls, the pocket-size book looked remarkably well-preserved for its age. 'The cover was somewhat bent, damaged and watermarked, but the folios were relatively well-preserved, and most of the texts readable,' he said. To Lee, that suggested the manuscript was 'not that old.' He left Afghanistan and for years didn’t give it much thought. How and when the manuscript left Afghanistan remains unknown. The 1990s were a dark period for Afghanistan’s rich cultural heritage. As armed groups fought over territory, their men — often directed by their commanders and guided by traffickers — plundered the country’s vast archaeological sites and ransacked its museums. Seventy percent of the national museum’s treasures vanished, according to one estimate, many ending up in private collections and some reputable institutions. 'There is a long history of illicit export of antiquities from the country that goes back for decades but ultimately back to colonial times,' said Cecilia Palombo, a University of Chicago professor who has researched the plunder of Afghan antiquities. A leading researcher with extensive experience in Afghanistan said the manuscript was likely taken out of the country after the Taliban overran Bamiyan in late 1998. The researcher spoke on condition of anonymity. Research by the Bible museum found that an unnamed Khalili deputy made multiple sales attempts in the United States and Europe between 1998 and 2001 before 'apparently' offloading it to a private collector in London in fall 2001. The collector kept it for a decade or more before Hobby Lobby bought it in 2013 and donated it to the museum. The office of Khalili, who later served as a vice president, declined a VOA interview request. The Tablet article Although Lee had found the book in Afghanistan, he didn’t know how significant it was. On returning to England, he showed his photographs to a Hebrew specialist, who thought it was from the 16th or 17th century. Then, after a cache of ancient documents dubbed the 'Afghan Geniza' surfaced on the international art market, Lee decided to publish his photograph, along with an article about Afghan Jewish history. Citing the book as an example of 'Jewish material [turning up] occasionally' in Afghanistan, he wrote that the 'whereabouts of this manuscript is now unknown.' He would find out four years later. That's when, 'out of the blue,' Hepler contacted him via LinkedIn and told him the manuscript was not the Book of Psalms but a prayer book, comprising Sabbath prayers, poetry and a partial Haggadah, the Jewish text recited at the Passover seder. The Green family bought the book from an Israeli antiquities dealer in 2013 during a buying spree of ancient artifacts. Some of these items were later returned after it was discovered they had been illegally taken out of Iraq and Egypt. The Afghan Liturgical Quire came with a forged provenance of its own, tracing the manuscript to collectors in London in the 1950s, masking any ties to Afghanistan. With Lee’s documentation, the museum was able to correct its provenance. The museum had initially thought the book was from the 9th century, but a second carbon-dating test performed in 2019 showed it dates to the 8th century, making it two centuries older than the previous oldest-known Hebrew book in the world. The discovery electrified experts. For Hebrew scholars, the discovery offered the earliest evidence of a bound Hebrew book. For Afghanistan specialists, it highlighted 'how significant this region was in respect of the history of the Middle East, Inner Asia and Northern India, and Afghanistan's ancient connectivity with cultures and religious traditions,' Lee said. Yet the realization that it had been smuggled out of Afghanistan cast a cloud over its legitimacy. Afghan laws and the 1970 UNESCO Convention make it illegal to export cultural artifacts and heritage items without government approval. To legitimize its custody of the manuscript, the museum adopted what it calls a 'human rights-based approach' to cultural heritage. Invoking the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the museum argued that the Afghan people and Afghan Jews living in New York have a right to access the manuscript. 'One of the things this project is focused on is on access — so, access to the Afghan Jewish community, access to the people of Afghanistan,' Hepler said. To get the backing of both stakeholders, the museum initiated discussions with officials of the former Afghan government and members of the Jewish community in New York. These efforts culminated in the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2021 with the Afghan embassy in Washington before the Taliban takeover, ensuring the document would be held in custodianship. The Afghan ambassador at the time, Roya Rahmani, did not respond to a request for an interview. Another former Afghan ambassador wrote a letter of support for the project. Jack Abraham, head of the Afghan Jewish Federation who was born in Afghanistan, said his group offered its full support for keeping the manuscript in the United States. 'I told [Hepler], ‘What you have in your hands is our heritage. It belongs to us. It could be any of our forefathers,’' Abraham said. But some Afghans see it as equally part of their heritage. 'This is the property of Afghanistan and must be returned to Afghanistan,' a senior former government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Barnett Rubin, a leading Afghanistan scholar and an advisor on the ALQ project, said both communities can legitimately lay claim to the book. 'The museum wanted to have the approval of any one of the two main entities that might have a claim on it to their custody of it,' Rubin said. With a custodianship agreement secured, the museum launched an exhibit in September, celebrating the project as an interfaith collaboration among Jews, Christians and Muslims. A second exhibit is planned for New York starting this month. While the Bible Museum technically owns the manuscript, Hepler said Afghanistan and the Afghan Jewish community 'have a lot of agency in this custodianship.' To that end, the museum plans to provide one high-quality replica to the Jewish community and three to major cultural institutions in Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-the-oldest-known-hebrew-book-landed-in-a-washington-museum/7949998.html	2025-01-25T06:47:15-08:00	
China’s support for Myanmar regime backfires; scam syndicates thrive	WASHINGTON — Reports of Chinese citizens trafficked into scam centers along the Thai-Myanmar border are prompting renewed questions about Beijing’s reliance on Myanmar’s military regime to tackle transnational crime. Analysts warn China’s strategy in Myanmar leaves citizens vulnerable while potentially bolstering criminal networks in the conflict-ridden Southeast Asia country. Recent high-profile abduction cases have sparked outrage among the Chinese public, including the reported luring of Chinese actor Wang Xing to Myawaddy, a Thai-Myanmar border town, by scammers posing as film producers. Chinese embassies in Myanmar and Thailand have warned citizens about high-paying job offers that often lead to forced labor. Thai officials reported that actor Wang Xing was trafficked into a scam syndicate operating in areas controlled by an ally of Myanmar’s military, the Karen Border Guard Force, or BGF. Speaking to local media, Brigadier General Saw Maung Win of the BGF Battalion 3 confirmed that the BGF had handed Chinese actor Wang Xing over to Thai authorities but denied involvement in the trafficking, claiming only to have assisted in the rescue operation. 'These incidents involving Chinese citizens trafficked to Myawaddy are handled cautiously by Chinese authorities,' said Hla Kyaw Zaw, a China-Myanmar analyst. 'But when action is required, China tends to pressure Thailand rather than directly addressing the situation in Myanmar.' Jason Tower of the United States Institute of Peace echoed similar concerns. 'China’s support for the Myanmar military comes at great cost to its own population,' Tower said, referencing a publicly available database with close to 2,000 names of people across China who have gone missing in Myanmar in recent years. Subsequently, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Southeast Asian nations to take decisive action against online gambling and telecom fraud, emphasizing the need for 'relevant' countries to fulfill their responsibilities without explicitly naming Myanmar. At a meeting with ASEAN envoys on Jan. 16, he highlighted the growing threat these crimes pose, particularly along the Thai-Myanmar border, which has endangered citizens of China and other countries. Chinese and Thai police have jointly arrested 12 suspects connected to trafficking, with investigations ongoing and efforts underway to apprehend more suspects. On Friday, China's Ministry of Public Security said it was 'making every effort' to crack down on the scam compounds and 'rescue trafficked people.' China’s ‘carrot’ approach Tower said that China appears to favor a 'carrot' approach in its dealings with Myanmar’s military. In 2024, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security awarded its highest honor, the Golden Great Wall Commemorative Medal, to Myanmar’s home affairs minister, Lieutenant General Yar Pyae, for joint efforts against transnational crime. However, analysts argue that despite China’s support, Myanmar’s military focuses on territorial battles rather than combating scam operations. According to Tower, Myanmar’s military lacks the capacity and the political will to address these syndicates effectively because the Myanmar military must rely on militia leader Saw Chit Thu to maintain control over Myawaddy, a crucial trade hub. Saw Chit Thu, the leader of the BGF, has been sanctioned by the United States, United Kingdom and European Union for his role in protecting Chinese gangs and scam operations. Scam networks reshuffle China’s aggressive crackdowns on scam networks along its northern border with Myanmar in recent years have pushed many scam operations to relocate to Myawaddy, Karen State, far from Beijing’s immediate oversight. Unlike northern Myanmar, where China has exerted direct pressure, Myawaddy’s geographical distance and political dynamics pose unique challenges to Beijing. Hla Kyaw Zaw said that China has seen some success in cracking down on online scams near its borders, but these efforts are largely localized. The measures have been less effective in other areas, such as Myawaddy, and scams continue to thrive. 'China closely monitors illegal activities in and around Myawaddy but depends on Thailand’s cooperation to address these issues,' Hla Kyaw Zaw said. In response to VOA's inquiries regarding scam operations, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar highlighted recent joint combat efforts by China and Myanmar against online scam operations. According to the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar’s announcement on Tuesday, China will soon launch the second phase of its 'Jingyao Joint Law Enforcement Operation' initiative, a multinational effort with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam to combat telecom fraud and transnational crime, following a first phase that resulted in over 70,000 arrests regionally and the rescue of 160 victims, mainly from northern Myanmar along the China border. Social media uproar Chinese actor Wang’s abduction sparked outrage on Chinese social media platforms, along with a growing database of families whose relatives have disappeared under similar circumstances. A joint letter from the families of 174 people believed to be trapped in Myanmar went viral on China’s social media platform, Sina Weibo, on Jan. 9. A political and strategic dilemma As scam networks grow more sophisticated, analysts say Beijing faces a challenging balancing act between protecting its citizens and maintaining its strategic interests in Myanmar. Experts such as Tower are urging Beijing to reassess its priorities. 'China’s strategy is failing,' Tower argued. 'The reality is, as you can see, how easily Chinese [civilians] are still trafficked into the Myanmar military Border Guard Force territory,' he said. 'It’s not able to deal with these problems with the military.' However, balancing crackdowns without destabilizing the Myanmar regime presents a challenge. 'China seems to be losing on both fronts,' Tower said. 'This is a really tricky issue. On one hand, China doesn’t want the Myanmar military regime to collapse. And it recognizes that if it goes back to using that stick, it’s going to speed up the collapse of the Myanmar military.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-support-for-myanmar-regime-backfires-scam-syndicates-thrive/7950028.html	2025-01-25T06:04:38-08:00	
Moldovan president visits Kyiv to talk energy, security	KYIV, UKRAINE — Moldovan President Maia Sandu visited Kyiv on Saturday for talks with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid growing tensions in Transnistria, a pro-Russian separatist enclave of Moldova that neighbors Ukraine. The territory, which has a population of half a million, has seen heating, hot water and electricity cut-offs since the start of the year because a Kyiv-Moscow gas transit contract that had allowed Russian gas to flow there has expired. 'We'll discuss security, energy, infrastructure, trade and mutual support on the EU path,' Sandu wrote on X as she arrived in the Ukrainian capital. There was a demonstration in Transnistria on Friday to call on Moldova to facilitate the transit of Russian gas and end the energy crisis, local media reported. Transnistria used to receive gas from Russia via a pipeline that crossed Ukraine and Moldova. Kyiv has refused to renew the transit contract, which expired on Jan. 1, abruptly ending Russian gas supplies to Transnistria, which has declared a state of emergency. The rest of Moldova has been spared gas cuts thanks to gas and electricity imports from neighboring Romania. With Ukraine's struggle against a Russian invasion nearly in its fourth year, Moldova is afraid the conflict could expand onto its territory in case of Russian attempts to destabilize Transnistria. In an interview with AFP, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean on Wednesday accused Moscow of trying to generate 'instability' in Moldova. He said the crisis could only be resolved if Russian troops stationed in Transnistria since a war against Moldova in 1992 are pulled out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovan-president-visits-kyiv-to-talk-energy-security/7949962.html	2025-01-25T03:30:55-08:00	
UN chief says 7 more workers detained by Houthi rebels in Yemen	SANAA, YEMEN — Yemen's Houthi rebels have detained another seven UN employees, the United Nations chief said on Friday, their latest move to target aid workers. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the 'immediate and unconditional' release of all aid staff held in Yemen, which is suffering one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. 'Their continued arbitrary detention is unacceptable,' Guterres said in a statement, adding that the United Nations was working to secure the release of those being held. The Iran-backed Houthis have detained dozens of staff from U.N. and other humanitarian organizations, most of them since the middle of last year. Guterres said the 'continued targeting of UN personnel and its partners negatively impacts our ability to assist millions of people in need in Yemen.' Reeling from a decade of war, Yemen is mired in a humanitarian catastrophe with more than 18 million people needing assistance and protection, according to the United Nations. Following the latest detentions, the United Nations has suspended 'all official movements into and within' areas held by Houthis, the office of the resident U.N. coordinator for Yemen said. The detentions come after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the Houthis placed back on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. Relisting the Houthis will trigger a review of U.N. agencies and other nongovernmental organizations working in Yemen that receive U.S. funding, according to the executive order signed on Wednesday. Mohammed al-Basha of the Basha Report, a U.S.-based risk advisor, called the latest detentions 'an expected reaction' to the 'terrorist' designation. 'They assume that by detaining U.N. staff they're going to be able to pressure the international community to pressure the Trump administration,' he said. No immediate comment was available from the Houthis, who seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and rule large parts of the impoverished country. The rebels, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, have been attacking the Red Sea shipping route and firing on Israel since the outbreak of the Gaza war, prompting reprisal strikes from U.S., Israeli and British forces. With a Gaza ceasefire starting last Sunday, the Houthis have made conciliatory moves, including releasing the 25-strong international crew of the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship they seized in the Red Sea in November 2023. The rebels have also promised to tone down the Red Sea attacks and have said they would stop targeting Israel if it sticks to the ceasefire. The Houthis have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015, although hostilities have fallen sharply since a U.N.-brokered ceasefire in 2022. Since the start of the war, the Houthis have kidnapped, arbitrarily detained and tortured hundreds of civilians, including U.N. and NGO workers, according to rights groups. In June, the rebels detained 13 U.N. personnel, including six employees of the Human Rights Office, and more than 50 NGO staff plus an embassy staff member. They claimed they had arrested 'an American-Israeli spy network' operating under the cover of humanitarian organizations — allegations emphatically rejected by the U.N. Human Rights Office. Two other U.N. human rights staff had already been detained since November 2021 and August 2023, respectively. In early August, the Houthis stormed the UNHCR office, forced staff to hand over the keys, and seized documents and property, before returning it later that month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-says-7-more-workers-detained-by-houthi-rebels-in-yemen/7949954.html	2025-01-25T03:05:38-08:00	
Drone attack on hospital in Sudan's Darfur kills 30, source says	PORT SUDAN, SUDAN — A drone attack on one of the last functioning hospitals in El-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region killed 30 people and injured dozens, a medical source said Saturday. The bombing of the Saudi Hospital on Friday evening 'led to the destruction' of the hospital's building where emergency cases were treated, the source told AFP, requesting anonymity for fear of retaliation. It was not immediately clear which of Sudan's warring sides had launched the attack. Since April 2023, the Sudanese army has been at war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, who have seized nearly the entire vast western region of Darfur. They have besieged El-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, since May, but have not managed to claim the city, where army-aligned militias have repeatedly pushed them back. According to the medical source, the same building had been hit by an RSF drone 'a few weeks ago.' Attacks on health care have been rampant in El-Fasher, where medical charity Doctors Without Borders said this month the Saudi Hospital was 'the only public hospital with surgical capacity still standing.' Across the country, up to 80% of health care facilities have been forced out of service, according to official figures. The war has so far killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and brought millions to the brink of mass starvation. In the area around El-Fasher, famine has already taken hold in three displacement camps -- Zamzam, Abu Shouk and Al-Salam -- and is expected to expand to five more areas including the city itself by May, according to a U.N.-backed assessment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drone-attack-on-hospital-in-sudan-s-darfur-kills-30-source-says/7949955.html	2025-01-25T03:01:39-08:00	
Hamas set to release hostages in next exchange for prisoners held by Israel	Hamas was set Saturday to release four Israeli women held as hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in the second swap under the ceasefire deal in Gaza. The four women are Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag, Hamas said Friday. All four women are Israeli soldiers who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that it had received the list via mediators and that its response would be provided later. The exchange is expected to begin on Saturday afternoon. On Jan. 19, the first day of the ceasefire, Hamas released three Israeli women in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners. In the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as well as increased humanitarian aid and a withdrawal of the Israeli military from some parts of Gaza. The Israel-Hamas war began with the Hamas attack on Israel in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. Israel’s response has also displaced the majority of the territory’s population and destroyed most of the enclave. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Ahead of the Saturday exchange, the United Nations Human Rights Office warned on Friday that increased violence in the occupied West Bank could threaten the ceasefire in Gaza. Since Tuesday, Israeli operations in the West Bank have killed at least 12 Palestinians and injured 40 others, 'most of them reportedly unarmed,' United Nations Human Rights office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said. 'It is very concerning that what’s happening today in the West Bank may have an impact on the ceasefire in Gaza. It is imperative that the cease-fire in Gaza holds,' he said. Hundreds of Jenin residents fled their homes as the Israeli military destroyed several houses on the third day of a major operation in the West Bank city on Thursday. Israeli officials said the Jenin operation was aimed at what the military said were Iranian-backed militant groups in the refugee camp next to the city, which has been a hub for armed Palestinian groups for years. 'We are also concerned by repeated comments from some Israeli officials about plans to expand settlements further still and a fresh breach of international law,' Al-Kheetan said. 'We recall again that the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population into territories it occupies also amounts to a war crime.' Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the center of an independent state, since the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries view the Jewish settlements that Israel has built there as illegal, but Israel cites historical and Biblical ties to the land. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-set-to-release-hostages-in-next-exchange-for-prisoners-held-by-israel/7949930.html	2025-01-25T01:18:24-08:00	
Buoyed by Trump's promises, Uzbeks seek closer ties to US	TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN/WASHINGTON — Uzbekistan is expected to push to deepen relations with the United States in the coming year, a position that is broadly popular among Uzbeks across the country, VOA found during a recent reporting trip. With more than 37 million people, Uzbekistan, Washington's strategic partner in Central Asia, accounts for more than half of the population of the region, which includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. 'I understand that the U.S. prefers dealing with us in the C5+1 format — five republics plus Uncle Sam — but we want more bilateral attention, at least for now,' said Sherbek Artikov, a young Uzbek hoping to study political science in America. Artikov is aware that many of his fellow Uzbeks are often denied U.S. visas and that hundreds of them have been deported since 2019 as undocumented immigrants. Yet, he remains optimistic: 'I believe over time, Washington will see that Uzbeks are not only reliable strategic partners but also hardworking, compassionate people — both as migrants and visitors.' In recent conversations with a VOA reporter traveling across Tashkent, Ferghana, Bukhara, Samarkand, and Surkhandarya, most Uzbeks expressed enthusiasm about U.S. President Donald Trump's return to the White House. They hoped his administration would foster stronger connections with the people of Uzbekistan, not just its government. From journalists and activists to entrepreneurs and educators, they want Trump to fulfill his promises to end the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. 'We are a peaceful region, despite the continuous turmoil in neighboring Afghanistan, but these conflicts deeply trouble us,' said Zuhra Amonova, an English teacher in Bukhara. Calls for new approach As relations between Washington and Central Asian nations have evolved, there have been some calls by American experts for creating a new diplomatic approach, shifting the U.S. government away from grouping the countries with South Asian nations and instead aligning them more with the Caucasus. Veteran bureaucrats who have worked with these regions at the State Department and the Pentagon told VOA that Washington's view of this part of the world has increasingly been seen through a Russian lens since the U.S. exit from Afghanistan. Ikboljon Qoraboyev, a professor at Maqsut Narikbayev University in Astana, Kazakhstan, says the Central Asia-Caucasus proposal reflects the region's crucial role between China and Russia and the growing significance of the Middle Corridor, a transit route across the Caspian Sea that carries goods westward to European markets. 'Central Asian policymakers may welcome the change, as their previous alignment with South Asia felt misaligned with their identity,' Qoraboyev told VOA. 'But U.S. policymakers must recognize each country's distinct interests, rather than relying solely on regional frameworks.' Like many experts VOA spoke to, he points out that Central Asian governments are eager for closer ties with the U.S., seeking investment, political support, development aid, and expanded educational and technological exchanges. These are among the key factors in the policy recommendations by Eric Rudenshiold, a former White House, Congress, and USAID official, now a senior fellow at the Caspian Policy Center. 'Successful U.S. engagement in the Trans-Caspian region will preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Caucasus and Central Asia,' Rudenshiold said at a forum in Washington ahead of the inauguration. He emphasized that such an approach would benefit the U.S. while creating opportunities in energy development, trade, and connectivity. Rudenshiold believes that promoting American values in this way could spur economic and political reforms in the region and shape democratic institutions. 'The Trans-Caspian region is becoming a vital geopolitical and economic crossroads, important to U.S. interests as it counters Russia's restrictions on the region's gas, oil, and uranium supplies and China's efforts to control next-generation energy,' he wrote in a strategic brief. Washington needs security agreements and closer partnerships in the region, Rudenshiold argued, 'due to shared concerns over renewed terrorist threats and its geostrategic location bordering Russia, China, Afghanistan, and Iran.' Leaders encourage Trump visit In congratulatory messages to Trump, regional leaders have invited him to visit. No U.S. president has ever toured Central Asia and the Caucasus. In a letter to Trump, Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev wrote that his country 'deeply values and appreciates the U.S. policy of consistently supporting the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of our nation.' He credited Trump's first term for renewing the strategic partnership, adding: 'We are committed to further developing our long-term cooperation within bilateral and multilateral frameworks.' The Trump administration has yet to outline its priorities both in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Rudenshiold and his center are pressing to appoint a special representative for these regions. Javlon Vakhabov, Uzbekistan's former ambassador to the U.S. and Canada who now heads the International Institute for Central Asia in Tashkent, also advocates for deeper political dialogue. 'In an era of global uncertainty, Central Asia seeks to collectively champion its interests on the international stage and coordinate efforts to address shared challenges,' Vakhabov told VOA. 'A high-level U.S. visit to Uzbekistan would underscore the region's importance.' Vakhabov sees great potential in the Middle Corridor, where secondary routes via Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan could strengthen supply chains and diversify transportation lines. He highlights the Uzbekistan–Afghanistan—Pakistan railway, 'which will reduce delivery times from 35 days to just three and cut shipping costs by two-thirds.' Vakhabov agrees with Rudenshiold that U.S. support for such initiatives would enhance regional stability and attract more American businesses. Touting Uzbekistan's natural resources, he underlines that collaboration on essential minerals and rare earth elements could help the U.S. strengthen 'defense, manufacturing, and technological competitiveness.' Some yearn to learn The U.S. has a long history of cooperation with Central Asian countries on counterterrorism and border security. Vakhabov recommends expanding that cooperation 'since they serve common interests.' The Human Rights Watch 2025 annual report describes Central Asia as a region where autocratic regimes systematically violate freedoms, reforms are stalled or superficial, and security forces hold significant power, undermining the rule of law. Uzbeks interviewed by VOA this winter expressed mixed views on the U.S. role in promoting justice and freedom, but most admired its democratic system. 'We need to grasp how democracy works in practice,' said Dilrabo Zaripova, a small business owner in Samarkand. 'From what we saw in this U.S. presidential election, it requires a strong will and commitment. I don't think we're there yet. But having close ties with America would help us learn from its resilience and complex experience.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/excited-about-trump-s-promises-uzbeks-hopeful-for-closer-engagement/7949771.html	2025-01-24T23:23:21-08:00	
One of last Auschwitz survivors makes telling the stories his mission	HAIFA, ISRAEL — Naftali Furst will never forget his first view of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, on Nov. 3, 1944. He was 12 years old. SS soldiers threw open the doors of the cattle car, where he was crammed in with his mother, father, brother, and more than 80 others. He remembers the tall chimneys of the crematoria, flames roaring from the top. There were dogs and officers yelling in German 'Get out, get out!' forcing people to jump onto the infamous ramp where Nazi doctor Josef Mengele separated children from parents. Furst, now 92, is one of a dwindling number of Holocaust survivors able to share first-person accounts of the horrors they endured, as the world marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazis' most notorious death camp. Furst is returning to Auschwitz for the annual occasion, his fourth trip to the camp. Each time he returns, he thinks of those first moments there. 'We knew we were going to certain death,' he said from his home in Haifa, northern Israel, earlier this month. 'In Slovakia, we knew that people who went to Poland didn't return.' Strokes of luck Furst and his family arrived at the entrance to Auschwitz on Nov. 3, 1944 -– one day after Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler ordered the cessation of the use of the gas chambers ahead of their demolition, as the Soviet troops neared. The order meant that his family wasn't immediately killed. It was one of many small bits of luck and coincidences that allowed Furst to survive. 'For 60 years, I didn't talk about the Holocaust, for 60 years I didn't speak a word of German even though it's my mother tongue,' said Furst. In 2005, he was invited to attend the ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Buchenwald, where he was liberated on April 11, 1945, after being moved there from Auschwitz. He realized there were fewer and fewer Holocaust survivors who could give first-person accounts, and he decided to throw himself into memorial work. This will be his fourth trip to a ceremony at Auschwitz, having also met Pope Francis there in 2016. Some 6 million European Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust — the mass murder of Jews and other groups before and during World War II. Soviet Red Army troops liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau on Jan. 27, 1945, and the day has become known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. An estimated 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Just 220,000 Holocaust survivors are still alive, according to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, and more than 20% are over 90. A meeting place after the war Furst, originally from Bratislava, then part of Czechoslovakia, was just 6 when the Nazis first started implementing measures against the country's Jews. He spent ages 9 to 12 in four different concentration camps, including Auschwitz. His parents had planned to jump off of the cattle car on the way to the camp, but people were packed so tightly they couldn't reach the doors. His father instructed the entire family, no matter what, to meet at 11 Sulekova St. in Bratislava after the war. Furst and his brother were separated from their mother. After numbers were tattooed on their arms, they also were taken from their father. They lived in Block 29, without many other children. As the Soviet army closed in on the area, so close they could hear the booms from the tanks, Furst and his brother, Shmuel, were forced to join a dangerous journey toward Buchenwald, marching for three days in the cold and snow. Anyone who lagged behind was shot. 'We had to prove our desire to live, to do another step and another step and keep going,' he said. Many people gave up, longing to end the hunger and thirst and cold, and just sat down, where they were shot by the guards. 'We had this command from my father: 'You must adapt and survive, and even if you're suffering, you must come back,'' Furst recalled. Furst and his brother survived the march, and an open-car train ride in the snow, but they were separated at the next camp. When Furst was liberated from Buchenwald, captured in a famous photo that included Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel in the bunkbeds, he was sure he was alone in the world. But within months, just as Furst's father had instructed, the four family members reunited at the address they memorized, the home of family friends. The rest of their family –- grandparents, aunts, uncles — were all killed. His family later moved to Israel, where he married, had a daughter, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, with another on the way. 'We couldn't imagine this tragedy' On Oct. 7, 2023, Furst awoke to the Hamas attack on southern Israel, and immediately thought of his granddaughter, Mika Peleg, and her husband, and their 2-year-old son, who live in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza where scores of people were killed or kidnapped. 'It just kept getting worse all day, we couldn't get any information what was happening with them,' said Furst. 'We saw the horrors, that we couldn't imagine this type of horror is happening in 2023, 80 years after the Holocaust.' Toward midnight on Oct. 7, Peleg's neighbors sent word that the family had survived. They spent almost 20 hours locked inside their safe room with no food or ability to communicate. Her husband's parents, who both lived on Kfar Aza, were killed. Despite his close connection, comparisons between Oct. 7 and the Holocaust make Furst uncomfortable. 'It's awful and terrible and a catastrophe, and hard to describe, but it's not a Holocaust,' he said. As awful as the Hamas attack was for his granddaughter and others, the Holocaust was a multi-year 'death industry' with massive infrastructure and camps that could kill 10,000 people a day for months at a time, he said. Furst, who was previously involved in coexistence work between Jews and Arabs, said his heart also goes out to Palestinians in Gaza, although he believes Israel needed to respond militarily. 'I feel the pain of everyone who is suffering, everywhere in the world, because I think I know what suffering is,' he said. Furst knows that he is one of very few Holocaust survivors still able to travel to Auschwitz, so it's important for him to be present there to mark the 80th anniversary. These days, he is telling his story as many times as he can, taking part in documentaries and movies, serving as the president of the Buchenwald Prisoner's Association and working to create a memorial statue at the Sered' concentration camp in Slovakia. He feels a responsibility to be the mouthpiece for the millions who were killed, and people can relate to the story of a single person more than the hard numbers of 6 million deaths, he said. 'Whenever I finish, I tell the youth, the fact that you were able to see living testimony (from a Holocaust survivor) puts a requirement on you more than someone who did not: you take it on your shoulders the obligation to continue to tell this.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-of-last-auschwitz-survivors-makes-telling-the-stories-his-mission/7949857.html	2025-01-24T23:21:32-08:00	
US pressure mounts on Thailand over 48 Uyghur detainees as hunger strike continues	WASHINGTON — The plight of 48 Uyghur detainees in Thailand has drawn international scrutiny as the group’s hunger strike protesting their possible return to China stretches into day 15 with the U.S. State Department, U.N. officials and activists voicing concern. 'By international human rights standards, such a prolonged hunger strike requires authorities to address grievances and ensure the detainees’ well-being,' said Rushan Abbas, executive director of the Campaign for Uyghurs and chairperson of the World Uyghur Congress executive committee. The group of Uyghurs has been held in Bangkok’s Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) since 2014, fleeing alleged persecution in China’s Xinjiang region. After more than a decade of detention there, their future remains precarious amid mounting calls for Thailand to uphold its human rights commitments. US and Thai response A U.S. State Department spokesperson told VOA late Thursday that Washington is 'following this situation closely' and 'deeply concerned by the reports.' The spokesperson told VOA that the United States is engaging with the Royal Thai Government on the matter. 'We continue to urge the Royal Thai Government to respect the principle of non-refoulement and to uphold its respective non-refoulment obligations under international law,' the spokesperson said. 'As Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio indicated during his confirmation hearing, he is prepared to use diplomacy and leverage the longstanding U.S.-Thailand alliance to engage the Royal Thai Government on the reported imminent repatriation of Uyghur detainees to China.' At a press conference on Friday, Thailand’s Foreign Ministry said 'no decision has been made' regarding the Uyghur detainees. 'Any decision on this matter will be based on relevant domestic legal frameworks, human rights principles, especially the principle of non-refoulement, including Thailand’s obligation to refrain from returning people to where they will face torture or enforced disappearance,' said Nikorndej Balankura, the ministry’s director general of information. 'For the time being no decision has been made. I can assure their safety.' Advocates sound alarm Despite assurances from Thai officials, human rights advocates remain skeptical, warning of the severe consequences if the Uyghur detainees are repatriated to China. The 48 men, arrested in 2014 alongside over 300 other Uyghurs attempting to cross into Malaysia via human trafficking routes from China’s Yunnan province, have been detained in Thailand for more than a decade. In 2015, 109 of the Uyghurs were forcibly deported to China, sparking international outrage, with their fates still unknown. Meanwhile, 173 women and children were resettled in Turkey, and five detainees, including two children, have died since 2014. Abbas expressed alarm over the uncertain future of the Uyghur detainees, drawing a parallel to the 'devastating precedent' set in 2015. 'These 48 men could face the same dark fate as those deported nearly a decade ago. The Thai government must not repeat the mistakes of 2015,' Abbas said. 'At that time, despite making similar assurances as today’s, Thai authorities sent 109 Uyghur men to China. They likely disappeared into the black hole of a regime infamous for torture and genocide.' Abbas also cited concerns that the deportations could occur imminently, possibly before the Thai prime minister’s scheduled visit to China on Feb. 4. 'It seems they are trying to gain leverage from China by acting before the visit,' she told VOA in a phone interview. The stakes in 2025, Abbas emphasized, are even higher than in 2015. 'If Thailand chooses to deport these Uyghurs despite the U.S. genocide determination and the U.N. finding of crimes against humanity, it would be a grave violation of international law and an affront to the principles of human rights,' she said. 'Thailand should prepare for a tsunami of condemnation and face severe economic and political consequences.' In 2021, the U.S. formally designated China’s treatment of the Uyghurs as genocide, and in a 2022 report, the U.N. human rights office stated that China’s actions in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against humanity, including torture, forced labor, and forced sterilization. China’s response China has repeatedly denied the U.N. and U.S. determinations of genocide, asserting that its actions in Xinjiang are aimed at combating separatism, extremism and terrorism – what Beijing refers to as the 'three evils.' The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok weighed in last Wednesday, alleging the Uyghur detainees had terrorist affiliations. 'A small number of individuals, enticed by external forces, fled abroad and even joined the 'East Turkestan Islamic Movement' [ETIM], a terrorist organization recognized by the United Nations, becoming terrorists themselves,' the embassy stated on its website. However, the narrative surrounding ETIM has evolved. While the group was designated a terrorist organization by the U.N. in 2002, the U.S. delisted it in 2020. A report by the Congressional Research Service at the time cited a lack of 'clear and convincing evidence of ETIM's existence.' Health deterioration According to U.N. experts, the detainees’ health is rapidly deteriorating. In a statement earlier this week, they said 23 of the 48 suffer from serious health conditions including diabetes, kidney disfunction, lower body paralysis, skin diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses, and heart and lung conditions. 'It is essential they be provided with the necessary and appropriate medical care,' the report said. U.S. Representative Gregory Meeks, ranking member of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a statement on Wednesday condemning any potential deportation. 'If these Uyghurs are deported back to the PRC, Thailand would be violating the customary practice of nonrefoulement and its commitments as State Party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,' he said, using the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. Meeks called on the Thai government to guarantee the detainees' protection, provide them with access to asylum procedures, and ensure they receive the medical care they need.

App provides immediate fire information to Los Angeles residents	OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA — From his home in northern California, Nick Russell, a former farm manager, is monitoring the Los Angeles-area fires. He knows that about 600 kilometers south, people in Los Angeles are relying on his team’s live neighborhood-by-neighborhood updates on fire outbreaks, smoke direction, surface wind predictions and evacuation routes. Russell is vice president of operations at Watch Duty, a free app that tracks fires and other natural disasters. It relies on a variety of data sources such as cameras and sensors throughout the state, government agencies, first responders, a core of volunteers, and its own team of reporters. An emergency at his house, for example, would be 'much different' from one at his neighbor's house .4 kilometers away, Russell said. 'That is true for communities everywhere, and that’s where technology really comes in.' Watch Duty's delivery of detailed localized information is one reason for its success with its 7 million users, many of whom downloaded the app in recent weeks. It acts as a virtual emergency operations center, culling and verifying data points. Watch Duty’s success points to the promise that technologies such as artificial intelligence and sensors will give residents and first responders the real-time information they need to survive and fight natural disasters. Google and other firms have invested in technology to track fires. Several startup firms are also looking for ways to use AI, sensors and other technologies in natural disasters. Utility firms work with Gridware, a company that places AI-enhanced sensors on power lines to detect a tree branch touching the line or any other vibrations that could indicate a problem. Among Watch Duty’s technology partners is ALERTCalifornia, run by the University of San Diego, which has a network of more than 1,000 AI-enhanced cameras throughout the state looking for smoke. The cameras often detect fires before people call emergency lines, Russell said. Together with ALERTCalifornia’s information, Russell said, 'we have become the eyes and ears' of fires. Another Watch Duty partner is N-5 Sensors, a Maryland-based firm. Its sensors, which are placed in the ground, detect smoke, heat and other signs of fire. 'They're like a nose, if you will, so they detect smoke anomalies and different chemical patterns in the air,' Russell said. Watch Duty is available in 22 states, mostly in the western U.S., and plans to expand to all states. While fire has been its focus, Watch Duty also plans to track other natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis, Russell said. 'Fire is not in the name,' he said. 'We want to be that one-stop shop where people can go in those times of duress, to have a source that makes it clear and concise what’s happening.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/app-provides-immediate-fire-information-to-los-angeles-residents/7949884.html	2025-01-24T20:34:28-08:00	
Trump says US government is behind California during visit to fire-stricken state	U.S. President Donald Trump said the federal government is standing behind California 100% in the aftermath of devastating wildfires and said during a visit to the state on Friday that he would come back as much as needed. 'The first lady and I are in California to express a great love for the people of California,' Trump told a gathering of local leaders at a fire station in Los Angeles’ Pacific Palisades neighborhood. The neighborhood was one of the worst hit by the recent fires, with rows of homes left in ashes. Trump participated in a walking tour of the area earlier in the day and also surveyed recovery efforts from a helicopter as firefighters in the Los Angeles area continued to confront multiple blazes amid high winds and dry conditions. 'I don’t think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating it is, until you see it,' Trump said after the tour. The Palisades Fire is about 77% contained and has burned through nearly 9,500 hectares of land, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Trump has criticized California leaders for water policies that he says have exacerbated the recent wildfires. He said before traveling to California that he would 'take a look at a fire that could have been put out if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow.' California Governor Gavin Newsom has rejected the president’s assertion, and other state legislators have said the fierce wildfires placed extreme demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such blazes. Newsom greeted Trump as he arrived on the tarmac in Los Angeles on Friday. The two were cordial and shook hands. 'I have all the expectations we’re going to be able to work together,' Newsom said. Trump responded: 'We’re going to get it fixed.' During the gathering with community leaders, Trump said that Los Angeles residents who lost homes should be allowed back onto their properties immediately, challenging Mayor Karen Bass to speed up the cleanup process. 'People are willing to get a dumpster and do it themselves and clean it up. There is not that much left, it is all incinerated,' Trump said. Bass said, 'the most important thing is for people to be safe,' but promised residents should be able to return home within the week. Trump promised that federal permits to rebuild would be granted promptly and urged local officials to do the same. Before visiting California, Trump first visited North Carolina, where he was briefed on monthslong recovery efforts of the damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Speaking to reporters at Asheville Regional Airport, Trump said FEMA 'has been a very big disappointment' and said he is considering 'getting rid' of the agency. FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency that has been responding to disasters in both California and North Carolina. 'It’s very bureaucratic. And it’s very slow,' Trump said of the agency. Trump continued to express dissatisfaction with FEMA while in California, calling it a 'big disappointment.' Trump, a Republican, has broached using federal disaster assistance as a bargaining chip during unrelated legislative negotiations over government borrowing, or as leverage to push California to alter its water policies. 'Playing politics with people’s livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,' Representative Young Kim, a Republican from Orange County, south of Los Angeles, said in a recent statement. Trump has also suggested putting more responsibility on individual states to respond to disasters. 'I’d rather see the states take care of their own problems,' he said in a Wednesday interview with Fox News. 'FEMA is getting in the way of everything.' Michael A. Coen Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Biden administration, said Trump has been 'misinformed' about the agency, and he took exception to what he characterized as Trump’s inclination to play politics with disaster relief. Ahead of Trump’s visit to southern California, firefighters continued to fight multiple fires in the Los Angeles region. The second-largest fire, known as the Eaton Fire, is now 95% contained after burning through more than 5,600 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near Castaic Lake started Wednesday, prompting evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people. Health advisories for smoke and windblown dust and ash have been issued for surrounding areas. 'Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,' Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County’s health officer, said in a statement. Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire overnight with aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire is now 56% contained and has burned more than 4,200 hectares of land, according to the Cal Fire. The Laguna Fire in Ventura County initially prompted evacuation orders for California State University Channel Islands and University Glen, but the orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon. That fire is 70% contained after charring nearly 40 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said high winds, low humidity and dry conditions continued to cause 'elevated' fire weather conditions on Friday. There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National Weather Service said rain is expected in the area beginning Saturday. Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires. The fires that broke out in southern California on Jan. 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-us-government-is-behind-california-during-visit-to-fire-stricken-state/7949879.html	2025-01-24T19:57:49-08:00	
Russian deepfake videos target Ukrainian refugees, including teen	New online videos recently investigated by VOA's Russian and Ukrainian services show how artificial intelligence is likely being used to try to create provocative deepfakes that target Ukrainian refugees. In one example, a video appears to be a TV news report about a teenage Ukrainian refugee and her experience studying at a private school in the United States. But the video then flips to footage of crowded school corridors and packets of crack cocaine, while a voiceover that sounds like the girl calls American public schools dangerous and invokes offensive stereotypes about African Americans. 'I realize it's quite expensive [at private school],' she says. 'But it wouldn't be fair if my family was made to pay for my safety. Let Americans do it.' Those statements are total fabrications. Only the first section — footage of the teenager — is real. The offensive voiceover was likely created using artificial intelligence (AI) to realistically copy her voice, resulting in something known as a deepfake. And it appears to be part of the online Russian information operation called Matryoshka —‚ named for the Russian nesting doll — that is now targeting Ukrainian refugees. VOA found that the campaign pushed two deepfake videos that aimed to make Ukrainian refugees look greedy and ungrateful, while also spreading deepfakes that appeared to show authoritative Western journalists claiming that Ukraine — and not Russia — was the country spreading falsehoods. The videos reflect the most recent strategy among Russia's online disinformation campaign, according to Antibot4Navalny, an X account that researches Russian information operations and has been widely cited by leading Western news outlets. Russia's willingness to target refugees, including a teenager, shows just how far the Kremlin, which regularly denies having a role in disinformation, is prepared to go in attempting to undermine Western support for Ukraine. Targeting the victims A second video targeting Ukrainian refugees begins with real footage from a news report in which a Ukrainian woman expresses gratitude for clothing donations and support that Denmark has provided to refugees. The video then switches to generic footage and a probable deepfake as the woman's voice begins to complain that Ukrainian refugees are forced to live in small apartments and wear used clothing. VOA is not sharing either video to protect the identities of the refugees depicted in the deepfakes, but both used stolen footage from reputable international media outlets. That technique — altering the individual's statements while replicating their voice — is new for Matryoshka, Antibot4Navalny told VOA. 'In the last few weeks, almost all the clips have been built according to this scheme,' the research group wrote. But experts say the underlying strategy of spoofing real media reports and targeting refugees is nothing new. After Russia's deadly April 2022 missile strike on Ukraine's Kramatorsk railway station, for example, the Kremlin created a phony BBC news report blaming Ukrainians for the strike, according to Roman Osadchuk, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. During that same period, he noted, Russia also spread disinformation in Moldova aimed at turning the local population against Ukrainian refugees. 'Unfortunately, refugees are a very popular target for Russian disinformation campaigns, not only for attacks on the host community ... but also in Ukraine,' Osadchuk told VOA. When such disinformation operations are geared toward a Ukrainian audience, he added, the goal is often to create a clash between those who left Ukraine and those who stayed behind. Deepfakes of journalists, however, appear designed to influence public opinion in a different way. One video that purports to contain audio of Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, for example, claims that Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region is just a bluff. 'The whole world is watching Ukraine's death spasms,' Higgins appears to say. 'There's nothing further to discuss.' In another video, Shayan Sardarizadeh, a senior journalist at BBC Verify, appears to say that 'Ukraine creates fakes so that fact-checking organizations blame Russia,' something he then describes as part of a 'global hoax.' In fact, both videos appear to be deepfakes created according to the same formula as the ones targeting refugees. Higgins tells VOA that the entirety of the audio impersonation of his own voice appears to be a deepfake. He suggests the goal of the video was to engage factcheckers and get them to accidentally boost its viewership. 'I think it's more about boosting their stats so [the disinformation actors] can keep milking the Russian state for money to keep doing it,' he told VOA by email. Sardarizadeh did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. Fake video, real harm The rapid expansion of AI over the past few years has drawn increased attention to the problem of deepfake videos and AI images, particularly when these technologies are used to create non-consensual, sexually explicit imagery. Researchers have estimated that over 90% of deepfakes online are sexually explicit. They have been used both against ordinary women and girls and celebrities. Deepfakes also have been used to target politicians and candidates for public office. It remains unclear, however, whether they have actually influenced public opinion or election outcomes. Researchers from Microsoft's Theat Analysis Center have found that 'fully synthetic' videos of world leaders are often not convincing and are easily debunked. But they also concluded that deepfake audio is often more effective. The four videos pushed by Matryoshka — which primarily uses deepfake audio — show that the danger of deepfakes isn't restricted to explicit images or impersonations of politicians. And if your image is available online, there isn't much you can do to fully protect yourself. Today, there's always a risk in 'sharing any information publicly, including your voice, appearance, or pictures,' Osadchuk said. The damage to individuals can be serious. Belle Torek, an attorney who specializes in tech policy and civil rights, said that people whose likenesses are used without consent often experience feelings of violation, humiliation, helplessness and fear. 'They tend to report feeling that their trust has been violated. Knowing that their image is being manipulated to spread lies or hate can exacerbate existing trauma,' she said. 'And in this case here, I think that those effects are going to be amplified for these [refugee] communities, who are already enduring displacement and violence.' How effective are deepfakes? While it is not difficult to understand the potential harm of deepfakes, it is more challenging to assess their broader reach and impact. An X post featur phony videos of refugees received over 55,000 views. That represents significant spread, according to Olga Tokariuk, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. 'It is not yet viral content, but it is no longer marginal content,' she said. Antibot4Navalny, on the other hand, believes that Russian disinformation actors are largely amplifying the X posts using other controlled accounts and very few real people are seeing them. But even if large numbers of real people did view the deepfakes, that doesn't necessarily mean the videos achieved the Kremlin's goals. 'It is always difficult ... to prove with 100% correlation the impact of these disinformation campaigns on politics,' Tokariuk said.

US Senate approves Hegseth as defense secretary by 51-50 vote	The U.S. Senate has approved Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump’s nominee to serve as defense secretary, on a mostly party-line 51-50 vote. Vice President J.D. Vance broke the 50-50 tie in the 100-member Senate, casting the deciding vote. It is only the second time in U.S. history that a vice president, who is president of the Senate, would have to break a tie for a nominee. The vote late Friday followed days of Senate debate over Hegseth’s fitness for the top civilian role in the U.S. military, managing the nation’s armed forces. In his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Hegseth told lawmakers he would bring back accountability to the nation’s military. He received support from Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Senator Roger Wicker, who said, 'Pete Hegseth has the determination and the tools to achieve real change. He will inject a new warrior ethos into the Pentagon, a spirit that can cascade from the top down.' But Hegseth faced criticism from Senate Democrats over his statements about women and transgender people serving in the military, as well as allegations of sexual assault, drunkenness and financial mismanagement of two nonprofits serving U.S. veterans that he led. Earlier this week, senators received an affidavit from Danielle Hegseth, Hegseth's former sister-in-law, alleging he was abusive towards his second ex-wife, Samantha Hegseth. She did not describe the abuse and said she did not witness it. In a statement to NBC News, which first reported the story, Samantha Hegseth said, 'There was no physical abuse in my marriage.' Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Thursday he was not satisfied with Hegseth’s answers to his questions about reports that the Trump administration would implement a board to screen senior military officers for their fitness to lead. 'We've seen it happen in other places around the world, where militaries are undermined and subjected by political leaders that have a particular political point of view and passion, and they become essentially not an army but an extension of the political aspirations of the Great Leader. We can't see that here in America,' Reed said. Hegseth, a former television host at the conservative Fox News Channel, also served as an officer in the Army National Guard in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay and is the author of several books. 'I don't have a similar biography to defense secretaries of the last 30 years,' Hegseth told senators in his opening statement, 'But as President Trump also told me, we've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with the supposed right of credentials, whether they are retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives. And where has it gotten us?' Republican senators praised Hegseth for his fresh perspective. 'Mr. Hegseth will bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the bureaucracy. He will focus relentlessly on the war fighter and the military's core missions, deterring wars and winning the ones we must fight,' Wicker said during the confirmation hearings. Hegseth said his priorities if confirmed as secretary of defense would focus on the threat posed by China and defense of the homeland, while reorienting the U.S. away from entanglements in the Middle East. He also pledged to restore morale and end diversity initiatives that he sees as harmful to establishing a merit-based military. Asked how he sees his potential role, Hegseth replied, 'Getting anything that doesn't contribute to our democracy out of how decisions are made inside the Pentagon. What gender you are. What race you are. Your views on climate change. Your conscience and your faith should have no bearing on whether you get promoted or whether you're selected to go to West Point or where you go to school. Only thing that should matter is, ‘How capable are you at your job? How excellent are you at your job?’' Hegseth is the first secretary of defense to have served as a junior officer on the front lines, and the first secretary from the generation that fought in post-9/11 wars. Senate Democrats said Hegseth’s experience running two nonprofits benefiting military veterans, with fewer than 100 employees, was not sufficient experience to run the massive U.S. Department of Defense. 'We're hiring you to be the CEO of one of the most complex, largest organizations in the world. We're the board of directors here. I don't know of any corporate board of directors that would hire a CEO, that said, you know, ‘I supervised 100 people before,’' Democratic Senator Gary Peters. The Defense Department oversees more than 3 million service members and a budget of $857 billion. Hegseth also faced allegations of sexual assault and public drunkenness during his time at Fox News. Reed said the FBI background investigation into Hegseth was insufficient. 'You lack the character and composure and competence to hold the positions of defense,' Reed said, noting he has voted for all nine previous nominees for secretary of defense, including nominees during Trump’s first term. All Cabinet nominees undergo a background check and an ethics review. Hegseth faced allegations of financial mismanagement of the two nonprofits where he served as executive director — Vets for Freedom, and Concerned Vets for America. After a 2009 audit of Vets for Freedom, Hegseth admitted the organization was half a million dollars in debt, and he was demoted. During his time at Concerned Vets for America, Hegseth faced whistleblower allegations of personal misconduct and financial mismanagement. Hegseth said the allegations were part of a coordinated smear campaign by left-wing media and largely came from anonymous sources. 'We undertook this responsibility with obligation to the troops to do right by them, for our war fighters. And what became very evident to us from the beginning, there was a coordinated smear campaign orchestrated in the media against us that was clear from moment one. And that it wasn't about me. Most of it was about President Donald Trump, who's had to endure the very same thing for much longer amounts of time, and he endured it — to his credit — in incredibly strong ways,' Hegseth said during his confirmation. Hegseth has also faced criticism for past remarks about diversity in the U.S. military. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said Hegseth had done 'a very big about-face in a short period of time' due to Trump’s nomination of him as secretary of defense. Warren said last week, 'For 12 years, you were quite open about your views — and your views were consistently the same: Women are inferior soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen and Guardians. Then on November 9, 2024, just 32 days after your last public comments saying that women absolutely should not be in combat, you declare that ‘Some of our greatest warriors are women.’' Five women who served in combat wrote letters of support of Hegseth’s nomination. Hegseth pledged that women would have access to ground combat roles during his tenure as secretary of defense. 'Given the standards remain high, and we'll have a review to ensure standards have not been eroded in any one of these cases,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-approves-hegseth-as-defense-secretary-by-51-50-vote/7949878.html	2025-01-24T19:30:42-08:00	
Driver rams anti-government rally in Serbia's capital, hurts protester	BELGRADE, SERBIA — A woman rammed a car into a crowd of anti-government protesters in Serbia's capital and injured one of them Friday, police said, as a student-led strike shut down businesses and drew tens of thousands of people to demonstrations around the country. The nationwide protests took place on the same day that President Aleksandar Vucic held a big afternoon rally with thousands of supporters in the central town of Jagodina, his coalition stronghold, to counter the persistent anti-government protests that have challenged his tight grip on power for nearly three months. Vucic told his supporters that the country has been 'attacked both from outside and inside' by the anti-government protests. 'It is not accidental that that they have attacked Serbia from abroad,' Vucic said, pointing out Serbia's friendly relations with Russia and China, and a refusal to impose sanctions on Moscow because of the war in Ukraine. 'That is what they want to crush, but we must not allow it. That is our strength,' he told the cheering crowd. Call for talks Vucic also called for a dialogue with the striking students, who have received widespread support from all walks of life in Serbia, at the same time weakening popular support for his party. The students have rejected negotiations on their demands with Vucic. The protesters have blocked traffic daily in Serbia to protest the deaths of 15 people killed in the November collapse of a train station canopy that critics have blamed on government corruption. The government denies blame for the deaths. Police in Belgrade said that they detained the 24-year-old driver who rammed into a crowd of protesters in a section of the city called New Belgrade. The injured victim, a 26-year-old woman, was hospitalized; her condition was described as stable. A similar incident took place during a blockade last week in Belgrade, when a car rammed into protesting students, seriously injuring a young woman. Many in Serbia believe the huge concrete canopy at a train station in the northern city of Novi Sad fell down because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption. Weekslong protests demanding accountability for the crash have been the biggest since Vucic came to power more than a decade ago. He has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union membership for Serbia. It wasn't immediately possible to determine how many people and companies joined the students' call for a one-day general strike on Friday. They included restaurants, bars, theaters, bakeries, shops and bookstores. 'Let's take freedom in our hands,' students told the citizens in their strike call. At his rally in Jagodina, Vucic announced the formation in March of a nationwide political movement in the style of Russian President Vladimir Putin's United Russia movement to help ensure the dominance of his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party. 'You are all welcome to the movement of big change and future,' Vucic said. He said that the movement will include people who aren't members of any political party. 'We need new energy,' Vucic said. Foreign influence alleged The president and the country's mainstream media have accused the students of working under orders from foreign intelligence services to overthrow the authorities while pro-government thugs have repeatedly attacked protesting citizens. The 15-minute traffic blockades on Friday started at 11:52 a.m., the exact time of the canopy collapse in Novi Sad. Serbian universities have been blockaded for two months, along with many schools. A lawyers association also has gone on strike, but it remained unclear how many people stayed away from work in the state-run institutions on Friday. Protest marches were held Friday in Belgrade, Novi Sad, the southern city of Nis and other smaller cities — even in Jagodina before Vucic's arrival. 'Things can't stay the same anymore,' actor Goran Susljik told N1 regional television. 'Students have offered us the possibility of change.' Serbia's prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people for the canopy collapse, including a government minister and several state officials. But the former construction minister, Goran Vesic, has been released from detention, fueling doubts about the investigation's independence. The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driver-rams-anti-government-rally-in-serbia-s-capital-hurts-protester-/7949871.html	2025-01-24T19:14:24-08:00	
Trump visits fire-stricken California, vows 'to get it fixed'	U.S. President Donald Trump toured parts of California damaged by wildfire as firefighters in the Los Angeles area continued to confront multiple blazes amid high winds and dry conditions. Trump surveyed recovery efforts from a helicopter on Friday, including flying over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood where a fire left rows of homes in ashes. The Palisades Fire is about 77% contained and has burned through nearly 9,500 hectares of land, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Trump has criticized California leaders for water policies that he says have exacerbated the recent wildfires. He said before traveling to California that he would 'take a look at a fire that could have been put out if they let the water flow, but they didn't let the water flow.' California Governor Gavin Newsom has rejected the president's assertion, and other state legislators have blamed the fierce wildfires for placing extreme demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such blazes. Newsom greeted Trump as he arrived on the tarmac in Los Angeles on Friday. The two were cordial and shook hands. 'I have all the expectations we're going to be able to work together,' Newsom said. Trump responded: 'We're going to get it fixed.' Trump calls FEMA 'big disappointment' Before visiting California, Trump first visited North Carolina, where he was briefed on monthslong recovery efforts for the damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Speaking to reporters at Asheville Regional Airport, Trump said FEMA 'has been a very big disappointment' and said he is considering 'getting rid' of the agency. FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency that has been responding to disasters in both California and North Carolina. 'It's very bureaucratic. And it's very slow. Other than that, we're very happy with them,' Trump said of the agency. Trump, a Republican, has broached using federal disaster assistance as a bargaining chip during unrelated legislative negotiations over government borrowing, or as leverage to push California to alter its water policies. 'Playing politics with people's livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the Southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,' Representative Young Kim, a Republican from Orange County, south of Los Angeles, said in a recent statement. Trump has also suggested putting more responsibility on individual states to respond to disasters. 'I'd rather see the states take care of their own problems,' he said in a Wednesday interview with Fox News. 'FEMA is getting in the way of everything.' Michael A. Coen, Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Biden administration, said Trump has been 'misinformed' about the agency, and he took exception with what he characterized as Trump's inclination to play politics with disaster relief. 50,000 told to evacuate Ahead of Trump's visit to southern California, firefighters continued to fight multiple fires in the Los Angeles region. The second-largest fire, known as the Eaton Fire, is now 95% contained after burning through more than 5,600 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near Castaic Lake started Wednesday, prompting evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people. Health advisories for smoke and windblown dust and ash have been issued for surrounding areas. 'Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,' Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County's health officer, said in a statement. Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire overnight with aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire is now 56% contained and has burned more than 4,200 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The Laguna Fire in Ventura County initially prompted evacuation orders for California State University Channel Islands and University Glen, but the orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon. That fire is 70% contained after charring nearly 40 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said high winds, low humidity and dry conditions continued to cause 'elevated' fire weather conditions on Friday. Saturday forecast includes rain There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National Weather Service said rain is expected in the area beginning Saturday. Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires. The fires that broke out in Southern California on January 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-visits-fire-stricken-california-vows-to-get-it-fixed-/7949855.html	2025-01-24T18:41:39-08:00	
Afghan refugees in Pakistan worry as US suspends resettlement program	WASHINGTON — The Sultani family was nearing the final stages of their case to resettle in the U.S., though their plan was disrupted after President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 suspending the relocation of refugees to the U.S. 'My family and I couldn’t sleep at night' since the executive order was signed, said 50-year-old Ahmad Zahir Sultani, who fled to Pakistan alongside his wife and four children a few months after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. 'We are very worried ... as we face an uncertain future,' said Sultani, who worked with U.S.-run projects in Afghanistan before the U.S. pulled out of the country in 2021. Just hours after his swearing-in as the 47th President of the U.S., Trump signed the executive order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program beginning Jan. 27. The Sultani family was identified as a Priority 1 case for resettlement under that program. 'This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligned with the interest of the United States,' stated the order. The order calls on the secretary of the Homeland Security Department, in consultation with the secretary of state, to report to the president within 90 days if the program 'would be in the interests of the United States.' The order added that every 90 days, a report would be submitted to the president until he 'determine[s] that resumption of the USRAP is in the interests of the United States.' Sultani and other Afghan refugees who have been waiting in Pakistan for resettlement in the U.S. told VOA that staying in Pakistan would be 'very difficult' for them as the crackdown on Afghan refugees continues in Islamabad, where the Sultanis currently reside. 'We are facing harassment and arrests by the police [in Pakistan]. And we can’t go back to Afghanistan as we fled because of the threats there,' Sultani said. According to Pakistan’s Foreign Office in July, among more than 44,000 Afghans living in Pakistan to be relocated to third countries, about 25,000 Afghan refugees are waiting to be resettled in the U.S. Fahimi Zahid, an Afghan activist living in Islamabad, told VOA that after the suspension of their relocation program to the U.S., Afghan refugees in Pakistan are 'very concerned' about their future in Pakistan. 'In the past, refugees had a hope that the U.S. was in talks with Pakistan to ensure they wouldn’t face any harassment,' she said, 'but after the executive order, it is for sure that Afghans would face further harassment and deportation.' According to the U.S. State Department, more than 180,000 Afghans were relocated in the U.S. from August 2021, after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, to December 2024. Thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during its two-decade war in Afghanistan are still waiting to be relocated to the U.S. Shawn VanDiver, the president of AfghanEvac, a California-based coalition of organizations helping the U.S., told VOA that until the USRAP resumes, 'there won’t be any travel. Refugees won’t be flying here or anywhere else.' U.S. media reported Wednesday that the flights of Afghan refugees who were supposed to be relocated to the U.S. were canceled only days before the order would go into effect. VanDiver said the order mainly would affect Afghan refugees with Priority 1 and Priority 2 cases. He said he and others at AfghanEvec are trying to have President Trump issue 'an exemption for Afghans.' 'People that pass security and waiting medical and all that, we got to make sure they get here,' he added. VanDiver noted that somewhere between 150,000 to 200,000 Afghans have resettlement cases. Sultani said that he and other Afghan refugees who waited for years to be relocated to the U.S. are now facing an uncertain future. 'Going back to Afghanistan is no option for us, and here [in Pakistan] we face many problems,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-refugees-in-pakistan-worry-as-us-suspends-resettlement-program/7949844.html	2025-01-24T17:58:23-08:00

State Department freezes new funding for nearly all US aid programs worldwide	WASHINGTON — The State Department ordered a sweeping freeze Friday on new funding for almost all U.S. foreign assistance, making exceptions for emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt. The order threatened a quick halt to many of the billions of dollars in U.S.-funded projects globally to support health, education, development, job training, anti-corruption, security assistance and other efforts. The U.S. provides more foreign aid globally than any other country, budgeting about $60 billion in 2023, or about 1% of the U.S. budget. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's order, delivered in a cable sent to U.S. embassies worldwide, specifically exempted emergency food programs, such as those helping to feed millions in a widening famine in warring Sudan. The cable spells out the execution of the aid-freezing executive order President Donald Trump signed on Monday. But Friday's order especially disappointed humanitarian officials by not including specific exemptions for lifesaving health programs, such as clinics and immunization programs. A globally acclaimed anti-HIV program, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was among those apparently included in the spending freeze, slated to last at least three months. Known as PEPFAR, the program is credited with saving 25 million lives, including those of 5.5 million children, since it was started by Republican President George W. Bush. Some aid projects began receiving their first stop-work orders under the freeze Friday afternoon. Some leading aid organizations also were interpreting the directive as an immediate stop-work order for U.S.-funded aid work globally, a former senior U.S. Agency for International Development official said. Many would likely cease operations immediately so as not to incur more costs, the official said. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Suspending funding 'could have life or death consequences' for children and families around the world, said Abby Maxman, head of Oxfam America. 'By suspending foreign development assistance, the Trump administration is threatening the lives and futures of communities in crisis, and abandoning the United States' long-held bipartisan approach to foreign assistance which supports people based on need, regardless of politics,' Maxman said in a statement. At the United Nations, deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said: 'These are bilateral decisions but nonetheless we expect those nations who have the capability to generously fund development assistance.' While Rubio's order exempted military assistance to allies Israel and Egypt from the freeze, there was no indication of a similar waiver to allow vital U.S. military assistance to Ukraine through. The Biden administration pushed military aid to Ukraine out the door before leaving office because of doubts about whether Trump would continue it. But there is still about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding for any future arms shipments to Ukraine, and it is now up to Trump to decide whether to spend it. The sweeping freeze begins enforcement of a pledge from Trump and other Republicans to crack down on U.S. aid programs. Florida Republican Representative Brian Mast, the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, promised this week that Republicans would question 'every dollar and every diplomat' in the State Department's budget to ensure it met their standards for strict necessity. The freeze is necessary to ensure that 'appropriations are not duplicated, are effective and are consistent with President Trump's foreign policy,' the global cable stated. Within the next month, standards for a review of all foreign assistance are expected to be set to ensure that it is 'aligned with President Trump's foreign policy agenda,' the cable said. And within three months, the government-wide review is expected to be completed with a subsequent report to be produced for Rubio to make recommendations to the president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-department-freezes-new-funding-for-nearly-all-us-aid-programs-worldwide/7949764.html	2025-01-24T16:02:23-08:00

Pandas are back in Washington, delighting National Zoo visitors	washington — Giant pandas have returned to the National Zoo in Washington, drawing joyful crowds. Two pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao, made their public debut Friday in front of hundreds of excited fans, the first pandas at the zoo in more than a year. Lisa Barham came all the way from Cleveland, Ohio, with her son to see them. 'It's just fantastic to be able to experience this as a family,' she told VOA’s Mandarin Service. Bao Li is the son of Bao Bao, a giant panda who was born at the National Zoo in 2013 and was returned to China. 'I brought my little boy to see Bao Bao's little boy,' Barham said. The pair of pandas, who are both 3 years old, rolled in Washington’s newly fallen snow and munched on bamboo. Crowds lined up for hours before the zoo opened at 8 a.m. to catch a glimpse of the bears. The pandas arrived from China in October but have been in quarantine while their enclosure was renovated. National Zoo director Brandie Smith told VOA that the pandas are 'a symbol of happiness and joy.' 'The pandas to me are such a success story … a story of panda friendship between our cultures,' she said. Because of conservation efforts, the giant panda is no longer on the endangered species list. However, it is still listed as 'vulnerable.' Smith said that at the start of the zoo’s program with pandas, which began in the 1970s, the focus was on producing more pandas to create an 'insurance population' for the planet. 'We accomplished that, and now the focus is really on habitat,' she said. About 1,864 giant pandas live in their native habitat in Asia while another 600 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world, according to the National Zoo’s website. Any cubs born to the new pandas are returned to China to join that country’s breeding program. The pandas are in Washington on a 10-year lease from China. The National Zoo says it is paying the China Wildlife and Conservation Association $1 million per year for the animals. At an opening ceremony at the zoo Friday morning, students from Yu Ying Public Charter School, a dual Chinese and English school in Washington, wore panda ears and sang a song about friendship. The school's executive director, Carlie Fisher, told VOA that the 'pandas represent peace and goodwill.' The zoo relaunched its popular Panda Cam on Friday, with 40 cameras streaming images of the furry bears throughout the day. The site had 75,000 views by 11:30 a.m. on Friday, according to zoo officials. VOA Mandarin Service reporter Calla Yu contributed to this report. Some information came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pandas-are-back-in-washington-delighting-national-zoo-visitors/7949534.html	2025-01-24T14:31:36-08:00	
In Turkey, watchdogs note wave of arrests of Kurdish media	WASHINGTON/ISTANBUL — Turkish authorities this month detained six Kurdish journalists from cities across the country. All six are accused of being members of a 'terrorist organization,' a common charge used in legal cases against media in Turkey. The arrests came the same week that Turkey was named a leading jailer of journalists. Data from the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, show 11 journalists currently detained for their work in Turkey, five of whom are Kurdish. Kurds are one of the world’s largest stateless ethnic groups, an estimated 30 million of whom span the Middle East countries of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. Across those regions, CPJ data show, 10 Kurdish media workers are detained. CPJ Chief Executive Jodie Ginsberg told VOA the trend of minorities targeted for arrest is seen globally. 'Again, this is something that we see when we look at the prison numbers more generally as often a targeting, particularly of minority communities, journalists representing those communities,' Ginsberg said. The most recent media arrests in Turkey involved journalists at the Yeni Yasam daily newspaper and at Guncel Productions. Sukru Alpsoy, a lawyer for the journalists, told VOA their work was presented as evidence in the case. VOA called the Istanbul Chief Prosecutor’s Office but did not receive a response. The CPJ data offer a snapshot of journalists in custody on Dec. 1 of each year. But media analysts say many more are held throughout the year. In Turkey, seven journalists were among a group of people arrested at a protest in December over the deaths in northern Syria of two journalists. An estimated 24 journalists have been detained in the past two months, according to Bianet Media Monitoring. Istanbul-based journalist Diren Yurtsever told VOA she believes authorities want to stop the media from reporting. A reporter for the Kurdish Mezopotamya News Agency, Yurtsever spent six months in custody last year on terrorism charges. 'We face charges such as 'membership of a terrorist organization,' 'propaganda for a terrorist organization' or 'financing,'' she told VOA. 'But when we look at the issue of membership in the organization and the files of journalists, we see that the grounds for accusations are mostly news reports. 'I can say that there is a great injustice against journalists and a serious threat to the law and freedom of expression is manifesting itself,' she said. Dicle Muftuoglu, a Mezopotamya editor and co-chair of the Tigris Euphrates Journalists Association, said the arrests are linked to coverage. 'Members of the court or any force cannot interfere with the issues that a journalist discusses in his program, the news he makes, or the problems he raises on social media,' said Muftuoglu. 'But today we see that they are interfering in all of this.' The Turkish embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s email requesting comment. In response to the latest arrests, the Coalition for Women in Journalism called for the detainees to be freed. 'This crackdown is part of a growing pattern of systematic repression, with the Kurdish press facing relentless persecution,' the media group said in a statement. Turkey ranks 158 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-turkey-watchdogs-note-wave-of-arrests-of-kurdish-media/7949520.html	2025-01-24T14:30:00-08:00

Legal team files UN complaint over jailed Bangladeshi journalists	WASHINGTON — Amid the political chaos in Bangladesh in August that included the ouster of the country's prime minister, journalists Farzana Rupa and Shakil Ahmed were arrested at an airport in the capital, Dhaka, while attempting to travel to Paris. More than 150 days have passed since then, and the married couple remains jailed in the South Asian country on accusations that their legal team rejects as politically motivated. 'This is a particularly absurd example of using the law to target critics, but unfortunately, it's still resulting in them remaining in prison,' human rights lawyer Caoilfhionn Gallagher, who is leading the couple's international legal team, told VOA. The international legal team representing the journalists filed a complaint Wednesday with the United Nations over their detention, which analysts say underscores broader challenges facing journalists in Bangladesh. Massive student-led protests erupted in Bangladesh in June 2024 and ultimately led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigning and fleeing to India. She had led the country since 2009. About 870 people died in the protests, according to the health ministry led by interim Bangladesh government. While covering the violent demonstrations, several journalists were attacked, and two were killed, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Many of journalists who have been targeted were viewed as pro-Hasina. Rupa and Ahmed are among four journalists viewed as pro-Hasina who were still jailed in Bangladesh as of early December, according to CPJ. Rupa and Ahmed both worked at the Ekattor TV channel, which was considered pro-Hasina, and were critical of the protests, according to the Coalition for Women in Journalism. Police claimed Rupa and Ahmed had incited Hasina's former government to kill protesters. The reporters were arrested in connection with the murder case of a garment worker who died during a demonstration in early August in Dhaka. Bangladeshi journalist Khairuzzaman Kamal, who previously worked with Rupa and is friends with Ahmed, said they are good journalists. 'They maintain their professional ethics very much,' said Kamal, of the Bangladesh Manobadhikar Sangbadik Forum journalist association. But other analysts say that, like many journalists in Bangladesh, they were pro-Hasina — but that doesn't mean they should be imprisoned on politically motivated charges. Even though Bangladesh has experienced significant media growth over the past 20 years, a lack of openness surrounding ownership and political affiliation has raised questions about editorial independence and threatened trust in the media, according to media reports. Gallagher, who is based in London, said the case against her clients is an example of retaliatory lawfare, which is when governments use and abuse the law to target critics. 'The intellectual hoops you have to jump through to claim that journalism in itself may have contributed to a mindset, which may have contributed to an attack, which may have contributed to a death is just legally nonsensical,' Gallagher said. Kamal agreed. 'It is a fabricated murder case against them because they are journalists,' the journalist said. By filing a complaint with the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Gallagher said she hopes the group will determine that Rupa and Ahmed's jailings are arbitrary. 'What we're seeing here is entirely unjust imprisonment without due process,' she added. Bangladesh's Embassy in Washington, U.N. office in Geneva, and Foreign Ministry did not reply to VOA's emails requesting comment. Press freedom threatened Press freedom has been under threat for years in Bangladesh, according to watchdog groups such as Amnesty International and Reporters without Borders. Hasina's government was long accused of using severe tools, such as intimidating family members of exiled journalists, and harsh laws to stifle dissent and repress the media. In her last year in power, Bangladesh fell to 165th place out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, the country's worst ranking ever. 'It was very clear during Hasina's 15 years of rule in Bangladesh that the media was under tight control for a long time, and journalists have been constantly targeted because of their reporting,' Beh Lih Yi, CPJ Asia program coordinator, told VOA. Mubashar Hasan, a fellow at the University of Oslo, agreed. Hasan, who researches authoritarianism and press freedom in Bangladesh, told VOA that for years it was risky for journalists to report critically on issues involving the military and the prime minister's office. 'There were no-go places for their journalism,' Hasan said. After Hasina resigned in early August, Bangladesh formed an interim government led by politician and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammad Yunus. In an October interview with the country's largest paper, Prothom Alo, Yunus appeared to advocate for press freedom. 'Write as you please. Criticize,' he said. 'Unless you write, how will we know what is happening or not happening?' And in a November interview with the Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star, Yunus recognized that the murder accusations against journalists without evidence were unfair, saying, 'This was hurriedly done, following the old laws and practices.' More than 140 journalists have faced these accusations, according to Reporters Without Borders. The interim government's stated commitment to defend press freedom is a good sign for the future, Beh said. But in practice, the forms of repression facing journalists have merely changed shape under the interim government. Four journalists are still in jail, and in November, demonstrators attacked the offices of two major newspapers. Authorities have also frozen the bank accounts of several journalists, and the interim government canceled press accreditations for more than 160 reporters. 'What we are very alarmed by is even though the interim government has pledged to reform, what is happening does not actually reflect that commitment,' Beh said.

Nigerian journalist misleads on Trump’s ability to travel internationally	Some countries have laws that refuse entry to convicted felons. They can still allow entry to a felon with a valid reason.

US cities get creative clearing snow, ice after rare winter storm	Days after a winter storm dropped ice and record-breaking snow, cleanup efforts were underway Thursday in several major Southern U.S. cities such as New Orleans, Louisiana, where crews were removing snow the same way they remove trash, drink cups and plastic beads after Mardi Gras celebrations. Temperatures were gradually rising across the U.S. South, bringing hopes that remaining snow and ice would melt away. 'We have to be honest with ourselves — we're from Louisiana, we know crawfish, we know football, but we don't really know snow and ice and that's okay,' said Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development spokesperson Daniel Gitlin. 'It's going to go away and we're better off letting Mother Nature do what she needs to do right now.' Up to 320 kilometers (200 miles) of interstate highways were expected to remain closed until Friday due to treacherous patches of black ice, Gitlin said. Louisiana has nearly run out of its salt supply after treating roads, he added. In New Orleans, a private waste management firm has been contracted to repurpose equipment that's typically used to clean up Mardi Gras beads and cups to clear snow from the streets. IV Waste President Sidney Torres said his company has deployed a 15,000-liter (4,000-gallon) 'flusher' truck to spray water on the ground to soften the ice for removal in the historic and festive French Quarter. The truck normally sprays lemon-scented fragrance 'to get rid of that funky liquor, urine, puke smell from the night before,' Torres said. 'We're finding new solutions and better techniques to dealing with this.' Arkansas sent Louisiana snowplows, dump trucks, salt spreaders and other equipment, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said. Snow likely breaks records The snowfall likely broke several records across the region, including in Florida where a preliminary report of 25 centimeters (10 inches) in one town would set a record for the state, if confirmed. Snow totals reached 8 centimeters (3 inches) this week in Savannah, Georgia, the most that the state's oldest city has recorded since December 1989. The snow was lighter in metro Atlanta, Georgia, where the southern suburbs saw more snow and ice than areas north of the city. In Covington, southeast of Atlanta, Jesse Gentes used a flame thrower to de-ice the roads in his subdivision. In better weather, he typically uses the flame thrower for brush removal, he told television station WSB-TV. Light freezing rain was forecast Thursday in the port city of Brunswick and surrounding Glynn County, where local officials had imposed an overnight curfew because of icy roads and frigid temperatures. Officials opened three warming stations where people could escape the biting chill, and nearly 4,000 residents of the county were still without power Thursday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. South Carolina reported at least one death in the storm. A 71-year-old man died from a medical condition while shoveling snow Thursday morning in Berkeley County, Coroner Darnell Hartwell said. About 8-10 centimeters (3-4 inches) of snow fell in the area, according to the National Weather Service. The snow and ice had staying power and left a mess on the roads in coastal South Carolina. In Charleston, South Carolina, ice that melted and then refroze overnight closed the James Island Connector, a bridge that links the city to its western suburbs. Police said on social media that 'while crews are working hard, it is unlikely to reopen soon.' Schools and county offices remained closed as officials in most areas south and east of the state capital, Columbia, asked people to stay home at least one more day. It was a similar story in North Carolina, where slick roads remained a danger to drivers after snow melted and then refroze overnight. Schools were also affected, including in Cumberland County where Fayetteville is located, where the school system announced that students would have an 'asynchronous' learning day allowing students to complete assignments at home. Several other school districts operated on a two-hour delay. Some school systems in central and south Alabama remained closed Thursday because of concerns about the remaining ice on roads or the possibility of frozen pipes in schools. In coastal Baldwin County, sections of Interstate 65 and Interstate 10 were shut down because of ice. Across the South, airports were gradually recovering from the weather interruption. Nationwide, about 600 flights scheduled to fly into or out of U.S. airports had been canceled by midday Thursday — a marked improvement over previous days when the storm was at its peak, according to the flight tracking service FlightAware.com. Parts of river freeze Meanwhile in the northeast, places like New York were still dealing with bitter cold temperatures despite moments when the sun peeked through the clouds. Parts of New York's Hudson River turned to ice Thursday during recent cold weather in the city. The frozen surface split into blocks of ice with the city's majestic skyline looming on the distant bank of the river. The National Weather Service has issued a warning for wind chills in eastern parts of the U.S. In New York, the city is dealing with temperatures below zero degrees Celsius (around 20 degrees Fahrenheit) which are expected to last through the weekend.

Nigeria seeks $910 million to tackle worsening humanitarian crisis	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian authorities and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs have launched an appeal for $910 million to address an escalating humanitarian crisis in the northeastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. The 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan was unveiled Thursday at the U.N. House in Abuja. The appeal aims to raise nearly a billion dollars to provide lifesaving assistance to some 3.6 million people affected by the more than 15 years of insurgency and insecurity in northeast Nigeria. Officials said humanitarian needs have worsened recently due to climate shocks, including devastating floods, and deepening economic issues. Mohammed Malick Fall, the U.N. resident coordinator in Nigeria, highlighted the growing challenges. 'This occasion underscores our collective resolve as a community to millions of people here in Nigeria. We have seen a spike in the number of people facing food insecurity. We have also seen a rise in children suffering from malnutrition,' he said. 'In 2024, we experienced perhaps one of the worst floods. 'Humanitarian interventions are key in saving lives, but they can't be the solution for all the problems across Nigeria. What is required also is for development to step in, that we double down on peace building,' Fall added. The 2025 plan prioritizes food security, health care, water and sanitation, with a particular focus on vulnerable groups such as women, children and people with disabilities. The plan also seeks to tackle the root causes of poverty and underdevelopment while building the resilience of vulnerable communities. Fall noted that just 57% of last year’s funding target was achieved — a number that was still slightly higher than the global average. Nigeria’s Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Nentawe Yilwatda, underscored the importance of taking a proactive approach to the emergency. 'The 2025 Humanitarian Response Plan prioritizes saving lives, building resilience, and adopting adaptive strategies to address evolving challenges with limited resources. This plan shifts from a reactive to a proactive approach, aiming to mitigate disasters before they occur,' Yilwatda said. 'While the focus remains on Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, it also acknowledges growing humanitarian needs in the northwest and north-central regions.' Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states have been grappling with terrorism from Boko Haram and widespread insecurity from armed gangs for over 15 years, creating one of Africa's most severe humanitarian crises. Zubaida Umar, director-general of Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency, emphasized the need for collaboration. 'The success of this plan lies in collaboration, synergy, and a people-centered approach. The numbers in this report represent real lives — children, women and men, families whose resilience inspires us to act with urgency and compassion,' Umar said. The U.N. estimates that 33 million Nigerians will face food insecurity in 2025, up from 26.5 million last year. Among them, 2.5 million children are at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition without immediate intervention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-seeks-910-million-to-tackle-worsening-humanitarian-crisis/7949382.html	2025-01-24T12:11:57-08:00	
Hamas announces hostages to be released in next exchange	Hamas on Friday announced the names of four Israeli women hostages whom the militant group is set to release Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in the second swap under the ceasefire deal in Gaza. The four women are Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag, Hamas said. All four women are Israeli soldiers who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that it had received the list via mediators and that its response would be provided later. The exchange is expected to begin on Saturday afternoon. On Jan. 19, the first day of the ceasefire, Hamas released three Israeli women in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners. In the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as well as increased humanitarian aid and a withdrawal of the Israeli military from some parts of Gaza. The Israel-Hamas war began with the Hamas attack on Israel in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. Israel’s response has also displaced the majority of the territory’s population and destroyed most of the enclave. Ahead of the Saturday exchange, the United Nations Human Rights Office warned on Friday that increased violence in the occupied West Bank could threaten the ceasefire in Gaza. Since Tuesday, Israeli operations in the West Bank have killed at least 12 Palestinians and injured 40 others, 'most of them reportedly unarmed,' United Nations Human Rights office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said. 'It is very concerning that what’s happening today in the West Bank may have an impact on the ceasefire in Gaza. It is imperative that the ceasefire in Gaza holds,' he said. Hundreds of Jenin residents fled their homes as the Israeli military destroyed several houses on the third day of a major operation in the West Bank city on Thursday. Israeli officials said the Jenin operation was aimed at what the military said were Iranian-backed militant groups in the refugee camp next to the city, which has been a hub for armed Palestinian groups for years. 'We are also concerned by repeated comments from some Israeli officials about plans to expand settlements further still and a fresh breach of international law,' Al-Kheetan said. 'We recall again that the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population into territories it occupies also amounts to a war crime.' Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the center of an independent state, since the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries view the Jewish settlements that Israel has built there as illegal, but Israel cites historical and Biblical ties to the land. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-announces-hostages-to-be-released-in-next-exchange/7949296.html	2025-01-24T11:37:56-08:00	
Ahead of election, media group accuses Belarus of crimes against humanity	WASHINGTON — Ahead of Belarus’ presidential election this weekend, a media advocacy group filed a complaint Friday with the International Criminal Court accusing the country’s longtime leader of crimes against humanity against journalists. The complaint, filed by Reporters Without Borders, known by French acronym RSF, accuses President Alexander Lukashenko of orchestrating a harsh crackdown on independent media that began after he claimed victory in the disputed 2020 election. That election was widely seen as rigged, with opposition candidates jailed or forced to flee. Security forces violently suppressed the subsequent mass protests. Paris-based RSF cited in its complaint the imprisoning and persecution of journalists and displacement of media workers as examples of crimes against humanity. 'RSF calls on the ICC Prosecutor to include these crimes against journalists in its preliminary investigation,' Antoine Bernard, RSF’s director of advocacy and assistance, said in a statement. Since the crackdown on independent media began, Belarus has ranked among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Belarusian media experts say the dire environment has made it harder to access credible information. 'The Belarusian information space is tightly controlled by the government,' Natalia Belikova, the head of international cooperation at Press Club Belarus, told VOA from Warsaw. Repression against journalists and activists has been increasing in the lead up to the election, she said. Press Club Belarus counts more than 40 journalists currently jailed in the country. The European Parliament and exiled Belarusian leader Svetlana Tikhanovskayahave condemned the upcoming election in Belarus as a sham. Since 2020, the Belarusian government has pressured independent media through raids on news outlets, blocking websites and designating media organizations as 'extremist.' The harsh environment forced some reporters to quit their jobs. Meanwhile, hundreds of other journalists fled into exile, according to the Belarusian Association of Journalists. 'For five years, the Belarusian regime has systematically persecuted independent voices, starting with journalists,' Jeanne Cavelier, the head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk, said in a statement. Belikova said she thinks the complaint to the ICC is significant. 'On the level of raising the profile of repression in Belarus, especially against journalists and free press, I think this is a very important move,' she said. But Belikova added that she wasn’t sure whether the complaint will improve the crisis facing Belarusian journalists. The office of the ICC prosecutor said it does not comment on complaints but confirmed it had received one from RSF. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment for this story. The assault on independent media has created an environment where state-run propaganda can thrive, according to analysts. Beginning last week, the Belarusian state-run television network ONT has aired a series of propaganda films that feature three jailed journalists. The journalists are seen in prison facilities, looking emaciated and exhausted as they are asked questions. The journalists — Ihar Losik and Andrey Kuznechyk, who work for VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Ihar Karney, who previously contributed to RFE/RL — are jailed on charges that press freedom groups view as politically motivated. The ONT propaganda series accused the journalists of trying to 'set Belarus on fire.' 'It is a very bad and malicious practice. It is against all human rights,' Belikova said about the interviews. Belikova said the interviews were likely intended to discredit RFE/RL in the eyes of Belarusians. RFE/RL’s Belarusian Service is one of the main independent outlets delivering independent news to people inside the country. RFE/RL said it had no comment on the interview series. Despite the proliferation of state-run propaganda, Belarusians still regularly access banned news sites. The five biggest sites had over 17 million visits in December 2023, according to a 2024 JX Fund report. Belarus has a population of around 9 million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ahead-of-election-media-group-accuses-belarus-of-crimes-against-humanity/7949238.html	2025-01-24T10:55:49-08:00

Lunar New Year travel offers boost to China’s economic woes	China’s annual mass migration ahead of the Lunar New Year will peak with billions of trips anticipated during this year’s holiday, which begins Tuesday. An estimated 9 billion trips are expected. This year’s holiday lasts from Jan. 28 through Feb. 4 and marks the arrival of the Year of the Snake. Authorities in China extended the annual break an extra day, so the public holiday will last eight days this year. During the holiday, travel is expected to pick up domestically and internationally. The government said it expects trips by train to surpass 510 million, with 90 million more traveling by air. Inside the country, most will travel by car. For trips overseas, travel to Southeast Asia has surged, with ticket volumes to Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia rising by more than 50%, according to data from the World Travel and Tourism Council. Additionally, demand for travel to Hong Kong has nearly doubled, and Japan is seeing a 58% increase in airline ticket purchases. While the Lunar New Year is known as a festive time characterized by colorful lanterns, parades and lion dances, it holds more than just cultural significance to Chinese authorities who see the period as an opportunity to boost a sluggish economy. That is one key reason authorities increased the holiday to eight days. They also launched several efforts to help revive weak consumer spending, such as promoting winter-themed holiday destinations and ensuring affordable airfares, according to officials at a State Council press conference in Beijing. Despite the efforts, Reuters reported businesses and consumers appear to be spending less than usual during the holiday season, citing concerns over a prolonged property slump and worries over job security. Throughout the past year, China has implemented a series of measures aimed at addressing those concerns, including stimulus measures such as cutting interest rates, increasing pensions and widening trade-in programs for consumer goods. One industry that appears to have gotten a boost from the festival season is cinema. The film industry in China had struggled recently, seeing a 22.6% decrease in total box office revenue in 2024. However, according to data from Maoyan, a Chinese ticketing platform, movie tickets exceeded $55 million by Jan. 23, the fastest presales for the Lunar New Year season. A large part of that increased demand has been from the film 'Legends of the Condor Heroes,' starring Xiao Zhan, an actor and singer who is also a brand ambassador for luxury goods companies such as Gucci and Tod's. Shops and restaurants also hope to see an increase in spending that mirrors the film industry over the course of the holiday.

Court bars Oath Keepers founder from Washington without approval	WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday barred Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes from entering Washington without the court's approval after U.S. President Donald Trump commuted the far-right extremist group leader's 18-year prison sentence for orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta issued the order two days after Rhodes visited the Capitol, where he met with at least one lawmaker, chatted with others and defended his actions during a mob's attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Rhodes was released from a Maryland prison a day earlier. Mehta’s order also applies to other Oath Keepers members who were convicted of charges that they participated in a violent plot to attack the Capitol.	https://www.voanews.com/a/court-bars-oath-keepers-founder-from-washington-without-approval/7949095.html	2025-01-24T09:29:46-08:00	
Drought led to 71,000 ‘excess deaths’ in Somalia, report shows	WASHINGTON — A study finds that severe drought plaguing parts of Somalia since 2022 has killed at least 71,000 people beyond the number expected. About 40% of the lives lost were children under the age of 5, said the study, commissioned by the U.N. Children’s Fund, the World Health Organization and Somalia’s Ministry of Health. The study covered the period between January 2022 and June 2024. In an interview with VOA Somali, Dr. Najib Isse Dirie, the deputy director for research at Mogadishu’s SIMAD University, which helped carry out the study, said the excess deaths were the result of five failed rainy seasons that brought parts of Somalia to the brink of famine. 'During the drought and after, the people experienced a significant 'drought-related excess' in different cases,' he said. 'Living in overcrowding IDP camps, loss of their livelihoods, and the lack of rainfall severely impacted their crop yields and made them vulnerable.' Speaking at the report launch in Mogadishu on Wednesday, the WHO’s representative to Somalia, Dr. Renee van De Weerdt Renhilde, said the study is an unpleasant reminder. 'The findings of this study highlight the profound impact that the 2022–2024 drought has had on the lives of the Somali people. ... This is a stark reminder of the urgent need for continued support and resilience-building efforts in Somalia,' she said. 'This also underlines the critical importance of strengthening Somalia’s health emergency prevention, preparedness, readiness and resilience system to effectively respond to emergencies and provide sustained care for people in need,' she added. 'WHO continues to collaborate with the Somali government and partners to ensure that communities are not only protected during crises but also empowered to withstand and recover from future shocks.' At the launching ceremony, Somali Health Minister Dr. Ali Hadji Adam Abubakar explained his county’s plans to limit the impact of future droughts by giving priority to vulnerable children and women. 'For my ministry, our focus is on creating a strong and robust health system as the cornerstone of a healthy and thriving Somali society,' Abubakar said. As it launched an appeal this week to raise $1.43 billion, the U.N. issued a warning that about 6 million people in Somalia will require humanitarian aid this year. In a statement, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said, 'Somalia continues to face a complex, protracted humanitarian crisis,' pointing out that conflict, insecurity, disease outbreaks, and recurrent shocks from climatic phenomena such as drought and floods further worsen Somalia's humanitarian needs. In 2011, a famine in Somalia killed more than a quarter-million people. The study was commissioned by UNICEF and the WHO and carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Imperial College London, and Somalia’s SIMAD University.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drought-led-to-71-000-excess-deaths-in-somalia-report-shows/7949102.html	2025-01-24T09:26:52-08:00	
London court says US mom can be extradited in children's killings	LONDON — A London judge on Friday rejected a U.S. mother's challenge to be extradited to Colorado to face murder charges in the deaths of two of her young children. Judge John Zani said in Westminster Magistrates Court that it would now be up to the British Home Secretary to order Kimberlee Singler returned to the United States. Singler, 36, is accused of two counts of first-degree murder in the December 2023 shooting and stabbings of her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, and one count of attempted murder in the knife slashing of her 11-year-old daughter. She also faces three counts of child abuse and one count of assault. Singler’s attorney had argued that sending her back to the U.S. would violate European human rights law, in part, because she faces a sentence of life in prison without parole in Colorado if convicted of first-degree murder. Such a sentence would be inhumane because it offers no prospect for release even if she is rehabilitated, attorney Edward Fitzgerald said. Fitzgerald said that despite an option for a Colorado governor to commute her sentence at some point, it was 'political suicide' to do so. Experts for the defense had originally said that a life sentence had never been commuted in Colorado. But prosecutors later found that Governor John Hickenlooper in 2018 commuted life sentences of five men convicted of murder. The defense countered that three of those sentences were not life without parole and two were for men who committed their crime between the ages of 18 and 21, which is sometimes considered a mitigating factor at sentencing because of their relative youth. 'This defendant, Kimberlee Singler, has no real prospect of release no matter what progress she makes' behind bars, Fitzgerald said. Prosecutor Joel Smith said the judge only had to consider if there is a mechanism that could allow Singler to be freed someday. 'Prospect of release — that is not your concern,' Smith told the judge at a hearing in December. Zani said in his ruling that there was an option in Colorado to release an inmate serving a life sentence. 'I am satisfied that the defendant has failed to vault the hurdle necessary in order to succeed in the challenges raised,' the judge said. Fitzgerald said he planned to appeal. Singler has denied that she harmed her children. She told police that her ex-husband had either carried out the killings or hired a hitman. Singler had superficial knife wounds and was initially treated as a victim. But that changed when her surviving daughter, who initially said she had been attacked by an intruder, told police her mother tried to kill her. After her daughter changed her story, police sought to arrest Singler on Dec. 26, but she had fled. She was found four days later in London’s posh Chelsea neighborhood and arrested. The girl told police that her mother gave the children milk with a powdery substance to drink and told them to close their eyes as she guided them into a sibling’s bedroom, prosecutors said. Singler cut her neck and, as the girl begged her to stop, she slashed her again. The girl said her mother had a gun. 'The defendant told her that God was telling her to do it and that the children’s father would take them away,' Smith said at a previous hearing. Police found Aden Wentz, 7, and Elianna 'Ellie' Wentz, 9, dead when they entered the Colorado Springs apartment on Dec. 19. They had been shot and stabbed. Although Singler blamed her husband, authorities said he had a solid alibi backed up by GPS records that showed he had been driving a truck at the time of the killings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/london-court-says-us-mom-can-be-extradited-in-children-s-killings/7949040.html	2025-01-24T08:37:07-08:00	
Afghan Taliban condemn ICC arrest warrants for leadership	ISLAMABAD — Afghanistan's ruling Taliban on Friday condemned the International Criminal Court's request for arrest warrants against their supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, and his chief justice for alleged persecution of women and girls. The Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs refuted the warrants as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.' The strongly worded English-language statement follows Thursday’s announcement by the chief ICC prosecutor that he was seeking arrest warrants for the reclusive Akhundzada and Abdul Hakim Haqqani, who has been serving as the chief justice of the country since the Taliban seized power in 2021. Prosecutor Karim Khan cited a thorough investigation and evidence collected in the process for concluding that the Taliban leaders 'are criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' Khan said that persecution has persisted since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan after nearly two decades of insurgency against the internationally recognized Kabul government and U.S.-led Western forces. 'It is unfortunate that such baseless allegations are being leveled against the honorable leaders of the Islamic Emirate [Taliban government] at a time when Afghanistan enjoys nationwide peace, its people have breathed a sigh of relief … and numerous other miseries and inhumane activities have been eradicated,' the Taliban ministry asserted. The Taliban takeover has almost ended years of war-related hostilities in the impoverished South Asian nation, leaving millions of Afghans in need of humanitarian assistance. 'Regrettably, this institution had turned a blind eye to the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by foreign forces and their domestic allies during their twenty-year occupation of Afghanistan,' the Taliban statement claimed Friday. Akhundzada has issued dozens of edicts over the past three years in line with his interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, from his base in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. The decrees have instituted sweeping restrictions on women and girls that the United Nations has labeled as 'gender apartheid.' The Haqqani-led Taliban Supreme Court has implemented what it claims is a Sharia-based criminal justice system, leading to public floggings of hundreds of Afghan men and women in packed sports stadiums on allegations such as adultery, sodomy, eloping, and other crimes. Several Afghans also have been executed publicly under what the Taliban described as the Islamic concept of retributive justice, known as qisas. Girls older than 12 are banned from pursuing education, including attending institutions that train midwives and nurses. Most women are prohibited from working in both the public and private sectors. They are blocked from visiting public parks, gyms, and baths. The Taliban have mandated that females cover their faces in public and that they cannot travel long distances without a male guardian — making Afghanistan the only country in the world to impose such bans on women and girls. The de facto authorities have rejected persistent U.N.-led calls for reversing all restrictions on the female Afghan population. 'Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable. Afghan survivors, in particular women and girls, deserve accountability before a court of law,' Khan said on Thursday. Amnesty International on Friday described the ICC prosecutor’s application for arrest warrants against the two Taliban leaders as an 'important step toward justice for Afghan women' and other vulnerable groups in the country. 'This is a crucial step to hold accountable all those allegedly responsible for the gender-based deprivation of fundamental rights to education, to free movement and free expression, to private and family life, to free assembly,' said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary-general. She also urged the ICC prosecutor to 'reconsider his decision in 2021 to deprioritize investigations' into war crimes allegedly committed by former Afghan government security apparatus, the U.S. military, and allied troops during their 20-year presence in Afghanistan. 'This decision risks contributing to perceptions of a selective approach to international justice, which prioritizes the interests of powerful states and their allies over the right to justice of victims of crimes under international law,' Callamard said, referring to Thursday’s announcement by the ICC prosecutor. The U.S.-led foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan just days after Taliban insurgents swept back to power in Kabul.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-taliban-condemn-icc-arrest-warrants-for-leadership/7949054.html	2025-01-24T08:27:16-08:00

Chocolate industry braces as Ivory Coast expects dire cocoa crop	Ivory Coast expects to record one of the worst mid-crop cocoa harvests of the last 15 years this season with production seen no higher than 300,000 metric tons compared with a yearly average of 500,000 tons, regulator and industry sources said. A poor harvest could add upward pressure to cocoa prices, which are already around record highs after nearly tripling last year. Analysts have said the chocolate industry is in for a rough 2025 that could see shelf prices increase by a percentage in the teens. Ivory Coast is the world's top cocoa producer, but a lack of rain and excessive heat since November across all its 13 growing regions have stalled development of the mid-crop harvest, which is meant to start in April. The unfavorable conditions mean that the first beans will start to arrive in ports in June at the earliest, provided the weather improves and rains return in the coming weeks, the sources said. 'There is no sign of any production at all on almost any plantation in the country,' said a pod counter who had just visited Ivory Coast farms. His words echo those of two regulator officials, who said that after touring farms their team decided to lower the outlook for cocoa production to 300,000 metric tons from 400,000 tons. 'Like everyone else, we're seeing the same thing. The mid-crop harvest will be one of the worst in 15 years,' one of the officials said. He added that the regulator had sold only about 250,000 tons in export contracts to grinders, preferring to be cautious. The regulator sources said the entire mid-crop harvest would be sold to local grinders to guarantee them the volumes necessary to maintain their activity. A dozen planters and middlemen across the West African country described the situation as unprecedented, characterized by a total absence of flowers and small pods after those that appeared in December and January dried up in the high heat. 'Even if the rain comes today ... it's already too late,' said Paul Kouame Kouakou, who owns four hectares of cocoa in Duekoue, a town in west Ivory Coast. It usually takes a flower around 22 weeks to become a mature pod. While the harvest was expected to start in April, there will be no cocoa until at least June, the farmer said. 'Usually, it's around November and December that we get the rains that herald the mid-crop harvest, but this year there's been no rain so far, and February and March are the hottest months,' said another pod counter. He visited dozens of plantations that did not have any sign of flowers or pods, which he called 'very bad news' for the crop.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chocolate-industry-braces-as-ivory-coast-expects-dire-cocoa-crop/7948916.html	2025-01-24T07:03:37-08:00	
Reclaiming Rudolf Hoss’s House as center countering hate, extremism and radicalization	Near Auschwitz's walls, the former home of the concentration camp’s commandant, Rudolf Hoss, stands as a symbol of denial and complicity, its windows overlooking the site of some of the Holocaust's worst atrocities. As the world marks the 80th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation (Jan. 27), plans are under way to transform the house into a research center on hate, extremism, and radicalization. VOA’s Eastern Europe bureau chief, Myroslava Gongadze, visited the house and has the story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/reclaiming-rudolf-h%c3%b6ss-s-house-as-a-center-countering-hate-extremism-and-radicalization/7948889.html	2025-01-24T06:40:53-08:00	
Israeli forces to stay in south Lebanon beyond withdrawal deadline	JERUSALEM — Israeli forces will remain in southern Lebanon beyond a Sunday deadline stipulated in a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah because the terms of the agreement have not been fully implemented, the Israeli prime minister's office said on Friday. Under the agreement, which began on Nov. 27, Hezbollah weapons and fighters must be removed from areas south of the Litani River and Israeli troops should withdraw as the Lebanese military deploys into the region, all within a 60-day timeframe due to conclude on Sunday at 4 a.m. The deal, brokered by the United States and France, ended more than a year of hostilities between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah. The fighting peaked with a major Israeli offensive that left Hezbollah severely weakened and displaced more than 1.2 million people in Lebanon. The United States, Britain and other Western countries have designated Hezbollah as a terror group. Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the Israeli military's withdrawal process was 'contingent on the Lebanese army deploying in southern Lebanon and fully and effectively enforcing the agreement, while Hezbollah withdraws beyond the Litani.' 'Since the ceasefire agreement has not yet been fully enforced by the Lebanese state, the gradual withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the United States,' the statement said. There was no immediate comment from Lebanon or Hezbollah. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hezbollah said on Thursday that any delay of Israel's withdrawal would be an unacceptable breach of the agreement, with which the Lebanese state would have to deal 'through all means and methods guaranteed by international charters.' Israel said its campaign against Hezbollah aimed to secure the return of tens of thousands of people forced to leave their homes in northern Israel by Hezbollah rocket fire. It inflicted major blows on Hezbollah during the conflict, killing leader Hassan Nasrallah and thousands of the group's fighters and destroying much of its arsenal. Hezbollah was further weakened in December when its Syrian ally, Bashar al-Assad, was toppled, cutting its overland supply route from Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-forces-to-stay-in-south-lebanon-beyond-withdrawal-deadline/7948894.html	2025-01-24T06:36:49-08:00

Russia, Ukraine report large-scale overnight drone attacks	Officials in Ukraine say Russia launched a barrage of drones in an overnight attack Friday killing at least two civilians, wounding several others and damaging commercial and residential buildings. The interior ministry said two victims were killed by drone debris in the central Kyiv region. It said a multistory residential building and commercial buildings were among the infrastructure that sustained damage during the attack. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said air defenses intercepted and destroyed some 120 drones over a dozen regions, including Moscow, overnight Friday, launched by Ukraine. No casualties were reported. U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he would talk soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to push the Russian leader to end his nearly three-year war on neighboring Ukraine. 'Millions of young lives are being wasted. That war is horrible,' Trump, via video link from Washington, told global business leaders meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He said that 'Ukraine is ready to make a deal,' although no peace negotiations have been announced. 'This is a war that never should’ve started.' Trump, three days into his second term in the White House, said he would ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to cut global oil prices, now about $77 a barrel, to curb Russia’s oil revenues, which it uses to fund the war. 'If the price comes down,' Trump said, 'the war in Ukraine will end immediately.' 'It’s so important to get that done,' he said. 'It’s time to end it.' Trump’s new remarks on the war came a day after he described the conflict as a 'ridiculous war' and told Putin in a social media message that if he didn’t move to end it, the U.S. would impose new tariffs, taxes and sanctions on Russian exports to the West. But the Kremlin was unmoved by Trump’s threat, saying Thursday it did not see any particularly new elements in U.S. policy toward Russia. 'He likes these methods, at least he liked them during his first presidency,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said Russia remains ready for 'mutually respectful dialogue' with the United States as Trump starts a four-year term in the White House. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-report-large-scale-overnight-drone-attacks/7948654.html	2025-01-24T01:29:46-08:00	
US agents raid New Jersey worksite as Trump escalates immigration crackdown	WASHINGTON — U.S. immigration agents rounded up undocumented migrants as well as American citizens in a raid of a Newark, New Jersey, worksite on Thursday that the city's mayor said involved detaining a military veteran and violations of the people's rights. The raid in New Jersey's most populous city, hailed in the past by Mayor Ras Baraka for its 'sanctuary' policies protecting migrants, follows President Donald Trump's pledge to deport millions of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Trump issued a raft of executive orders after taking office on Monday that aim to clamp down on illegal immigration. He has taken steps to punish officials who resist enforcement of his sweeping crackdown. In a raid of a business establishment in Newark, outside New York City, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents failed to produce a warrant as they detained 'undocumented residents as well as citizens,' Baraka said in a statement. 'One of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned,' Baraka said. In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said that agents 'may encounter U.S. citizens while conducting field work and may request identification to establish an individual’s identity as was the case during a targeted enforcement operation at a worksite today in Newark.' The spokesperson said that ICE was investigating the incident. Baraka said the raid had violated the citizens' rights under the U.S. Constitution. 'Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,' he said. Neither Baraka nor ICE identified the business raided by name. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on X that the Trump administration arrested 538 people Thursday, describing all of them as 'illegal immigrant criminals.' She said they included members of a Venezuelan prison gang and people convicted of sex crimes. Leavitt did not provide more details. A range of studies by academics and think tanks have shown that immigrants do not commit crime at a higher rate than native-born Americans. Other studies find that immigrants in the U.S. illegally also do not commit crimes at a higher rate. Sanctuary cities Baraka, the Newark mayor, is one of the first local officials in the U.S. to issue a statement on a specific raid following the start of Trump's immigration crackdown. In 2017, he signed an executive order cementing Newark's sanctuary status and was a vocal opponent of Trump's immigration policies during the president's first term. Of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally or with temporary status in 2022, about 44% lived in states with 'sanctuary' laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. That figure does not include those in sanctuary cities and counties in places without a statewide law, such as New Mexico. U.S. media outlets reported that federal law enforcement and ICE agents had arrested nearly 500 undocumented migrants wanted for outstanding crimes in sanctuary cities, including some from New York and New Jersey. The reports cited ICE officials who said the arrests took place Tuesday and Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agents-raid-new-jersey-worksite-as-trump-escalates-immigration-crackdown/7948613.html	2025-01-23T22:31:51-08:00	
Houthi rebels release crew of vessel seized in Red Sea in 2023	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Yemen's Houthi rebels have released the crew of the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier seized in November 2023 at the start of their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war. The move by the Iranian-backed Houthis marks their latest effort to de-escalate their attacks following a ceasefire in Gaza. However, it came as U.S. President Donald Trump moved to reinstate a terrorism designation he made on the group late in his first term that had been revoked by President Joe Biden, potentially setting the stage for new tensions with the rebels. The Houthis said they released the sailors after mediation by Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula that's long been an interlocutor with the Houthis. A Royal Air Force of Oman jet took a flight to Yemen earlier Wednesday and took off again about an hour after the Houthi announcement with the crew, who smiled as they stepped off into freedom in Muscat. The Houthis also said Hamas separately requested the release of the ship's crew of 25, who included mariners from the Philippines, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Mexico. 'This step comes in support of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza,' the Houthis said in a statement on rebel-controlled SABA news agency. In the Philippines, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. confirmed the release of 17 Filipino crew members, describing the moment as an 'utmost joy.' The Filipinos returned to their home country Thursday to welcomes from their families and government officials. Bulgaria’s Foreign Ministry confirmed the release of two Bulgarians identified by officials as the ship’s captain, Lyubomir Chanev, and assistant captain, Danail Veselinov. A government jet was on the way to Oman to bring the Bulgarians home, the ministry said. Hans Grundberg, the United Nations’ special envoy to Yemen, called the crew’s release 'heartwarming news that puts an end to the arbitrary detention and separation that they and their families endured for more than a year.' 'This is a step in the right direction, and I urge Ansar Allah to continue these positive steps on all fronts, including ending all maritime attacks,' he added, using another name for the Houthis. Vessel's link to Israeli billionaire The Houthis said they hijacked the Galaxy Leader over its connection to Israel. The attack launched the rebels' campaign targeting ships in international waters in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that connects them. A representative for the Galaxy Leader's owners had no comment Wednesday. The Bahamas-flagged vessel is affiliated with an Israeli billionaire, Abraham 'Rami' Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel. The Houthi attack on the Galaxy Leader saw the rebels launch a helicopter-borne raid. Propaganda footage of the raid has been played constantly by the Houthis, who even shot a music video aboard the ship at one point. On Monday, the Houthis signaled they now will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip, but warned wider assaults could resume if needed. However, it likely won’t be enough to encourage global firms to reenter the route that’s crucial for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Their attacks have halved traffic through the region, cutting deeply into revenues for Egypt, which runs the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. The release of the vessel's crew now may have been an effort to curry favor with the U.S., though the ship still remains moored off the Yemeni port city of Hodeida. 'This gesture by the Houthis may be intended as a goodwill measure towards the new Trump administration,' said Yemen expert Mohammed al-Basha, of the Basha Report risk advisory firm. However, Trump signed an order urging Secretary of State Marco Rubio to reinstate a foreign terrorist organization designation on the Houthis. Rubio separately called Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, who have led a coalition battling the Houthis since 2015. 'Under President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’ capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea,' the White House said. Biden lifted the designation early in his term, citing the humanitarian threat that the sanctions posed to ordinary Yemenis and to back an de facto ceasefire that still broadly holds in Yemen's war. Houthi attacks targeted over 100 commercial ships The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s military offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Houthis have sunk two vessels in their campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels had maintained that they only targeted ships linked to Israel, the U.S., or the U.K. However, many of the ships attacked had little or no connection, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. That may be due in part to the U.S. airstrike campaign. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthi-rebels-release-crew-of-vessel-seized-in-red-sea-in-2023-/7948607.html	2025-01-23T22:15:20-08:00	
US Air Force looks to upgrade Cyprus airbase as humanitarian staging post for the Middle East	NICOSIA, CYPRUS — Experts from the U.S. Air Force are looking at ways to upgrade Cyprus' premier air base for use as a humanitarian staging post in future operations in the Middle East, a Cypriot official told The Associated Press on Thursday. Cyprus, which is only 184 kilometers from the Lebanese capital, Beirut, has acted as a transit point for the repatriation of foreign nationals fleeing conflict in the Middle East and beyond on numerous occasions in the past. It has also served as a transit point for humanitarian aid to Gaza. Experts from the 435th Contingency Response Group based out of Ramstein, Germany, will spend the next few days at Andreas Papandreou Air Force Base to assess the upgrade needed to accommodate a wide array of U.S. air assets and other forces. A key priority is to ensure air traffic safety in and around the base, which abuts the island's second-largest civilian airport, the official said. The base's location makes it easy to transfer evacuees onto civilian aircraft at the adjacent airport for their trip home. The official spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to speak publicly about the details of the experts' visit. Air traffic safety would need to be enhanced through new high-tech installations, including state-of-the-art radar, to ensure the independent operation of civilian and military aircraft at safe distances. 'The Americans are very specific on safety issues and want to make some upgrades to further improve the base's safety,' the official said. Other essential upgrades include expanding both the base itself and the runway to accommodate more transport and fighter aircraft. Hardened shelters to protect those air assets are also envisioned. The Cyprus government agreed to the air base upgrade assessment following the recent deployment of a U.S. Marine contingent at the base. The Marines, who were equipped with V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft, were on stand-by in the event of a swift evacuation of US citizens from nearby Lebanon during Israel's strikes against Hezbollah targets late last year. Deputy government spokesman Yannis Antoniou told the state broadcaster Thursday that any use of the base by the forces of the U.S. or other nations would require prior Cyprus government approval. He insisted the air base would not act as a forward base for military strike operations against targets in the region. 'We've shown interest in working with (US. Forces) because we consider this to serve the vital interests of the Cyprus Republic,' Antoniou said, adding that in their report, the USAF experts will offer an estimate of the upgrade costs and which percentage of those the US government would be willing to cover. Bilateral relations between European Union member Cyprus and the U.S., especially in terms of military cooperation, have grown significantly over the last few years following a pledge by Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides to affirm the ethnically divided country's 'clear Western orientation.' A manifestation of those ties was last week's directive by former President Joe Biden that allows Cyprus to buy arms from the U.S. government and get surplus American military equipment. The Cypriot government noted the development as a tangible acknowledgment of Cyprus' reliability as a U.S. partner in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-air-force-looks-to-upgrade-cyprus-airbase-as-humanitarian-staging-post-for-the-middle-east/7948601.html	2025-01-23T21:09:23-08:00

Italy's highest court upholds slander conviction of Amanda Knox	Italy's highest court on Thursday upheld the slander conviction of American defendant Amanda Knox in a case related to the sensationalized 2007 murder of her British roommate. Knox was convicted of slandering her former boss, Congolese bar owner Patrick Lumumba, by falsely accusing him of murdering Meredith Kercher. A 21-year-old exchange student, Kercher was found stabbed to death in 2007 in the Perugia apartment she shared with Knox. While being interrogated, Knox, who was 20 at the time, signed two statements prepared by police regarding her accusation against Lumumba. Knox later wrote a handwritten note questioning her false accusation. Last year, an appeals court in Florence handed Knox a three-year sentence for wrongly accusing Lumumba. Knox, now 37 years old, had already served nearly four years during the investigation, initial murder trial and first appeal. She was convicted twice before Italy's highest court finally exonerated her of the crime in 2015. She is not at risk of any more jail time. Knox had appealed the slander conviction based on a European Court of Human Rights ruling that said her rights had been violated by police failure to provide a lawyer and adequate translator during a lengthy night of questioning just days after Kercher was killed. With the appeal, Knox was aiming to clear her name in Rome's Court of Cassation in the last remaining legal case against her following a nearly two-decades-long legal saga. But on Thursday, Judge Monica Boni confirmed the slander conviction. Knox, who did not attend the court, maintained her innocence in a post on X. 'It's a surreal day,' Knox said. 'I've just been found guilty yet again of a crime I didn't commit.' Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said he was surprised by the conviction. 'We cannot believe it. A totally unjust decision for Amanda and unexpected in our eyes,' he said. 'We are incredulous.' But Lumumba said he was satisfied with the verdict. 'Amanda was wrong. This verdict has to accompany her for the rest of her life,' he told The Associated Press. Rudy Guede, originally from the Ivory Coast, was eventually found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in prison for killing Kercher. He was released in 2021 after serving most of his sentence. He denied killing Kercher. Knox's lengthy legal saga was fodder for tabloids around the world and spawned books, movies and documentaries. Knox herself is currently producing a Hulu mini-series about her wrongful conviction and fight to clear her name. Social activist Monica Lewinsky is also producing the series. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-highest-court-upholds-slander-conviction-of-amanda-knox/7948531.html	2025-01-23T17:45:21-08:00

Multiple blazes continue in southern California	Firefighters in southern California continued to confront multiple blazes on Thursday amid high winds and dry conditions. The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near Castaic Lake broke out Wednesday, prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people. Health advisories for smoke and windblown dust and ash have been issued for areas near the Hughes Fire. 'Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,' Dr. Muntu Davis, L.A. County’s health officer, said in a statement. The Laguna Fire in Ventura County resulted in evacuation orders for California State University Channel Islands and University Glen, but the orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon. The evacuation warning for the Sepulveda Fire near Interstate 405 late Wednesday was lifted after firefighters stopped the fire’s progress after it had burned through less than 1 square kilometer. The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said Thursday the 'very gusty' offshore Santa Ana winds will continue in southern California with gusts that could reach as high at 105 kph in some mountain ranges. The winds, combined with Southern California’s 'very low humidity and dry antecedent conditions,' prompted the center to continue a Critical Risk of Fire Weather alert for Thursday and an Elevated Fire Weather Outlook for Friday. Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire with overnight aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire, northwest of Los Angeles, swelled to burn an area of more than 41 square kilometers near the Lake Castaic recreation area. The fire was about 14% contained early Thursday as forecasters warned of another day of dry and windy conditions that could make it difficult to keep fires from spreading. There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National Weather Service said some rain is expected in the area beginning Saturday. Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires. In addition to the Hughes Fire, crews are still battling the Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the foothills to the north of the city. The Palisades fire, at 95 square kilometers, is about 70% contained, while the Eaton, at 56 square kilometers, is about 95% contained, according to file officials. The fires that broke out in Southern California on Jan. 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the response to the fire, is expected to travel to Los Angeles on Friday. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/multiple-blazes-continue-in-southern-california/7948529.html	2025-01-23T17:08:31-08:00	
Trump orders release of last JFK, RFK, King assassination files	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the declassification Thursday of the last secret files on the assassination of the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy, a case that still fuels conspiracy theories more than 60 years after his death. Trump signed an executive order that will also release documents on the 1960s assassinations of JFK's younger brother, Robert F. Kennedy, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. 'That's a big one, huh? A lot of people have been waiting for this for years, for decades,' Trump told reporters as he signed the order in the Oval Office of the White House. After signing the order, Trump passed the pen he used to an aide, saying, 'Give that to RFK Jr.,' JFK's nephew and the current president's nominee to become secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The order Trump signed requires the 'full and complete release' of the JFK files, without redactions that he accepted back in 2017 when releasing most of the documents. 'It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay,' the order said. Trump had previously promised to release the last of the files, most recently at his inauguration on Monday. The U.S. National Archives has released tens of thousands of records in recent years related to the November 22, 1963, assassination of President Kennedy but held thousands back, citing national security concerns. It said at the time of the latest large-scale release, in December 2022, that 97% of the Kennedy records — which total 5 million pages — had now been made public. The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone. But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy's murder in Dallas, Texas, and the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various conspiracy theories. A gesture to RFK Jr. Trump's move is partly a gesture to one of the most prominent backers of those conspiracies — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself. RFK Jr. said in 2023 there was 'overwhelming evidence the CIA was involved' in his uncle JFK's murder and 'very convincing' evidence the agency was also behind the 1968 assassination of his own father, Robert F. Kennedy. The former attorney general was killed while campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president. Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-born Jordanian, was convicted of his murder. Thousands of John Kennedy assassination-related documents from the National Archives were released during Trump's first term in office, but he also held some back on national security grounds. Then-President Joe Biden said at the time of the December 2022 documents release that a 'limited' number of files would continue to be held back at the request of unspecified 'agencies.' Previous requests to withhold documents have come from the CIA and FBI. Kennedy scholars have said the documents still held by the archives are unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th U.S. president. Oswald, who had at one point defected to the Soviet Union, was shot to death two days after killing Kennedy by a nightclub owner, Jack Ruby, as he was being transferred from the city jail. Hundreds of books and movies such as the 1991 Oliver Stone film 'JFK' have fueled the conspiracy industry, pointing the finger at Cold War rivals Russia or Cuba, the Mafia and even Kennedy's vice president, Lyndon Johnson. King was assassinated in April 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray was convicted of the murder and died in prison in 1998, but King's children have expressed doubts in the past that Ray was the assassin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-release-of-last-jfk-rfk-king-assassination-files/7948500.html	2025-01-23T16:58:39-08:00	
Fighting reaches outskirts of eastern Congo's largest city as rebels close in	GOMA, CONGO — Panic spread in eastern Congo's main city on Thursday, with M23 rebels steadily inching closer to Goma and seizing a nearby town as they battle the Congolese army. Bombs were heard going off in the city's distant outskirts, and hundreds of wounded civilians were brought in to the main hospital from the area of the fighting. The rebel group has been making significant advances in recent weeks, closing in on Goma, which is home to around 2 million people and a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts. On Thursday, the rebels took Sake, a town only 27 kilometers (16 miles) from Goma and one of the last main routes into the provincial capital still under government control, according to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo, along the border with Rwanda, in a decades-long conflict that has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced by the fighting. Earlier this month, the M23 captured the towns of Minova, Katale and Masisi, west of Goma. 'The people of Goma have suffered greatly, like other Congolese,' an M23 spokesperson, Lawrence Kanyuka, said on X. 'M23 is on its way to liberate them, and they must prepare to welcome this liberation.' The M23 seized Goma in 2012 and controlled it for over a week. As news of the fighting spread, schools in Goma sent students home Thursday morning. 'We are told that the enemy wants to enter the city. That's why we are told to go home,' Hassan Kambale, a 19-year-old high school student, said. 'We are constantly waiting for the bombs.' Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing the M23, mainly composed of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army over a decade ago. Rwanda's government denies the claim but last year admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. On Wednesday, Congo's minister of communication, Patrick Muyaya, told French broadcaster France 24 that war with Rwanda is an 'option to consider.' Late Thursday, Guterres condemned, 'in the strongest terms, the renewed offensive launched by the 23 March Movement [M23],' including the 'seizure of Sake.' 'This offensive has a devastating toll on the civilian population and heightened the risk of a broader regional war,' Guterres' statement read. He also urged 'all parties to uphold human rights and international humanitarian law.' Earlier in the day, Congolese authorities claimed that the military pushed back an attack from the 'Rwandan army' on Sake. The Associated Press was unable to verify if Rwanda's army took part in the offensive. 'The population is in panic. The M23 now control large parts of the town,' said Leopold Mwisha, president of civil society of the area of Sake. Guterres said he was 'deeply troubled' by the most recent reports about the 'presence of Rwandan troops on Congolese soil and continued support to the M23.' The U.S. Embassy in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, in a notice Thursday warned of 'an increase in the severity of armed conflict near Sake' and advised U.S. nationals in North Kivu province, which includes Goma, to be on the alert in case they needed to leave their homes on short notice. The United Kingdom also issued a travel advisory that said M23 now controls Sake and urged British nationals to leave Goma while roads remained open. Many Sake residents have joined the more than 178,000 people who have fled the M23 advance in the last two weeks. The CBCA Ndosho hospital in Goma was stretched to the limit, with hundreds of newly wounded on Thursday. Thousands escaped the fighting by boat on Wednesday, making their way north across Lake Kivu and spilling out of packed wooden boats in Goma, some with bundles of their belongings strapped around their foreheads. Neema Matondo said she fled Sake during the night, when the first explosions started to go off. She recounted seeing people around her torn to pieces and killed. 'We escaped, but unfortunately,' others did not, Matondo told AP. Mariam Nasibu, who fled Sake with her three children, was in tears — one of her children lost a leg, blown off in the relentless shelling. 'As I continued to flee, another bomb fell in front of me, hitting my child,' she said, crying.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fighting-reaches-outskirts-of-eastern-congo-s-largest-city-as-rebels-close-in-/7948493.html	2025-01-23T16:40:46-08:00	
Will Trump spark a mineral 'gold rush' in Greenland?	NUUK, GREENLAND — The mineral wealth on the Arctic island of Greenland is in the global spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants to take control of the territory from Denmark, prompting alarm from European allies. Trump's words were echoed in a January 12 interview on 'Fox News Sunday' by Vice President JD Vance, who said, 'There is a deal to be made in Greenland,' and that the island has 'a lot of great natural resources.' Until now, Greenland's mining industry has struggled to turn a profit, but could that be about to change? 'Full of minerals' Greenland currently has only one active commercial mine — White Mountain —located north of the capital, Nuuk, and gets its stark, monochrome color from anorthosite rock, which is rich in calcium deposits and other minerals. The mine's operator, Lumina Sustainable Materials, ships the rock from Greenland's western coastline to Asia, Europe and North America, where it is used to make a variety of products such as fiberglass, paint, fillers, cement and polymers. Efforts are under way to exploit aluminum deposits within the anorthosite. 'Greenland is a country full of minerals. We have, literally, minerals available all over the place,' Bent Olsvig Jensen, Lumina's managing director in Greenland, told VOA in an interview. Dozens of other mining companies from around the world are conducting exploration and feasibility studies across Greenland, although White Mountain remains the only commercial operation currently trading. China competition The minerals include plentiful rare earth elements such as lithium and scandium, which are critical for devices such as batteries. Global supply chains for those elements are currently dominated by China. Trump has repeatedly said that U.S. control of Greenland is necessary for 'international security.' His comments caused a political storm in Greenland and Denmark, but mining companies see an opportunity. 'His interest in Greenland can actually help the industry get access to further investment, which is needed for the industry to develop in Greenland,' Jensen said. 'So, yes, I definitely welcome it. And I think it's important that both from the industry side but also from the political side in Greenland that we position ourselves towards Trump and the U.S.' 'Not for sale' Greenland's government is largely autonomous, although Denmark is responsible for the island's security. Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for resources, emphasized the government's long-held response to Trump's interest: Open for business, but not for sale. 'We do want American investments. We do want collaboration with the U.S. State Department, and we've been trying to advocate for that for some time,' she told VOA. Greenland signed a deal with Trump during his first administration in 2019 to boost the mining industry. 'The U.S. funded our direct marketing towards investors all over the world, and this agreement has just come to its end. So we've been trying to … get engagement from the U.S. for some time now in order to renew this deal,' Nathanielsen said. Challenges Despite widespread recognition of Greenland's mineral wealth, attracting investment in mining has been a long-term problem. 'For many years now, we have seen that there has been some hesitance in the investor environment to engage in high-risk, long-term projects. We only have one American-owned license at the moment. In comparison, we have 23 from Canada, 23 from the U.K. and about 10 from Denmark. So, it's not an area where you see a lot of U.S. engagement as of now. Of course we welcome it, and there's plenty of opportunity,' Nathanielsen said. Greenland's government is pushing for full independence from Denmark. Supporters hope the island's mineral wealth could one day provide the economic foundation for full statehood. But there's a long way to go, said Ulrik Pram Gad, an analyst at the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen. 'If you want minerals out of the ground and financing Greenlandic self-sufficiency economically, then you will need to have the uptake in the international processing going,' Gad told VOA. 'And then, probably you'll have to think very closely about how to make sure that these mining projects benefit people who live close to them, rather than being a new version of imperialist extraction. Because then, the Greenlanders might not want it in the end,' he explained. The risk doesn't always end in reward. Rubies and pink sapphires were extracted at the Aappaluttoq mine until 2023, when its operator, Greenland Ruby, went bankrupt, $71 million in debt. The company is restructuring and seeking new investors, with a goal of restarting operations. Greenland's 2.1 million square kilometers of land is icebound for much of the year. 'Obviously, we are in the middle of the Arctic, so there are some logistical challenges,' Jensen of Lumina said. 'Not all of Greenland is open all year round. However, that is something that we can plan our way out of.' Jensen added that investors must have patience to make a profit. 'It takes time to develop a project from the early-stage exploration until you actually have a mine where you can extract and start selling. And as we all say in mining, 'Time is money.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/will-trump-spark-a-mineral-gold-rush-in-greenland-/7948233.html	2025-01-23T16:29:02-08:00

Trump signs executive orders on AI, cryptocurrency and issues more pardons	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order related to AI to 'make America the world capital in artificial intelligence,' his aide told reporters in the White House's Oval Office. The order sets a 180-day deadline for an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan to create a policy 'to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.' Trump also told his AI adviser and national security assistant to work to remove policies and regulations put in place by former President Joe Biden. Trump on Monday revoked a 2023 executive order signed by Biden that sought to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence poses to consumers, workers and national security. Biden's order required developers of AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security, the economy, public health or safety to share the results of safety tests with the U.S. government, in line with the Defense Production Act, before they were released to the public. Trump also signed an executive order creating a cryptocurrency working group tasked with proposing a new regulatory framework for digital assets and exploring the creation of a cryptocurrency stockpile. The much-anticipated action also ordered that banking services for crypto companies be protected, and banned the creation of central bank digital currencies that could compete with existing cryptocurrencies. The order sees Trump fulfill a campaign trail pledge to be a 'crypto president and promote the adoption of digital assets.' That is in stark contrast to Biden's regulators that, in a bid to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering, cracked down on crypto companies, suing exchanges Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and dozens more in federal court, alleging they were flouting U.S. laws. The working group will be made up of the Treasury secretary, attorney general and chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, along with other agency heads. The group is tasked with developing a regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. The group is also set to 'evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile ... potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.' In December, Trump named venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks as the crypto and artificial intelligence czar. He will chair the group, the order said. Finally, Trump signed pardons for 23 anti-abortion protesters on Thursday in the Oval Office of the White House. The pardons came a day before anti-abortion protesters were due to descend on Washington for the annual March for Life.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-executive-orders-on-ai-cryptocurrency-issues-more-pardons-/7948209.html	2025-01-23T15:08:40-08:00

Kidnapped Israeli Russian researcher alive; Baghdad working on release	WASHINGTON — Iraqi officials said that an Israeli Russian researcher, who was kidnapped by an Iraqi militia nearly two years ago, is alive, and that they are working to secure her release. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein on Thursday told an Axios reporter in Davos, Switzerland, that Elizabeth Tsurkov, a Princeton doctoral candidate, is alive and that Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani was working on her release, according to Reuters. Tsurkov, 39, was abducted in Baghdad in March 2023 shortly after her arrival in the Iraqi capital. The dual Israeli Russian citizen had traveled to Iraq to conduct fieldwork for her dissertation. Israeli citizens are forbidden from traveling to Iraq, but Tsurkov used her Russian passport to enter the country, according to the Israeli government. The Israeli government said in July 2023 that Tsurkov was being held by Kataib Hezbollah, a powerful Shia militia that has ties to the Iraqi government and Iran. In November 2023, Kataib Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, released a proof-of-life video of Tsurkov, the only confirmed evidence of her fate to date. Her sister, Emma Tsurkov, said the family was 'pleased to see the Iraqi government acknowledge what we already know: Elizabeth is alive and being held hostage in Iraq by militias aligned with the Iraqi prime minister. 'At the same time, we are fed up with empty promises from the Iraqi government to get her released with no real follow-through,' she told VOA. Last year, Emma Tsurkov and two other siblings launched an extensive campaign in Washington during an official visit by Sudani. During a panel discussion hosted by the Atlantic Council, Emma Tsurkov interrupted the Iraqi leader, protesting Baghdad’s inaction in securing her sister’s release. In response, Sudani stated that his government had formed a task force to follow up with Tsurkov’s case. The U.S. State Department had confirmed that Tsurkov’s case was raised by former President Joe Biden during his White House meeting with Sudani. Emma Tsurkov said the family 'knows that Elizabeth’s case is already on the radar of the new SPEHA,' referring to Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump’s nominee for special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. Boehler must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can formally begin his role. 'We are confident the Trump team will hold the Iraqi government accountable and make Elizabeth’s safe return a real priority and not just a talking point like the last administration,' Emma Tsurkov said. VOA contacted the State Department for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kidnapped-israeli-russian-researcher-alive-baghdad-working-on-release/7948151.html	2025-01-23T14:18:43-08:00	
Elon Musk and the legacy of moguls in American politics	Business has been intertwined with American politics since before the nation’s founding. And although unelected business leaders play a major role in financing campaigns and policy initiatives, few in recent memory have taken as personal and public a role in politics as Elon Musk. Even before the 2024 election, the South African-born entrepreneur often interacted with the U.S. government via his companies. His electric car manufacturer, Tesla, has received green energy subsidies, while his company Space X holds multiple contracts with NASA and the U.S. military to provide space-launch services, develop vehicles and operate flights. Through SpaceX, Musk also played a key role in U.S. support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion by providing Starlink satellite internet terminals to Ukrainian forces. Musk’s involvement in the war became a source of concern after reports emerged that he was directly making decisions regarding the terminals’ use in the field and was in personal contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials. Musk attained an even more notable role in the media through his 2022 purchase of social media platform Twitter, which had become a de facto public square where journalists, companies and government officials made public announcements and engaged in discussion alongside regular users. Renaming the site X, Musk overhauled verification and content moderation policies to combat what he described as left-wing bias, reinstating President Donald Trump’s account as well as multiple accounts that had been banned for hate speech. As the presidential election drew near, Musk used the platform to boost Trump’s policy positions, eventually making campaign appearances alongside him and sitting in on his calls with foreign leaders. Musk’s involvement culminated in the businessman being announced as head of a new advisory commission on government efficiency, named after an internet meme and cryptocurrency that Musk himself had popularized. But while Musk’s involvement in U.S. politics may be unusual compared to his contemporaries, it recalls earlier eras when larger-than-life business leaders exercised great influence over the country’s affairs. J.P. Morgan (1837-1913) Having made his early career on Wall Street, John Pierpont Morgan gained fame by reorganizing the country’s booming railroad industry in the wake of the Civil War. By organizing conferences among railroad companies and consolidating the ones he held shares in, he helped create an integrated rail system, as he would later do with the nation’s steel production. When the economic panic of 1893 saw the U.S. running out of gold reserves, Morgan’s company stepped in to bail out the government, supplying gold in exchange for Treasury bonds. Then in 1907, when a financial panic threatened to collapse the nation’s banks, Morgan was again credited with saving the country by bringing together bank executives and forcing them to agree on a mutual stabilization plan. Morgan is remembered as a serious businessman who prioritized stability over speculation and supported hospitals, museums and universities through his philanthropic efforts. But Morgan’s integration of railroad and steel industries created monopolies that inspired the nation’s earliest antitrust laws. Moreover, the fact that the U.S. government twice had to rely on a private businessman to bail out its finances became a major cause for concern, leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve. Henry Ford (1863-1947) Henry Ford is best known for developing the first mass-produced automobile, making what was previously a luxury product affordable for the average consumer. Beyond the road, Ford popularized the assembly line and the 40-hour workweek as well as setting higher wage standards under the reasoning that better-paid and happier workers would be more productive and able to buy the cars they made. Ford believed that industry and consumerism would not only benefit the economy but promote world peace, actively campaigning against war as a waste of productivity. Having failed to prevent U.S. entry into World War I, Ford dutifully supplied the war effort and quieted his activism, but he still ran for U.S. Senate in 1918 — a race he narrowly lost. Yet not all aspects of Ford’s reputation have aged well. The tycoon’s paternalistic and generous approach to his employees went hand-in-hand with his adamant opposition to unionization efforts and worker strikes, which were suppressed by force. His pacifism had a darker side as well. Ford was notably antisemitic and believed that Jewish people had been responsible for World War I as well as multiple ills in American society. After buying the Dearborn Independent newspaper in 1918, Ford used it to publish multiple antisemitic conspiracy theories, stopping only after threats of a boycott against his companies. As part of the America First Committee, Ford campaigned against U.S. entry into World War II and continued to do business with Nazi Germany up until the U.S. declared war in 1941. William Randolph Hearst (1863-1951) As owner of the San Francisco Examiner and the New York Morning Journal, Hearst built a media empire while pioneering a form of sensationalistic reporting that came to be known as 'yellow journalism.' The Journal’s exaggerated reports of Spain’s colonial violence in Cuba inflamed American opinion and increased calls to intervene. When Congress eventually declared war on Spain in 1898, Hearst personally traveled to Cuba to cover the conflict. Hearst’s media operations would later expand to more than two dozen newspapers in multiple cities, as well as magazines and book publishers. After setting his sights on politics, Hearst briefly served in the U.S. House of Representatives for New York’s 11th district but narrowly lost subsequent mayoral and gubernatorial bids. Hearst’s papers had published editorials violently denouncing President William McKinley, and he was blamed for incitement upon McKinley’s assassination in 1901. Initially a progressive populist, Hearst shifted toward right-wing isolationism in the wake of World War I and the 1917 Russian Revolution. While denouncing President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal policies as anti-American, Hearst expressed admiration for Hitler and published articles by the German leader. Nevertheless, Hearst supported U.S. entry into World War II following the attack on Pearl Harbor, shifting his focus to promoting anti-Asian sentiment and the internment of Japanese Americans. Today, Hearst is remembered as the real-life inspiration for the film 'Citizen Kane,' which was made during his lifetime and which he sought to block from being released. Conclusion Tycoons who shaped American politics in past eras inspired admiration and controversy, their impact becoming clear only in hindsight. It remains to be seen whether Musk’s influence will outlast the Trump administration, and whether other modern-day moguls will follow his example.	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-and-the-legacy-of-moguls-in-american-politics/7948108.html	2025-01-23T13:35:08-08:00	
Senate confirms Trump’s choice for CIA director	washington — U.S. lawmakers confirmed a key member of President Donald Trump’s national security team Thursday, voting 74-25 to make John Ratcliffe director of the country’s premier spy agency. The vote came three days after Trump took the oath of office as the 47th president of the United States and three days after a plea from the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee for a speedy vote on Ratcliffe’s nomination to lead the CIA. 'Our world is far too dangerous for any delay in having a Senate-confirmed leader in charge of the CIA,' Senators Tom Cotton and Mark Warner said in a statement Monday, after their committee advanced Ratcliffe by a 14-3 margin. Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term in office, earned praise from Republican lawmakers following his confirmation hearing last week. 'Under the Biden administration, the intelligence community made some notable misses,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, told fellow lawmakers Tuesday, citing failures to anticipate the rapid collapse of the U.S.-supported Afghan government in 2021 and the incorrect predictions that Russian forces would quickly overrun Ukrainian defenses at the start of the Kremlin’s invasion. 'Mr. Ratcliffe brings the right experience and the right approach to the CIA,' he said. 'The nation needs a strong, capable and aggressive CIA,' Cotton, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, told Ratcliffe at his confirmation hearing last week. 'I believe the men and women you will lead want to serve in just that kind of agency. They joined the CIA, after all, not a church choir or a therapy session,' he added. But the confirmation vote was delayed after criticism from some leading Democrats. 'I want the record to show that I strongly oppose the nomination,' Democrat Ron Wyden said Tuesday. 'In 2020, I opposed his confirmation to be director of national intelligence because I believe his partisanship and willingness essentially went to the proposition of doing what would please Donald Trump,' he said. 'Unfortunately, his actions as head of national intelligence only confirmed my concerns.' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer echoed that opposition before Thursday’s vote. 'I will respectfully vote no, not because of our political difference, which of course exists, but because I am deeply worried that Mr. Ratcliffe will be unable to stand up to people like Donald Trump and Tulsi Gabbard, who are known to falsify intelligence,' he said. 'There may be no agency more important than the CIA that has to be fact-based. Sometimes, these facts will lead to inconvenient conclusions for his superiors and the president,' he said. 'It’s in those cases where truth, not fiction, not ideology, must prevail, and I have my doubts that Mr. Ratcliffe will be able to hold firm.' Gabbard, a veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard and a former Democratic lawmaker, is Trump’s choice to be the next director of national intelligence. Her confirmation hearing has been scheduled for next week, when she will be asked about accusations from both Democrats and some Republicans that she has repeated Russian disinformation and about her 2017 meeting with former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who stands accused of war crimes. Ratcliffe’s opponents have accused him of defying Congress and withholding information in the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi – a killing that U.S. intelligence concluded was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They also have criticized Ratcliffe, in his role as director of national intelligence, for the September 2020 release of a Russian intelligence assessment that seemed to back Trump’s allegations of nefarious activity by his opponent in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton. But that decision, and others by Ratcliffe to push back against previous U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia had endeavored to help Trump win the 2016 election, is part of what endeared him to the president. Ratcliffe indicated during his confirmation hearing that substantial changes would be in store for the CIA, saying it needed to be more aggressive both in collecting human intelligence and in countering U.S. adversaries. 'We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in every corner of the globe no matter how dark or difficult,' he told lawmakers at the time. 'We will conduct covert actions at the direction of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do. 'To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,' Ratcliffe added. 'If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.' That mantra, according to some analysts, has resonated with both Republicans and Democrats. 'There was criticism throughout the hearing that the CIA has gone soft on collecting human intelligence, on stealing foreign adversary secrets,' Tyler McBrien, the managing editor of Lawfare, told VOA. 'A lot of criticisms about how the CIA has failed to predict in the past four years major geopolitical events, including the fall of the Assad regime and even the New Orleans terrorist attack. 'Ratcliffe really is focused on that human intelligence aspect and also a reorientation toward what he sees as the biggest national security threat, which is China,' McBrien said. Ratcliffe has promised lawmakers that under his leadership the CIA will deliver insights free of political bias and that he will not lead a purge of employees based on their perceived political views or perceived loyalty to Trump. He also promised to reinvigorate CIA investigations into the cause of Havana Syndrome — the name given to a series of brain injuries and other serious health ailments that have struck hundreds of U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials. And he voiced support for maintaining controversial U.S. surveillance authorities under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, calling it an indispensable tool.

Trump promises global businesses lower taxes for products made in US, tariffs if not	U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday invited global businesses to manufacture their products in the U.S. and promised them lower taxes but warned if they choose to produce their goods elsewhere, they would have to pay tariffs to export them to the United States. 'America is back and open for business,' Trump, in a video linkup from Washington, told corporate leaders meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 'My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth,' Trump said. 'But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff.' Trump, three days into his second term in the White House, said he wants to cut the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21 to 15%, although that needs approval from his political allies in the Republican-controlled Congress. Lawmakers have begun debating how to extend and reshape personal and corporate tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump's first term in office. Trump promised the U.S. would supply Europe with the liquified natural gas it needs but contended that the European Union treats the United States 'very, very unfairly' with the extent of regulations it imposes on American businesses operating in the 27-nation bloc. The president complained specifically about tariffs and environmental impact statements for new construction projects, calling them 'things you shouldn't have to do.' Trump promised that his administration would make the U.S., already the world's biggest economy, 'a manufacturing superpower' and said the government during his four-year term would eliminate 10 business regulations for every new one that is imposed. He said he plans to ask Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut the price of oil they produce to boost the global economy. He contended that if the current global oil price — about $77 a barrel — is cut, 'the war in Ukraine will end immediately.' Russia uses revenue from its own oil production to help fund its three-year war on neighboring Ukraine. Trump said that in the global economy, the U.S. 'just wants to be treated fairly by other countries.'

US lawmakers seek to end China's special trade status, import exemption	WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill on Thursday that would revoke China's preferential trade status with the United States, phase in steep tariffs and end the 'de minimis' exemption for low-value Chinese imports. The bill, introduced by John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House of Representatives select committee on China, comes after President Donald Trump issued a memo on Monday asking his cabinet to assess legislation on the Permanent Normal Trade Relations designation for Beijing. Congress approved PNTR for China in 2000, paving the way for its entry into the World Trade Organization. But the U.S. has routinely found the large role of the state in China's economy, including hefty government subsidies for strategic industries, to violate the global trade body's rules. Trump, who has railed against China's vast trade surplus with the U.S., has vowed more duties on Chinese goods. Moolenaar's Restoring Trade Fairness Act was co-sponsored by Democratic Representative Tom Suozzi and introduced with a companion bill in the Senate. Moolenaar said granting China PNTR had ushered in waves of Chinese imports, depleted U.S. manufacturing and made the U.S. susceptible to economic coercion from its 'foremost adversary.' 'This gamble failed,' Moolenaar said in a statement. 'This legislation will safeguard U.S. national security, enhance supply chain resilience, and bring manufacturing jobs back to America and our allies.' China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The path for the bill to become law was not immediately clear, but Republicans hold majorities in both the House and Senate. Lawmakers from both parties say they want to increase U.S. companies' ability to compete with China. Waves of U.S. tariffs by Trump in his first term and by the Biden administration had effectively ended PNTR treatment for China. Nonetheless, the proposed legislation would end annual recertification of the designation and codify minimum 35% tariffs for non-strategic goods and minimum 100% tariffs for strategic goods. The duties would be phased in over five years — 10% in the first year, 25% in the second year, 50% in year four and 100% by year five. The bill would also end de minimis treatment for certain 'covered nations,' including China. Trump has called for changes to the $800 de minimis duty-free exemption for low-value shipments often blamed for illicit imports of fentanyl precursor chemicals from China. Critics of de minimis say it contributes to the United States' trade deficit with China — $279 billion in 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-seek-to-end-china-s-special-trade-status-import-exemption/7947991.html	2025-01-23T11:59:41-08:00	
US judge temporarily blocks Trump's order ending birthright citizenship	SEATTLE, WASHINGTON — A U.S. federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's executive order redefining birthright citizenship, calling it 'blatantly unconstitutional' during the first hearing in a multistate effort challenging the order. The temporary restraining order sought by Arizona, Illinois, Oregon and Washington was the first to get a hearing before a judge and applies nationally. The case is one of five lawsuits being brought by 22 states and several immigrant rights groups across the country. The suits include personal testimonies from attorneys general who are U.S. citizens by birthright and name pregnant women who are afraid their children won't become U.S. citizens. U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, a Ronald Reagan appointee, began the hearing by grilling the administration's attorneys, saying the order 'boggles the mind.' 'This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,' Coughenour told Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer. Coughenour said he's been on the bench for more than four decades and couldn't remember seeing another case where the action challenged was so clearly unconstitutional. Shumate said he respectfully disagreed and asked the judge for an opportunity to have a full briefing on the merits of the case, rather than the judge issuing a 14-day restraining order blocking its implementation. Trump's executive order, which he signed on Inauguration Day, is slated to take effect on Feb. 19. It could affect hundreds of thousands of people born in the country, according to one of the lawsuits. In 2022, there were about 255,000 births of citizen children to mothers living in the country illegally and about 153,000 births to two such parents, according to the four-state suit filed in Seattle. The Trump administration argued in papers filed Wednesday that the states don't have grounds to bring a suit against the order and that no damage has yet been done, so temporary relief isn't called for. The administration's attorneys also clarified that the executive order only applies to people born after Feb. 19, when it is to take effect. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas; Canada and Mexico are among them. The lawsuits argue that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship for people born and naturalized in the U.S., and states have been interpreting the amendment that way for a century. Ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, the amendment says: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' Trump's order asserts that the children of noncitizens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and orders federal agencies to not recognize citizenship for children who don't have at least one parent who is a citizen. A key case involving birthright citizenship unfolded in 1898. The Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the country. But some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that the case clearly applied to children born to parents who were both legal immigrants. They say it's less clear whether it applies to children born to parents living in the country illegally. Trump's order prompted attorneys general to share their personal connections to birthright citizenship. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, for instance, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the nation's first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the lawsuit was personal for him. 'There is no legitimate legal debate on this question. But the fact that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from inflicting serious harm right now on American families like my own,' Tong said this week. One of the lawsuits aimed at blocking the executive order includes the case of a pregnant woman, identified as 'Carmen,' who is not a citizen but has lived in the United States for more than 15 years and has a pending visa application that could lead to permanent residency status. 'Stripping children of the 'priceless treasure' of citizenship is a grave injury,' the suit says. 'It denies them the full membership in U.S. society to which they are entitled.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-s-order-ending-birthright-citizenship/7947939.html	2025-01-23T11:48:53-08:00

UK teenager jailed for at least 52 years for girls' murders	LONDON — A British teenager who murdered three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event was jailed for at least 52 years on Thursday, for an atrocity prosecutors said was so violent it appeared he had tried to decapitate one of the victims. On Monday, Axel Rudakubana, 18, admitted carrying out the killings last July in the northern English town of Southport, a crime which was followed by days of nationwide rioting. Rudakubana will likely spend the rest of his life in jail for the murders of Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, who were among 26 children attending the summer vacation event. He also pleaded guilty to 10 charges of attempted murder, as well as to producing the deadly poison ricin and possessing an al-Qaida training manual. Two of his victims suffered 'horrific injuries which ... are difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature,' prosecutor Deanna Heer told Liverpool Crown Court. Judge Julian Goose described Rudakubana's actions as 'evil,' saying: 'I am sure that Rudakubana had a settled and determined intention to carry out these offenses and that, had he been able to, he would have killed each and every child, all 26 of them, as well as any adults who got in his way.' The judge sentenced Rudakubana in his absence after he refused to return to court, having twice been removed for interrupting the hearing. Goose said he was not allowed by law to impose a life sentence without the possibility of parole as Rudakubana was 17 at the time of his crimes, but added: 'It is likely that he will never be released and that he will be in custody for all his life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-teenager-jailed-for-at-least-52-years-for-girls-murders/7947723.html	2025-01-23T09:06:36-08:00	
Rubio heads to Central America amid Trump's push to reclaim Panama Canal	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to visit Panama and other countries in Central America amid President Donald Trump’s push to reclaim the Panama Canal and Washington’s efforts to curb illegal migration. The trip is expected to mark Rubio’s first foreign visit as secretary of state. U.S. news outlet Politico reported that Rubio’s itinerary includes stops in Panama, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. A State Department spokesperson told VOA, 'We don’t have any travel to announce at this time.' President Trump has said he has not ruled out the possibility of either military or economic measures to achieve his stated goal of bringing the Panama Canal back under U.S. control. Earlier this week, Rubio outlined his foreign policy priorities, including halting the mass entry of undocumented migrants into the United States. 'The State Department will no longer undertake any activities that facilitate or encourage mass migration,' Rubio said in a statement. 'Our diplomatic relations with other countries, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, will prioritize securing America’s borders, stopping illegal and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal immigrants' to their home countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-heads-to-central-america-amid-trump-s-push-to-reclaim-panama-canal/7947641.html	2025-01-23T08:32:29-08:00	
Vietnam's media restructuring will lead to more propaganda, critics warn	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — Critics warn that Vietnam's ongoing push to restructure the country's media will allow authorities to have tighter control over news outlets and more effectively spread propaganda. The media restructuring started in 2019 when former Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc signed the 'National Press Development and Management Planning until 2025' policy. According to the plan, 180 press organizations will be shut down, and 8,000 reporters and editors will lose their jobs. Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates, told VOA the media restructuring has become more severe under General Secretary To Lam, who took over as leader of the Communist Party after the July 2024 death of his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong. 'There's little doubt that this so-called ‘reform’ will result in the Vietnamese people getting even less real news,' Robertson wrote in an email. 'This is precisely the path one expects an authoritarian like To Lam to take, doubling down on government control of what the people hear and see.' To Lam’s broader ambitions for government reform include consolidating 14 ministries into seven. Under the government’s plan, dubbed Resolution 18, each ministry will be allowed to have one official news publication, further cutting the number of news outlets in the country. The move could cut the number of news outlets in half, some analysts say. The government plans to concentrate resources into six national media conglomerates. The six outlets include Nhan Dan — the newspaper of the Communist Party — as well as the outlets of the Defense Ministry and Public Security Ministry. Vietnam Television will become the sole national television channel, absorbing smaller broadcasters. On Jan. 15, broadcasts for 13 channels operating under Vietnam Multimedia Corporation, or VTC, ended, along with Voice of Vietnam TV and Nhan Dan TV. VTC was the country’s second-most-popular television broadcaster and had been operating for 20 years. One 21-year-old journalism student was working as an intern at VTC in Hanoi when it shut down at midnight on Jan. 15. He said all the staff gathered on the first floor and had a countdown until all the TV monitors were turned off. Afterwards, they had fireworks. He said approximately 1,000 VTC employees lost their jobs that night. 'Everyone was crying,' he said, asking to be referred to as Justin. 'After 20 years working at the station, doing a lot of collaboration, doing a lot of programs, doing a lot of special news, they have been kicked out for no reason. That's how they are feeling.' A regular VTC viewer in northern Vietnam who described herself as a housewife said it's painful to see the broadcast shuttered. 'Honestly, I don't want any channel to close,' she wrote on Facebook in Vietnamese. 'I consider those channels as family members. Losing a channel is like losing a person.' 'Bitter medicine' On Dec. 1, To Lam spoke during a national conference on the implementation of Resolution 18. He stated the restructuring is designed to streamline the political system and remove institutional bottlenecks. 'This is really a difficult issue,' To Lam said. 'It will involve thoughts, feelings, aspirations and affect the interests of a number of individuals and organizations. 'The implementation in many units will certainly encounter difficulties,' the General Secretary said. 'However, we still have to proceed because to have a healthy body, sometimes we have to ‘take bitter medicine.’' Trinh Huu Long, a democracy advocate and co-founder of the Taiwan-based nonprofit Legal Initiatives for Vietnam, said the government is rushing to finalize its media restructuring and the consolidation of government ministries. 'Everyone is working around the clock,' he said. 'They're planning to finish everything in March, when the Congress will hold a special session to rubber stamp this massive restructure.' Nguyen Hong Hai, a senior lecturer at Hanoi's VinUniversity, told VOA that while working in the public sector, he saw the need for reform firsthand. 'There's the fact that there are a lot of employees who are not working, in the real sense, and there's a lot of waste,' he said. 'Every society needs reforms. But the thing is, how to do it effectively?' Justin, the journalism student in Hanoi, supports the government reforms although he said change is happening 'too fast' and without new opportunities for those who lost their livelihoods. That includes his uncle, who worked for VTC for some 20 years. 'We have cried, but we still 100% agree with what the government decided,' he said. 'We just want to comment, ‘Please, if you want to kick me out, give me a new job.’ … Do not change so rapidly so that people will be shocked, like right now, kicked out from the job and with no other proposal for the future.' Pushing propaganda Long said that as Hanoi focuses its resources into six national media conglomerates, authorities will have more power to push Hanoi's agenda. 'The government will invest in a small number of state agencies to make them a lot more effective in propaganda,' Long said. 'The number one function of every state-media outlet is to promote and defend the [Communist] Party. Serving readers is secondary.' In a November 2024 report, Legal Initiatives for Vietnam stated that there are currently 17 independent journalists behind bars in the country, all of whom were jailed within the last five years. While all media outlets in Vietnam undergo government censorship, some outlets are funded by private corporations, although they must receive their licenses from government ministries. Long said these semi-privatized outlets, which have been the most professionalized and provided news which has not entirely aligned with Hanoi and government policy, are being pushed out. 'The quality is going to go south very, very quickly,' he said. Long gave the example of Zing News. In July 2023 the news site was suspended for three months after it was investigated by the Ministry of Information and Communications. The outlet came back after the suspension but was rebranded as Z News and the quality and frequency of its content was greatly downgraded, effectively making the outlet 'irrelevant,' Long said. He said that the outlet was punished for writing articles about Russia's war on Ukraine that created 'pro-Ukraine sentiment among the Vietnamese public.' 'They published a lot of articles about the Ukraine war that fell out of the [Communist] Party's line, which is always to be pro-Russia,' Long said. A researcher of Vietnamese media, who asked to remain anonymous due to safety concerns, told VOA that the digitizing of national media allows it to 'masquerade' propaganda as news. 'I think it's very depressing. … It's going to be uniform news, and it's going to be only from the government's point of view,' the researcher said. 'There's going to be fewer and fewer people dedicated to work as journalists and seeking out the news that matters to the Vietnamese people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-media-restructuring-will-lead-to-more-propaganda-critics-warn/7947621.html	2025-01-23T08:26:04-08:00	
ICC seeks arrest warrants for top Taliban leaders in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced Thursday that he is seeking arrest warrants for high-ranking Taliban leaders in Afghanistan accused of crimes against humanity, citing widespread discrimination against the country’s female population. Karim Khan identified the suspects as the Taliban supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, and his chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, saying his action is based on a thorough investigation and evidence collected in the process. 'My Office has concluded that these two Afghan nationals are criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women … and persons whom the Taliban perceived as allies of girls and women,' Khan stated. He noted that the persecution has been ongoing since August 2021, when the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan and imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. Khan said, without elaborating, that his office would soon file additional applications seeking arrests of other senior Taliban members. ICC judges are now required to review the applications before deciding whether to issue an arrest warrant for Akhundzada and Haqqani. Experts anticipate the process could take weeks or even months. 'These applications recognize that Afghan women and girls, as well as the LGBTQI+ community, are facing an unprecedented, unconscionable, and ongoing persecution by the Taliban,' Khan stated. 'Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable. Afghan survivors, in particular women and girls, deserve accountability before a court of law,' added the chief prosecutor. The Hague-based ICC is mandated to rule on the world’s worst offenses, such as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court has no police force and relies on its 125 member states to execute its arrest warrants. Taliban officials did not immediately offer any response to the ICC announcement. Akhundzada, who governs the country from the southern city of Kandahar, has issued numerous edicts over the past three-and-a-half years, imposing extensive restrictions on Afghan women and girls that the United Nations has condemned as 'gender apartheid.' Girls are banned from pursuing education beyond the sixth grade, including attending institutions that train midwives and nurses. Most women are prohibited from working in both the public and private sectors. They are blocked from visiting public parks, gyms, and baths. The Taliban have mandated that females cover their faces in public and that they cannot travel long distances without a male guardian — making Afghanistan the only country in the world to impose such bans on women and girls. The U.N. and global rights groups have condemned the bans and demanded the Taliban reverse their restrictions on women, saying they are a key sticking point in the Afghan authorities’ pursuit of official recognition for their government in Kabul. The Taliban have vehemently defended their governance, asserting that their policies align with Sharia and Afghan culture. Taliban leaders say all Afghan citizens’ rights are provided for under Islamic law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-seeks-arrest-warrants-for-top-taliban-leaders-in-afghanistan/7947612.html	2025-01-23T07:57:11-08:00

Same-sex marriages in Thailand now legal	Bangkok — Hundreds of LGBTQ+ couples married in Thailand Thursday as the kingdom became the third place in Asia to legalize same-sex unions. The decision carries serious economic potential in that country. The new law came into effect on Thursday, following only Taiwan and Nepal in Asia. It also makes Thailand the first Southeast Asian nation to recognize same-sex marriage, in a region of several Muslim-majority nations where homosexuality is outlawed on religious grounds. Now, in an administrative change that carries major consequences, the word 'spouse' replaces 'husband' and 'wife' in statutes, unlocking access for same-sex couples to practical benefits previously only enjoyed by heterosexual marriages. Those include the ability to adopt children, take out joint mortgages, pass on property after death, benefit from next-of-kin status and receive state benefits - as well as crucial medical rights to give consent on behalf of their partners in an emergency. Across the country, from Krabi in the south to Chiang Mai in the north, couples married in registration ceremonies that ranged from intimate at local government offices to a mass wedding at a downtown shopping mall in Bangkok. Thai national Rittigiat Subma married his Chinese partner, Xichen Lin, in Bang Rak district, Bangkok’s most popular district for marriage. Pride rainbow flags and umbrellas hung above the offices, while a three-piece band provided the soundtrack to the weddings. 'I’m so happy. It’s long overdue,' Rittigiat told VOA. 'My partner and I can now take a loan together to buy a house, we can access other equal benefits and make big medical decisions for one another.' 'I can get a spouse visa after we register our marriage here and move to Australia with him for his work.' Proudly holding the red-bound marriage certificate book, his spouse, Xichen Lin. said the pair - who are both 27 and work for tech firms - knew they wanted to get married within weeks of meeting each other. 'Had this bill not been passed there wouldn’t be a relationship for us, because one of the premises of our relationship is that we’re going to have a future.' With no legal possibilities for gay couples in China where same-sex marriage is illegal, he said Thai law has unlocked that possibility. 'We are able to live a normal life now just like a regular couple; we can tell the others that we are married … we can share assets and represent each other in legal circumstances.' Despite the joy and celebration, there were notes of caution from LGBTQ+ advocates who say their equality efforts continue beyond the same-sex bill. 'The law may take effect today but that doesn’t mean discrimination against LGBTQ+ community has changed overnight,' said Tunyawaj Kamolwongwat, a lawmaker for the progressive People’s Party, and a key driver of the law change. 'There is a long journey ahead of us with other laws needing to catch up … now we have to follow up on an array of issues including pregnancy through assisted reproductive technologies, [and] foreign citizenship for LGBTQ+ partners ...' Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has reaped the political dividends from the legal change, which follows years of delayed efforts to get same-sex marriage codified. 'With the power of love by all of you, today Thailand marks a historic day in making the world know that we embrace every kind of love, every gender that is a fundamental part of democracy,' Paetongtarn, now at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said in a prerecorded video message. There are also big hopes for an economic bounce, with companies from insurance and mortgages to hotels keen to cash in on the so-called pink baht. Paetongtarn’s government has put same-sex marriages under the kingdom’s 'soft power' drive - alongside Thai pop music and movies - sensing an economic opportunity from a reputation for openness and hosting weddings and honeymoons in one of the world’s top tourist destinations. A study by travel platform Agoda said that Thailand’s marriage equality legislation is set to deliver an additional 4 million international visitors per year and increase tourism revenue by nearly $2 billion annually – within two years after it is enacted. Thai official data says around 9% of the population - or 4.4 million people - identify as LGBTQ+, representing a domestic marriage market of around $50 million. Dujruedee Thaithumnus, a wedding consultant on the tourist haven of Koh Samui in the Gulf of Thailand, said the island was ready for the inflow of couples. 'It will boost the economy of the entire island … from musicians who play at weddings, to make-up artists and flower shops to photographers and hotels. The island is already packed as it is. I can’t imagine after the law change is official.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/same-sex-marriages-in-thailand-now-legal/7947517.html	2025-01-23T07:05:15-08:00	
Emilia Perez' tops Oscar nominations in fire-hit Hollywood	LOS ANGELES — Transgender cartel musical 'Emilia Perez' topped this year's Oscar nominations, earning 13 nods in an announcement on Thursday postponed by the devastating Los Angeles wildfires. French director Jacques Audiard's Mexico-set musical, released by Netflix, shattered the record for the most Academy Award nominations for a non-English-language movie. It was followed by epic immigrant saga 'The Brutalist' and show-stopping musical adaptation 'Wicked,' which each picked up 10 nominations. Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown' and Vatican thriller 'Conclave' bagged eight nods apiece. Voting deadlines had to be extended this month, as Los Angeles — the home city of the Academy Awards — was devastated by multiple blazes that have killed more than two dozen people and forced tens of thousands to flee. Nominees were unveiled in subdued circumstances, as a town that typically fixates on the Oscars race was instead fixated on new fires burning north of the city. Even so, the glitzy Oscars ceremony itself is still set for March 2, and the stars and studios who have spent months and millions of dollars campaigning learned if they have made the coveted final shortlists. 'Emilia Perez,' in which a narco boss transitions to life as a woman and turns her back on crime, picked up nods for best picture, best director and best international film, as well as multiple song, score and sound nods. Its star, Karla Sofia Gascon, became the first openly trans acting nominee in best actress, and Zoe Saldana was nominated for best supporting actress. Their more famous co-star, Selena Gomez, who has been criticized for her Spanish-language dialogue, missed out. Even so, the Netflix film easily surpassed the most nominated non-English-language movie ever — a record previously held by 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'Roma,' each with 10. In best actor, firm favorite Adrien Brody was nominated for 'The Brutalist' along with Timothee Chalamet ('A Complete Unknown'), Ralph Fiennes ('Conclave') and Colman Domingo ('Sing Sing'). But in an unexpected pick sure to ruffle a few feathers in the new White House, the fifth and final spot went to Sebastian Stan, for his unsettling transformation into a young Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice.' The movie drew threats of lawsuits from Trump's attorneys, particularly for a scene in which the new U.S. president is shown raping his wife. In arguably the morning's biggest surprise, Jeremy Strong, who plays the youthful Trump's sinister mentor Roy Cohn, was also nominated in his supporting role. He edged out the likes of Denzel Washington ('Gladiator II'). Meanwhile, in an intense race for best actress, A-listers Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman — who went all-out with their performances in 'Maria' and 'Babygirl,' respectively — missed out entirely. Instead, comeback queen Demi Moore, who charmed the industry with her Golden Globes acceptance speech for body horror-satire 'The Substance,' was nominated and is seen as the favorite. Her rivals include Gascon, 'Anora' star Mikey Madison, 'Wicked' lead Cynthia Erivo and Brazil's Fernanda Torres for 'I'm Still Here.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/emilia-perez-tops-oscar-nominations-in-fire-hit-hollywood/7947487.html	2025-01-23T07:01:46-08:00

UK watchdog targets Apple, Google mobile ecosystems with new digital market powers	London — Google's Android and Apple's iOS are facing fresh scrutiny from Britain's competition watchdog, which announced investigations Thursday targeting the two tech giants' mobile phone ecosystems under new powers to crack down on digital market abuses. The Competition and Markets Authority said it launched separate investigations to determine whether the mobile ecosystems controlled by Apple and Google should be given 'strategic market status' that would mandate changes in the companies' practices. The watchdog is flexing its newly acquired regulatory muscles again after the new digital market rules took effect at the start of the year. The CMA has already used the new rules, designed to protect consumers and businesses from unfair practices by Big Tech companies, to open an investigation into Google's search ads business. The new investigations will examine whether Apple or Google's mobile operating systems, app stores and browsers give either company a strategic position in the market. The watchdog said it's interested in the level of competition and any barriers preventing rivals from offering competing products and services. The CMA will also look into whether Apple or Google are favoring their own apps and services, which it said 'often come pre-installed and prominently placed on iOS and Android devices.' Google's YouTube and Apple's Safari browser are two examples of apps that come bundled with Android and iOS, respectively. And it will investigate 'exploitative conduct,' such as whether Apple or Google forces app makers to agree to 'unfair terms and conditions' as condition for distributing apps on their app stores. The regulator has until October to wrap up the investigation. It said it could force either company to, for example, open up access to key functions other apps need to operate on mobile devices. Or it could force them to allow users to download apps outside of their own app stores. Both Google and Apple said the work 'constructively' with the U.K. regulator on the investigation. Google said 'Android's openness has helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratize access to smartphones and apps. It's the only example of a successful and viable open source mobile operating system.' The company said it favors 'a way forward that avoids stifling choice and opportunities for U.K. consumers and businesses alike, and without risk to U.K. growth prospects.'

Rubio says US committed to Philippines in call about China's 'dangerous' actions	New U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed China's 'dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea' with his Philippine counterpart on Wednesday and underscored the 'ironclad' U.S. defense commitment to Manila. 'Secretary Rubio conveyed that (China's) behavior undermines regional peace and stability and is inconsistent with international law,' the U.S. State Department said in a statement on the call with Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo. The Philippines has been embroiled in wrangles at sea with China in the past two years and the two countries have faced off regularly around disputed features in the South China Sea that fall inside Manila's exclusive economic zone. Rubio's call came after he hosted counterparts from Australia, India and Japan in the China-focused 'Quad' forum on Tuesday, the day after President Donald Trump returned to the White House. The four recommitted to working together. Quad members and the Philippines share concerns about China's growing power and analysts said Tuesday's meeting was designed to signal continuity in the Indo-Pacific and that countering Beijing would be a top priority for Trump. In the call with Manalo, Rubio 'underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines' under their Mutual Defense Treaty and discussed ways to advance security cooperation, expand economic ties and deepen regional cooperation, the statement said. China's foreign ministry said its activities in the waters were 'reasonable, lawful and beyond reproach.' Speaking at a regular press conference, ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the United States was 'not a party' to the South China Sea dispute and had 'no right to intervene' in maritime issues between China and the Philippines. 'Military cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines should not undermine China's sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea, nor should it be used to endorse the illegal claims of the Philippines,' Mao said. The Philippines, a U.S. defense treaty ally, is among the first countries to engage with the new U.S. administration to discuss critical security matters, Manila's defense department said in a statement. Its defense secretary Gilberto Teodoro and U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz met at the White House on Thursday to reaffirm the enduring alliance between their two countries. Just ahead of Trump's inauguration, the Philippines and the United States carried out their fifth set of joint maritime exercises in the South China Sea since launching the joint activities in 2023. Security engagements between the allies have soared under Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has moved closer to Washington and allowed the expansion of military bases that American forces can access, including facilities facing the democratically governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own. Visiting the Philippines last week, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said a trilateral initiative to boost cooperation launched by Japan, the U.S. and the Philippines at a summit last year would be strengthened when the new U.S. administration took over in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-says-us-committed-to-philippines-in-call-about-china-s-dangerous-actions-/7947364.html	2025-01-23T04:41:17-08:00	
India open to return of undocumented Indians in the United States	New Delhi — Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said New Delhi is open to the return of undocumented Indians in the United States. His comments came following a meeting with U.S. foreign secretary Marco Rubio in Washington during which illegal immigration was one of the issues discussed. Saying that New Delhi was firmly opposed to illegal migration, he told reporters that 'We have always taken the view that if there are any of our citizens who are not here legally, if we are sure that they are our citizens, we have always been, you know, open to their legitimate return to India.' He said it is a position India takes with every country. Jaishankar was addressing a news conference in Washington on Wednesday, a day after his meeting with Rubio. After taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump issued executive orders that aim to clamp down on illegal immigration and deport those who are in the U.S. illegally. Indians made up the third-largest group of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2022 behind Mexico and El Salvador, according to Pew Research Center. It estimated their number at 725,000. Analysts see India’s proactive stand on facilitating the return of illegal Indian migrants in the U.S. as a move to address a key concern of the Trump administration as New Delhi prepares to navigate more complicated issues, including trade and tariffs. 'Among a range of issues, where there are divergences between India and the U.S., this is one area where India can show it is transparently doing something, allowing it greater space to maneuver in other areas,' according to Harsh Pant, vice president of studies at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'In other areas, such as the economy and trade, it is very difficult to do things which the new Trump administration may want India to do, and it would take time.' Jaishankar said that New Delhi is currently verifying the identities of those eligible for deportation and precise numbers of illegal migrants cannot be determined. The United States has identified some 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants to be sent back home, for which India will verify and start the process of deportation, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, citing people familiar with the matter. Deportations of Indians in the United States who lack proper documentation have been taking place – a group of Indian nationals was repatriated by the U.S. in October, for example. The Indian foreign minister Jaishankar also spoke in support of legal migration channels. 'As a government, we are obviously very much supportive of legal mobility because we do believe in a global workplace. We want Indian talent and Indian skills to have the maximum opportunity at the global level,' he said at his press conference. The H-1B visa program, which brings skilled foreign workers to the United States, has been a subject of debate in the U.S. in recent years, with some strongly criticizing the program for negatively impacting American workers. Proponents assert those skilled workers benefit U.S. companies and employers. Indians, most of them professionals working in the technology industry, are among the biggest beneficiaries of the visa program. Analyst Pant says India is on a 'stronger wicket' where H-1B visas are concerned. 'On this issue, India has also been getting support from companies in the U.S. So politically, that is a safer issue for India to handle because there is a domestic support base for India,' Pant said. Elon Musk is among those who have expressed strong support for the program. Trump, who had been critical of the program, last month spoke in its favor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-open-to-return-of-undocumented-indians-in-the-united-states/7947323.html	2025-01-23T03:45:03-08:00	
Taliban flog 12 Afghans, including women, for adultery, eloping	Islamabad — Taliban justice officials in Afghanistan said Thursday that 12 people, including two women, had been publicly flogged this week after being tried and charged with adultery, sodomy, eloping, and having 'illicit relations.' The regime’s Supreme Court announced the punishments, saying they were carried out in the southeastern Khost and northern Parwan provinces, with members of the judiciary, administrative staff, and ordinary citizens present as onlookers. Each of the twelve defendants received the maximum of 39 lashes and prison terms ranging from eight months to three years. The top court acknowledged that the sentences were imposed by provincial courts and implemented only after its approval. At least 35 Afghans have been publicly flogged in this month alone, according to the Supreme Court data. Hundreds of men and women have been flogged in packed sports stadiums across Afghanistan, while six people have been publicly executed under what the Taliban described as the Islamic concept of retributive justice, known as qisas. The United Nations and global human rights organizations have persistently decried the floggings and other forms of corporal punishment as contrary to Afghanistan’s international human rights obligations, demanding the Taliban cease the practice. Taliban leaders, who regained power in 2021, defend their criminal justice system and governance at large, saying they are based on their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. Authorities have banned Afghan girls from pursuing secondary and university-level education and prohibited women from seeking employment in most public and private workplaces. Women must also publicly cover their faces and travel with a male guardian. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, mainly over their harsh treatment of women and other human rights concerns. China and the United Arab Emirates have acknowledged a Taliban ambassador without recognizing the Afghan government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-flog-12-afghans-including-women-for-adultery-eloping/7947313.html	2025-01-23T03:35:00-08:00	
Trump designates Yemen's Houthis as a 'foreign terrorist organization'	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday re-designated Yemen's Houthi movement, known formally as Ansar Allah, as a 'foreign terrorist organization,' the White House said. The move will impose harsher economic penalties than the Biden administration had applied to the Iran-aligned group in response to its attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and against U.S. warships defending the critical maritime chokepoint. Proponents of the move say it is overdue, though some experts say it could have implications for anyone seen as aiding the Houthis, including some aid organizations. 'The Houthis' activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade,' the White House said in a statement. The Houthis, who control most of Yemen, have carried out more than 100 attacks on ships plying the Red Sea since November 2023, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers. The attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa for more than a year. The group has targeted the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which are joined by the narrow Bab al-Mandab strait, a chokepoint between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. military sought to intercept Houthi attacks to safeguard commercial traffic and waged periodic strikes to degrade Houthi military capabilities. But it did not target the group's leadership. At the start of his presidential term in 2021, Joe Biden had dropped Trump's terrorist designations to address humanitarian concerns inside Yemen. Confronted with the Red Sea attacks, Biden last year designated the group as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' organization. But his administration held off on applying the harsher FTO designation. British charity Oxfam said the move would worsen the suffering of Yemeni civilians, disrupting vital imports of food, medicine, and fuel. 'The Trump administration is aware of these consequences but chose to move forward anyway, and will bear responsibility for the hunger and disease that will follow,' Oxfam America's director of peace and security, Scott Paul, said in a statement. David Schenker, who was assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the first Trump administration, said Trump's move on Wednesday was an obvious, early step to respond to what he described as one of Iran's leading proxy forces in the Middle East. 'While the redesignation likely won't have a positive impact on the group's behavior, the measure suggests the new administration is not looking to induce (or cajole) the Iranians to negotiations through blandishment,' Schenker told Reuters. The Trump administration said the U.S. will work with regional partners to eliminate Houthi capabilities, deprive it of resources 'and thereby end its attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea.' The designation will also trigger a broad review of U.N. partners, non-governmental organizations and contractors operating in Yemen, the White House said. 'The President will direct USAID to end its relationship with entities that have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis’ terrorism and abuses,' the White House said. The Houthis in recent days have signaled they were scaling back attacks in the Red Sea following a multiphase cease fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Earlier on Wednesday, the group released the crew of the Galaxy Leader commercial ship more than a year after they seized their Bahamas-flagged vessel off the Yemeni coast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-designates-yemen-s-houthis-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization-/7947289.html	2025-01-23T02:28:32-08:00

Israeli military says it killed 2 militants connected to West Bank bus attack	Israel’s military said Thursday it killed two Islamic Jihad militants who were involved in a deadly attack on a bus in the West Bank earlier this month. The Israel Defense Forces said its troops killed the militants in the village of Burqin amid an exchange of fire after the militants had barricaded themselves in a building. One Israeli soldier was injured in the attack, the military said. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz praised the operation Thursday and said Israel will continue its operation targeting terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank to ensure it does not become a base for attacks. Israel launched the operation on Tuesday, days after it began a ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank increased after the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli counterassault in Gaza. Palestinian health officials say Israeli raids and attacks by Israeli settlers have killed more than 800 Palestinians in the West Bank during that time. Israel’s military says at least 29 Israelis, including soldiers have been killed. The Gaza war began with the Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 people hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, with most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The U.S. State Department said new Secretary of State Marco Rubio pledged to help Israeli free the remaining hostages as he spoke by telephone Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Rubio 'congratulated the Prime Minister on Israel’s successes against Hamas and Hezbollah' and highlighted that maintaining 'steadfast support for Israel is a top priority' for the United States under President Donald Trump, according to a statement from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, said it will release another round of hostages on Saturday. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that the next group of hostages would be four Israeli women, who would be set free in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Shortly after the six-week ceasefire began, Hamas released three hostages while Israeli freed 90 Palestinian prisoners. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-says-it-killed-2-militants-connected-to-west-bank-bus-attack-/7947265.html	2025-01-23T01:21:58-08:00	
Gabon to hold presidential election April 12	LIBREVILLE, GABON — Gabon's transitional government said presidential elections would be held on April 12, a key step to reestablish civilian rule after a coup ended the Bongo dynasty's decades-long reign. Government spokesman Seraphin Akure Davain made the announcement early Thursday following a Cabinet meeting. 'Voting will start at 7 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. in line with current laws,' he said. The oil-rich central African country, which had been under the rule of the Bongo family for 55 years, adopted a new constitution in a November referendum. It provided for a maximum of two seven-year presidential terms, no prime minister and no dynastic transfer of power. On Monday, a new law allowed military officials to stand in elections, subject to certain conditions. Transitional President General Brice Oligui Nguema, who swiftly took over as leader after the August 2023 coup, has made no secret of his ambitions to remain in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-to-hold-presidential-election-april-12/7947252.html	2025-01-23T00:18:35-08:00	
Chad opposition protests final election results won by transitional president’s party	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chad's Constitutional Council has ignored opposition calls to set aside results of last month’s parliamentary elections for gross irregularities and fraud, and proclaimed the ruling party of Chad's president, Field Marshal Mahamat Idriss Deby, the winner. Officials said nominations for senatorial elections to end the transition are open, but the opposition insisted another transitional government should be formed and transparent elections organized to end the three-decade Deby family rule. Officials in Chad said opposition leaders assembled Wednesday in the capital, N'djamena, to protest the election results published Tuesday by the Constitutional Council, the central African nation’s highest court. Clement Sianka, spokesperson of Chad's National Assembly of Democrats, an opposition political party that participated in the Dec. 29 polls, said he took part in the protest because his party is surprised that the council refused to annul the elections he said were marred by fraud, low voter participation and intimidation of civilians Chad's military considered to be opposition supporters. Sianka said that by ordering government troops to chase opposition party representatives from polling stations, Deby, who in December declared himself as field marshal, the highest rank in Chad's military, once more sent a strong message to civilians that he wants to take power at any cost and continue the three-decade rule begun by his father, Idriss Deby Itno. Sianka said fraud was alarming, with ballot boxes confiscated and stuffed by supporters of Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement, or MPS, party in front of helpless civilians. He said the MPS party declared its candidates as winners in towns and villages where civilians obeyed opposition boycott calls and elections did not take place. Sianka spoke on Chad’s state TV on Wednesday. According to the final results published by the country’s Constitutional Council on Tuesday, the MPS won124 seats in the 188-member National Assembly. Sixty-four women were voted in as lawmakers, according to the official results, an increase of 36 women over Chad's last legislative period, which ended in 2011. Officials say financial difficulties have made it impossible for legislative polls to be held since 2011. The opposition said the polls, the first in over a decade, should be set aside because most of Chad's roughly 8.3 million voters heeded opposition calls for a boycott. There were no indications the polls were to be free, fair and transparent as civilians already knew that Deby wanted to confiscate power, Chad's opposition said. However, Chad's Constitutional Council said voter turnout was over 50%, and the elections were peaceful with no major incidents that could affect the outcome of polls. Chad's Political Actors Consultation Group, or GCAP, a coalition of several dozen political parties, on Wednesday said democracy was stifled during Chad's three-year transition period. GCAP said Deby, who took power as a military ruler in 2021, persecutes critical opposition leaders to maintain the rule of his father. Idriss Deby spent three decades in power until he died while fighting rebels in April 2021. GCAP said Deby should hand power to a civilian capable of managing another transition during which transparent elections will be organized for a return to democratic rule. The group did not say who they think will manage the transition are advocating. Chad's opposition also accused the elections management body of rigging elections to favor Deby, who appoints and can fire the elections management body’s officials. Chad's Constitutional Council has neglected calls for an immediate end to the country’s transitional government and the cancellation of the Dec. 29 elections. The council says such calls are intended to bring chaos in Chad. On Wednesday the National Agency for the Management of Elections or ANGE reiterated calls on qualified civilians to prepare their nomination papers before a Jan. 24 deadline and run in the country's first senatorial elections, to be organized in April. Officials say the senatorial election will be the last polls to be organized by the transitional government in its efforts to hand power over to civilian rule. Ahmed Bartchiret, president of ANGE, said ANGE will not accept intimidation by opposition parties that want to disrupt Chad's unity and create chaos. He said ANGE will organize free, fair and transparent elections as it freely organized a constitutional referendum and presidential elections to hand over power to civilian rule as desired by the peace-loving people of Chad. Chad's opposition has always contested the outcome of elections since Deby became transitional president. Deby said he respects the verdict of the ballot and called on civilians to work with democratically elected officials for the development of Chad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-opposition-protests-final-election-results-won-by-transitional-president-s-party/7947242.html	2025-01-23T00:05:32-08:00	
Deadly Russian missile attack hits Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region	Officials in southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said Thursday a Russian ballistic missile attack killed at least one person and injured 24 others. Regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram that Russian drones also destroyed an energy facility and knocked out power to tens of thousands of people. In the Mykolaiv region, Governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram that Ukrainian air defenses shot down nine Russian drones. Debris from the drones damaged several houses, Kim said. Ukraine’s military also shot down several drones over the Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it shot down four Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Trump-Putin U.S. President Donald Trump told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday to end his 'ridiculous war' against Ukraine or the United States would soon impose new 'high levels' of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on any Russian exports to the West. Trump, two days into his second term in the White House, told Putin in a social media post that he was 'not looking to hurt Russia' and that the U.S. 'must never forget' that Russia helped the U.S. win World War II, but that it was time to end Moscow’s nearly three-year invasion of neighboring Ukraine. 'All of that being said,' Trump noted on his Truth Social account, 'I’m going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR. Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT’S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.' 'If we don’t make a ‘deal,’ and soon,' Trump said he would 'have no other choice' but to impose the taxes, tariffs and sanctions. Under President Joe Biden, who left office on Monday, the United States and its European allies frequently sanctioned key sectors of the Russian economy and oligarch friends of Putin, worsening the country’s economy but failing to stop the war. Trump said, 'Let’s get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with! We can do it the easy way, or the hard way - and the easy way is always better. It’s time to 'MAKE A DEAL.' NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!' There was no immediate response from Putin to Trump’s demands.

South Korea investigators recommend Yoon be charged with insurrection, abuse of power	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean investigators recommended Thursday that impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol be charged with insurrection and abuse of power, as they handed over the results of their probe into his ill-fated declaration of martial law to prosecutors. The official charges against Yoon were 'leading an insurrection and abuse of power,' the Corruption Investigation Office said after a 51-day probe into his Dec. 3 attempt to suspend civilian rule. The CIO said it 'decided to request the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office file charges against the sitting President, Yoon Suk Yeol, in connection with allegations including leading insurrection.' Yoon had 'conspired with the former Minister of National Defense and military commanders on December 3, 2024,' it said. The leader, currently suspended from duties, 'declared martial law with the intent to exclude state authority or disrupt the constitutional order, thereby inciting riots.' Under the South Korean legal system, the case file of the suspect -- identified as 'Yoon Suk Yeol: president' -- will now be handed to prosecutors, who have 11 days to decide whether to charge him, which would lead to a criminal trial. The prosecutors' office has 'complied with the CIO's request for a case transfer,' the investigators said. Yoon was arrested in a dawn raid last week on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be detained in a criminal probe. South Korea was plunged into political chaos by Yoon's botched martial law declaration, which lasted just six hours before lawmakers voted it down. They later impeached him, stripping him of his duties. Since his arrest, Yoon has refused to be questioned by the CIO, which is in charge of the criminal probe. He has declined to cooperate with the probe and 'consistently maintained an uncooperative stance,' Lee Jae-seung, deputy CIO chief, said in briefing to reporters. Yoon's security detail also 'obstructed searches and seizures, including access to secure communication devices like classified phones,' Lee said. The CIO said it had decided, in view of Yoon's efforts to block their investigation, it would be 'more efficient' for prosecutors to handle the case, as they have the authority to indict suspects. His lawyers have repeatedly said the CIO has no authority to investigate insurrection. Yoon's legal team said Thursday that they urged prosecutors to 'conduct an investigation that adheres to legal legitimacy and due process.' 'Abused authority' During the night of Dec. 3, Yoon purportedly ordered troops to storm the National Assembly and prevent lawmakers from voting down his declaration of martial law. The CIO said its probe found that Yoon 'abused his authority by compelling police officers from the National Assembly Guard Unit and martial law forces to perform duties beyond their obligations.' He also 'obstructed the exercise of lawmakers' rights to demand the lifting of martial law,' it added. Yoon has denied instructing top military commanders to 'drag out' lawmakers from parliament to prevent them from voting down his decree. Yoon, who remains head of state, is being held in a detention center. In addition to the criminal probe, he is also facing a Constitutional Court case, where judges will decide whether to uphold his impeachment, which would officially remove him from office. If the court rules against Yoon, he will lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. Yoon, who attended a court hearing this week, will appear again Thursday when the judges will call witnesses to hear details of how martial law unfolded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-investigators-recommend-yoon-be-charged-with-insurrection-abuse-of-power/7947234.html	2025-01-22T23:41:22-08:00	
Earthquakes above magnitude 5 strike Philippines	MANILA, Philippines — Two earthquakes jolted the Philippines several hours apart on Thursday, authorities said, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage. A magnitude 5.8 quake occurred off the town of San Francisco in Southern Leyte province in the central region of Visayas at 7:39 a.m, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. A magnitude 5.4 earthquake followed four hours later that hit Siocon town in the southern Mindanao region. The agency had recorded at least 68 aftershocks from the Visayas tremor. There were no immediate reports of injuries from either tremor. San Francisco police chief Barnie Catig said the earthquake in the town was brief but strong. 'Some of the picture frames in our shelves fell off,' Catig said by phone. No one was injured, but at least 18 houses and government buildings had minor damage, Catig said. At least one highway had fissures from the tremor but remained passable, he said. 'We're still conducting a full assessment,' Catig said. Earthquakes are common in the Philippines, which is located in the Pacific Ocean's 'Ring of Fire', where volcanic activity and earthquakes frequently occur.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquakes-above-magnitude-5-strike-philippines/7947230.html	2025-01-22T23:13:44-08:00	
2 soldiers dead, 12 wounded in ambush by ex-Philippine rebels	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Former Muslim rebels ambushed government troops assigned to escort U.N. staff visiting the southern Philippines, killing two soldiers and wounding 12 others, the military said Thursday. Wednesday's attack came more than 10 years after the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) signed a peace agreement with Manila, ending a decades-old armed campaign initially for a separate state and later Muslim self-rule in Asia's bastion of Catholicism. A military statement said the soldiers were 'fired upon by unidentified armed personalities' in Basilan island, triggering a firefight that left two soldiers dead and 12 others wounded. The commander of the army unit, Brigadier General Alvin Luzon, said Thursday MILF gunmen attacked the troops who had been dispatched to 'provide area security' to a United Nations team that was to visit a development project in the former MILF stronghold. The U.N. visit was later aborted due to the firefight, he added. The U.N. country office in the Philippines did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment. The peace treaty had led to the creation of a self-rule area in a Muslim-populated region in the southern Philippines, now run by Chief Minister Ahod Ebrahim, the former MILF chief. However, the process of decommissioning the weapons of thousands of MILF fighters following a lengthy armed campaign that left thousands dead is yet to be completed. Ebrahim said in a statement sent to AFP that the regional Bangsamoro government -- which includes the island province of Basilan -- was 'deeply saddened by the unfortunate encounter' with MILF members. He urged all parties to 'remain calm as we work towards addressing this incident through appropriate channels,' while stressing the regional government 'remains steadfast in its commitment to the full implementation' of the peace treaty. Philippine Army commander Lieutenant General Roy Galido condemned the attack and said his forces are 'working closely with local government units and law enforcement agencies to ensure that the perpetrators of this treacherous act face the full consequences of their actions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/soldiers-dead-12-wounded-in-ambush-by-ex-philippine-rebels/7947229.html	2025-01-22T23:13:11-08:00	
Analysts: China normalizing its claims to maritime zone shared with South Korea	WASHINGTON — South Korea should increase efforts to prevent China from normalizing its claims to sovereignty over a disputed maritime area in waters the two countries share, analysts say. China has been doing it for decades in the South China Sea, analysts say, where it has been using so-called gray zone tactics to assert its claims over vast stretches of maritime territory — claims contested by several neighboring countries in the area. Recent Chinese activity in the waters it shares with South Korea has prompted analysts' warnings that Beijing is doing the same to Seoul. South Korean officials said earlier this month that China had installed a steel structure in disputed waters west of South Korea, The Chosun Daily in Seoul reported. Using reconnaissance satellites, South Korean intelligence agencies detected the structure last month and estimate that it exceeds 50 meters in width and height, The Chosun Daily said. The structure was spotted in the disputed area known as the Provisional Measures Zone, or PMZ, in the Yellow Sea, which South Korea calls the Western Sea. The zone is where the exclusive economic zones of the two countries overlap. The zone was established in 2001 to manage the overlapping claims to the area. Building any kind of facility and conducting activities unrelated to fishing are banned in the area until the dispute is settled. China installed two similar structures in a nearby area in April and May, prompting protests by South Korea. 'Gray zone strategy' 'It is likely that these recent actions are tied to a gray zone strategy that slowly encroaches on this area in ways that over the long-term reinforces their claims,' said Terence Roehrig, an Asia-Pacific security expert and lecturer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 'The goal of a gray zone strategy is to slowly force the target state to accept a new normal in the area. Seoul must ensure that does not happen by continuing to assert its position and insist that the delimitation of these waters be settled through negotiation,' Roehrig continued. 'China views the Yellow Sea as a crucial area for its security and potential gateway into the Chinese heartland. It is likely that eventually, these structures may have some military use,' he added. Gray zone tactics blur the line between what is legal and illegal through paramilitary coercions designed to weaken an adversary over time. China's tactics have included building artificial islands and making incursions, pushing the boundary of what is allowed to project military power and control sea routes. 'The incident demonstrates China is using the same strategy it employed in the South China Sea with South Korea now,' said Rahman Yaacob, research fellow for the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute. According to Yaacob, China has used gray tactics to build civilian structures in the South China Sea since the early 1990s. China installed structures in Mischief Reef back then, saying their purpose was to support fishermen, he said. 'We now know Mischief Reef has been converted into a military base on an artificial island,' Yaacob said. China now has a military base on an artificial island it built on Mischief Reef, which is in the Spratly Islands. Mischief Reef is also claimed by multiple countries that protest China's military buildup. Admiral John Aquilino, the former U.S. Indo-Pacific commander, said in 2022 that China seemed to have completed the construction of missile arsenals, aircraft hangers, radar systems and other military facilities in Mischief Reef. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said China might want access to 'the mineral rights under the sea and to be able to transit freely in the area so it can control commerce and flow of activities in the area' close to South Korea. Sustained structures in the region could impact naval operations of South Korea and the U.S., he continued. 'It's important that South Korea, in particular, but also the United States, Japan and other allies do not allow China to normalize its activities,' Maxwell added. 'That's what it wants to do — normalize its presence so it can claim it as its sovereign [maritime] territory.' In response to South Korea's protests, China said last year that the structures were for supporting fishing activities. The Yellow Sea is a key fishing site for China. 'It's certainly possible that the structures are used to support fishing activities,' said Tabitha Grace Mallory, a founder and CEO of China Ocean Institute and a University of Washington professor focusing on China's ocean policy. 'The fact that these structures are being built unilaterally in the PMZ is just unnecessarily provocative,' she added. Telling VOA on Tuesday that he is 'not familiar with the situation,' Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said, 'I would like to point out that China is a responsible country that has always carried out distant-water fishery and marine scientific activities in accordance with laws and regulations.' Exploiting political turmoil Some analysts say China could be taking advantage of Seoul's political situation to install the structure in the disputed waters. The installation coincides with the political chaos stemming from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law. 'China is helping to create the political chaos in South Korea so that it can conduct these activities inside South Korea's economic exclusive zone' and 'act with impunity,' Maxwell said. Others are unsure whether the two incidents are related. 'I don't know if this is explicitly tied to exploiting [South Korea's] political turmoil,' said Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation chair in Korea studies at the Brookings Institution. 'But Beijing may be testing South Korea's political resolve over disputed maritime claims, especially if we anticipate that the Trump administration will press [Seoul] to do more to counter Chinese threats in the Indo-Pacific,' Yeo continued. Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson Institute, said Beijing does not want to push South Korea too hard, although it has an opportunity to do so, because 'China has an interest in opening a healthy relationship with South Korea, especially at a time when it thinks it is going to have a more amendable government in place.' Cronin was referring to main opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, considered pro-China, having a shot at running for the next presidential election, which could be held in few months if the Constitutional Court rules in favor of Yoon's impeachment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-china-normalizing-its-claims-to-maritime-zone-shared-with-south-korea/7947215.html	2025-01-22T22:18:10-08:00	
Hundreds to wed as Thai same-sex marriage law comes into force	Bangkok — Hundreds of same-sex couples are set to tie the knot in Thailand on Thursday as it becomes by far the largest nation in Asia to allow equal marriage. A mass LGBTQ+ wedding in the capital, organized by campaign group Bangkok Pride with city authorities, expects hundreds of marriage registrations as the law comes into effect. Transgender woman Ariya 'Jin' Milintanapa, who has waited two decades for this moment, told AFP she was 'psyched.' 'This day is important not just for us, but for our kids as well. Our family will finally become one,' she said. Thailand ranks highly on indexes of LGBTQ+ legal and living conditions, and public attitudes, and Thursday's milestone makes it the first Southeast Asian country to allow equal marriage. The kingdom's same-sex marriage bill was passed in a historic parliamentary vote last June, the third place in Asia to do so after Taiwan and Nepal. The law was ratified by King Maha Vajiralongkorn in October and comes into effect after 120 days. The law on marriage now uses gender-neutral terms in place of 'men,' 'women,' 'husbands' and 'wives,' and also grants adoption and inheritance rights to same-sex couples. More than 30 countries around the world have legalized marriage for all since the Netherlands became the first to allow same-sex unions in 2001. Couples will be able to register at the main mass wedding at Bangkok's central Siam Paragon shopping mall and district offices nationwide from 8 a.m. on Thursday. It marks the culmination of years of campaigning and thwarted attempts to pass equal marriage laws. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said during a celebratory photoshoot last week: 'No matter your gender or who you love, love knows no limits or expectations. Everyone will be protected under the same laws.' Thailand has long had an international reputation for tolerance of the LGBTQ+ community, and opinion polls reported in local media have shown overwhelming public support for equal marriage. However, much of the Buddhist-majority kingdom retains traditional and conservative values and LGBTQ+ people say they still face barriers and discrimination in everyday life. Thai activists have been pushing for same-sex marriage rights for more than a decade, with their advocacy stalled by political turbulence in a country regularly upended by coups and mass street protests. Siritata Ninlapruek, an LGBTQ+ activist, described the journey as a challenging, bittersweet battle. 'I am extremely happy, but my fight for the community continues,' she said. She emphasized the need for gender identity recognition beyond biological sex. 'Whether male, female or non-binary, people should have the right to identify as they wish.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-to-wed-as-thai-same-sex-marriage-law-comes-into-force/7947206.html	2025-01-22T21:11:28-08:00	
Researchers: Houthis have advantages in protecting leaders from threatened strikes	WASHINGTON — Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi terror group appears to be well-positioned to shield its leaders from retaliatory strikes recently threatened by Israel, international researchers tell VOA. Israel also faces its own challenges in potentially engaging in long-distance targeting of Houthi leaders, but those researchers say the Israeli threat to Houthi rule is likely to grow in the future. Israel has carried out five long-distance airstrikes on Houthi infrastructure and other targets in Yemen since last July, in retaliation for the Houthis firing hundreds of drones and missiles as part of an Iranian proxy war launched against Israel in October 2023. The Biden administration had labeled the Houthis a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization last January, citing their use of missiles supplied by Iran to attack Red Sea shipping. President Donald Trump, who took office this week, signed an order on Wednesday starting a monthlong process of further penalizing the Houthis with a designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. After Israel’s latest Yemen strike on Jan. 10, Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a videotaped warning to Houthi leaders, saying Israel will 'hunt you down' – repeating a threat that he first made last month to 'decapitate' the Houthi leadership. Houthi leader Abdul-Malek al-Houthi issued a defiant videotaped message of his own on Monday, saying his militia will monitor an Israel-Hamas ceasefire that took effect a day earlier in Gaza and 'escalate' conflict with Israel 'if (it) breaches' the deal. The Houthi leader is known for being elusive and issuing videotaped statements from undisclosed locations. Mohammed Albasha, a Yemeni American former journalist and founder of U.S.-based consultancy Basha Report that specializes in Middle East and North Africa risk assessments, told VOA that he has not observed any public meetings involving al-Houthi in Yemen since 2015. That is when a Saudi-led coalition began an offensive to try to oust the Houthis from the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which the militia stormed into the year before. In a series of interviews for this report, Albasha and other international researchers specializing in Yemen said they suspect that al-Houthi has been hiding for years in the mountains of his clan’s home base of Saada province in northwestern Yemen, along with other senior figures of his militia. 'I don’t think Israeli threats have changed the behavior of Houthi leaders much,' said Wolf-Christian Paes, a researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 'Since 2015, they have fought Saudi and Emirati forces who tried to target their leadership, which made them very security conscious,' Paes said. 'Al-Houthi has rarely met U.N. or other foreign visitors in person or given interviews to journalists.' Ely Karmon, a researcher at Israel’s International Institute for Counterterrorism, said Houthi leaders appear to have tightened those precautions in response to recent developments, including Israel’s five strikes on Yemen, dozens of U.S.-led strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen since last January, and Israeli attacks on Iranian proxy leaders elsewhere in the region. Karmon noted that 10 days after Israel’s first airstrike in Yemen on July 20, 2024, the Houthis’ patron, Iran, held a swearing-in ceremony for its new president, Massoud Pezeshkian, and al-Houthi did not travel to the Islamic republic to attend. Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, another Iranian proxy leader, did travel to the Iranian capital for the inauguration and was assassinated in an Israeli bombing hours after the event. April Longley Alley, a researcher at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said the Houthis also are likely to be skeptical of using transmitting technology anywhere near their top leader. Israel used communications devices to attack Hezbollah on consecutive days in September, first detonating thousands of rigged pagers and then hundreds of rigged walkie-talkies that it surreptitiously delivered to the Lebanese terror group. Ten days after the pager attack, Israel assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on his southern Beirut stronghold, giving the Houthis more cause to bolster the protection of al-Houthi, the researchers said. Beyond the Houthis’ home base in Saada, the militia has a political leadership running an internationally unrecognized authority in Sanaa, called the Supreme Political Council. Albasha, the former journalist, said the council’s prime minister and other ministers are not involved in military matters and operate under the authority of the militia’s senior commanders from Saada and the Houthi clan. The researchers said Houthi political leaders and spokesmen appear regularly in public in Sanaa, but typically in settings with many civilians present, giving those officials a human shield from potential aerial attacks. In the latest such appearance on Wednesday, the Houthis’ Supreme Political Council prime minister, Ahmed Ghaleb Nasser al-Rahawi, appeared at a government auditorium where several hundred people gathered to commemorate the 2004 killing of Hussein al-Houthi, a brother of the militia’s current leader, by forces of Yemen’s then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh. But the researchers said the Houthis’ tactics for shielding their leaders from attack also have drawbacks. 'Houthi military leaders are going to be very skeptical of using phones, and that is likely going to make it harder and more time consuming for them to exchange messages between Saada and Sanaa,' Longley Alley said. Ari Heistein, an Israel-based researcher with the Counter Extremism Project, said Houthi military leaders risk losing relevance in running their regime if they disconnect from electronic communications for prolonged periods. 'Running a country of more than 32 million people with serious problems is hard to do from isolation in a remote environment,' Heistein said. The researchers said it is harder for Israel to strike leaders of the Houthis than those of Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy groups located nearer its borders because Yemen is more than 2,000 kilometers away. That distance requires several hours of flight time for Israeli warplanes to reach their targets, versus minutes for the same warplanes to reach neighboring territories. They said Israel also lacks in Yemen the same kind of human intelligence sources that it established in Lebanon and Palestinian territories before the start of the recent conflict, when it perceived Yemen to be a relatively low threat. Karmon, the counterterrorism researcher, said that if the ceasefire in Gaza holds and the Houthis refrain from firing more projectiles at Israel in the coming weeks and months, he expects Israel to focus on closing what he called a 'huge' intelligence gap in Yemen. He said Israel could utilize long-range drones, satellites, human sources and intelligence-sharing with the U.S. and regional partners to do that. Heistein said Israel likely will use its surprise September attacks on Hezbollah, which were years in the making, as a model for dealing with threats from Yemen. 'If the Houthis quiet down for a while, the next time they begin causing trouble, particularly for Israel and international shipping, Israel probably will have a plan in place to take out their leadership,' Heistein said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/researchers-houthis-have-advantages-in-protecting-leaders-from-threatened-strikes/7947198.html	2025-01-22T20:40:03-08:00

New wildfire erupts in Southern California	A new wildfire erupted Wednesday in Southern California, scorching more than 39 square kilometers of trees and brush in the mountains north of Los Angeles. The Hughes Fire is the latest wildfire to erupt in parched Southern California. It is burning near Lake Castaic, a recreation area about 65 kilometers from the Eaton and Palisades fires that are continuing to burn in the region for a third week. The fire, less than 1 square kilometer when first reported, quickly grew to 20 square kilometers with the aid of the Santa Ana winds, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. It was later reported to be 39 square kilometers in size. 'This fire had a robust response today, and as you can see behind us, the responders are doing great work to try to contain this fire,' Joe Tyler, director of Cal Fire, said. 'Certainly, we are not out of the woods yet.' Winds were gusting at 67 kph Wednesday afternoon and expected to increase to 96 kph in the evening and throughout Thursday, the National Weather Service posted on X. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said that 31,000 people were ordered to evacuate, and about 23,000 were under evacuation warnings. Kayla Amara drove to a Castaic neighborhood to retrieve items from a friend’s home. As she was packing, she grabbed a hose and began watering down the property. 'I hope there's a house here to return to,' Amara said as police cars raced through the streets and flames engulfed trees in the distance. Before the Hughes Fire, firefighters and Southern California residents were bracing for the possibility of more wildfires fueled by the strong dry winds. Rain is forecast, but meteorologists have warned it would not be enough to end the fires. Forecasters predict a 60% to 80% chance of rain in the region beginning Saturday, with rainfall totals in most areas not exceeding 0.8 centimeters. The National Weather Service said dangerous fire conditions would persist in the region through Thursday or Friday. Cal Fire spokesman David Acuna said officials are concerned that the Palisades and Eaton fires could break their containment lines. The chance of thunderstorms bringing heavier rainfall has raised fears of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by two weeks of wildfires. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said an executive order she signed Tuesday is designed to curb the flow of toxic debris from the region’s fires and protect the area’s beaches and oceans. 'This is to prevent additional damage to areas already ravaged by fire and also to protect our watershed, beaches and ocean from toxic runoff,' the mayor said. City workers will remove toxic materials and set up barriers to direct the flow of debris into the sewer system. In addition, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved emergency measures facilitating the installation of flood control infrastructure and the removal of sediment in the burned areas. Residents are being encouraged to be ready to evacuate at a moment’s notice with their prepared emergency evacuation kits. They are also being encouraged to look at the city’s website to learn how to protect themselves from ash in the air that can include heavy metals, arsenic and other harmful substances, according to L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer. The fires that broke out in Southern California on January 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed thousands of buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes. President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the response to the fire, is expected to travel to Los Angeles this week. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-wildfire-erupts-in-southern-california-/7947166.html	2025-01-22T19:09:37-08:00

Europe posts record year for clean energy	A record 47% of the European Union's electricity now comes from solar and other renewables, a report Thursday said, in yet another sign of the growing gap between the bloc's push for clean energy and the new U.S. administration's pursuit of more fossil fuels. Nearly three-quarters of the EU's electricity doesn't emit planet-warming gases into the air — with another 24% of electricity in the bloc coming from nuclear power, a report released by the climate energy think tank Ember found. This is far higher than in countries like the United States and China, where nearly two-thirds of their energy is still produced from carbon-polluting fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Experts say they're encouraged by Europe's fossil fuel reductions, particularly as the U.S. looks set to increase its emissions as its new president pledges cheaper gas prices, has halted leases for wind projects and pledged to revoke Biden-era incentives for electric vehicles. 'Fossil fuels are losing their grip on EU energy,' said Chris Rosslowe, an energy expert at Ember. In 2024, solar power generated 11% of EU electricity, overtaking coal which fell below 10% for the first time. Clean wind power generated more electricity than gas for the second year in a row. 2024 data wasn't available for all countries. Ember's data for the world's largest generators of electricity for 2023 show Brazil with the largest share of its electricity from renewables, almost 89%, with much of that coming from hydroelectric power. Canada had about 66.5%, China 30.6%, France 26.5%, the U.S. 22.7% and India 19.5%. One reason for Europe's clean power transition moving at pace is the European Green Deal, an ambitious policy passed in 2019 that paved the way for climate laws to be updated. As a result of the deal, the EU made their targets more ambitious, aiming to cut 55% of the region's emissions by the end of the decade. The policy also aims to make Europe climate neutral — reducing the amount of additional emissions in the air to practically zero — by 2050. Hundreds of regulations and directives in European countries to incentivize investment in clean energy and reduce carbon pollution have been passed or are in the process of being ratified across Europe. 'At the start of the Deal, renewables were a third and fossil fuels accounted for 39% of Europe's electricity,' Rosslowe said. 'Now fossils generate only 29% and wind and solar have been driving the clean energy transition.' The amount of electricity generated by nuclear energy has remained relatively stable in the bloc. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also spurred the move to clean energy in Europe. Gas prices skyrocketed — with much of Europe's gas coming from Russia becoming unviable — forcing countries to look for cheaper, cleaner alternatives. Portugal, Netherlands and Estonia witnessed the highest increase in clean power in the last five years. The transition to clean power helped Europe avoid more than $61 billion worth of fossil fuel imports for generating electricity since 2019. 'This is sending a clear message that their energy needs are going to be met through clean power, not gas imports,' said Pieter de Pous, a Brussels-based energy analyst at European think tank E3G. De Pous said the EU's origins were 'as a community of coal and steel because those industries were so important,' but it is now rapidly becoming a 'community of solar and wind power, batteries and smart technologies.' Nuclear growth in the bloc, meanwhile, has slowed. Across the European Union, retirements of nuclear plants have outpaced new construction since around the mid-2000s, according to Global Energy Monitor. As President Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement aimed at curbing warming and is pursuing a 'drill, baby, drill' energy policy, Rosslowe said the EU's leadership in clean power becomes all the more important. 'It's about increasing European energy independence, and it's about showing this climate leadership,' he said. On Tuesday, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said: 'Europe will stay the course, and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-posts-record-year-for-clean-energy/7947111.html	2025-01-22T17:14:43-08:00

US House passes immigrant detention bill	WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday gave final approval to a bill that requires the detainment of unauthorized migrants accused of theft and violent crimes, marking the first legislation that President Donald Trump can sign as Congress, with some bipartisan support, swiftly moved in line with his plans to crackdown on illegal immigration. Passage of the Laken Riley Act, which was named after a Georgia nursing student who was murdered last year by a Venezuelan man, shows just how sharply the political debate over immigration has shifted to the right following Trump's election victory. Immigration policy has often been one of the most entrenched issues in Congress, but a crucial faction of 46 politically vulnerable Democrats joined Republicans to lift the strict proposal to passage on a 263-156 vote tally. 'For decades, it has been almost impossible for our government to agree on solutions for the problems at our border and within our country,' said Senator Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican. She called the legislation 'perhaps the most significant immigration enforcement bill' to be passed by Congress in nearly three decades. Still, the bill would require a massive ramp up in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's capabilities, but it does not include any new funding. Meanwhile, Trump has launched a slew of executive orders intended to seal off the U.S. border with Mexico to immigration and ultimately deport millions of migrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. On Wednesday, Trump also canceled refugee resettlement, and his administration has signaled that it intends to prosecute local law enforcement officials who do not enforce his new immigration policies. Republican congressional leaders have made it clear they intend to follow suit. Their toughest challenge, however, will be finding a way to approve the funding to implement Trump's hardline plans. 'What he's doing is kickstarting what will ultimately be our legislative agenda,' said House Speaker Mike Johnson. House Republicans initially passed the legislation last year with support from 37 Democrats. It then languished in the Democratic-controlled Senate. This year, Republicans, now with control of both congressional chambers, have made it their top priority. When it came before the Senate, 12 Democrats voted in favor of passage, and when the House voted on a version of the bill earlier this month, 48 Democrats supported it. 'While the bill is not perfect, it sends a clear message that we think that criminals should be deported,' said Representative Tom Suozzi, a New York Democrat who has called on his party to support tougher immigration enforcement. Under the legislation, federal authorities would be required to detain any migrant arrested or charged with crimes such as shoplifting. The scope of the proposal was widened in the Senate to also include those accused of assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone. The bill also gives legal standing to state attorneys general to sue the federal government for harm caused by federal immigration decisions. That gives states new power in setting immigration policy at a time when they have been trying to push back against presidential decisions under both the Trump and Biden administrations. Ultimately, even the Trump administration is likely to struggle to implement the new requirements unless Congress follows up later this year with funding. Republicans are strategizing how to push their priorities through Congress using a party-line process known as budget reconciliation. They have put the cost of funding Trump's border and deportation priorities at roughly $100 billion. The Department of Homeland Security has estimated the Laken Riley Act would cost $26.9 billion in the first year to implement, including an increase of 110,000 ICE detention beds. Most Democrats criticized the lack of funding in the bill as proof that it is a piecemeal approach that would do little to fix problems in the immigration system and saddle federal authorities with new requirements. 'The bill's authors claimed it's going to result in the arrest and detention of serious criminals, but it will not do that because it's a totally unfunded mandate,' said Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Others raised concerns that the bill would strip due process rights for migrants, including minors or recipients of the Deferred Action for Unaccompanied Minors program. Senator Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said that federal authorities would now be forced to prioritize detention of migrants arrested for low-level crimes like shoplifting, rather than those who commit violent felonies. On the whole, there is no evidence that immigrants are more prone to violent crime. Several studies have found immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than those born in the U.S. Groups that advocate for restrictive immigration policies dispute or dismiss those findings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-passes-immigrant-detention-bill/7947071.html	2025-01-22T16:53:26-08:00	
Beijing's lack of clarity about Rubio sanctions sparks speculation in China	washington — Beijing’s lack of clarity about whether it will lift sanctions previously placed on Marco Rubio — the new U.S. secretary of state and a China hawk — has sparked speculation on Chinese social media about whether Rubio will become the first American diplomat in his position who can’t visit China. On Baidu, China’s most popular search engine, sitting atop the trending chart Tuesday night was the question, 'Will China remove sanctions on the new U.S. Secretary of State?' On Weibo, China’s microblogging site similar to X, netizens wonder if Rubio will become the first U.S. secretary of state who won’t be able to come to China. 'This guy has been barred from entering China, let alone visiting China,' one Weibo user commented. 'It’s now a question how he will be able to deal with China.' Tough on China Rubio, the first Cabinet member of the second Trump administration to be confirmed by the Senate, was sworn in Tuesday. He was one of the toughest congressional lawmakers on China during his 14-year tenure as a senator. Rubio introduced bills, made statements and worked with rights groups that were highly critical of China’s human rights record and growing influence around the world. A Chinese state media article once called him 'one of America's most radical anti-China politicians.' In 2020, within a month, the Chinese government sanctioned Rubio twice. The first was announced in July of that year as part of the retaliation against the U.S. government’s sanctions against a Chinese government department and four officials in Xinjiang for human rights violations alleged to have taken place in the region. The second one was announced in August after Washington sanctioned 11 Chinese and Hong Kong officials. 'I don’t want to be paranoid, but I am starting to think they don’t like me,' Rubio tweeted sarcastically back then after learning about the sanctions. During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio reaffirmed his position on China, asserting that China remains the 'biggest threat' to the United States in the 21st century. 'If we don’t change course, we are going to live in the world where much of what matters to us on a daily basis from our security to our health will be dependent on whether the Chinese allow us to have it or not,' he said during the hearing. On China’s heavily censored internet, most of the comments on his swearing-in have been negative. In a proposed Cabinet lineup that includes candidates who are controversial, Rubio stands out as one with bipartisan support. He received a unanimous 99 confirmation votes. Experts say that how Rubio approaches China will depend largely on President Donald Trump. 'Rubio has a long history of working on China. But everyone in the Cabinet is loyal to Trump. I do think Trump will be the ultimate decision maker on China,' Yun Sun, a senior fellow and co-director of the East Asia Program and director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, told VOA Mandarin. 'Any China policy will be a balance of issues to reach what Trump defines as American national interests. Hawkish views and friendly views will both be a part of the deal,' she said. Necessary to 'maintain contact' In his new role, Rubio has put Beijing in a peculiar position. The Chinese government has not publicly sent a clear signal regarding questions about whether it will lift sanctions on him to allow him to visit. When asked if China would drop the sanctions, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said Tuesday at the daily press conference, 'China will firmly defend national interests. In the meantime, it's necessary for high-level Chinese and American officials to maintain contact in an appropriate way.' Recent online speculation about Rubio has evolved since social media users noticed the Chinese government ostensibly changed its translation of Rubio’s name. Claims circulated that Beijing changed the translation so that it could lift sanctions on Rubio without looking embarrassed, because now China can say the sanctions were aimed at a different person than Rubio. But the so-called new translation isn’t new at all. The first translation has been the most widely used for Rubio in Chinese government documents and media. However, as early as 2019, People’s Daily, Beijing’s flagship state media outlet and a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, used the second translation to refer to Rubio in an attack article. Transcripts from China’s foreign ministry also show that when the two sanctions on him were unveiled in 2020, Rubio was referred to by a third variation of his name. The speculation garnered so much attention that Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, was asked about it on Wednesday at a press conference. 'I am not yet aware of what you mentioned,' she said.

Gangs could overrun Haiti capital if aid falls short, UN chief says	United Nations — Haiti's capital could become overrun by criminal gangs if the international community does not step up aid to a United Nations-backed security mission there, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres warned in a report Wednesday. More money, equipment and personnel are needed for the Kenya-led international force, Guterres said, adding that any further delays risk the 'catastrophic' collapse of Haiti's security institutions and 'could allow gangs to overrun the entire metropolitan area' of Port-au-Prince. The U.N. secretary-general lamented that the mission is 'still not deployed to full strength,' limiting its capacity to support the Haitian national police. Haiti's Foreign Minister Jean-Victor Harvel Jean-Baptiste, speaking at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council, said that the country faced 'major difficulties' that threaten not just the population but also 'the very survival of the state.' The Security Council gave the green light in October 2023 to the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission designed to support Haiti's authorities in their fight against gang violence. But since then, just under 800 of the 2,500 police officers hoped for have been deployed. More than 5,601 people were killed in Haiti last year as a result of gang violence, about a thousand more than in 2023, the U.N. said. In the report, Guterres said setbacks in Haiti's political process have 'contributed to a climate in which these atrocities have become possible.' Haiti currently has no president or parliament and is ruled by a transitional body, which is struggling to manage extreme violence linked to criminal gangs, poverty and other challenges. The U.N. also recorded 315 lynchings of people allegedly affiliated with gangs as well as 281 cases of alleged summary executions by police. More than a million Haitians have been forced to flee their homes, three times as many as a year ago. The Caribbean nation has suffered from decades of instability, but the situation escalated last February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in the capital to overthrow then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry. Unpopular and unelected, Henry stepped down in April, his resignation eventually giving way to a transitional government, which had by November fired its interim prime minister and replaced him with current Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime. The U.N. Special Representative in Haiti, Maria Isabel Salvador, criticized the 'increasing fragmentation' of the temporary council. 'While there is progress on the political front and reason to be timidly hopeful, the transition framework remains fragile,' she told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. Salvador said the humanitarian situation had reached 'alarming levels,' saying that over six million people -- nearly half the population -- required humanitarian assistance. The United States had, under former President Joe Biden, backed a request by Haitian authorities to transform the security mission into a U.N. peacekeeping force, but faced opposition from China and Russia. So far, the mission has had limited impact on the frequency of attacks by armed groups, who are accused of committing numerous murders, rapes and kidnappings for ransom. The attacks have also targeted key buildings and infrastructure, which forced the closure of the capital's airport to commercial flights in November.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gangs-could-overrun-haiti-capital-if-aid-falls-short-un-chief-says/7947093.html	2025-01-22T16:47:31-08:00	
Trump signals aggressive stance as US races China in AI development	Before he had been in office for 48 hours, President Donald Trump sent a clear signal that to outpace China, his administration will be pursuing an aggressive agenda when it comes to pushing the United States forward on the development of artificial intelligence and the infrastructure that powers it. On his first day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order signed in 2023 by former President Joe Biden that sought to place some guardrails around the development of more and more powerful generative AI tools and to create other protections for privacy, civil rights and national security. The following day, Trump met with the leaders of several leading technology firms, including Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI; Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle; and Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank, to announce a $500 billion private sector investment in AI infrastructure known as Stargate. 'Beginning immediately, Stargate will be building the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of advancements in AI, and this will include the construction of colossal data centers,' Trump said in a media event at the White House on Tuesday. Specifically, Stargate will invest in the creation of as many as 10 huge data centers in the United States that will provide the computing for artificial intelligence systems. The first data center is already under construction in Texas. The massive private sector investment will create up to 100,000 U.S. jobs, the executives said. Keeping AI in the US 'What we want to do is, we want to keep it in this country,' Trump said. 'China is a competitor, and others are competitors. We want it to be in this country, and we're making it available. I'm going to help a lot through emergency declarations, because we have an emergency. We have to get this stuff built.' The assembled tech leaders took the opportunity to praise the new president. 'I think this will be the most important project of this era,' Altman said. 'We wouldn’t be able to do this without you, Mr. President.' Janet Egan, a senior fellow in the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security, said that all the signals Trump is sending indicate he is serious about maintaining the United States’ current advantages in the development of advanced AI. 'I think this shows that he's going to have a really clear mind as to how to partner closely with the private sector to enable them to speed up and run fast,' Egan said. 'We've also seen him take direct action on some of the bottlenecks that are impeding the development of AI infrastructure in the U.S., and a particular focus is energy.' OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has relied on Microsoft data centers for its computing. The firm reportedly discussed with the Biden administration the regulatory hurdles of planning and permitting when building data centers. In a policy paper released earlier this month, OpenAI cited the competition with China, laying out its policy proposals to 'extending America’s global leadership in AI innovation.' 'Chips, data, energy and talent are the keys to winning on AI — and this is a race America can and must win,' the paper said. 'There’s an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn’t attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects — strengthening the Chinese Communist Party’s global influence.' Patrick Hedger, director of policy at NetChoice, a technology trade association, told VOA that the Stargate announcement 'immediately signaled to me that private capital is more than willing to come off the sidelines these days with the new Trump administration.' As part of his flurry of executive actions on Monday, Trump eliminated several preexisting executive orders placing limits on fossil fuel extraction and power generation. In the White House event on Monday, Trump also noted that AI data centers consume vast amounts of electricity and said he would be clearing the way for Stargate and other private companies to invest in new energy generation projects. China competition While Trump eliminated many of Biden’s executive orders immediately on Monday, he does not appear to have taken action against some of the former president’s other AI-related initiatives. Last year, Biden took several steps to restrict China’s access to cutting-edge technology related to AI, specifically, restricting the ability of companies that sell advanced semiconductors and the machinery used to produce them to Chinese firms. On that issue, Egan said, Trump and Biden appear to be on the same page. 'I think it's important to also note the continuity in how Trump's approaching AI,' she said. 'He, too, sees it as a national security risk and national security imperative. ... So, I think we should expect to see this run-fast approach to AI complemented by continued efforts to understand and manage emerging risks. Particularly cyber, nuclear, biological risks, as well as a more muscular approach to export controls and enforcement.' Speed and safety Louis Rosenberg, CEO and chief scientist at Unanimous AI and a prominent figure in the field for decades, told VOA he thinks there is a bipartisan consensus that AI needs to be developed speedily but also responsibly. 'At the highest level, the accelerating risks around frontier AI is not a partisan issue,' he wrote in an email exchange. 'Both parties realize that significant safeguards will be needed as AI gets increasingly intelligent and flexible, especially as autonomous AI agents get released at large scale.' Rosenberg said the most significant question is how the U.S. can remain the global leader in AI development while making sure the systems that are deployed are safe and reliable. 'I suspect the Trump administration will address AI risks by deploying its own targeted policies that are not as broad as the Biden executive order was but can address real threats much faster,' he wrote. 'The Biden executive order was very useful in raising the alarm about AI, but from a practical perspective it did not provide meaningful protections from the important emerging risks. 'Ultimately we need to find a way to move fast on AI development and move fast on AI protection. We need speed on both fronts,' Rosenberg said.

Trump escalates campaign against diversity, threatens private sector probes	U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his campaign against diversity programs on Tuesday by pressuring the private sector to join the initiative and telling government employees in offices administering such programs they would be placed on paid leave. On his first day in office, Trump issued a series of executive orders to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which attempt to promote opportunities for women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people and other traditionally underrepresented groups. Civil rights advocates have argued that such programs are necessary to address long-standing inequities and structural racism. Trump and his supporters say DEI programs end up unfairly discriminating against other Americans and weaken the importance of candidates' merit in job hiring or promotion. In an executive order issued on Tuesday, Trump revoked executive orders dating as far back as 1965 on environmental actions, equal employment opportunities and encouragement to federal contractors to achieve workforce balancing on race, gender and religion. The 1965 order that was revoked was signed by then-President Lyndon Johnson to protect the rights of workers employed by federal contractors and ensure they remained free from discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin, according to the Labor Department. The Trump executive order seeks to dissuade private companies that receive government contracts from using DEI programs and hiring on the basis of race and sex — what the order called 'illegal DEI discrimination and preferences' — and asks government agencies to identify private companies that might be subject to civil investigation. 'As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars,' the order said. Full details on how the Trump administration would enforce 'civil compliance investigations' were not immediately available. The order issued on Tuesday stipulates that federal and private-sector employment preferences for military veterans could continue. The executive order was celebrated by conservative activists and Republican leaders. It was also met with condemnation from civil rights leaders who are strategizing how to respond to Trump's actions. Reverend Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, formally announced Wednesday the organization and its partners plan to identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be boycotted for abandoning DEI pledges. Reuters first reported the coordinated action ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Basil Smikle Jr., a political strategist and policy adviser, said he was troubled by the Trump administration's assertion that diversity programs were 'diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work and determination' because it suggested women and people of color lacked merit or qualifications. 'There's this clear effort to hinder, if not erode, the political and economic power of people of color and women,' Smikle said. 'What it does is opens up the door for more cronyism,' he said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters to address criticism from civil rights advocates. Separately, the Trump administration instructed U.S. federal government departments and agencies to dismantle all DEI programs, advising employees of such programs that they would be immediately placed on paid leave. The government should by the end of business on Wednesday inform employees of any government offices or units focused exclusively on DEI that their programs will be shut down and employees placed on leave, the Office of Personnel Management said in a memorandum. The Tuesday memo also included a template for agency heads to use, encouraging federal employees to report alleged attempts by 'some in government to disguise' continued use of DEI programs and initiatives 'by using coded or imprecise language.' A directive, using nearly identical wording, was distributed Wednesday to staff at various federal agencies and departments, including the State Department, according to a memo viewed by Reuters. Trump also signed a memorandum on Tuesday that ends a Biden administration initiative to promote diversity in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), ordering the FAA administrator to immediately stop DEI hiring programs, the White House said. Trump ordered the FAA to conduct a safety review that would replace any employees who fail to demonstrate their competence. 'President Trump is immediately terminating this illegal and dangerous program and requiring that all FAA hiring be based solely on ensuring the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence,' the White House said in a fact sheet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-escalates-campaign-against-diversity-threatens-private-sector-probes-/7946801.html	2025-01-22T15:20:23-08:00	
Austin Tice's mother travels to Syria to search for missing son	WASHINGTON/DAMASCUS, SYRIA — At a recent press conference in the Four Seasons Hotel in Syria's capital, Damascus, Debra Tice made clear that she would never give up searching for her son, Austin. A former U.S. Marine-turned-journalist, Austin Tice was detained at a checkpoint in Syria in 2012. Little has been heard or seen of him since, but he is believed to have been held in Damascus. After the Bashar al-Assad government fell in December, U.S. officials made a few short visits to Syria, but Tice's family said they had expected more. Debra said she had hoped the U.S. government would send an official search team, but she wasn't shocked that they didn't. 'You can't even believe it. It's heartbreaking,' she said. Watch related report by Cristina Caicedo Smit and Liam Scott: In the weeks after the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — known as HTS — overthrew the Assad government, hundreds of people were released from prisons run by the former government. Scenes of families reuniting had raised hope among the Tice family. Just days before Assad fell, the family had convened in Washington to say they had received recent evidence confirming Tice was alive. At the press conference on Monday, Debra said that she feels solidarity with the many Syrians who have had a family member disappear. These families 'understand the pain that we carry every day, that our families carry, that the nieces and nephews that have never met their uncles carry,' she said. 'For all the mothers whose sons were disappeared in these dungeons, our hearts are joined,' she said. When Roger Carstens, the U.S. hostage envoy for the Biden and first Trump administration, visited Damascus in late December, he told reporters that U.S. officials weren't able to be on the ground for extended periods of time to search for Tice. Trump's new nominee for the hostage envoy position is Adam Boehler, whose confirmation hearing has yet to be scheduled. Watch related report by Cristina Caicedo Smit: On the ground in Syria, the Washington-based nonprofit Hostage Aid Worldwide has been leading efforts to locate Tice. Soon after Assad fell, the team began searching former prisons and buildings, including one that the group's president, Nizar Zakka, described as a secret detention center. The facility was dark and grimy. Like in previous prisons they inspected, they found documents, but no people. 'We are learning more and more about how the prison systems operate in Syria, how it was operating, how it was moving, who managed what,' Zakka told VOA after a search. 'It's going to take time to find Austin.' In December, the U.S. State Department announced it was increasing its award to $10 million for information about Tice's whereabouts. 'I understand the State Department, that they're outside of Syria and they want to feel like they're doing something,' Zakka said. But the increased reward has led to an increase in tips with unhelpful information, he said. A State Department spokesperson told VOA that efforts to find Tice remain under way. 'We are working to get U.S. officials into Damascus for additional trips to help direct the search and will do so as soon as we confirm the conditions are safe and local authorities can accommodate the visit,' the spokesperson said in a Thursday statement. Advocates say it feels as if the search for Tice has fallen on civil society groups, rather than the U.S. government. 'It definitely feels like that — that they're standing back at this time,' according to Bill McCarren, the executive director at the National Press Club's Press Freedom Center in Washington. 'There does need to be a more sustained effort,' said McCarren, who has worked on Tice's case for years. In Damascus, Tice's mother said she was hopeful that the new Trump administration would help secure her son's release. 'I have great hope that the Trump administration will sincerely engage in diligent work to bring Austin home,' she said. 'His people have already reached out to me.' While visiting the Syrian capital, she also met with Syria's new de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. 'It was so wonderful to learn that they are dedicated and determined to bring home my son,' she said. But for Zakka of Hostage Aid Worldwide, the Syrian transitional government is also making it harder for his organization to search for Tice. Soon after Assad fell, Zakka said his group had a lot of freedom. But now, 'there's more restrictions every day,' Zakka said. 'It's getting difficult.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/austin-tice-s-mother-travels-to-syria-to-search-for-missing-son/7946775.html	2025-01-22T15:02:10-08:00	
Russia's Arctic militarization behind Trump's focus on Greenland	Nuuk, Greenland — A blizzard whips the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands flags above the Joint Arctic Command headquarters overlooking the harbor of Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. The small military outpost staffed by around 80 personnel oversees Danish security for the vast Arctic island of some 2.1 million square kilometers. Greenland’s government is largely autonomous, but the island is part of the Danish Kingdom, and Denmark retains responsibility for its security. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear his determination to take ownership of the island for the United States and hasn’t ruled out using economic or military force. Speaking hours after his inauguration, Trump reiterated his view that U.S. control was necessary for 'international security' because, he explained, 'You have Russian boats all over the place. You have China boats all over the place, warships. And [Denmark] can't maintain it.' Russian missiles The United States has long viewed Greenland as vitally important for its defense, explained Marc Jacobsen, an analyst at the Royal Danish Defense College in Copenhagen. 'There's no doubt that it's geostrategically important in defending the U.S. national security against Russian missiles,' Jacobsen told VOA. 'The shortest route for Russian missiles towards the U.S. is via the North Pole, via Greenland.' Russia has invested heavily in its Arctic military footprint in recent years. Its northernmost Nagurskoye air base on Siberia’s northern coast hosts nuclear-capable strategic bombers, missile and surveillance systems. Russian nuclear submarines patrol the Arctic seas, while a growing fleet of nuclear-powered ice breakers projects Kremlin power across the region. China and Russia have conducted joint military drills in the Arctic. Beijing is also seeking access to valuable minerals beneath the ice. 'There is definitely a threat, especially from Russian military capacities in that region. And NATO countries are right now moving to increase their capacity,' Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, also of the Royal Danish Defense College, told VOA. Denmark’s defense Denmark’s military capabilities on Greenland consist of four aging naval patrol vessels, a surveillance plane and dog sled patrols. Copenhagen announced plans last month to invest in new surveillance drones, two new ships and additional personnel, along with upgrading an existing air base to accommodate F-35 fighter jets. The exact cost has yet to be decided, but the government said it would spend a 'double-digit billion amount' in Danish kroner, or at least $1.5 billion. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen admitted, however, that the government has failed to invest in Greenland’s security. 'We have neglected for many years to make the necessary investments in our ships, in the aircraft that will help to monitor our kingdom, and that is what we are now trying to do something about,' he told reporters on Jan. 9. 'We will hopefully create an investment package where we will strengthen our ability to monitor what is happening in the Arctic, and also for some new capacities to be put into place.' Denmark hopes the upgrades will go toward 'meeting American demands for increasing the surveillance of Greenland,' Jacobsen said. US Space base The U.S. military has been present in Greenland since World War II, when American forces were deployed to the island following Denmark’s fall to Nazi Germany. At the height of the U.S. deployment, Greenland hosted more than 10,000 U.S. service personnel. The Pituffik Space Base on Greenland’s northwest coast, formerly known as the Thule Air Base, is the United States’ northernmost military facility. It now hosts around 200 military personnel, alongside missile warning, defense and space surveillance systems. 'The military protection of Greenland de facto relies on the U.S.,' Rahbek-Clemmensen said. 'And the big question is then whether the U.S. wants to enhance that presence, perhaps to be able to do other types of military operations in that area.' That may be why, he added, Danish officials appear to be approaching the issue in a manner that maintains good U.S. relations. 'The Danish government has been trying to touch on that word 'control' that Trump uses, which is a very ambiguous term,' he added. 'What does control mean? Does it mean owning a piece of territory? Or does it mean having a certain amount of military equipment on that territory?' US-Danish relations At Denmark’s Arctic command center in Nuuk, the U.S. flag flies alongside the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands colors. The building also hosts the U.S. Consulate — a sign that, for the time being, U.S.-Danish relations remain cordial. Before Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen said there were no plans to expand U.S. military presence in Greenland. That could change under the new president. For now, Denmark and its European allies are hoping that Trump’s comments are part of a strategy to force NATO allies to spend more on defense. 'There's an important element which is about his personality, which he brings into the way that U.S. diplomacy, or his diplomacy, is carried out,' Jacobsen said. 'In a positive light, if the USA increases its presence in the Arctic, it will increase the NATO presence, because the seven Arctic states — besides Russia — we are all members of NATO now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-arctic-militarization-behind-trump-s-focus-on-greenland/7946621.html	2025-01-22T14:31:53-08:00	
Georgia's Zourabichvili says US shouldn't back government that is result of 'rigged elections'	washington — Last December, Georgia’s parliament chose Mikheil Kavelashvili, a close ally of ruling Georgian Dream party founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, as the country’s new president. He replaced Salome Zourabichvili, who had won the presidency in 2018 in a popular vote. Zourabichvili was the country’s fifth president. Opposition parties and Zourabichvili contend that the country’s October 2024 parliamentary elections, which Georgian Dream officially won with 54.09% of the vote, were rigged, and that therefore neither Georgian Dream’s victory nor Kavelashvili’s replacement of Zourabichvili as president was legitimate. The opposition parties have refused to enter parliament and work with Georgian Dream members and are demanding new elections. Zourabichvili was in Washington to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump at the invitation of Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina. While in the U.S. capital, she spoke with Voice of America. The following transcript of that interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: VOA: Thank you for being here at VOA. We know that you attended the inauguration of the 47th president of the United States but also had a chance to meet with members of President Trump’s Cabinet. What was your main message during those meetings? Salome Zourabichvili, former president of Georgia: Well, those … were more social encounters before the inauguration and before the confirmation of those Cabinet members. I met them during different receptions and at [an inaugural] ball. So it was not a place for [a] formal meeting [or] for relaying formal messages. It's very important that contact was established. My short message was that Georgia [is] at a very crucial turning point today, in a region that is very important for the United States and for the United States’ interests, and so there should be immediate attention for what is happening in Georgia, in the Caucasus, in the Black Sea, from the new administration. VOA: You often say that Georgia needs the U.S., but the U.S. also needs Georgia. Why should Georgia be important for the United States, and what role could Georgia play in the South Caucasus [and] the wider region? Zourabichvili: First of all, because the Russians know that more than anybody else: They always said historically that whoever controls Tbilisi … controls the Caucasus. And that is even more important today, at a time when this region is becoming very important for control of the Black Sea. ... The ports of the Black Sea are very important. And it's not a coincidence that Russia started the war against Ukraine also for control of that part of the Black Sea coast, starting with Crimea in 2014. And it's no coincidence that the hybrid war Russia … has started with the elections in Georgia, also with the elections in Romania, and to rig the elections, in a very different manner, in Moldova – so those three countries, if you look at the map, are countries of the Black Sea. So the strategy of Russia is very clear. Hence the strategy of the United States should be [a] continuation of what it has been over the years, which was to consolidate Georgia … [as] a stronghold of democracy. [The] Georgian army would not exist were it not for American support. So I think that shows that this was not just for sympathy of, but because there was a serious, real American interest in supporting Georgia. And I'm confident that these interests are still there and even more today than maybe in the past. VOA: You were invited to attend the inauguration by Congressman Joe Wilson, one of the authors in the U.S House of Representatives of the MEGOBARI Act [aimed at bolstering democracy and countering Russian influence in Georgia], and the Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act [prohibiting the U.S. from recognizing the Ivanishvili regime and recognizing Zourabichvili as Georgia’s legitimate president]. Could you explain why you think it is so important for the U.S. government not to recognize the current Georgian government? Zourabichvili: I think it is not possible for a country like the United States to recognize a government that is the result of rigged elections and anti-constitutional acts … a regime in which no independent institution is left; all the institutions are just nominated by one party and one-man rule. That is really destroying everything that the United States has been doing in this country. Building institutions — not only the army; it's all the institutions — support for reform of the justice system, creation of the anti-corruption system and all of that, which is really the work of more than 30 years since the independence of Georgia. What is happening today is really destroying all of that. VOA: You, the opposition and part of Georgian people are asking for new elections. Is that the main demand at this moment? Zourabichvili: I'm still hoping that the de facto leaders [of Georgia] would recognize that stability of the country is the most important thing and would come to terms with helping the country by [holding] new elections, through some compromise with the opposition. But as time goes by, there's probably less and less hope that they would come to such a sensible solution. And what will then happen most probably is that the regime will dissolve, because it cannot resist either the sanctions, the economic and financial situation that we are getting into, the fact that it's rejected by the vast majority of the country and is isolated from all the partners, Americans and Europeans, that have been really supporting Georgia over the years. VOA: Different experts we talk with say that Georgia is not going to be a top priority of the Trump administration. How do you plan to bring Georgia to its attention? Zourabichvili: Well, we probably are never going to be the top priority, and I hope it won't be, because that means a crisis of a different level, which we don't want. Again, we do not want instability. But I think that what is happening in Georgia is quite important as an example. I don't think America [can] accept a country [that] has been supported and, really, constructed as a state by the United States, [making] friends with terrorist movements, with Iran, with China, and [handing over] strategic interests on the Black Sea, the port of Anaklia, or new communications lines, to China, which is what is happening.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-s-zourabichvili-says-us-shouldn-t-back-government-that-is-result-of-rigged-elections-/7946741.html	2025-01-22T14:07:59-08:00

Trump administration freezes many health agency reports, online posts	The Trump administration has put a freeze on many federal health agency communications with the public through at least the end of the month. In a memo obtained by The Associated Press, acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Dorothy Fink told agency staff leaders Tuesday that an 'immediate pause' had been ordered on — among other things — regulations, guidance, announcements, press releases, social media posts and website posts until such communications had been approved by a political appointee. The pause also applies to anything intended to be published in the Federal Register, where the executive branch communicates rules and regulations, and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientific publication. The pause is in effect through February 1, the memo said. Agencies subject to the HHS directive include the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration — entities that fight epidemics, protect the nation's food supply, and search for cures to diseases. HHS officials did not respond to requests for comment on the pause, which was first reported by The Washington Post. Four federal health officials speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the issue confirmed the communication pause to the AP. A former HHS official said Wednesday that it's not unusual for incoming administrations to pause agency communications for review. But typically, officials working on the president's transition team have the process for issuing documents running smoothly by inauguration day. 'The executive branch is a hierarchy,' said Steven Grossman, who now consults for food and drug companies, in an email. 'Whether stated publicly or not, every new administration wants important commitments and positions to wait until new teams are in place and some semblance of hierarchy restored.' A pause is reasonable as a changing executive branch takes steps to become coordinated, said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska's public health college. 'The only concern would be is if this is a prelude to going back to a prior approach of silencing the agencies around a political narrative,' he added. During his first term, President Donald Trump's political appointees tried to gain control over the CDC's MMWR journal, which had published information about the COVID-19 pandemic that conflicted with messaging from the White House. Fink wrote in her memo that some exceptions would be made for communications affecting 'critical health, safety, environmental, financial or nation security functions,' but that those would be subject to review. The FDA on Tuesday and Wednesday posted notices about warning letters sent to companies and a drug safety notice. A consumer advocacy group said the communications pause could still threaten public safety. Americans depend on timely information from the CDC, the FDA and other agencies to avoid foodborne illnesses and stay aware of other health issues, said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 'When it comes to stopping outbreaks, every second counts,' Lurie said in a statement. 'Confusion around the vaguely worded gag order is likely to lead to unnecessary delay in publishing urgent public alerts during active outbreaks.' He was echoed by Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public health expert. 'Local health officials and doctors depend on the CDC to get disease updates, timely prevention, testing and treatment guidelines and information about outbreaks,' Klausner wrote in an email. 'Shutting down public health communication stops a basic function of public health. Imagine if the government turned off fire sirens or other warning systems.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-freezes-many-health-agency-reports-online-posts/7946719.html	2025-01-22T13:53:52-08:00

Nigeria's new BRICS partner status sparks economic optimism, debate	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian authorities said this week that the nation’s new partnership status with the BRICS bloc could unlock critical opportunities in trade, investment and agriculture. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu’s special adviser told Lagos-based Channels Television that the partnership, which became official Friday, is pivotal to promoting trade, investment, food security, infrastructure development and energy security. The adviser, Daniel Bwala, said the pact enables Nigeria to forge deeper strategic relationships with BRICS members beyond traditional bilateral partnerships. BRICS — an acronym for the founding members of Brazil, Russia, India and China, with South Africa added a year later — is a political and economic bloc. BRICS introduced the 'partner country' category in October. Partner nations are a step below full membership. Economist Emeka Okengwu praised the arrangement. 'Look at the members of BRICS and the economies that they bring to the table. Brazil is probably the biggest producer of livestock and its products globally, then to aircraft, aviation and renewable energy,' Okengwu said. 'Look at Russia, India, China and South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia. These are big populations. If you put them together, they probably bring 10 times the value of whatever Europe and America can give to you,' he said. In total, the 10 BRICS member states make up 40% of the global economy and 55% of the global population. In a statement, Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said that the country’s participation in BRICS reflects its commitment to leveraging global economic opportunities to advance national development goals. Last December, Nigeria intensified efforts to join not only BRICS but also the G20 organization of the world’s major economies and the BRICS New Development Bank. Okengwu said the partnership will help Nigeria at 'being productive, taking goods and services in there, being able to meet global standards and being competitive.' 'It would've been horrible if Nigeria was not in BRICS and then we would've been left hanging with all these challenges we're having with our neighbors in the Sahel,' Okengwu said. Despite the optimism, analysts say Nigeria faces significant hurdles. The country’s struggling economy and inadequate infrastructure raise concerns about its capacity for meaningful growth through BRICS. There's also concern about how Nigeria will balance its alliances with Western nations while deepening ties with BRICS. However, Ndu Nwokolo, an economist with Nextier, suggested the challenge is manageable. 'It's about how smart you are to benefit from everybody,' Nwokolo said. 'With what we're seeing by some of the pronouncements of [U.S.] President [Donald] Trump, Nigeria may benefit from it because already Trump is talking about increasing taxes [tariffs] even within ally states. 'So, if he's going to do that with countries we think are traditional partners, so who's telling you that he will not do more with countries that he considers outsiders,' he said. 'So, we're looking at a situation where countries that are not originally traditional allies of America will try to pull together, and Nigeria may benefit from that.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-new-brics-partner-status-sparks-economic-optimism-debate/7946666.html	2025-01-22T13:06:38-08:00	
Trump's agriculture secretary pick led group opposed to ethanol, farm subsidies	President Donald Trump's pick to run the Agriculture Department, Brooke Rollins, led an organization that opposed ethanol mandates and farm subsidies, major programs she could influence if confirmed, according to a Reuters review of the group's policy statements. That background may put Rollins at odds with farm state lawmakers at her nomination hearing on Thursday and revive concerns in the powerful corn and biofuel lobbies about Trump's mixed record on ethanol during his first term in office. 'The hearing is a perfect occasion to renounce the misleading and demonstrably false statements made about ethanol by some of her colleagues more than a decade ago,' said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol trade group. Rollins was president and CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation from 2003 to 2018, during which time the oil industry-backed nonprofit argued that government support for ethanol contributed to higher emissions and rising food and fuel prices. The oil industry has seen ethanol as a threat to its share in the gasoline market. It says a federal mandate requiring the biofuel to be blended into the nation's fuel supply costs it a fortune in compliance costs. 'As a way to save the planet, not many policies are worse than government-backed ethanol. It’s bad for the economy, bad for the environment, doesn’t reduce greenhouse gases and has led to rapidly rising food prices,' said one article published by the Texas group in 2012. In 2017, Rollins endorsed Kathleen Hartnett White, the longtime director of the group's energy program, to serve as Trump's chair of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality. The White House later withdrew her nomination after a contentious hearing that included criticism of her ethanol positions from farm state senators. White had supported a 2008 effort by then-Texas Governor Rick Perry to partly waive the ethanol blending program, known as the Renewable Fuel Standard, in the state. The Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the program, denied Perry's request. During Rollins' tenure, the group also called for the elimination of farm subsidies in a 2016 report titled The Policymaker's Guide to Corporate Welfare. The report said offering loan guarantees to farmers to start or expand their operations 'introduces distortions into the marketplace.' The USDA issues billions of dollars in direct and guaranteed loans each year to support the domestic farm economy. Rollins, who served as acting director of the White House Domestic Policy Council during Trump's first term, is set to appear before the Senate Agriculture Committee for her nomination hearing on Thursday. 'Brooke Rollins will work to enact the president’s agenda, and you can look to President Trump’s past statements of support for biofuels to understand the administration’s position on this issue,' said Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the Trump administration transition team. During his 2017-21 term, Trump boosted corn-based ethanol by enabling year-round sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, but he also angered the ethanol industry by expanding the use of waivers exempting small refiners from the federal blending requirement. Ethanol trade group Growth Energy said it supported Rollins' nomination and believed the Trump administration would support the ethanol industry's priorities. During the Biden administration, Rollins led the America First Policy Institute, a policy organization closely tied to Trump that has expressed skepticism about climate change. More than 400 state and national agriculture groups wrote to Senate Agriculture Committee leaders John Boozman and Amy Klobuchar on January 15 to endorse Rollins. 'Her close working relationship with incoming President Trump will ensure that agriculture and rural America have a prominent and influential voice at the table when critical decisions are made in the White House,' the letter said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-agriculture-secretary-pick-led-group-opposed-to-ethanol-farm-subsidies-/7946665.html	2025-01-22T12:39:46-08:00	
Trump revokes humanitarian parole for migrants from 4 countries	Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump ended on Monday a humanitarian parole program that benefited Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, and Haitians. Under the executive order called 'Securing Our Borders,' which outlines various immigration-related actions, President Trump aimed to take 'all appropriate action' to build the border wall, deploying defense personnel to the southern border, and detain irregular migrants. It also asks for elimination of certain parole programs. One such program, the CHNV program (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela) allowed up to 30,000 individuals per month from those countries to enter the United States legally and stay for a period of up to two years, provided they had a U.S.-based supporter. As of December 2024, about 531,690 people had entered the country under that program, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Beneficiaries were required to have a valid passport, arrange their own travel, and pass national security and public safety vetting, among other criteria. The Biden White House announced the CHNV parole program on January 5, 2023. Officials at the time said the initiative was part of the administration's efforts to discourage unlawful entries along the U.S. southern border. The program was modeled on the Ukraine program and an earlier Venezuelan program. Immediate effects The executive order took effect immediately. That means that no new applications will be accepted from individuals seeking to sponsor those migrants. Elizabeth Jacobs of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that advocates restricting immigration to the U.S., told VOA that those who have received parole already through this program will likely be allowed to remain in the United States as parolees until their parole period expires.' At that time, Jacobs said, those individuals would be 'without status' and at risk of deportation. Programs like CNHV were a way 'Americans have been able to legally and safely sponsor newcomers in need of refuge to come to the United States, including Afghan allies,' Nazanin Ash, CEO of Welcome.US, wrote on their website. 'Those who had parole protection before January 20 will have to seek immigration status through other means or risk deportation from the United States,' Cori Alonso-Yoder, told VOA. She is an immigration law professor at George Washington University. The executive orders do not indicate that humanitarian parole will be revoked for current beneficiaries of the program, said Doris Meissner of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington during a press call on Tuesday. However, 'they certainly will not renew it.' 'So what happens to those people? If they stay in the U.S. once the two-year period ends, they will, of course, fall into unauthorized status. They will lose their work authorization and will certainly be subject to deportation,' she noted. Other legal options The program was not a path to U.S. citizenship or permanent residence. However, according to immigration lawyers, beneficiaries may be able to adjust their immigration status from temporary parole to a more permanent one, such as a visa or sponsorship through a U.S. relative, which can lead to a green card. Cubans, after a year in the U.S., can apply for permanent residence under the Cuban Adjustment Act. Venezuelans and Haitians may qualify for Temporary Protected Status, which provides relief from deportation and work authorization. They could also apply for asylum along with Nicaraguans. However, they must demonstrate a credible fear of persecution in their home countries based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-revokes-humanitarian-parole-for-migrants-from-four-countries/7946518.html	2025-01-22T11:47:16-08:00	
At least 2 students injured in shooting at Nashville high school, police say	NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE — At least two students were wounded by gunfire at a Nashville high school Wednesday but the situation has been contained, police said. Metro Nashville Police spokesperson April Weatherly could not immediately describe the conditions of those who were shot at Antioch High School, which has about 2,000 students and is located in a neighborhood of Nashville about 16 kilometers southeast of downtown. The shooter is believed to have shot two students before shooting themself, according to Weatherly, who could not immediately say if the shooter was a student. School officials are asking parents not to go to the high school to pick up their children. They were asked to go to a nearby hospital instead. Students will be bused there as they are released from the school by police. The FBI in Nashville referred questions to the Metro Nashville Police Department, which is leading the investigation, spokesperson Elizabeth Clement-Webb said in an email. She said Nashville police had not asked for the FBI's help in the investigation as of early Wednesday afternoon. In March 2023, a shooter killed three 9-year-olds and three adults at a private Christian elementary school in the city, The Covenant School.	https://www.voanews.com/a/students-injured-in-shooting-at-nashville-high-school-police-say/7946512.html	2025-01-22T11:24:42-08:00	
Pentagon to send up to 1,500 active duty troops to help secure US-Mexico border, officials say	WASHINGTON — The Pentagon will begin deploying as many as 1,500 active duty troops to help secure the southern border in the coming days, U.S. officials said Wednesday, putting in motion plans President Donald Trump laid out in executive orders shortly after he took office to crack down on immigration. Acting Defense Secretary Robert Salesses was expected to sign the deployment orders on Wednesday, but it wasn't yet clear which troops or units will go, and the total could fluctuate. It remains to be seen if they will end up doing law enforcement, which would put American troops in a dramatic new role, not done in recent history. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement has not yet been made. The active duty forces would join the roughly 2,500 U.S. National Guard and Reserve forces already there. There are currently no active duty troops working along the border. The forces are expected to be used to support border patrol agents, with logistics, transportation and construction of barriers. They have done similar duties in the past, when both Trump and former President Joe Biden sent active duty troops to the border. Troops are prohibited by law from doing law enforcement duties on the border, but that may change. Trump has directed through executive order that the incoming secretary of defense and incoming homeland security chief report back within 90 days if they think an 1807 law called the Insurrection Act should be invoked. That would allow those troops to be used in civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil. The widely expected deployment, coming in Trump's first week in office, was an early step in his long-touted plan to expand the use of the military along the border. In one of his first orders on Monday, Trump directed the defense secretary to come up with a plan to 'seal the borders' and repel 'unlawful mass migration.' On Tuesday, just as Trump fired the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, the service announced it was surging more cutter ships, aircraft and personnel to the 'Gulf of America' — another nod to the president's directive to rename the Gulf of Mexico. Trump said during his inaugural address on Monday that 'I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places in which they came.' In his first term, Trump also ordered active duty troops to the border to help the Department of Homeland Security and border control agents, in response to a caravan of migrants slowly making its way through Mexico toward the United States in 2018. In executive orders signed Monday, Trump suggested the military would help DHS with 'detention space, transportation (including aircraft), and other logistics services.' U.S. active duty troops are forbidden from doing law enforcement duties under the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century federal law. So they can't arrest or detain people at the border, unless the president acts to invoke the Insurrection Act. The Insurrection Act allows presidents to call on reserve or active duty military units to respond to unrest in the states, an authority that is not reviewable by the courts. During the 2018 deployment, more than 7,000 active duty troops were sent to Texas, Arizona and California, including military police, an assault helicopter battalion, various communications, medical and headquarters units, combat engineers, planners and public affairs units. At the time, the Pentagon was adamant that active duty troops would not do law enforcement. So they spent much of their time transporting border patrol agents to and along the border, helping them erect additional vehicle barriers and fencing along the border, assisting them with communications and providing some security for border agent camps. The military also provided border patrol agents with medical care, pre-packaged meals and temporary housing. Normally, in deployments to the border in support of the Department of Homeland Security, Pentagon officials request specifics from DHS on what needs to be accomplished, and military leaders then decide what troops should go and how many.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-to-send-up-to-1-500-active-duty-troops-to-help-secure-us-mexico-border-officials-say/7946463.html	2025-01-22T11:00:43-08:00	
US lawmakers warn of ‘emboldened’ terror threat	WASHINGTON — Top Republican lawmakers are calling for U.S. security agencies to quickly change course under President Donald Trump to better confront threats from terror groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida. The House Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday issued an update threat assessment, highlighting the New Year’s Day truck ramming attack in New Orleans, which killed 14 people, as well as the June 2024 arrest of eight Tajik nationals with suspected Islamic State ties. 'Make no mistake — all of the lights are still blinking red,' said committee chair Republican Representative Mark Green in a statement. 'The New Orleans terrorist attack was a stark reminder that the terror threat to America is alive and persistent,' said Green. 'Foreign terrorist organizations and jihadist networks abroad remain committed to recruiting and radicalizing individuals on U.S. soil.' Green’s comments harken back to a 2023 warning from then-FBI Director Christopher Wray, made in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel, which officials said seemed to inspire terror groups around the world. 'I've never seen a time where all the threats, or so many of the threats, are all elevated, all at exactly the same time,' Wray said at the time. Last year, Wray warned the FBI was increasingly concerned about a coordinated terror attack on the U.S. like the March 2024 Islamic State terror attacks on a Moscow concert hall. The Department of Homeland Security's 2025 annual threat assessment, issued this past October, warned, 'The terrorism threat environment in the United States over the next year will remain high.' And it attributed the biggest danger to individuals who are not necessarily affiliated with established terror groups. 'The threat will continue to be characterized primarily by lone offenders or small cells motivated to violence by a combination of racial, religious, gender, or anti-government grievances; conspiracy theories; and personalized factors,' it said. Green on Wednesday blamed the increased threat on the administration of former President Joe Biden, saying terror groups have been 'emboldened by the national security blunders of the past four years.' The committee’s 'Terror Threat Snapshot' cited more than 50 terrorism cases in 30 U.S. states since April 2021 and 187 terrorism arrests, attacks and plots in Western Europe since the start of 2023. Democrats expressed some disappointment, arguing the comments have not been backed up by the committee’s actions to date. 'It’s a bit confusing,' according to one staffer, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to respond to the chair’s comments. 'Why haven’t they had substantive hearings on foreign terrorism and homegrown violent extremism?' Meanwhile, a new report Wednesday by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies cautioned that while there is reason to be concerned about the exploits and ambitions of groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida, the threat inside the United States does not appear to be growing. 'Longer-term trends suggest that jihadist terrorism in the United States is not resurgent,' according to the report. 'Groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida have filled more of an inspirational role rather than directly orchestrating attacks on the United States,' it said. 'The average lethality of jihadist terrorist attacks has also fallen since the peak of the [Islamic State] caliphate.' The CSIS report found there were a yearly average of 38 recorded attacks or plots in the U.S. from 2020 to 2023, but only 21 recorded plots or attacks during the first 11 months of 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-warn-of-emboldened-terror-threat/7946462.html	2025-01-22T10:55:02-08:00	
Islamic State claims killing of Chinese national in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Taliban authorities in northeastern Afghanistan said Wednesday that a gun attack resulted in the death of a Chinese national, while his local interpreter escaped unharmed. An Afghanistan-based Islamic State affiliate, IS-Khorasan, claimed responsibility for the deadly overnight shooting in Takhar province, which sits on the country’s border with Tajikistan. The terrorist outfit said on its Amaq media outlet that its 'soldiers' used a machine gun to target the Chinese man. Taliban officials said the slain foreigner was working for a mining company in the country. Mohammad Akbar, the provincial police chief, said the Chinese citizen was being driven with his interpreter to the Dasht-e-Qala district late Tuesday when their vehicle was ambushed. Akbar said that foreign travelers must notify local police before embarking on a road trip, but he said the deceased Chinese citizen failed to do so. The police officer added that an investigation into the attack was underway. 'I believe our embassy in Afghanistan will track the information over what’s happened and do its utmost to protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens and their safety,' said Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, during a press conference in Beijing when asked about the shooting incident. Tuesday’s fatal assault on a Chinese national in Afghanistan marked the first such incident since December 2022, when IS-Khorasan militants stormed a Kabul hotel popular with Chinese investors. That attack resulted in the deaths of three Afghans and injuries to 18 people, including five Chinese nationals. The Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in August 2021, when the United States and its Western allies withdrew their troops from the country after a nearly two-decade-long presence. While de facto Afghan rulers assert they have restored peace and order to the conflict-torn country since seizing power, IS-Khorasan has conducted repeated high-profile attacks targeting Taliban leaders, key religious figures and members of the Afghan minority Shiite community. No country has officially recognized the fundamentalist Taliban as legitimate rulers in Kabul, mainly over their sweeping curbs on Afghan women’s rights and freedoms and other human rights concerns. China was the first country to appoint an ambassador to Afghanistan and recognized a Taliban ambassador in Beijing since the group took control. It also has enhanced bilateral trade and investment ties with the de facto Kabul government to help stabilize the Afghan economy and deal with a dire humanitarian crisis. Chinese investors have signed significant agreements with Kabul in the Afghan mining and oil sectors since the Taliban takeover. Analysts suggest that China’s security concerns are motivating its growing diplomatic and economic engagement with the Taliban to prevent the country from descending into chaos again, which could lead to militants using Afghan territory as a base for launching terrorist attacks against Chinese interests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-claims-killing-of-chinese-national-in-afghanistan/7946312.html	2025-01-22T09:59:17-08:00	
Reporter's Notebook: Navigating journalism in the 'new' Syria	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — 'Here’s a good first line for you,' says VOA photojournalist Yan Boechat as we drive up to a former ruling party office in Damascus. On the building are murals depicting Hafez al-Assad, the deceased dictator of Syria, and his son and successor, Bashar al-Assad, who fled Syria when the regime fell in December. 'The line is, ‘This may be one of the few places in Syria where pictures of Hafez are still intact,’' Boechat says. And he is correct. Most of Syria’s public art of the Assads has been torn down or defaced. At the entrance to Damascus’ main market, posters of Bashar al-Assad’s face are placed on the ground for residents to stomp on. But in this neighborhood, populated almost entirely by former regime soldiers and their families, the pictures remain untouched. As we get out to take pictures, a young soldier on a motorcycle zips over. His hair is scruffy, and his face is covered with a green, polyester neck scarf. He greats us politely, and my male colleagues shake his hand. The soldiers of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, also known as HTS, don’t shake women’s hands. 'It’s better if you coordinate with us,' the soldier says, after our translator explains that we are journalists, reporting on post-regime Syria. 'It’s over,' says Boechat, half sighing and half laughing. He doesn’t mean a definitive end to the new days of a free press in Syria. But it’s certainly the end of locals in this neighborhood speaking openly. They are former regime fighters, and the new bosses are former rebels. 'Every day it’s a little more,' I joke when we get in the car to follow the soldier to his base. When we first arrived in Syria in December, there were no regulations for the press, or really anything. Rebels had taken over Syria only days before. They hadn’t had time to set rules. But on this trip, this was starting to change. We had to apply for entry and stop by the Ministry of Information for reporting permits. And now, soldiers on the streets were asking questions. Of course, it’s still more free than under the Assads. If the regime was still in charge, we could have been arrested for reporting on our own. During Bashar al-Assad’s rule, I applied for journalism visas — unsuccessfully — multiple times. A friend of a friend in the old Ministry of Information later told me my applications never reached them. The embassy officers would 'file it to the trash,' like those of other unwanted Western reporters, we assumed. As we arrive with the young soldier at his base — a low, single room shack by the roadside — our translator, Husam Yunso, speaks to the soldiers. They tell us to ignore the locals in the neighborhood and delete the videos of them. 'They are regime supporters and liars,' one soldier says. They offer us a tour. We know that no one will speak openly when we are accompanied by armed guards, but they seem to be genuinely trying to help. 'It’s becoming more like Turkey,' Yunso says when we are back in the car. Like in Turkey, Yunso points out, the security forces interrupted our work but didn’t threaten us. 'Let’s hope it stays at the level of Turkey,' Yunso says. After the fall The days after the regime fell were a free-for-all. In city squares, flags waved and music blasted. Elated rebels fired AK47s into the air. As fighters freed thousands of prisoners, families crowded inside the emptied facilities, searching for clues about their missing loved ones. Journalists flocked to Syria’s borders. Boechat, Yunso and I first crossed a few days later in a small bus packed with our equipment, a Syrian family and bags of bananas. At an abandoned border-crossing station on the Syrian side, an HTS soldier, dressed in well-worn fatigues, poked his head into the window. 'Do you have any explosives?' he asked, before dissolving into laughter and waving us through. On the road to Damascus, we saw abandoned military vehicles, their contents, including regime uniforms, scattered. An explosion near one such scene unnerved me. It turned out to be on the site of an already bombed weapons depot, courtesy of Israel. Presumably, some explosives were popping off from the fire. On the way, Boechat regaled us with tales of the regime days, when journalists were assigned a 'minder.' The minder could help secure interviews or translate, but their main job was to report back to the government about what the journalists were doing. Minders also served as a constant reminder not to touch taboo subjects. A week later and still minder-free, we entered Sednaya Prison, the flagship house of torture for political prisoners under the Assad regime. It may not have been the worst in the country, but it was the most notorious. Thousands of prisoners were freed from it when the rebels took over. Many left physically battered and mentally devastated, described by one former prisoner, named only as Ahmed, as 'mummies, not people.' Much of the trauma, Ahmed told us, came from witnessing nonstop deadly beatings and executions. When asked if he thought the families searching for lost relatives would find them, he replied, 'There is no one. … They were all killed.' Establishing order By the time we returned to Syria in early January, the new Ministry of Information was up and running. Housed in the same building, it even had some of the same staff. Nabih Bulos, the Middle East chief for the Los Angeles Times, greeted one such worker, and the men embraced. 'I never forget a face,' said Bulos, who worked in Syria multiple times under the old guard. In the offices, there was some confusion, but no more than usual when trying to get permits for reporting. We finally left with a promise that a general permit would be sent via WhatsApp. We neither received that document, nor were we asked to present it. A week later, the Ministry of Information sent an online form for journalists, asking them to detail work plans before they arrive. Like most new governmental institutions in Syria, press officials were still establishing their systems. It’s not yet clear how free the press will be to report. So far, there has been no indication that journalists will be watched 24 hours a day, persecuted and sometimes even disappeared or killed, as was done under Assad rule. But the fear of oppression is present. 'We have nothing to be scared of anymore,' says one market seller, when we ask for an on-camera interview. His friends, two men leaning against the building and smoking, laugh and agree. 'But yet, we are afraid to talk to the media.' Late last week, as I left Syria, I found rows of cars waiting on the Syrian side of the border at around 6 a.m. The new leadership had manned the stations near the entrance to Lebanon. 'Under the regime, this was much faster,' says the taxi driver, while we wait to cross. 'These guys are too slow.' Boechat remained in Damascus to spend a few more days reporting. Among other things, there was that tour of the neighborhood where former regime soldiers live. But the young soldier never answered our calls or texts, so Boechat went as before, without a guide. In the neighborhood, he took pictures again of the old Baath Party building. But now, the paintings of the Assads had been blacked out or removed. Boechat met another HTS soldier, Omar, a thin, bearded man in a camouflage sun hat who spoke about the history of violence between the neighborhood and rebel groups. It was clear from his speech that not all was forgiven. 'There was a warehouse here where they used to take detainees … and torture them to death,' he said in an on-camera interview. After leaving the area, Boechat headed up to a mountain that under the regime had been off limits to journalists and most other people. Near a checkpoint, he found families having tea on the grass. A white and gold Islamic flag was perched in the barrel of a large Soviet machine gun mounted on the back of a pickup truck. Boechat lifted his camera and asked if he could shoot. 'Sure, no problem,' said a soldier, posing with his fingers in a victory sign. A nearby radio cackled, and a commander swept over to Boechat, telling him to delete the picture. Boechat said that he would do it later, but the commander wanted to see it happen on the spot. 'You cannot have that picture,' he said. 'Delete it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/reporter-s-notebook-navigating-journalism-in-the-new-syria-/7946299.html	2025-01-22T09:54:33-08:00	
Justice Department takes aim at local, state officials over immigration enforcement	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department has threatened local and state authorities with prosecution if they fail to cooperate with President Donald Trump's immigration policies, which include a pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Citing a constitutional clause concerning division of power, acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove said in a memorandum that 'federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing, and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands.' 'The Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution,' Bove added in the memo issued late Tuesday and published by U.S. media on Wednesday. Trump announced new restrictions on immigration and asylum in the United States hours after taking office on Monday, including a plan to send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and end birthright citizenship. The Republican president vowed during his White House campaign to carry out the largest mass deportation of migrants in U.S. history. Bove said a newly created Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group would identify 'state and local laws, policies, and activities that are inconsistent with Executive Branch immigration initiatives and, where appropriate, to take legal action to challenge such laws.' A number of Democratic-controlled 'sanctuary cities' in the United States restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities. 'Laws and actions that threaten to impede Executive Branch immigration initiatives, including by prohibiting disclosures of information to federal authorities engaged in immigration enforcement activities, threaten public safety and national security,' Bove said. Bove, who served as one of Trump's personal lawyers before being named to the Justice Department, also directed the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces to participate 'in the execution of President Trump's immigration-related initiatives.' The FBI and other agencies should 'review their files for identifying information and/or biometric data relating to non-citizens located illegally in the United States' and turn it over to the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate removals, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/justice-department-takes-aim-at-local-state-officials-over-immigration-enforcement-/7946305.html	2025-01-22T09:26:11-08:00	
China braces for potential trade war after Trump threatens to impose tariffs	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China is bracing for potential tariffs after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 10% duty on Chinese imports as early as Feb. 1. At a regular press briefing Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stressed China’s commitment to defending its 'national interests.' 'We have always believed that there are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war,' she said. Following Trump’s remarks, China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index dropped 0.9% Wednesday, ending a four-day winning streak. The Hong Kong-listed Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese stocks, fell 2%. Beijing’s reactions come after Trump said his team was looking at potentially imposing a 10% tariff on Chinese imports because China has been 'sending fentanyl into the U.S. through Mexico and Canada.' 'Probably February 1st is the date we're looking at,' the U.S. president told reporters Tuesday at the White House. Trump’s comment comes one day after he appeared to be holding off on imposing tariffs on imports from China, and he directed federal agencies to investigate U.S. trade deficits and unfair trade practices with other countries on Monday. On Chinese social media, the U.S. president’s threat was met with a mixed response. Some internet users said the 10% tariff could be followed by a series of duties imposed against Chinese goods, while others criticized Trump for being unpredictable and inconsistent with his decisions. 'Why does the U.S. go through all this trouble? In the end, the American people are the ones who would have to pay because if China doesn’t export goods, American people won’t even have Christmas trees,' Chinese internet user Fortune Axe Brother wrote in a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Some analysts say the threat to impose tariffs as early as Feb. 1 could be the U.S. president’s 'negotiating gambit' to force concessions from China. 'Compared to the 25% tariffs that Trump has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada, the 10% tariff on Chinese imports seems like Trump going easy on China,' said Dexter Roberts, a non-resident fellow at Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub. In Roberts’ view, the threat reflects Trump’s desire to 'cut some sort of deal' with Beijing. 'If China comes through with what Trump views as concessions that are good for him and the U.S., he is very likely not to pursue those tariffs right away,' Roberts told VOA by phone. While it remains unclear whether the U.S. will follow through on the threat, some Chinese people say their export businesses already have been affected by concerns about potential U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports since last year. 'Even before Trump’s latest comments, some of our American customers had already pre-ordered a lot of goods from us since his election victory in November,' a Chinese winter apparel exporter surnamed Yuan in Shanghai, who asked to be identified only by his last name due to security concerns, told VOA in a written response. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, American companies increased their purchases from China in the last few months of 2024. China’s official customs data shows that Chinese companies exported goods worth almost $50 billion to the U.S. in December 2024, marking a 10.7% increase from a year before. To avoid the U.S. tariffs, some Chinese companies have moved production to countries in Southeast Asia or Latin America, such as Vietnam and Mexico, in recent years. 'After Trump launched a trade war against China during his first term, some of our American customers asked my company to move production to Vietnam,' a manager at a consumer electronics manufacturer in Guangzhou surnamed Li, who asked to be identified only by his last name due to security concerns, told VOA in a written response. Despite these preparations, experts say Chinese businesses will still struggle to deal with a potential trade war that Trump may launch against China during his second term. 'Trump already has experience in launching a trade war against China, and his administration is looking at targeting Chinese efforts to avoid U.S. tariffs by potentially imposing tariffs on Southeast Asian countries or Mexico,' He Jiangbing, an independent Chinese economic commentator, told VOA by phone. Since China has largely relied on exports to drive its economic growth in recent years, Roberts said potential tariffs imposed by the U.S. government could seriously affect China’s economic growth. 'China’s export sector would be hit hard by the tariffs and that means the whole Chinese economy would be hit hard,' he told VOA, saying the trend would have a 'knock-on effect' on domestic consumption. 'Exporters are employers so they might have to lay off workers and cut wages. People who have been laid off may spend less money and that will hurt the Chinese economy,' Roberts added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-braces-for-potential-trade-war-after-trump-threatens-to-impose-tariffs-/7946261.html	2025-01-22T08:54:05-08:00	
Death toll in flooding, landslides in Indonesia rises to 21	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesian rescuers retrieved four more bodies after they resumed their search Wednesday for people missing after floods and landslides on Indonesia's main island of Java, bringing the death toll to 21. Water from flooded rivers tore through nine villages in Pekalongan regency of Central Java province, and landslides tumbled onto mountainside hamlets after the torrential rains Monday. Videos and photos released by National Search and Rescue Agency showed workers digging desperately in villages where roads and green-terraced rice fields were transformed into murky brown mud and villages were covered by thick mud, rocks and uprooted trees. National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said flooding triggered a landslide that buried two houses and a cafe in the Petungkriyono resort area. The disasters all together destroyed 25 houses, a dam and three main bridges connecting villages in Pekalongan. At least 13 people were injured, and nearly 300 people were forced to flee to temporary government shelters. The search and rescue operation that was hampered by bad weather, mudslides and rugged terrain was halted Tuesday afternoon due to heavy rain and thick fog that made devastated areas along the rivers dangerous to rescuers. On Wednesday, they searched in rivers and the rubble of villages for bodies and survivors in worst-hit Kasimpar village, said Budiono, who heads a local rescue office. Scores of rescue personnel recovered three mud-caked bodies, including a 5-month old baby, as they searched a Petungkriyono area where tons of mud and rocks buried two houses and a cafe. Another body was pulled out from under a broken bridge near a river in Kasimpar village. Rescuers are still searching for five people reported missing. Landslides and floods were also reported in many other provinces, Muhari said. On Monday, a landslide hit five houses in Denpasar, on the tourist island of Bali, killing four people and leaving one missing. Heavy seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile floodplains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-in-flooding-landslides-in-indonesia-rises-to-21/7946246.html	2025-01-22T08:44:21-08:00	
Rubio: US foreign policy will focus on core national interests	New U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that core national interests will be at the heart of American diplomacy as President Donald Trump embarks on his second four-year term in the White House. Rubio, the first of Trump’s Cabinet nominees to win Senate confirmation and take office, said in a mission statement that all U.S. spending and efforts on foreign affairs 'must be justified with the answer to three simple questions: Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?' He said that 'to advance our national interest, we will build a more innovative, nimble, and focused State Department. This will require replacing some priorities, deemphasizing some issues, and eliminating some practices.' Rubio, 53, echoed Trump’s early promises to end masses of undocumented migrants from entering the U.S. 'The State Department will no longer undertake any activities that facilitate or encourage mass migration,' Rubio said. 'Our diplomatic relations with other countries, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, will prioritize securing America’s borders, stopping illegal and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal immigrants' to their home countries. Rubio said the State Department will end any efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in hiring, in line with orders Trump issued on day one of his new term. 'This order will be faithfully executed and observed in both letter and spirit,' Rubio said, 'We must reward performance and merit.' He said foreign policy efforts 'must return to the basics of diplomacy by eliminating our focus on political and cultural causes that are divisive at home and deeply unpopular abroad. This will allow us to conduct a pragmatic foreign policy in cooperation with other nations to advance our core national interests.' In addition, he said the U.S. 'must stop censorship and suppression of information' and 'reprioritize truth.' He emphasized 'the fundamental truth that America is a great and just country whose people are generous and whose leaders now prioritize Americans’ core interests, while respecting the rights and interests of other nations.' With Trump announcing he will pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement — joining Iran, Libya and Yemen as the only countries that will officially not adhere to the pact to limit global warming — Rubio said the State Department 'will use diplomacy to help President Trump fulfill his promise for a return to American energy dominance.' 'Amid today’s reemerging great power rivalry,' Rubio said, 'I will empower our talented diplomatic corps to advance our mission to make America safer, stronger, and more prosperous.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-us-foreign-policy-will-focus-on-core-national-interests/7946236.html	2025-01-22T08:40:35-08:00	
Botswana closes doors on foreign teachers, truck drivers	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — A Botswanan official said this week the nation will no longer issue work permits to foreign teachers and truck drivers in order to protect local jobs. Minister of Labor and Home Affairs Pius Mokgware told a group of unemployed teachers protesting in Gaborone that the government already has stopped issuing permits to foreign educators and truck drivers. He said that last month the government rejected 140 applications for work permits. Thabang Kopelo, who was representing the unemployed teachers, said they want the new government, which took office in October, to go a step further. 'We now demand the cancellation and the immediate suspension of issuing of work permits to teachers who come from outside of Botswana. ... There are [already] thousands and thousands' of local teachers, Kopelo said. The group’s actions weren’t xenophobic, Kopelo said, but a plea to the government to prioritize citizens in hiring teachers. 'In other countries ... they are being attacked,' Kopelo said. 'Derogatory language is being used against them. We are not moving in that approach; we are fellow brothers and sisters.' In neighboring South Africa, clashes between migrants and locals have often turned deadly, with citizens arguing foreigners are taking their jobs. Gaborone-based Congolese teacher Patrice Okomi said there is not much foreign workers can do except abide by the host government’s regulations. 'We are here at the mercy of the government, and it is entirely up to the Botswana authorities to decide our future,' Okomi said. 'If the feeling is that we have overstayed our welcome, there is not much we can do except to prepare for our exit.' Botswana’s stable economy has attracted migrant workers, the majority fleeing hardship in neighboring Zimbabwe. According to figures from the government office Statistics Botswana, there are 4,581 holders of foreign work permits in Botswana, with teachers comprising 18% of the total.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-closes-doors-on-foreign-teachers-truck-drivers/7946183.html	2025-01-22T08:08:18-08:00	
Murdoch's UK tabloids apologize to Prince Harry, admit intruding on Diana	LONDON — Prince Harry claimed a monumental victory Wednesday as Rupert Murdoch's U.K. tabloids made an unprecedented apology for intruding in his life over decades and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit. News Group Newspapers offered a 'full and unequivocal apology to the Duke of Sussex for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life,' Harry's attorney, David Sherborne, read from a statement in court. The statement even went beyond the scope of the case to acknowledge intruding on the life of Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana, and the impact it had on his family. 'We acknowledge and apologize for the distress caused to the duke, and the damage inflicted on relationships, friendships and family, and have agreed to pay him substantial damages,' the settlement statement said. His phone was hacked, and he was spied on It was the first time News Group has acknowledged wrongdoing at The Sun, a paper that once sold millions of copies with its formula of sports, celebrities and sex — including topless women on Page 3. Harry had vowed to take his case to trial to publicly expose the newspaper's wrongdoing and win a court ruling upholding his claims. In a statement read by his lawyer, Harry claimed he achieved the accountability he sought for himself and hundreds of others, including ordinary people, who were snooped on. News Group acknowledged 'phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information by journalists and private investigators' aimed at Harry. News Group had strongly denied those allegations before trial. 'This represents a vindication for the hundreds of other claimants who were strong-armed into settling without being able to get to the truth of what was done to them,' Sherborne said outside the High Court in London. Wrongdoing alleged at the top The bombshell announcement came after the trial's start was postponed a day as last-minute settlement talks heated up outside court. Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles III, and Tom Watson, a former Labour Party member of Parliament, were the only two remaining claimants out of more than 1,300 others who had settled lawsuits against News Group Newspapers over allegations their phones were hacked and investigators unlawfully intruded in their lives. The company engaged in 'perjury and cover-ups' to obscure the truth for years, deleting 30 million emails and other records, Harry and Watson said in a joint statement read by Sherborne. 'There was an extensive conspiracy,' the statement said, in which 'senior executives deliberately obstructed justice.' News Group said in a statement that it would have disputed at trial that evidence was destroyed and that it continues to deny those allegations. While News Group had issued an unreserved apology for its wrongdoing at the shuttered News of the World, it had never done so at The Sun and had vehemently denied those allegations. The statement read by Sherborne took aim at Rebekah Brooks, now the CEO overseeing News Group, who had been the editor at The Sun when she was acquitted at a criminal trial in a phone hacking case. 'At her trial in 2014, Rebekah Brooks said, 'When I was editor of The Sun, we ran a clean ship,'' he said. 'Ten years later when she is CEO of the company, they now admit, when she was editor of The Sun, they ran a criminal enterprise.' News Group apologized for wrongdoing by private eyes hired by The Sun, but not for anything done by its journalists. Two cases down, one to go In all the cases that have been brought against the publisher since a widespread phone hacking scandal forced Murdoch to close News of the World in 2011, Harry's case got the closest to trial. Murdoch closed the paper after the Guardian reported that the tabloid's reporters had in 2002 hacked the phone of Milly Dowler, a murdered 13-year-old schoolgirl, while police were searching for her. Harry's case against News Group was one of three he brought accusing British tabloids of violating his privacy by eavesdropping on phone messages or using private investigators to unlawfully help them score scoops. His case against the publisher of the Daily Mirror ended in victory when the judge ruled that phone hacking was 'widespread and habitual' at the newspaper and its sister publications. During that trial in 2023, Harry became the first senior member of the royal family to testify in court since the late 19th century, putting him at odds with the monarchy's desire to keep its problems out of view. The outcome in the News Group case raises questions about how his third case — against the publisher of the Daily Mail — will proceed. That trial is scheduled next year. Source of a bitter feud Harry's feud with the press dates to his youth, when the tabloids took glee in reporting on everything from his injuries to his girlfriends to dabbling with drugs. But his fury with the tabloids goes much deeper. He blames the media for the death of his mother, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being chased by paparazzi in Paris. He also blames them for the persistent attacks on his wife, actor Meghan Markle, that led them to leave royal life and flee to the United States in 2020. The litigation has been a source of friction in his family, Harry said in the documentary 'Tabloids On Trial.' He revealed in court papers that his father opposed his lawsuit. He also said his older brother, William, Prince of Wales and heir to the throne, had settled a private complaint against News Group that his lawyer has said was worth over 1 million pounds ($1.23 million). 'I'm doing this for my reasons,' Harry told the documentary makers, although he said he wished his family had joined him. Harry was originally one among dozens of claimants, including actor Hugh Grant, who alleged that News Group journalists and investigators they hired violated their privacy between 1994 and 2016 by intercepting voicemails, tapping phones, bugging cars and using deception to access confidential information.	https://www.voanews.com/a/murdoch-s-uk-tabloids-apologize-to-prince-harry-admit-intruding-on-diana/7946082.html	2025-01-22T07:11:50-08:00	
TikTok's US reprieve comes as other countries limit social media use	Singapore — TikTok’s short-lived shutdown in the United States has opened a wider debate in other countries regarding access to popular social media platforms by children. TikTok went dark temporarily Sunday in the U.S. after a new law banning it went into effect. The law required TikTok’s Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance to sell the app’s U.S. operation due to national security concerns over its ties to Beijing. After his inauguration on Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting the ban for 75 days, giving ByteDance additional time to find a buyer. The order provides relief to the app’s 170 million American users, many of them young adults. More than 60% of teenagers in the U.S. ages 13 to 17 use TikTok, with most of them accessing the platform daily, according to data from the Pew Research Center. The U.S. is not the only country looking to regulate social media and other platforms such as online gaming. While the reasons behind the restrictions vary, a growing number of countries already regulate technology or are proposing legislation to restrict its use. In Australia, a high-profile social media ban for young adults under the age of 16 will take effect at the end of the year, prohibiting them from creating accounts on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X and Snapchat. The government said the ban was a necessary measure to protect children. 'Social media is doing harm to our kids, and I'm calling time on it,' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters last November. Websites like YouTube that do not require an account to view content will likely be excluded from the ban. The Australian government said the onus will be on the social media companies to 'take reasonable steps' to prevent children under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms. Companies that do not comply could face fines of more than $30 million. Details of how the law will be enforced remain scarce, with age verification technologies currently being trialed. Some young Australian users of the platforms remain skeptical about how effective a ban will be. 'I think people will manage to find ways around it, maybe by lying about their age,' 15-year-old Theodore Cagé told VOA. While Cagé concedes that social media can be a 'big distraction from school,' he is against a blanket ban, favoring more measured approaches such as limiting screen time or blocking specific content. 'I reckon it definitely should be more targeted, not just a total ban on everything, because there's a lot of good stuff out there. It's not all bad,' he said. The impending ban has also raised concerns that some children will be left isolated. 'Social media serves as a lifeline for those youth who do not have supportive homes or local environments. They can find supportive communities on social media', Lisa Given, a professor of information sciences at RMIT University in Melbourne, told VOA. Australia’s ban will be closely watched, especially by countries in Asia that are considering their own restrictions for young users. Indonesia’s communications minister said the Southeast Asian nation is planning a minimum age for social media use and discussed plans last week with President Prabowo Subianto. In neighboring Singapore, teenagers under 18 will be moved to a more restrictive Teen Accounts on Instagram starting January 21. The city-state also issued guidelines in schools to limit screen time for children. Starting March 31, app stores in Singapore will block children under 12 from downloading apps, including TikTok and Instagram. But in the Southeast Asian financial hub, which prides itself on technological advancements and connectivity, social media still plays a significant role in the daily lives of young people. Platforms like Snapchat and Instagram 'are pretty important for engaging in new relationships or finding new friendships,' 17-year-old Pablo Lane of Singapore told VOA. 'It [social media] has had big benefits for me, just broadening the scope of people I can contact.' China has gone further than other countries in Asia to control children’s access to online networks. In 2021, Beijing introduced new measures restricting children under 18 to just three hours a week. And in late 2024, new guidelines from China’s cybersecurity regulator called for mobile devices to be equipped with a 'minors mode' that would limit screen time for children under 18, including an overnight curfew. The setting, which parents can turn off, restricts 16 to 18-year-olds to two hours of phone use a day, with eight to 16-year-olds allowed just one hour. Jeremy Daum, a senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, said China is also focused on protecting children from harmful content online rather than implementing blanket bans. 'They're really trying, from a number of different angles, to make a safe web for kids,' he Daum. Questions remain over whether China’s model could apply elsewhere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-s-us-reprieve-comes-as-other-countries-limit-social-media-use/7946040.html	2025-01-22T06:32:36-08:00

Trump order suspending refugee resettlement affects US Afghan allies, says advocacy group	Washington — President Trump’s executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program would affect the resettlement of thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during the war in Afghanistan, an advocacy group said. AfghanEvac, a California-based coalition of organizations helping U.S. Afghan allies to resettle in the U.S., said Monday that the pause in all refugee resettlements would affect Afghan allies who are awaiting relocation to the U.S. 'Thousands of Afghan allies who have completed almost all required steps in the refugee process would be immediately impacted by a refugee resettlement pause, and thousands more who are currently undergoing processing would remain in limbo,' AfghanEvac said, in a statement on its X account. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday that called the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program detrimental to U.S. interests and suspending it beginning on January 27. 'This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligned with the interest of the United States,' stated the executive order. It called on the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the secretary of state, to report to the president within 90 days if the program 'would be in the interests of the United States.' The order added that every 90 days, a report would be submitted to the president until he 'determine[s] that resumption of the USRAP is in the interests of the United States.' According to Shawn VanDiver, president of AghanEvac, more than 180,000 Afghans were relocated in the U.S. from August 2021, after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, to December 2024. Thousands of Afghans are still waiting to be relocated to the United States. AfghanEvac said that the order would not only have an impact on at-risk Afghans living in hiding but also on the family members of the active-duty U.S. troops. Earlier, Reuters reported that the flights of 1,660 Afghans cleared by the U.S. government to resettle in the U.S. were canceled. But the president of AfghanEvac, Shawn VanDiver, said in a post on X that no flights were canceled. 'To be clear: flights have not yet been canceled for anyone,' VanDiver said. Omar Samad, a former Afghan diplomat living in the U.S., told VOA that the ban is part of a larger package and it will impact Afghans who are waiting to be relocated to the U.S. 'It is going to be reviewed by the U.S. agencies, and it is possible that they that the U.S. make an exception for Afghans,' Samad added. VanDiver said that the coalition of organizations helping Afghans are working to 'secure exemptions for Afghan allies.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-order-suspending-refugee-resettlement-affects-us-afghan-allies-says-advocacy-group-/7945982.html	2025-01-22T05:48:05-08:00

China executes 2 mass murderers	In November, China suffered the deadliest mass murder in the past decade. Seventy days later, on Monday, China executed the perpetrator, along with another killer responsible for a subsequent attack. The speed of the verdict and punishment was applauded by Chinese netizens but drew criticism from legal analysts who argue that the killers' speedy executions will fail to prevent future crime. Fan Weiqiu, 62, drove his car into crowds of people around Zhuhai Stadium in Guangdong province, killing 35 and injuring 43. At his trial on December 27, Fan stated that he was motivated by his dissatisfaction with his divorce settlement. The court delivered his death sentence that same day, calling his motivations 'extremely vile, [and] the nature of the crime extremely egregious.' Messages of support for Fan's execution were posted on Weibo. One user, named Dentist Wu Bin, commented that the criminal's death was 'satisfying to everyone.' Another user from Hong Kong, called A Girl's Runaway Dream, wrote: 'I support the verdict! Don't let these bad people remain to ring in the [lunar] new year. I hope the dead rest in peace, justice will never be late!' Fat Brother Yang Li from Jiangsu echoed his fellow commenters, posting: 'This is to be done quickly, seriously and severely. Close the case while it is still fresh in people's minds. To both give an explanation to the people, and also to effectively deter criminals.' Still, a small number of netizens expressed skepticism of the death penalty. Weibo user Shumu Yangshenwo in Hainan province posted: 'When will it be possible for China to abolish the death penalty as a form of torture?' Xu Jiajin, the other criminal executed on Monday, was convicted for the deaths of eight people and the injuries of 17 others at his alma mater, a technical school in Wuxi. The 21-year-old returned to get revenge after failing his final exams and not receiving his graduation certificate. Online communities circulated his suicide note in which Xu wrote, 'I hope my death will push labor laws forward. Don't mistake me as a doormat, but some scores must always be settled.' Xu's execution followed a mere 66 days after his crime and sentencing. The turnaround of under three months from crime to punishment in the two cases has led some legal analysts to question the legitimacy of China's judicial system. Ignatius Lee, a political and legal blogger with more than 79,000 followers on X, told VOA that the executions represent a 'serious regression of the judicial system' in China. Even with conclusive evidence, the speed at which the trial and execution were conducted reveals the lack of error-correction procedures within the judiciary. 'Outside of satisfying the public's desire for revenge, this has no judicial merit,' Lee said. All public knowledge of the criminals and their motivations comes from police reports, which in a way 'puts a gag on their mouths.' The lack of transparency surrounding the trials and their verdicts, Lee said, makes it hard for the public to learn anything from the cases and to take measures to prevent their recurrence. To Lee, the most common causes of such revenge crimes are legal injustice and failed petitions to government offices. The petition system, which allows ordinary Chinese citizens to express grievances to county governments, has a very low success rate and has led to instability, as long wait times force petitioners to go to extremes to express their dissatisfaction. Wu Shaoping, a former Beijing human rights lawyer now living in New York, views these two murder cases as representative of the Chinese judiciary's failure to address root problems and prevent violence. 'In these two cases, the CCP is acting typically in that it has not disclosed [the motives] to the outside world, nor has it allowed the public to discuss them. It still wants to cover it up so that, because there is no way for people to explore this issue in depth, the root causes of the social problems cannot be found, and to find a cure [to prevent such crime],' Wu said. China was considering reforms to the death penalty prior to President Xi Jinping's administration. Such reforms, which have not been readdressed under Xi's tenure, included transferring review power of death penalty verdicts to China's highest court to ensure that verdicts are fair, Wu said. Wu argues that the motives of these two murderers and others before them stem from social or economic grievances. Discussing and addressing social issues, however, is a 'off-limits zone to the Chinese Communist Party,' he says, as party officials fear that addressing larger issues might undermine their rule. Kevin Slaten, who manages Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor, said that the two murder cases underscored the legal system's political utility to China. 'From the CCP's perspective, these cases needed to progress quickly for two reasons. Slaten told VOA. 'First, to make the public believe that the government is promptly handling public security issues. Second, by closing these cases as earlier as possible, it seeks to more quickly end public discussion of the context behind their motives, which involves social problems in China, including the economic slowdown.' China's legal system is marked by two extremes, Slaten added. On one end, detained human rights activists have to wait for months and sometimes years before being brought to trial. On the other hand, Fan and Xu were taken into court immediately, with executions following not even three months after their crimes, he said.

Israel says it will control Rafah crossing during ceasefire’s first stage	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Wednesday that Israel will remain in control of the Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt throughout the first phase of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. A statement from the office denied reports that the Palestinian Authority, which governs part of the West Bank, would control the Rafah crossing. European Union monitors will supervise the crossing, with Israeli troops surrounding the area and Israel in charge of approving the passage of people and goods through the crossing. Israel has been in control of the area since May of 2024 as part of its offensive seeking to dismantle the Hamas militant group in Gaza. Israeli official resigns Israel's army chief, Herzi Halevi, said Tuesday he would resign on March 6, accepting responsibility for the massive security failure on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants from Gaza carried out a cross-border terror attack on Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing 250 hostages. Halevi, in a letter to Israel's defense minister, said he would complete the Israel Defense Forces' inquiries into the shock strike that led to 15 months of fighting and help strengthen the IDF's readiness for future security challenges. 'I will transfer command of the IDF in a high-quality and thorough manner to my successor,' wrote Halevi, who is chief of the General Staff of Israel's armed forces. A six-week truce is now in effect, but Halevi said, 'The objectives of the war have not all been achieved. The army will continue to fight to further dismantle Hamas and its governing capabilities, ensure the return of the hostages' and enable Israelis displaced by militant attacks to return home. Ever since the attack, Netanyahu has refused to answer questions about assigning blame for the attack, saying that such an inquiry could wait for the war to end. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, with most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza, although Israel, without evidence, says it has killed 17,000 militants. Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, said it will release another round of hostages on Saturday, as the ceasefire with Israel held into a third day and U.N. humanitarian agencies moved aid into Gaza to help Palestinian civilians. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that the next group of hostages would be four Israeli women, who would be set free in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Fifteen months of war has devastated the Gaza Strip, destroying many of the homes that Palestinians who fled in search of safety hoped to return to with the halt in fighting. The ceasefire has so far included the return of three hostages who had been held in Gaza and the release 90 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said nearly 900 aid trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-will-control-rafah-crossing-during-ceasefire-s-first-stage-/7945897.html	2025-01-22T04:21:45-08:00	
Aid group urges halt to expulsion of Afghan refugees over dire conditions	Islamabad — A global humanitarian agency warned Afghanistan's neighbors Wednesday against expelling millions of refugees in the coming months, citing the country’s unpreparedness due to decades of conflict, economic devastation, and climate-related challenges. The Norwegian Refugee Council, or NRC, reported that Iran plans to expel up to 2 million Afghan refugees by March, while at least 800,000 have already been deported from Pakistan since October 2023. 'The many vulnerable Afghans already returning from Iran, whom I met at the border this week, feel they live in an enduring limbo,' stated Jan Egeland, the NRC secretary-general. 'They left Afghanistan in search of a better and safer life and are now returning to an uncertain future in Afghanistan, where they face the same unemployment, hunger, and human rights violations that made them leave their homeland in the first place,' he said. The NRC noted that most of the returnees are forced to remain in urban Afghan areas, struggling to find work or housing. While some have family connections, many lack ties after years in exile and have nowhere to go. International aid is essential in alleviating immense humanitarian needs in Afghanistan, but it is now dwindling, lamented Egeland, adding that women and girls were bearing the brunt of the shortfall in financial support for nongovernmental groups and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. The NRC chief warned that 'the world has turned its back' to the needs of Afghans trapped in one of the worst humanitarian crises globally since the Taliban regained control of the country in August 2021. 'Poor and displaced Afghan families are paying a heavy price for a lack of real, durable solutions to assist displaced people and refugees caught in an escalating humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and host countries,' Egeland said. The United Nations and nongovernmental humanitarian groups have persistently urged the international community to continue supporting the country. Aid workers have expressed concerns that the Taliban’s restrictions on women's access to workplaces and public life are significantly impacting humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan. They complain that the curbs make it challenging to deliver essential public services, such as healthcare, nutrition, and immunization, particularly in provinces where Taliban authorities have banned male doctors from treating female patients. The de facto hardline Afghan rulers have also prohibited girls from attending schools beyond the sixth grade and recently ordered medical training institutes nationwide not to accept female students. Egeland said he raised 'the severe restrictions on the fundamental rights' faced by Afghan women and girls in meetings with Taliban authorities. 'The ongoing ban on secondary education for girls means that 1.5 million teenage girls are out of school. Additionally, a new incomprehensible ban has shut down training for midwives and nurses, which will not only destroy livelihoods but will also directly threaten women's health and lives,' he cautioned. Egeland, who regularly visits Afghanistan, emphasized the need for the international community to engage with the Taliban to secure the restoration of human rights for women and girls. He called for an increase in global support to fund crucial humanitarian assistance while urging the Taliban 'to create an enabling environment. 'Many countries' continued disengagement with authorities in Afghanistan is only enabling more restrictions and suffering for the women, girls, and families here – many of whom see no option but to risk their lives on perilous journeys,' the NRC chief stated. Pakistan has commended Egeland for drawing global attention to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and defended its policy of sending Afghan refugees to their native country. 'For forty years, Pakistan has generously hosted over four million Afghan refugees. Those sent back were residing illegally without any documentation or proof of residence,' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement in Islamabad earlier this week. The Taliban takeover led to nearly 700,000 Afghans seeking refuge in Pakistan. This includes individuals who fear retaliation for their association with the U.S-led Western allied troops, who were present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades until their withdrawal in August 2021. 'Progress on the cases of thousands of Afghan nationals who were promised resettlement in Western countries remains painfully slow. U.N. Humanitarian aid to Afghanistan remains critically underfunded, with only 37.5% of the required funds secured last year,' the Pakistani foreign ministry stated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aid-group-urges-halt-to-expulsion-of-afghan-refugees-over-dire-conditions-/7945867.html	2025-01-22T03:10:37-08:00	
China families appeal to free relatives held by scam gangs in Myanmar	BEIJING/BANGKOK — The abduction and cross-border rescue had all the makings of the kind of action script struggling Chinese actor Wang Xing had hoped to land – only not as a reality star. Wang, 22, flew to Bangkok earlier this month after getting an unsolicited offer to join a film that was shooting in Thailand. There was no movie. Instead, like hundreds of other Chinese men, Wang had been duped by a job offer that he later acknowledged appeared too good to be true, as part of a trap set by a criminal syndicate. Like others desperate for work, he was kidnapped and put to work in one of the online scam centers that operate just across the Thai border in Myanmar, according to his account and statements by police in China and Thailand. But unlike most trafficked Chinese whose families wait in quiet anguish, Wang had a powerful advocate back home. His girlfriend, who goes by the nickname Jiajia, broadcast details of Wang's abduction and started a social media campaign documenting her battle to get him back to China, picking up millions of followers and the support of Chinese celebrities. When Wang was freed on Jan. 7 by Thai police, who said he had been found in Myanmar but gave few details about his release, frustrated families of other Chinese people still detained in the Myanmar scam centers began to post details of their own cases in an attempt to capitalize on the attention. Within days, the rare grassroots effort had collected the names of nearly 1,800 Chinese nationals that family members said had been trafficked into Myanmar from border areas of China and Thailand. Scam compounds, where workers are often treated brutally, have proliferated in Myanmar amid the chaos and widening civil war since the military seized power in a 2021 coup. The UN says hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to scam centers in Southeast Asia since the COVID-19 pandemic in an industry that defrauds people across the globe and generates billions of dollars per year for organized crime groups, many of Chinese origin. The tally, which organizers said had been handed over to Chinese authorities, quickly became the most detailed census of Chinese victims of the syndicates that trap people into working online scams from towns like Myawaddy, on Myanmar’s border with Thailand. In an unusual statement issued on Friday, China's Ministry of Public Security said it was 'making every effort' to crack down on the scam compounds and 'rescue trafficked people.' On Tuesday, China's state broadcaster said Beijing had reached a consensus with Thailand and Myanmar to arrest the syndicates' leaders and eradicate the scam centers. After a surge in crimes targeting Chinese citizens, Beijing initially moved in 2023 to combat the Myanmar fraud compounds, resulting in the arrest of tens of thousands of Chinese nationals suspected of involvement in the illicit business. That reflected China's approach to treat those trafficked primarily as suspects rather than victims, according to groups that fight human trafficking. 'It’s difficult to get a confirmed number of Chinese people trafficked to scam compounds,' said Mina Chiang, founder of the Humanity Research Consultancy, an anti human trafficking group. Unable to file police reports Reuters spoke to family members of four people listed as disappeared in Myanmar and identified in the database, which drew its name from Wang’s first name, Xing, or star. None would agree to be identified by full name for fear of angering authorities and slowing efforts to release the victims. Of the nearly 1,800 victims identified in the 'Star Homecoming' campaign, about 93% are men. The average age is 27, with the vast majority between the ages of 15 and 45. Most of them told stories of economic hardship -- indebtedness, the struggle to make ends meet as gig economy workers, job loss in the construction industry amid a nationwide downturn -- that made them jump when the scam centers came calling. Chinese law does not consider men as potential victims of human trafficking, and about half the families said they had been unable to file a missing person report with local police, according to a Reuters analysis of the crowd-sourced spreadsheet. 'At first I wanted to file a police report, but they said missing persons reports were only for women and children,' said one woman, whose 30-year-old husband disappeared after accepting what turned out to be a scam job offer because he needed to pay back debts. Another woman, the wife of a 22-year-old electrician who went missing, said Chinese police had told her they could not accept a report on his disappearance since he had been traveling with his passport. Several family members who posted details of men who had disappeared said they hoped the attention on the cases would force China’s government to shift focus and bring trafficking victims home. Last week, when organizers shut down the spreadsheet from taking new names, China’s foreign ministry called on other Southeast Asian nations to do more to crack down on fraud rings. Back home, actor Wang publicly thanked China for working successfully to free him. Separately, in a now-deleted article in media outlet Renwu, he said he noticed a hair band his girlfriend Jiajia left in his luggage and worried he could never see her again. 'She asked me to try to refuse the work offer halfway, but in the end, I still went,' Wang said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-families-appeal-to-free-relatives-held-by-scam-gangs-in-myanmar/7945844.html	2025-01-22T02:26:09-08:00	
Sri Lanka agrees with China's Sinopec to fast-track $3.7 billion refinery	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's foreign minister said on Wednesday that the South Asian island nation had signed an agreement with Chinese state energy giant Sinopec to fast-track a proposed $3.7 billion oil refinery in its southern port city of Hambantota. Sinopec and Sri Lanka will jointly decide the share of refined fuel that will be exported from the facility, Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath told reporters. 'This is one of the largest foreign investment projects Sri Lanka has received and we feel it will be important for us,' Herath said. 'This refinery has been discussed between the two countries for many years and we are committed to taking it forward. We hope to break ground as soon as possible.' He declined to provide details on the planned capacity of the refinery. A Sinopec representative in China did not respond immediately to a request for comment and its Sri Lanka office did not answer phone calls. Sri Lanka is currently completely dependent on imported oil, which costs the cash-strapped country billions of dollars every year, though it does have some smaller refineries. The country is looking to attract foreign investment to stabilize its economy which crumpled under a severe foreign exchange crisis in 2022. Sri Lanka posted a faster-than-expected rally after securing a $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program in 2023. Sinopec and Sri Lanka will work to resolve land, tax and water issues within a month, Herath said, adding that Colombo expects the refinery to assist the Chinese-built Hambantota Port to function as a hub via bunkering services. Last week, China and Sri Lanka signed 15 cooperation documents, including agreements on economic and technological development, when recently-elected Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake met China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing. Dissanayake's visit to debt-ridden Sri Lanka's largest bilateral lender came after he first traveled to Beijing's regional rival India. Specifics of the deals signed between Sri Lanka and China were not disclosed at the signing ceremony. Sinopec's effort to build a refinery in the Indian Ocean island puts it in direct competition with India's interests in expanding its role as an energy supplier to Sri Lanka. Herath said Sri Lanka is continuing discussions with India on a proposed fuel pipeline between the two countries and is open to refinery proposals from India.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-agrees-with-china-s-sinopec-to-fast-track-3-7-billion-refinery/7945834.html	2025-01-22T02:08:14-08:00	
Trump expresses possibility of more sanctions against Russia for Ukraine war	U.S. President Donald Trump signaled the possibility of placing additional sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine. Asked about the prospect while speaking to reporters Tuesday, Trump responded, 'Sounds likely.' Trump said his administration has been in talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and would be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin 'very soon.' He said the European Union should be 'paying a lot more than they’re paying' to aid Ukraine, while falsely stating the U.S. has contributed $200 billion more than the EU. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has committed about $175 billion in aid for Ukraine. The European Union says the bloc and its member states have made about $145 billion in aid available. Trump says Europe should be paying more because its proximity means the war has a greater effect on the EU than the United States. 'I mean, what are we, stupid? I guess the answer is yes, because they must think so,' Trump said. He has previously complained that NATO allies are not allocating enough of their spending to defense and called for increased defense budget targets. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said during a speech Wednesday at an EU Defence Agency conference that, in terms of general defense spending, Trump is 'right to say that we don’t spend enough,' and that the EU needs to invest more. She called for the EU to provide 'more, faster and stronger' support to Ukraine, saying that Ukrainians 'are fighting for their freedom and ours.' 'There is absolutely no doubt that we can do more to help Ukraine,' Kallas said. 'With our help, they can also win the war.' Aerial attacks Ukrainian officials said Wednesday the country’s air defenses shot down dozens of drones overnight, including in Mykolaiv where Governor Vitaliy Kim said falling debris damaged an apartment building and injured two people. Officials in the Khmelnytskyi and Sumy regions also reported drones being shot down in their areas. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed six Ukrainian drones over the Rostov region, while also knocking down a drone over Kursk and another over Voronezh. Rostov Governor Yury Slyusar said drone fragments fell in the courtyard of a house, but that no one was injured. Ceasefire provisions Zelenskyy said Tuesday that if a ceasefire deal were enacted with Russia, 'at least 200,000 European peacekeepers' would need to be on the ground in Ukraine to defend the Eastern European country against a possible attack by Russia. Zelenskyy said Europe must 'take care of itself.' He said 200,000 peacekeepers from European countries would be the minimum number of peacekeepers required, 'Otherwise, it's nothing.' 'Let's not forget, there is no ocean separating European countries from Russia,' Zelenskyy said in his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Ukraine's president said Russia's demand that Ukraine reduce its army to one-fifth of its current size of 800,000 is not an option. Ukraine's best defense during a ceasefire deal, Zelenskyy said, would be its membership into NATO. Alliance members have declared the Ukraine is on an 'irreversible' path to membership, but the United States, Germany and others oppose allowing Ukraine to join while the war is ongoing for fear of sparking a wider conflict..

Gabon dispatches government ministers to encourage voter registrations	Yaoundé, Cameroon — Civilians in Gabon are being encouraged this month to register to vote in presidential elections scheduled for August 2025, as ordered by transitional President General Brica Clotaire Oligui Nguema. The planned elections are envisioned to end a two-year transition to civilian rule. Voter registration began Jan. 2 and is due to conclude at the end of the month. Gabon's political opposition says voter registration has not been as robust as expected because civilians believe the transitional president wants to confiscate power, assertions that Nguema denies. The elections are part of a plan for a return to constitutional order after an Aug. 30, 2023 coup that ousted longtime President Ali Bongo Ondimba. Gabon officials say at least 300,000 new voters, who have either reached the legal voting age of 18 or who are not yet registered, are expected to be added to the 860,000 or so civilians that registered as part of Gabon's November 16, 2024 constitutional referendum, and whose names are already in the elections database. This week, officials of the central African nation said senior state functionaries were deployed to encourage civilians to register before the January 31 deadline. Ministers dispatched to towns and villages this week are expected to work with voter enrollment teams and make sure civilians are formally registered as voters so they can participate in the August elections and cast ballots. But Gabon's opposition and civil society groups say civilians are not heeding calls by government officials to register because they are not sure Nguema is ready to hand power to civilian rule. Cyrille Bissiengou is the deputy coordinator of Yes Volunteers, a group created in 2024 to encourage civilians to take part in Gabon’s electoral process. Bissiengou said he is not sure that 300,000 new voters will register before the Jan. 31 deadline, as Gabon's government expects. Many young people told Yes Volunteers they weren't sure about Nguemas' willingness to hand power to civilians. Bissiengou spoke on Gabon's state TV on Tuesday. Jean Remy Yama, leader of Unitary Dynamics, one of Gabon's leading worker trade unions and member of Gabon's senate, also expressed skepticism. Yama said if Nguema truly wanted to hand power to civilian rule, he should have allowed Gabon's parliament and senate to set up an independent elections management body to ensure free, fair and transparent elections. He said by asking a minister appointed by transitional rulers to register voters and organize elections, Nguema is indicating that he wants to hold power. Gabon's constitution, voted in a Nov. 16 referendum to lay the groundwork for elections, bars transitional government members from running in the 2025 presidential polls but permits Nguema to run for president. Nguema has not said whether he will be a candidate and the transitional government refutes claims the military leader is planning to maintain power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-dispatches-government-ministers-to-encourage-voter-registrations-/7945820.html	2025-01-22T01:36:45-08:00	
Trump’s WHO, climate orders bring challenges and opportunities for Africa, China	Johannesburg — On inauguration day, U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders that set in motion the country’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Treaty as well as from the World Health Organization. While it may be some time before the broader impact of those moves will be clear, Cobus Van Staden, a China-Africa expert with the South African Institute for International Affairs, says one unintended consequence could be a shift in the global balance of power in these international institutions. 'The U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization, from the Paris Accord weakens the voice that the U.S. had in those organizations,' Van Staden said. 'The net effect of many of these orders is to just further make China more central in the relationship with many Global South countries, particularly also in Africa.' While China may be the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, it’s also the biggest manufacturer of green technology products globally, notes Christian-Geraud Neema, from the think tank called China Global South Project. 'When the U.S. withdraws from the Paris Accords, China can rightfully put forward its narrative of being the green technology champion,' Neema said. During a news conference on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun voiced concern about Trump’s decision on the Paris Climate Agreement. 'Climate change is a common challenge facing mankind. No country can stay out of it. No country can be immune to it. China's determination and actions to actively respond to climate change will be consistent,' Guo said. Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC Director-General told Newzroom Afrika on Tuesday that the withdrawl could curtail services for people in Africa. 'My interest is the health of African people, and the U.S. is the main partner that we have in Africa and the U.S. is providing a large spectrum of services to African people,' Kaseya said. 'And I think it’s time for us to understand the decision that is made and to see how we can overcome this challenge for African people.' At the same time, Kaseya says he sees opportunities with the new administration to create as he puts it 'a win-win for all of us.' Neema of the China-Global South Project said the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization – which will take a year – could help position China as a leader in global health. 'When it comes to health cooperation, we can also see how much China’s expanding its own influence in Africa, with different medical cooperation it has with different countries,' Neema said. China has a long record of building hospitals in Africa and sending medical aid ships and doctors to the continent, but Washington’s withdraw could see even more demand for funding and support from Beijing. Trump has accused the WHO of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic. He also has said he resents the fact that the U.S. – the WHO’s largest contributor – gives much more money to the organization than China contributes. 'Pretty sad though, think of it,' Trump said. 'China pays $39 million and we pay %500 million, and China's a bigger country.' In further remarks on Tuesday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said China would 'continue to support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities, deepen international public health cooperation,' and 'strengthen global health governance.' Bob Wekesa, director at the African Center for the Study of the United States, at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said ultimately, Trump’s orders meant Africa would have to turn elsewhere for help. 'African countries will now eventually have to figure out how to raise their own internal resources for matters to do with help, and if not, kind of rely on Europeans and the Chinese and Indians,' Wekesa said. Last month, the U.S. announced more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to African countries. But Wekesa said with the U.S. pulling out of the WHO, relying less on the U.S. is a lesson that African countries already learned during Trump’s first term in office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-who-climate-orders-bring-challenges-and-opportunities-for-africa-china/7945804.html	2025-01-22T00:49:32-08:00	
Turkey detains nine people over ski resort hotel fire that killed 76	ANKARA, TURKEY — Turkey has detained nine people, including the owner of the hotel, in connection with a deadly fire that claimed the lives of 76 people and injured dozens at a ski resort in western Turkey, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said early Wednesday. Yerlikaya also reported that the bodies of 45 victims had been handed over to their families, while DNA tests were being conducted to identify the remaining bodies at the forensic institute. The fire occurred at the Grand Kartal Hotel in the Kartalkaya ski resort in the Bolu mountains. The hotel, where the fire broke out, expressed deep sorrow in a statement on Wednesday and pledged full cooperation with the investigation. 'We are cooperating with authorities to shed light on all aspects of this incident,' the statement said. 'We are deeply saddened by the losses and want you to know that we share this pain with all our hearts.' The 12-story hotel, which had 238 registered guests, was consumed by flames after the fire started on the restaurant floor around 3:30 a.m. local time or 0030 GMT. Survivors described scenes of panic as they fled through smoke-filled corridors and jumped from windows to escape. Authorities are facing growing criticism over the hotel’s safety measures, as survivors reported that no fire alarms went off during the incident. Guests said they had to navigate the smoke-filled corridors in complete darkness. President Tayyip Erdogan declared Wednesday a day of national mourning following the tragedy, which occurred during the peak of the winter tourism season, with many families from Istanbul and Ankara traveling to the Bolu mountains for skiing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-detains-nine-people-over-ski-resort-hotel-fire-that-killed-76/7945747.html	2025-01-21T23:19:37-08:00

Weather Service issues red flag warnings for fire-ravaged California	The National Weather Service issued a Red Flag Warning for most of California’s Los Angeles and Ventura counties on Tuesday for the area’s 'extremely low relative humidity and periods of gusty offshore winds.' The weather service said its 'Particularly Dangerous Situation Red Flag warning has ended, but dangerous fire weather conditions persist through Thursday or Friday.' Northeast winds will remain 'gusty' in the hills and mountains, the service said in a statement. Low humidities are set to continue. Some areas will experience a lull in the winds Tuesday night into Wednesday, but extremely dry conditions will continue and winds will strengthen again late Wednesday, according to the weather service. The Red Flag Warning covers most of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties through 8 p.m. Thursday. Earlier Tuesday, the weather service said there was an extreme risk of fire weather over parts of Southern California. The service said winds of 32 to 64 kilometers per hour, combined with 'stronger winds in the terrain, low relative humidity, and dry fuels, have contributed to the dangerous conditions.' Strong winds sparked some scattered fires Tuesday in Los Angeles, but alert firefighters quickly brought the fires under control. At least 27 people have died in a series of wildfires across the Los Angeles area during the past two weeks as Santa Ana winds mixed with dry conditions on the ground to quickly spread blazes. Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger has called for an outside investigation into the evacuation notification process for residents of western Altadena, near the Eaton Fire, one of several that erupted across Los Angeles. A report in the Los Angeles Times says evacuation orders for western Altadena were delayed for hours. 'From what I have been told, it was a night of pure chaos for both fire and first responders,' Barger told The Times. The county supervisor said she has 'deep concerns' about what happened. Residents told the Times that by the time they received evacuation orders, many of the homes in the area already were on fire. Seventeen people are reported to have died in the Eaton fire. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said an executive order she signed Tuesday is designed to curb the flow of toxic debris from the region’s fires and protect the area’s beaches and oceans. 'This is to prevent additional damage to areas already ravaged by fire and also to protect our watershed, beaches and ocean from toxic runoff,' the mayor said. City workers will remove toxic materials and set up barriers to direct the flow of debris into the sewer system.

Trump says he would sanction Russia if Putin does not negotiate on Ukraine	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would likely impose sanctions on Russia if its president, Vladimir Putin, refuses to negotiate about ending the war in Ukraine. Trump gave no details on possible additional sanctions. The United States has already sanctioned Russia heavily for its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said his administration was also looking at the issue of sending weapons to Ukraine, adding his view that the European Union should be doing more to support Ukraine. 'We're talking to [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy; we're going to be talking with President Putin very soon,' Trump said. 'We're going to look at it.' Trump said he had pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping in a call to intervene to stop the Ukraine war. 'He's not done very much on that. He's got a lot of ... power, like we have a lot of power. I said, 'You ought to get it settled.' We did discuss it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7945674.html	2025-01-21T18:39:29-08:00	
Trump says EU 'in for tariffs', warns of 10% rate on China	U.S. President Donald Trump pledged Tuesday to hit the European Union with tariffs, adding that a 10% duty on Chinese imports could also come as soon as February 1. Trump, who was speaking to reporters at the White House a day after being sworn in, cited the need to rectify the EU's trade imbalances with the United States while taking aim once again at Beijing over fentanyl trafficking. 'They treat us very, very badly. So they're going to be in for tariffs,' Trump said of the EU. 'You can't get fairness unless you do that.' A day earlier, Trump accused the bloc of not importing enough American products, saying he would 'straighten that out' by imposing duties or by urging for more oil and gas purchases. Regarding China, Trump on Tuesday reiterated his threat to impose a 10% tariff, saying it was 'based on the fact that they're sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada.' When asked how soon these tariffs could be enacted, he added: 'Probably February 1st is the date we're looking at.' This was the same date he earlier said he could impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, accusing them of failing to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the United States. Mexico, Canada and China are leading sources for goods imported by the United States, according to official trade data. The EU's economy commissioner vowed this week that the bloc stands ready to defend its interests. Speaking at an annual meeting of global elites in Davos, Switzerland, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen declared that Europe was ready to negotiate with Trump, while maintaining that Washington remains an important partner. The EU's 'first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests, and be ready to negotiate' with Trump, she said. 'We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles, to protect our interests and uphold our values,' she said. On Monday, Trump vowed an immediate overhaul of the U.S. trade system, promising to 'tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.' He signed an order directing agencies to study a range of trade issues including deficits, unfair practices and currency manipulation. The investigations could pave the way for further duties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7945671.html	2025-01-21T18:21:32-08:00	
Rare snowstorm blankets Houston and New Orleans	HOUSTON — A rare winter storm churned across the U.S. Gulf Coast on Tuesday, breaking snowfall records more than a century old in a southern region where flurries are unusual, as much of the United States remained in a dangerous deep freeze. A snowstorm warning was in effect for 31 million people - from southern Texas east through Georgia and north to the Carolinas and into Virginia - until Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service said. With the storm moving east, crews near Houston plowed highways on Tuesday while downtown streets, covered in white, were virtually deserted. Schools were closed Tuesday and Wednesday as the city, the fourth-biggest in the U.S., expected about 10 cm of snow to fall. 'I've been in Texas my entire life and I have never seen this depth of snow,' said Ishan Bhaidani, 29, who owns a fintech consulting company in Houston. 'It typically gets more icy, but this type of fine snow, this is a first.' Authorities in Houston investigated two deaths that may be weather-related, including that of a homeless man who was found near an apartment complex, the Harris County Sheriff said on X. Snow was also falling in New Orleans, where nearly 25 cm had accumulated by late afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. Richard Bann, an NWS meteorologist, said that the service was trying to confirm whether Tuesday's snowfall broke a New Orleans record set in 1895. The last time New Orleans received any measurable snowfall was 2009, according to the NWS. 'Stay home and stay off the roads,' said a bundled-up New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, as winds whipped snow in her face, in a video message to residents on X. Breaking a 144-year-old record, more than 15 cm of snow fell in Mobile, Alabama, by late afternoon, according to the NWS. The storm is expected to crawl through Mississippi, Georgia and Florida early this week. The storm snarled air travel with flights delayed or canceled on Tuesday. More than 1,000 flights departing or bound for Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport were canceled, according to Flightaware.com. Temperatures dipped into single digits Fahrenheit, well below freezing, across the region. Forecasters and local leaders urged residents to protect themselves from frostbite and to take steps to keep their water pipes from rupturing. Across the South, the snow, combined with an inch of ice accumulation and wind gusts of up to 64 kph, could make road and air travel difficult for several days, while threatening to topple power lines and trees, forecasters said. About 30,000 homes and businesses in southeastern Texas were without power at one point on Tuesday, but by late afternoon that number fell to fewer than 8,000, according to Poweroutage.us. Atlanta, Georgia, and Montgomery, Alabama, opened warming centers and closed government offices in anticipation of the storm. Numerous school districts canceled classes, according to local news. To the north, most of the eastern two-thirds of the United States experienced brutally cold temperatures as an Arctic front was expected to linger through at least Tuesday. Grand Lake, Colorado, was the coldest spot in the U.S. on Tuesday morning at -39 C.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rare-snowstorm-blankets-houston-and-new-orleans-/7945667.html	2025-01-21T18:02:33-08:00	
Trump highlights partnership investing $500B in AI	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. The new entity, Stargate, will start building data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum. 'It's big money and high quality people,' said Trump, adding that it's 'a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential' under his new administration. Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project possible, even though building has started and the project goes back to 2024. 'This will be the most important project of this era,' said Altman, CEO of OpenAI. Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized vaccine. 'This is the beginning of golden age,' said Son, referencing Trump's statement that the U.S. would be in a 'golden age' with him back in the White House. Son, a billionaire based in Japan, committed in December to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. He previously committed to $50 billion in new investments ahead of Trump's first term, which included a large stake in the troubled office-sharing company WeWork. While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly implemented. The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration. Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March 2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its own data centers. OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration's Commerce Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects 'can be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.' The push to build data centers also predates Trump's presidency. Last October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another $1 trillion being committed internationally. Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector leader with the 2022 launch of its ChaptGPT, a chatbot that captivated the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and perform basic business tasks. The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out new electricity generation in anticipation of AI's expansion, knowing that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses. Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the technology's possible risks to national security and economic well-being. Trump supporter Elon Musk, worth more than $400 billion, was an early investor in OpenAI but has since challenged its move to for-profit status and has started his own AI company, xAI. Musk is also in charge of the 'Department of Government Efficiency' created formally on Monday by Trump with the goal of reducing government spending. Trump previously in January announced a $20 billion investment by DAMAC Properties in the United Arab Emirates to build data centers tied to AI.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-highlights-partnership-investing-500b-in-ai-/7945647.html	2025-01-21T17:47:06-08:00	
Namibia doctors fight cervical cancer	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — The cervical cancer rate in Namibia is 37.5 for every 100,000 women, about three times higher than the rate worldwide. Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers and doctors in Namibia are advocating greater access to healthcare and the HPV vaccine to reduce the prevalence of the disease. November 2009 was a turning point in the life of Barbara Kamba-Nyathi. At the tender age of 29, she was diagnosed with stage three cervical cancer. Her doctors recommended radiation therapy as opposed to chemotherapy, because at that time she had not yet had children and radiation therapy would help her avoid premature menopause. But that was not her only struggle. Kamba-Nyathi, who lived in Windhoek at the time, said she faced stigma for cervical cancer's association with HIV and the human papilloma virus. 'One of the challenges that come with having a diagnosis like cervical cancer is that our African society its usually taboo to talk about things of our reproductive organs, you know, our reproductive system is taboo,' said Kamba-Nyathi. 'We don't talk about such things and in the end, we tend to normalize pain and even things that don't feel right in our bodies we tend to normalize them and they become part of our identity.' Rolf Hansen, the chief executive officer of the Cancer Association of Namibia, said a lack of education and a lack of access to healthcare prevent many women from getting tested or being treated for cervical cancer or HPV, which is the second-leading cause of cancer among sub-Saharan women. 'Like I said, HIV and HPV work hand in hand to fuel the cervical cancer pandemic,' said Hansen. 'Now, in our country as well we see that in our low-income setting as well as our rural setting, we have high HPV prevalence, high cervical cancer so a lot of work needs to be done at a grassroots level so that we can actually combat this disease.' Doctors Simon and David Emvula provide health services to underprivileged communities, together with the Be Free/Break Free program — an initiative of former first lady Monica Geingos — in Namibia's largest township of Katutura. They are advocating for the rollout of the HPV vaccine for girls between the ages of 9 and 14, before they become sexually active. Emvula said that during one screening in Windhoek on Saturday, they treated more than 100 patients, screening girls and women for HPV, cervical cancer, fibroids and other sexually transmitted infections and sexually transmitted diseases. Emvula spoke to VOA at his practice in Windhoek. 'The turnout was actually beyond what we expected and once again it was an eye-opener ... that there is definitely a need for that,' said Emvula. Emvula said HPV vaccination is among the most effective ways to prevent cervical cancer but the government of Namibia is lagging. HPV vaccines have been introduced in 129 countries worldwide and the Namibian government has endorsed the rollout of the vaccines for girls ages 9 to 14. Despite promises made as reported by VOA last year, the vaccines have not yet been made available. Namibia's executive director of health, Ben Nangombe, could not be reached for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-doctors-fight-cervical-cancer/7945602.html	2025-01-21T17:01:44-08:00	
Lavrov echoes debunked Kremlin narratives to justify war, undermine NATO	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's mid-January press conference 'on the performance of Russian diplomacy in 2024' was filled with false and misleading claims, many previously debunked, highlighting the Kremlin's broader disinformation tactics. Russia's disinformation aims to legitimize its war, undermine NATO and erode Western support for Ukraine. By targeting domestic and international audiences — especially skeptics of U.S. policy — it seeks to shape perceptions, distort historical facts and create false equivalencies. The goal is to justify aggression while portraying Ukraine as illegitimate and extremist. NATO expansion Lavrov falsely claims that NATO promised not to expand eastward. 'We have long lost hope that Western countries will fulfill their promises and obligations, including NATO's non-expansion to the east, refraining from luring Ukraine into NATO,' he said. In reality, NATO has always maintained an 'open door policy,' allowing any state to join if it meets membership requirements. No treaty ever restricted NATO expansion. In 2014, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev confirmed the West never promised the Soviet Union otherwise. In 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton rejected a 'gentlemen's agreement' with Russian President Boris Yeltsin to bar former Soviet republics from joining NATO. These facts disprove Lavrov's claims that NATO broke any commitments to Russia, exposing the Kremlin's use of disinformation to justify its foreign policy and aggression against Ukraine. Claim that invasion was defensive Lavrov on Jan. 14 also falsely claimed that Russia's war against Ukraine is defensive and aimed at protecting Russian-speaking populations. 'Despite the Minsk agreements, [Ukraine] bombed these people [in Donbas], who should have been granted a special status in accordance with the U.N. Security Council's resolutions,' he said. 'After years of explaining this … we ultimately launched the special military operation to protect our security interests and the interests of the Russian people in Ukraine.' This false narrative has been challenged consistently. The international community, including the United Nations, has condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an act of aggression violating international law. Investigations have found no credible evidence supporting claims of systemic oppression of Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine that would justify such military intervention. United Nations data shows civilian casualties in Donbas steadily declined before Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion, contradicting claims of a 'humanitarian' mission. Experts have repeatedly demonstrated the war is not about protection but constitutes genocide against Ukrainians, exposing the Kremlin's disinformation to justify aggression. Zelenskyy's legitimacy Lavrov falsely called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presidency the product of a coup, though he won a democratic election, which even Russia initially recognized. '[T]he current Ukrainian regime, which came to power through an illegal anti-constitutional coup,' he said during the Jan. 14 press conference. Zelenskyy's democratic election — like that of his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko — was recognized globally, including by Russia. Before Poroshenko, Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, not due to a coup, but amid mass protests. Despite Russian claims of U.S. involvement, no credible evidence links the protests to foreign orchestration. 'Self-determination' of Crimea, Donbas Lavrov falsely claimed that Crimea and Donbas left Ukraine legally. 'The right to self-determination underpins the decisions made by residents of Crimea in 2014 and by residents of Novorossiya and Donbass in 2022,' he said. Russia's annexations violate international law, as the referendums were conducted under military occupation without legal legitimacy. Crimea, Donbas and other territories temporarily occupied by Russia are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. The right to self-determination does not grant any group the automatic right to secede, particularly through force or foreign intervention. Russia's own constitution denies the right to secession, reinforcing that self-determination is subordinate to state sovereignty. This was affirmed in two decisions by the Russian Constitutional Court, prioritizing territorial integrity over international self-determination principles. Moreover, in Putin's Russia, advocating for national self-determination can lead to criminal penalties. The 2022 invasion revealed Moscow's imperial ambitions, denying Ukraine's existence and history. Russia forcibly deported Ukrainian children, leading the OSCE to label Russia a colonial empire rejecting rights to indigenous peoples. Ukraine leadership called 'Nazi regime' Lavrov falsely called the current political regime of Ukraine a Nazi organization. '[T]he issue of [Ukraine's accession to] NATO must be taken off the table, and the Russian speakers' language, religious and other rights, which Zelensky's Nazi regime has outlawed, must be restored.' The Kremlin falsely claims Ukraine is a Nazi state, ignoring the fact that ultranationalist groups in Ukraine, like Svoboda, have limited popular support and political power. Svoboda's influence has diminished, receiving only 2.15% of the vote in 2019. In contrast, ultranationalists in Russia have significant influence on state and military policies, affecting domestic and foreign agendas. Alleged ban on Russian language Lavrov also repeated the fallacious allegation that the Russian language is barred in Ukraine. 'They [Ukraine] enacted a law banning the Russian language long before the special military operation started. … The Russian language has been totally outlawed.' No law banned Russian in Ukraine, rather, policies promoted the Ukrainian language while still allowing Russian usage. In July 2012, Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada passed a law granting Russian 'regional language' status in areas where Russian speakers exceeded 10%. While opposition members argued it diminished Ukrainian, some regions, including Donbas, recognized Russian as the official language. After Yanukovych fled in February 2014, the law was repealed, but acting President Oleksandr Turchynov declined to approve the repeal. It stayed in effect until 2018, when Ukraine's Constitutional Court struck it down. This was part of Ukraine's effort to strengthen its national identity and limit Russia's post-Soviet influence. Accusations of TurkStream sabotage Lavrov also falsely accused the United States and Ukraine of targeting the TurkStream gas pipeline, claiming Washington is encouraging Ukraine to sabotage the pipeline. '[T]he U.S. has given the green light to terrorist attacks designed to undermine EU's wellbeing in terms of energy supplies,' he said. 'Now, they are encouraging their Ukrainian clients to put the TurkStream out of operation, just as they did with the Nord Stream pipelines.' No concrete evidence has been provided to substantiate these allegations, making such claims speculative and misleading.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lavrov-echoes-debunked-kremlin-narratives-to-justify-war-undermine-nato/7945306.html	2025-01-21T16:58:16-08:00

Democratic-led states sue to block Trump's birthright citizenship order	Twenty-two Democratic-led U.S. states sued Tuesday to try to block President Donald Trump from ending birthright U.S. citizenship for the children of undocumented migrants living in the country. The suit by the states, joined by the city governments in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, are among the first filed by those opposing Trump's executive orders, which he signed in the immediate hours after his inauguration Monday. The U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship to those born in the country, and court rulings have made only small exceptions, such as rejecting citizenship for the offspring of foreign diplomats born in the U.S. Presidents cannot unilaterally change the Constitution, which instead must be accomplished through large majorities of lawmakers in Congress or wide state legislative action. But Trump, as part of his crackdown on 11 million or more undocumented migrants living in the U.S., signed one executive order directing U.S. agencies to stop handing citizenship documents to the offspring of undocumented migrants. The Republican president's order directed federal officials, starting Feb. 19, to not recognize U.S. citizenship for children born in the United States to mothers who are in the country illegally or are in the U.S. only temporarily, such as visa holders, and whose fathers are not citizens or lawful permanent residents. Trump's nascent administration is moving quickly to deport such migrants back to their home countries, even if they have lived in the U.S. for years, paid taxes and assimilated into American life. Trump's immigration agents are first targeting undocumented migrants who have been convicted of crimes. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement, 'State attorneys general have been preparing for illegal actions like [Trump's no-citizenship edict], and today's immediate lawsuit sends a clear message to the Trump administration that we will stand up for our residents and their basic constitutional rights.' The White House did not immediately comment on the suits, three of which were filed in Boston, Massachusetts, and Concord, New Hampshire. Four states filed a separate lawsuit in Washington. Democratic-led states and advocacy groups have immediately challenged two other Trump executive orders, one creating the Department of Government Efficiency — a nongovernmental advisory panel overseen by billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk — and another weakening job protections for government civil servants to make it easier for the Trump administration to fire them and replace them with Trump loyalists. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said that if Trump's no-citizenship order is allowed to stand, it would mean more than 150,000 children born annually in the United States would be denied the right to citizenship. 'President Trump does not have the authority to take away constitutional rights,' she said in a statement. One of the plaintiffs challenging the order is a woman living in Massachusetts identified only as 'O. Doe.' She is in the country through temporary protected status and is due to give birth in March. The temporary protected status immigration designation is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events and currently covers more than 1 million people from 17 nations. U.S. birthright citizenship was enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in the aftermath of the Civil War in the early 1860s and ratified in 1868. It says: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' Platkin, the New Jersey attorney general, said Tuesday that presidents might have broad authority, but they are not kings. 'The president cannot, with a stroke of a pen, write the 14th Amendment out of existence, period,' he said. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the nation's first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the lawsuit was personal for him. 'The 14th Amendment says what it means, and it means what it says — if you are born on American soil, you are an American. Period. Full stop,' he said. 'There is no legitimate legal debate on this question. But the fact that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from inflicting serious harm right now on American families like my own.' Chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts along with other immigrant rights advocates have also filed suit to block Trump's action. Their suit asked a court to rule that Trump's order is unconstitutional. It cites the case of a woman identified as 'Carmen,' who is pregnant but is not a U.S. citizen. The lawsuit says she has lived in the United States for more than 15 years and has a pending visa application that could lead to permanent resident status. She has no other immigration status, and the father of her expected child has no immigration status either, the suit says. 'Stripping children of the 'priceless treasure' of citizenship is a grave injury,' the suit said. 'It denies them the full membership in U.S. society to which they are entitled.' Some material in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democratic-led-states-sue-to-block-trump-s-birthright-citizenship-order/7945334.html	2025-01-21T15:03:31-08:00	
Trump's UN nominee touts peace through strength on world stage	UNITED NATIONS — President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations told senators at her confirmation hearing Tuesday that she will promote his doctrine of 'peace through strength' on the world stage if she is confirmed. 'It is imperative to ensure strong American leadership at the United Nations,' Elise Stefanik told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 'I share President Trump's vision of a U.N. reformed by strong America First peace through strength and return to this founding mission of promoting peace and security around the world.' Stefanik, 40, from a rural New York district, has been in Congress for a decade and has served on national security related committees. As chair of the Republican Conference since 2021, she is the fourth-ranking House Republican but will have to step down if she is approved. She appeared to have bipartisan support, with Democratic legislators largely posing standard foreign policy questions and avoiding partisan attacks. China's influence China's growing influence within the United Nations was at the top of lawmakers' concerns. 'China has used its malign influence to block attempts to discuss the Chinese government-sponsored genocide against the Uyghurs, and they have blocked our ally Taiwan from fully participating in the U.N.,' committee chair Jim Risch of Idaho said. He also criticized Beijing for pushing its nationals into U.N. system jobs to serve its national interests. Stefanik agreed that Beijing has made 'significant inroads' at the world body and said Washington needs to push back on it with a 'long-term strategy.' 'Working closely with our allies and our partners, both at the most junior levels and at the more senior levels within the U.N., we need to make sure that we are running candidates – either American or allied nations – in the election process for key leadership posts within the U.N. system,' she said. Stefanik said efforts should focus on technical organizations such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) – both organizations that until recently had been under the leadership of international civil servants from China. And she warned that the United States must be vigilant in protecting its ethical standards related to the use of artificial intelligence. The United States is the single largest financial contributor to the United Nations, and several senators questioned whether U.S. taxpayers are still getting their money's worth from the organization. The nominee said she would seek to do an agency-by-agency audit of what U.S. funds are spent on and press for reforms including more transparency and accountability. She also had praise for agencies led by U.S. appointees, including the World Food Program and the U.N. children's agency, UNICEF. 'Stefanik's remarks signaled that the U.S. is going to be tough on the U.N., but not walk away from the organization altogether,' said Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group. 'I actually think that quite a lot of her lines about the need to ensure the U.N. offers value for money will play well with other big donors to the organization, who are keen to control costs.' One of Trump's first executive orders on Monday was to notify the World Health Organization of his intention to withdraw the United States from the body – and with it the hundreds of millions of dollars it contributes to WHO's budget. Stefanik said she supported the move. 'WHO failed on a global stage in the COVID pandemic for all the world to see,' she said. Stefanik was most passionate about 'our most precious ally' Israel and defending it from what she called 'antisemitic rot' and bias at the United Nations. 'We need to be a voice of moral clarity on the U.N. Security Council and at the United Nations at large, for the world to hear the importance of standing with Israel, and I intend to do that,' she said. Asked by Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen about her vision for 'the day after' in Gaza, she said Trump is 'uniquely positioned' to bring peace to the region, to eradicate Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, and protect Israel's national security. Van Hollen pressed further, asking if she supports the view of far-right Israeli legislators who say Israel has a biblical right to the entire West Bank. Stefanik replied 'yes.' Crisis Group's Gowan said that last comment might fuel 'nervousness' among U.N. members that Trump could endorse an Israeli effort to annex parts of the Palestinian territories. But overall, he thinks international diplomats will have found her testimony reassuring. 'Especially after the whiplash effect of Trump disowning the Paris [climate] deal and World Health Organization during his first afternoon in office,' he said. No vote has been scheduled yet in the committee on her nomination. If Stefanik passes that hurdle, and she is widely expected to, then her nomination would go to the full Senate for a final vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-un-nominee-touts-peace-through-strength-on-world-stage-/7945332.html	2025-01-21T15:01:33-08:00	
Zelenskyy: Ukraine would need at least 200,000 peacekeepers for ceasefire	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that if a ceasefire deal were enacted with Russia, 'at least 200,000 European peacekeepers' would need to be on the ground in Ukraine to defend the Eastern European country against a possible attack by Russia. Zelenskyy, speaking a day after Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency, said Europe must 'take care of itself.' He said 200,000 peacekeepers from European countries would be the minimum number of peacekeepers required, 'Otherwise, it's nothing.' 'Let's not forget, there is no ocean separating European countries from Russia,' Zelenskyy said in his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Ukraine's president said Russia's demand that Ukraine reduce its army to one-fifth of its current size of 800,000 is not an option. Ukraine's best defense during a ceasefire deal, Zelenskyy said, would be its membership into NATO. While most European countries support Ukraine's entry into the alliance, Germany and the U.S. oppose it. Hungary and Slovakia, which are pro-Russia governments, also oppose Ukraine's entry into NATO. Zelenskyy also called on European nations to consider Trump's recent call for NATO members to increase their defense spending to 5% of GDP. 'If it takes 5% of GDP to cover defense, then so be it, 5% it is.' Zelenskyy said Europe needs to create a united security and defense policy. Meanwhile, Ukraine is seeking a meeting with Trump, who had promised before the U.S. election that he would bring a swift end to the war between Russia and Ukraine if he won the American presidency. It has never been clear, though, how he would accomplish that. Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russian drone attacks damaged residential buildings in several parts of central and southern Ukraine. The attacks were part of an assault that Ukraine's military said involved 131 Russian drones and four ballistic missiles. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 72 of the drones, the air force said. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysask said on Telegram that Russian attacks damaged houses and a warehouse, injuring one person. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets reported Tuesday that falling drone fragments damaged four residential buildings, a school, a shop and a power line. Poltava Governor Filip Pronin said on Telegram that a drone fell on a house in his region, sparking a fire, while pieces of destroyed drones damaged six residential buildings. Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed 55 Ukrainian aerial drones, mostly in regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Russian air defenses knocked down 22 of the drones over Bryansk, 12 drones over Rostov and 10 over the Smolensk region, the ministry said. Other intercepts took place over Voronezh, Saratov and Kursk. Smolensk Governor Vasily Anokhin said on Telegram that drone debris damaged several residential buildings, while Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a drone attack on a car injured two people. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-ukraine-would-need-at-least-200-000-peacekeepers-for-ceasefire/7945314.html	2025-01-21T14:38:34-08:00	
Syrian Kurds look for continued US support under Trump	WASHINGTON — Kurdish groups in Syria are expressing hope for continued support from the United States as President Donald Trump begins his second term in office. Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been a key U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State terror group, also known as IS or ISIS. Supported by a U.S.-led global coalition, the SDF runs a large territory once controlled by IS in northeastern Syria. Mazloum Abdi, general commander of the SDF, congratulated Trump on Monday after he was sworn in. 'We look forward to continuing cooperation in achieving stability, defeating terrorism, and supporting peace in Northeast Syria,' Abdi said in a post on the social media platform X. Following the fall of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad last month, U.S.-backed Kurdish forces have been under mounting pressure by both the new authorities in Damascus and the Turkish government to disarm. Turkish-backed Syrian armed groups also have been in daily clashes with the SDF in parts of northern Syria. Ankara views the SDF as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, considered to be a terrorist group by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria as part of the anti-IS mission, according to the Pentagon. Asked during a Jan. 7 press conference whether he would keep the same troop capacity in Syria, Trump said he wouldn't comment on a military strategy. With regards to tensions between the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syrian Kurds, Trump said he is friends with Erdogan. 'He's a guy I like and respect. I think he respects me also,' Trump said during the same press conference. 'He's the one that didn't go after certain people after I requested that he not, you know what I'm talking about, the Kurds. I don't know how long that's going to [hold] because they're natural enemies. They hate each other, but he didn't do that yet, and he didn't do it in the past also. He started, and I said please don't do that, and he didn't do it,' Trump added. Trump was referring to discussions he had with the Turkish president in 2019 during the former's first term in office. Following a partial U.S. troop withdrawal from northeast Syria in October 2019, the Turkish military and their Syrian proxies carried out a major ground offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces. Turkey ended its campaign after several ceasefire agreements brokered separately by the U.S. and Russia. Newly appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio said during his Senate confirmation hearing last week that it was important to continue supporting Syrian Kurdish forces. 'We need to recognize that there are implications to abandoning partners who have a great sacrifice and threat, actually jailed the ISIS fighters,' Rubio said, referring to the thousands of IS foreign fighters who are held in Kurdish-run prisons and camps in northeast Syria. 'One of the reasons why we were able to dismantle ISIS, because they [Syrian Kurds] were willing to host them in jails, a great personal threat to them, and obviously that situation is very tenuous,' he said. Rubio noted that it was in the U.S. national interest 'to have a Syria that is no longer a playground for ISIS, that respects religious minorities, ranging from Alawites all the way to Christians, that protects the Kurds, and at the same time it is not a vehicle through which Iran can spread its terrorism to Hezbollah and destabilize Lebanon.' The new authorities in Syria are led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group that is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Some experts, like Brussels-based Kurdish affairs analyst Hosheng Ossi, argue that the U.S. and its regional partners, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, should view the SDF and Syrian Kurds as a strategic safeguard to prevent Syria from being entirely controlled by a radical group like the HTS. 'Washington has invested in the SDF for more than a decade, and it would be a strategic blunder to let the SDF in the eastern Euphrates area face an enemy that is even more dangerous than Daesh,' Ossi told VOA, using an Arabic acronym for IS. He said for the Trump administration to have a successful approach toward the Kurdish situation in Syria, it 'could seriously and firmly seek to separate the SDF from the PKK.' Suleyman Ozeren, a professorial lecturer at American University in Washington, said the U.S. remains the only viable mediator between Turkey and the SDF. 'If President Trump intends to fully withdraw from Syria, he may need to apply pressure on both Turkey and the SDF to find a resolution,' he told VOA. 'However, the SDF will likely face significant pressure to make concessions, while Ankara may achieve favorable compromises.' 'Any agreement would also need to involve HTS, which presents both an opportunity and a challenge for Ankara, as HTS itself seeks improved relations with the United States,' he said.

Trump's executive orders on gender draw mixed reaction across Africa	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Conservatives across Africa applauded U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive orders Monday regarding gender and diversity, while gay rights activists and the LGBTQ community on the continent are expressing deep concern. On his first day as the 47th U.S. president, Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders, including some that reversed policies of his predecessor, Joe Biden. These included orders revoking some protections for transgender people and defining the sexes strictly as male and female. Trump's actions sparked a mix of reactions throughout Africa. Some, like Bishop John Praise Daniel, vice president of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, welcomed Trump’s moves. 'I'm very excited,' he said 'I think Donald Trump has just done what is right, because how can some young persons wake up and say, ‘I don't feel like being a girl, I want to be a boy,’ and their sexes will be changed. We don't need that confusion. Bringing back righteousness, order and sanity to society.' But while many in Africa’s conservative societies are in support, LGBTQ activists strongly opposed the decision, calling it a setback after years of progress and advocacy. Frank Ejiogu, founder of Creme de la Creme, a Nigerian LGBTQ advocacy group, warned of serious consequences. 'We know this will have ripple effects that might catalyze violence against LGBTQ community members in the Global South, which will boil down to discrimination, assault, and a lot of [restrictive] policies that governments will start enacting,' he said. Ejiogu said LGBTQ activists already are planning how to resist such measures. 'We’re strategizing on how to stand firm on what we believe in and for the community,' he said. '[Trump] can only be there for four years. The only thing we promise ourselves all over the globe and in the Global South is to making sure that we fight back against the policies against LGBTQ communities all around the world.' Members of the LGBTQ community already face harsh penalties in many African countries. In Nigeria, same-sex relationships are punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Uganda’s constitutional court upheld a life sentence for homosexuality offenders last year, while Mali’s junta criminalized homosexuality with imprisonment in December.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-executive-orders-on-gender-draw-mixed-reaction-across-africa/7945171.html	2025-01-21T12:43:53-08:00	
US withdrawals from WHO, Paris Agreement met with regret, calls for reversal	Geneva — United Nations agencies say the imminent U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization and Paris climate agreement will have serious consequences for global health and efforts to slow down climate change. 'The World Health Organization regrets the announcement that the United States of America intends to withdraw from the organization,' the WHO said Tuesday in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s declaration Monday that he intends to quit the U.N. health agency. 'WHO plays a crucial role in protecting the health and security of the world’s people, including Americans, by addressing the root causes of disease, building stronger health systems, and detecting, preventing and responding to health emergencies, including disease outbreaks, often in dangerous places where others cannot go,' it stated. In explaining his decision, Trump accused the agency of being subject to 'inappropriate political influence' from other member states. 'World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It’s not going to happen anymore,' he said in signing an executive order Monday, hours after his inauguration. In responding to the allegations, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Tuesday that the United States, which was one of the founding members of WHO in 1948, had over seven decades together with the WHO, 'saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats.' 'Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication,' he said. The United States is the WHO’s single largest donor. It contributed $1.284 billion or 18 percent of the agency’s 2022-2023 budget. Jasaravic said the U.S. decision was not unexpected and the WHO was now analyzing the exact details of Trump’s executive order 'to see how this will play out and to see what will be the consequences.' He noted that the United States can formally leave the WHO and stop financing the organization one year after the United Nations receives official written notice of U.S. withdrawal. He said the WHO hopes the United States will reconsider its decision and maintain the U.S.-WHO partnership 'for the benefit of the health and well-being of millions of people around the globe.' 'At the same time, we will continue to work in the world’s most difficult places,' including countries in conflict, 'so we can protect the most vulnerable and be where people need us the most,' he said. 'The world lives longer, healthier, perhaps a little bit happier because of WHO, which goes to places where others cannot go, including Gaza, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan,' Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, said in support of the beleaguered agency. In the meantime, U.N. officials have called the U.S. decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement 'a major disappointment,' noting that the world’s nations had adopted the accord because they recognized 'the immense harm that climate change is already causing and the enormous opportunity that climate action presents.' Antonio Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, said that it was 'crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues' in this critical decade for climate action. The World Meteorological Organization has warned that 'climate change is playing out, on an almost daily basis, through more extreme weather.' A recent WMO report finds the last 10 years have been the hottest in recorded history, and that 2024 was the hottest year on record, with temperatures at about 1.55 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial era. 'Every fraction of a degree of global warming has an impact on our economies and our lives,' Clare Nullis, WMO spokesperson said, adding that 'The U.S. accounts for the lion’s share of global economic losses from weather, climate and water-related hazards.' According to the non-profit USAFacts, 'nearly 40 percent of the billion-dollar climate events that have hit the U.S. since 1980 happened between 2017 and the present day.' The data-gathering organization says that '2023 had the most billion-dollar natural disaster events of any year to date.' Nullis pointed out Tuesday that the ongoing Los Angeles wildfires are 'estimated to be the most costly U.S. disaster on record.' 'Not all of these weather-related disasters, you know, have a connection with climate change. We are not saying that…but climate change is an aggravating factor. It is making our weather much more, much more extreme,' she said. 'So, you know, the need for the Paris Agreement is pretty obvious.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-withdrawals-from-who-paris-agreement-met-with-regret-calls-for-reversal/7945156.html	2025-01-21T12:16:07-08:00

Aid trucks enter Gaza, as officials hope ceasefire holds	CAIRO — Aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip from Egypt at a cautious pace, as Egyptian officials tried to assess the pulse of a Gaza cease-fire agreement, amid hopes it would hold and be reinforced in the coming days, despite concerns that developments on the West Bank might cause it to fray. An unnamed U.N. official on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing expressed cautious optimism to journalists that aid shipments into Gaza would continue and pick up speed if the current cease-fire holds. 'There's a readiness to manifest to send more trucks [into Gaza] in order to make sure that the [need] is met,' the official said. 'And the initial filling of the gap on the other side is really important.' Saudi-owned al-Arabiya TV's correspondent in Rafah indicated that 600 aid trucks went into Gaza from Egypt Tuesday. He added that on a normal day before the conflict broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, an average of 500 trucks went into Gaza from Egypt. As Gazans told Arab media they were pleased a ceasefire appeared to be holding, some observers expressed worries that so much damage has been done to Gaza that it might not be possible to restore any semblance of normalcy for years to come. Paul Sullivan, a Washington-based Middle East analyst and former professor at the American University of Cairo, told VOA he was not optimistic that a ceasefire deal, even if it holds, will do much to restore calm to Gaza. 'This will be a source of terrorism for decades to come,' Sullivan said. 'The ticking human pain of the starving youth will haunt the world for decades to come.' In the meantime, ordinary Egyptians, the overwhelming majority of whom supported Gaza during the months of the conflict against Israel, appeared pleased to see some hope that the fighting was finally winding down.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aid-trucks-enter-gaza-as-officials-hope-ceasefire-holds/7945116.html	2025-01-21T12:03:04-08:00	
M23 rebels in eastern DR Congo seize town on key supply route	GOMA, CONGO — M23 rebels seized the town of Minova in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a key supply route for the provincial capital, Goma, authorities said Tuesday. The move led to an exodus of people in the face of a new offensive by the rebel group, which has taken several strategic towns in recent weeks. The provincial governor of South Kivu, Jean-Jacques Purusi, confirmed the capture of Minova, adding that the rebels have also taken the mining towns of Lumbishi, Numbi and Shanje in the same province and the town of Bweremana in neighboring North Kivu province. Congo's military said in a statement Tuesday that the rebels made 'breakthroughs' in Minova and Bweremana. It did not confirm whether M23 captured the towns. M23, or the March 23 Movement, is a militant group composed of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army just over a decade ago. The group rose to prominence in 2012 when its fighters seized Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and eastern Congo's largest city, on the border with Rwanda. M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo, in a decadeslong conflict that has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced. Congo, the United States and United Nations experts accuse neighboring Rwanda of backing M23. Rwanda denies the claim. M23 has been making significant advances in eastern Congo in recent weeks. The rebels captured the key mining town of Masisi in North Kivu earlier this month, another key supply route for Goma. Minova is a strategically important port on the shores of Lake Kivu and a transit point for many agricultural goods heading to Goma, about 45 kilometers away. More than 237,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in eastern Congo since the beginning of this year, the U.N. refugee agency said in a report Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-rebels-in-eastern-dr-congo-seize-town-on-key-supply-route/7945120.html	2025-01-21T11:56:48-08:00	
Trump’s 2nd term: Hopes for economic prosperity amid new challenges	Many American voters are hopeful that President Donald Trump’s second term, which began on Jan. 20, will usher in a period of economic prosperity — much like they felt during his first term. However, the economy he is inheriting this time around is markedly different from the one he inherited eight years ago, pre-pandemic. And he faces new challenges. While former President Joe Biden has defended his handling of the country’s economic recovery — pointing to strong job growth and falling inflation — high prices persist. A large national debt, climate change and some of Trump’s own policy proposals may further complicate efforts to boost the economy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-2nd-term-hopes-for-economic-prosperity-amid-new-challenges/7945076.html	2025-01-21T11:51:04-08:00	
Trump repeat of need to take control of Greenland raises concerns, stirs debate	NUUK, GREENLAND — U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his assertion Monday that the United States needs to take control of Greenland from Denmark in the interests of 'international security.' His repeated calls in recent weeks are raising concerns and stirring debate among the Arctic island’s 57,000-strong population as well as alarm among the United States’ European allies. 'Greenland is a wonderful place. We need it for international security. And I'm sure that Denmark will come along,' the president said. 'The people of Greenland are not happy with Denmark, as you know. I think they are happy with us. … My son and representatives went up there two weeks ago, and they like us. So, we’ll see what happens,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, hours after his inauguration as the 47th president of the United States. Donald Trump Jr. visited Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, on Jan. 7, where he handed out 'Make America Great Again' baseball caps and had lunch with a group of locals before returning to the U.S. a few hours later. At a press conference in Florida the same day, President-elect Trump said he refused to rule out using economic or military force to take control of Greenland. ‘Not for sale’ Denmark and its European allies have offered a cautious response, emphasising the need to respect international sovereignty while trying not to offend Trump. Greenland already has a high degree of independence, although Denmark retains responsibility for the island’s security affairs. Naaja Nathanielsen, a senior minister in Greenland’s autonomous government, gave a simple response to Trump’s comments. 'We are not a commodity. And we are not for sale,' she told VOA. Nevertheless, Nathanielsen sees common ground with Washington. 'If you cut through the rhetoric, I hear two messages from the U.S.,' she said. 'One is we need to look at the national security aspect, and we quite agree with the U.S. message in that point. We've been trying to advocate for that as well for some years. And the other perspective is, and the other message I hear is, we want to engage more in the Greenlandic mineral sector. And that is really, you know, kicking in an open door.' Political change Greenland is due to hold a general election by April at the latest. The government wants a simultaneous referendum on full independence from Denmark. 'Greenlanders themselves must decide what our future looks like,' Greenlandic Premier Mute Egede said during a live televised debate on Sunday with political leaders from Denmark and Greenland. 'We have said very precisely that Greenland — and us in this country — do not want to be Americans. We don't want to be Danes either. We are Greenlanders,' he said. After centuries of Danish control, the political winds of change in Greenland are getting stronger, according to Arnaq Nielsen, opinion editor at Greenland’s weekly Sermitsiaq newspaper. 'Everything is about the visit of Trump Junior, and when you meet people, it’s all we talk about,' Nielsen told VOA in an interview at the Sermitsiaq newsroom in Nuuk. 'This situation is evolving so quickly. Now it’s about a lot more than the complicated relationship between Denmark and Greenland. Suddenly Trump Junior is here, and it all explodes. It’s hard to figure out what is going on.' 'It’s a small number of people here who are really happy that Trump Junior came to Greenland. And a small number of people really resent him coming here. But the large majority are not that loud because only the two extremes are being heard,' Nielsen said. Social media Those extremes are being amplified by social media. YouTube influencers have followed Trump Junior’s visit to Greenland, handing out American dollar bills to passers-by, along with baseball caps emblazoned with the slogan 'Make Greenland Great Again.' The influencers are not associated with the Trump administration. Several Greenlanders welcomed the unfamiliar visitors. Others have engaged in angry exchanges. A video posted online last week showed an unidentified local resident tearing up a U.S. currency note and stamping on a red Make Greenland Great Again baseball cap. 'Do you think you can buy us?' the man said. Residents of Nuuk who spoke to VOA were divided over the global attention. 'I think we are in a terrible situation,' Nuuk resident Per Chemnitz said. 'Our politicians are handling this totally wrong. They have been seduced by something so much bigger than they are able to handle. So, I don’t know where this will end. The worst thing that can happen is that we lose our relationship to Denmark.' Aka Gronvold, who also lives in the Greenlandic capital, welcomed the Trumps’ intervention. 'Right now, Greenland has the attention of the whole world. That is really good, and it’s about time that Greenland gets some more attention.' Gronvold told VOA. ‘Make Greenland Great Again’ That attention looks set to continue. Republican lawmakers last week introduced a bill titled the Make Greenland Great Again Act, allowing President Trump to start talks with Denmark over purchasing Greenland. It’s not yet clear whether the bill will receive enough support from Congress. Denmark has echoed Greenland’s assertion that the island is not for sale but said it would welcome greater cooperation with Trump in security and mineral extraction. Controlling Greenland comes with a cost, noted analyst Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen of the Royal Danish Defense College. 'If the U.S. went in and were to acquire Greenland, they would suddenly also have to pay the bill for running Greenlandic society — a bill that's being covered by the Danish government right now and which runs along the lines of U.S. $750 million to U.S. $1 billion a year,' Rahbek-Clemmensen said. '[The U.S.] gets all its interests, and it doesn't have to pay the bill. And so, geopolitically speaking, it doesn't really make that much sense to change that situation. So, if I were to explain why Trump has an interest in Greenland… I would say that it probably has to do with the whole ideology of Make America Great Again,' he told VOA. 'In this situation. acquiring Greenland would literally make the U.S. greater — or at least bigger,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-repeat-of-need-to-take-control-of-greenland-raises-concerns-stirs-debate/7944672.html	2025-01-21T11:40:35-08:00

Mexico defends sovereignty as US seeks to label cartels as terrorists	MEXICO CITY — Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's executive order moving toward designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations would only impact Mexico if there's close coordination between the two governments. She said that Mexico would defend its sovereignty and independence while seeking coordination with the U.S. in the wake of the order signed Monday. 'We all want to fight the drug cartels,' Sheinbaum said at her daily press briefing. The U.S. 'in their territory, us in our territory.' Trump's order highlighted Mexican drug cartels and other Latin American criminal groups like Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). The order says they 'threaten the safety of the American people, the security of the United States, and the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.' The order did not list any Mexican cartels by name but said Cabinet secretaries would recommend groups for designation as terrorist organizations in the next 14 days. It was among a slew of executive orders Trump signed Monday to kick off his administration, several of which focus on securing the southern border. 'The Cartels have engaged in a campaign of violence and terror throughout the Western Hemisphere that has not only destabilized countries with significant importance for our national interests but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs,' the order reads. It was unclear what the impact could be for fighting the cartels, but there was concern it could be another way to make it more difficult for people from the countries where those groups operate to access the U.S. It came in addition to measures including the declaration of an emergency on the U.S. southern border, a promise to slap 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Feb. 1 and ending the use of the CBP One app, which allowed migrants to apply for asylum appointments before reaching the border. Trump has also promised to carry out mass deportations and threatened military intervention in Mexico to fight cartels, something sharply rejected by Sheinbaum. Many have voiced concern the terrorist designation could provide the U.S. justification to take military action against cartels. Vanda Felbab-Brown, an organized crime expert at the Brookings Institution, said the order could have 'huge implications from trade to migrants.' As cartels have gained a firm grip on control of the lucrative migrant smuggling trade in recent years, it's virtually impossible for migrants and asylum seekers to pass through Mexico and other Latin American countries without paying some sort of fee to cartels. The moment they do, Felbab-Brown said, it could disqualify them from seeking asylum. 'Trump can essentially prevent the vast majority of undocumented migrants trying to cross the U.S. border from getting asylum,' she said. Mike Vigil, a former head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's foreign operations, said he expected any terrorism designation to have very little impact on day-to-day operations against cartels because many of the same anti-terrorism powers American authorities would be granted are already employ in counter-narcotics efforts. 'It's already been done. This is nothing new,' Vigil said. 'It's all political theater and tossing a piece of stale salami to [Trump's] base.' He said logistically the order would likely allow the U.S. to seize assets of groups in the U.S., sanction U.S. citizens that do business with terrorist organizations and block members of those groups from entering the U.S. 'It's not going to allow the U.S. to send troops into Mexico like so many people think simply because people forget that Mexico is a sovereign country and it would be an act of war,' he said. The move comes as cartel violence has intensified in northern Mexican states after the kidnapping and detention of kingpin Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada sparked an all-out war between rival factions of the Sinaloa cartel. Gunmen continue to leave mutilated bodies scattered across the state and kidnap people even from hospitals. It's part of a larger shifting dynamic in cartel warfare in the Latin American nation. Years ago, a handful of criminal organizations headed by a few key capos controlled large parts of Mexico. Now, many more factions have violently fought for power, as they've become more agile and harder to pin down. They've used more sophisticated tools like bomb-dropping drones, improvised explosive devices and rigged armored vehicles, and have expanded into migrant trafficking and the avocado trade. Meanwhile, thousands of Mexican citizens have gotten caught in the crossfire, having been slain or gone missing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-defends-sovereignty-as-us-seeks-to-label-cartels-as-terrorists-/7944948.html	2025-01-21T10:17:58-08:00	
Trump's first full day back in White House includes firings, infrastructure announcement	Washington — President Donald Trump is spending his first full day back in the White House meeting with congressional leaders, making an infrastructure announcement and demonstrating one of his favored expressions of power: firing people. The new president posted on his Truth social media platform early Tuesday that he would fire more than 1,000 presidential appointees 'who are not aligned with our vision,' including some high-profile names. Trump fired chef and humanitarian Jose Andres from the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, retired Gen. Mark Milley from the National Infrastructure Advisory Council, former State Department official Brian Hook from the board of the Wilson Center and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms from the President's Export Council. 'YOU'RE FIRED!' Trump said in his post — his catchphrase from his reality TV show, 'The Apprentice.' Former President Joe Biden also removed many Trump appointees in his first days in office, including former press secretary Sean Spicer from the board overseeing the U.S. Naval Academy. Trump planned to continue to build on his barrage of Inauguration Day announcements, with the White House promising a 'massive announcement' on infrastructure. Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to detail the announcement in advance, but she said in an interview on Fox News that it would send a message to the world. 'You won't want to miss it,' she said. 'Infrastructure week' became a punchline during Trump's first administration as White House officials promised repeatedly — over years — to train a focus on major public works projects, only to have Trump himself quickly shift emphasis elsewhere while major legislation on infrastructure never materialized. It was enough of a pattern that Biden joked about how his predecessor couldn't pull off even a week of focus on infrastructure while his administration oversaw passage of billions of dollars for bridges, tunnels, roads and other projects for the coming 10 years. 'He didn't build a damn thing,' Biden said frequently of Trump, adding that his own administration delivered 'infrastructure decade.' Trump wants to ban Chinese companies from owning vital U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and agriculture, and he says he will force Chinese owners to sell any holdings 'that jeopardize America's national security.' Trump also attended a national prayer service Tuesday morning at Washington National Cathedral, a customary visit for new presidents and one that will wrap up his four days of inauguration-related events. Later in the day, the president was expected to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other GOP (Republican) legislators. It's the first formal sit-down for the GOP leadership teams including Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Senate GOP Whip John Barrasso and the new president as they chart priorities for using Republican power in Washington. Despite an ambitious 100-day agenda, the Republican-led Congress is not on the same page on some ideas and strategies as they rush to deliver tax cuts for the wealthy, mass deportations and other goals for Trump. Trump used the first hours of his presidency on Monday to sign a series of executive orders and memorandums, moving quickly to show that his new hold on the U.S. government would be a stark change from his predecessor. He pardoned hundreds of people for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate accords and the World Health Organization, began his immigration crackdown by declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and sought to end automatic citizenship for anyone born in America, which is expected to run into constitutional challenges. He also signed an order that intends to pause a ban on TikTok for 75 days to give its China-based parent company more time to find an approved buyer.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-first-full-day-back-in-white-house-includes-firings-infrastructure-announcement/7944947.html	2025-01-21T10:15:12-08:00	
Trump fires first woman to head a US military service	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration has removed Admiral Linda Fagan — the first woman to lead a U.S. military service — as the head of the Coast Guard. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the Coast Guard, did not immediately respond to a request on Tuesday for comment on Fagan's dismissal. Fox News cited a senior official saying reasons included her failure to address border security threats, excessive focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, and an 'erosion of trust' over the Coast Guard's investigation into sexual assault cases. Trump and other Republicans have long railed against government programs aimed at fostering diversity, and border security is a key priority for the president, who declared a national emergency at the U.S. frontier with Mexico on Monday, the first day of his new term. 'She served a long and illustrious career, and I thank her for her service to our nation,' acting DHS secretary Benjamine Huffman said in a message to the Coast Guard, which is one of the five U.S. military branches. Fagan had led the Coast Guard since 2022, and previously held posts including vice commandant of the service. She 'served on all seven continents, from the snows of Ross Island, Antarctica to the heart of Africa, from Tokyo to Geneva, and in many ports along the way,' according to an archived version of her biography, which is no longer available on the Coast Guard website.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-fires-first-woman-to-head-a-us-military-service-/7944898.html	2025-01-21T09:22:18-08:00	
Over 20 killed in clash between security forces, Islamic State fighters in Somalia	WASHINGTON — Over 20 people were killed and more than 10 others wounded during two days of fighting between Islamic State fighters and security forces from Somalia’s Puntland region, officials said Tuesday. In an interview with VOA’s Somali Service, a spokesperson for Puntland security operations, Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed, said that 15 Islamic State militants and seven Puntland soldiers were killed in the clashes Sunday and Monday. Ahmed said IS fighters used improvised explosive devices to protect their hideouts near the Ufeyn area. As soldiers were clearing landmines, one of the devices exploded, killing six soldiers and wounding three, he said. The spokesperson said that during the operation, soldiers killed eight Islamic State militants. Ahmed said the latest military operation, which centered around the Cal Miskat mountains in the Bari region, continued through Monday. 'On Monday, our soldiers encountered the terrorist fighters around Laba-Afle area, killing seven of them. One of our soldiers was also killed and four others injured,' he said. Residents, who requested anonymity fearing for their lives, told VOA they saw the bodies of militants strewn along the roads leading into the Cal Miskat mountains. Puntland began a military offensive last month against extremist groups in the region following months of preparations. The region’s leader, Said Abdullahi Deni, appealed to the public to support the operation, which he said is aimed at dislodging the Islamic State militants from their hideouts in mountainous areas. Puntland has endured terrorist attacks perpetrated by al-Shabab and Islamic State militants, but the ongoing military operation appears to be focused on IS. The group has a relatively small presence in Somalia compared to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, but experts have warned of growing activity. U.S. military officials and Somali security experts reported that IS increased its membership numbers in Somalia last year. The group was previously estimated to have between 100 and 400 fighters, but Somali security and intelligence experts estimate their current numbers to be 500 to 600 militants. Most of the newcomers are said to be from the Middle East and eastern and northern Africa. IS in Somalia was formed in October 2015 by a group of former al-Shabab fighters led by the cleric Sheikh Abdulkadir Mumin, who reportedly pledged allegiance to the late IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Mumin appears to have survived a U.S. airstrike on May 31, 2024. A United Nations counterterrorism official last year warned of increased attacks by Islamic State affiliates in Somalia, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-20-killed-in-clash-between-security-forces-islamic-state-fighters-in-somalia/7944791.html	2025-01-21T08:56:54-08:00

Indonesia seeks to counter global rivalries as full BRICS member, pushes for UN reform	JAKARTA — Indonesia’s admission this month to the BRICS developing-country bloc, started by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, marks an expansion of the group to Southeast Asia. Jakarta’s admission, which follows last year’s addition of Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, was announced January 6 by Brazil, the group’s presiding member. In October, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam became partner countries – meaning they are interested in becoming BRICS members but have not yet been accepted for full membership. Indonesia is the only Southeast Asian country that has been accepted as a full member. Teuku Rezasyah, a professor of diplomacy and foreign policy at Indonesia’s Universitas Padjajaran, said membership will allow Indonesia to work with other influential countries with substantial populations to reform multilateral organizations such as the United Nations. 'Currently, Russia and China are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. However, BRICS has become a strong foundation for Indonesia to generate support from countries like India, Brazil and South Africa in order to push through reforms of the U.N. Security Council,' he told VOA January 15. Rezasyah said there have not been significant structural changes in the United Nations for 80 years. The Security Council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States – have veto power and they are 'mostly Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian civilizations,' he said. 'The world’s first and fourth largest country by population which is India and Indonesia, who represent large Hindu and Muslim populations, are not always represented well in the Security Council,' he said. Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Roy Soemirat pointed to areas in which Jakarta would like to see changes at the U.N. 'Indonesia continues to push for revitalizing the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. There need to be changes in the working methods, limited use of veto power, and improve the issue of representation at the Security Council. The Security Council was last expanded from 11 to 15 countries in the 1970s. As more countries join the United Nations, the composition of the Security Council needs to change,' he told VOA January 18. He added that Indonesia has been active in U.N. working groups on U.N. reforms, particularly as a nonpermanent Security Council member from 2019 to 2020. The United Nations unanimously agreed to push for improving regulations on using veto power in 2015. Along with France and Mexico, Indonesia has urged Security Council countries to be more transparent and voluntarily explain their reasons for a veto, Roy added. Aspirations to reform the United Nations Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Sugiono, in his annual address January 10, cited a lack of respect for international law and the U.N. Charter, saying the global economic architecture does not meet the modern challenges and needs most countries face. Indonesia was one of the first countries to call for U.N. reforms, in a 1960 speech to the General Assembly by then-President Sukarno. Mohammad Faisal, executive director of the Center of Reform on Economics, a Jakarta research group, said it will 'still be a long way to truly reform the United Nations,' but that 'the growing power of the emerging countries, including those under BRICS, will at least, make it more balanced.' 'So, the voices of the emerging and developing countries can be heard more optimally in the global arena,' he said. Lalu Muhammad Iqbal, a foreign Spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Antara wire service that he believes that the U.N. Security Council reform is essential because can make decisions that all member states must follow. However, there is no agreement among U.N. member states on a system for change. Some member states propose changing the veto right, while others propose permanent or semipermanent member status. Dinna Prapto Raharja, senior policy advisor at Synergy Policies - a public policy consulting firm - and a tenured Associate Professor in international relations noted developing countries’ various positions on U.N. reform. 'Everybody has their own champion of who should be the new permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, for instance. How the U.N. Security Council veto can be ended and who should get veto power. That’s why I think Indonesia has to come up with an idea for U.N. reform that is really feasible to achieve,' she said. The foreign affairs ministry emphasized the importance of BRICS as a platform for voices of the Global South. 'BRICS is an important platform for Indonesia to strengthen South-South cooperation, ensuring that the voices and aspirations of Global South countries are heard and represented in the global decision-making process. We are fully dedicated to working together with all BRICS members, or with other parties, to create a just, peaceful, and prosperous world.' the ministry said in a January 7 press statement. There are also concerns among members of the House of Representatives, Indonesia’s unicameral national legislature, and international relations analysts, that by joining BRICS, Indonesia is drawing closer to Russia and China while distancing itself from Western powers such as the United States and the European Union. Vinsensio Dugis, head of the ASEAN Studies Research Center at Universitas Airlangga in Indonesia, said he is concerned that Western countries consider BRICS to be a forum led by China and Russia to oppose Western political and economic interests, which could cause Western countries to withhold future investment in Indonesia. Combined, BRICS has a population of 3.5 billion people or 45% of the global population. Not including Indonesia, the economies of BRICS countries account for around 28% of the global economy. It is often perceived as challenging the political and economic dominance of rich and powerful countries in North America and western Europe. Apart from reforming the United Nations, Indonesia said it is ready to send more peacekeeping forces to Gaza. Soemirat, speaking before a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect Sunday, called the prolonged conflict in Gaza 'an example of the U.N. Security Council’s failure to quickly fulfil its mandate to maintain international peace and security based on the U.N. Charter.' Sugiono, in a January 16 posting on X, expressed hope that the ceasefire agreement that had been reached could be 'a momentum to push for peace in Palestine.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-seeks-to-counter-global-rivalries-as-full-brics-member-pushes-for-un-reform/7944625.html	2025-01-21T06:28:25-08:00	
China seeks more cooperation with US as Trump takes office	Taipei, Taiwan — China has urged the United States to focus on managing bilateral relationships through cooperation instead of confrontation as U.S. President Donald Trump kicks off his second term in office. 'China is willing to work with the new U.S. government to maintain communication, strengthen cooperation, properly manage differences, and push China-U.S. relations to make greater progress from a new starting point,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during the regular press conference on Tuesday in Beijing. Analysts say Beijing hopes to reduce misunderstandings between both sides through engagement and exchanges in the early stage of the second Trump presidency. 'The Chinese government hopes China and the U.S. could understand each other’s needs through communication,' said Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar. 'Beijing believes China and the U.S. can still reach a consensus and avoid many misunderstandings that have arisen during the first Trump presidency' if both sides prioritize efforts to stabilize bilateral relations, he told VOA by phone. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration on Monday, China and Trump’s team conducted several top-level exchanges, including a call between the new U.S. president and Chinese President Xi Jinping last Friday. Trump said he and Xi would 'solve many problems together' while the Chinese president said the key to handling bilateral relations was to 'respect each other's core interests and major concerns and to find a proper solution to the problem.' On Sunday, China’s Vice President Han Zheng, who was in Washington, D.C., to attend Trump’s inauguration ceremony, met with his American counterpart JD Vance, and a group of American business leaders, including Tesla founder Elon Musk. He said China and the U.S. could 'contribute to each other's progress, bring benefits to the two countries, and make important contributions to world peace and development' as long as they 'uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.' Additionally, Han urged U.S. businesses to 'play an active role as a bridge and make greater contribution to the development of China-U.S. relations' by continuing to 'invest and take root in China.' Experts say Beijing wants to seize the opportunity to improve bilateral relations with Washington through these initial engagements with the Trump administration. Beijing 'would not only prefer to avoid increased sanctions but also the potential for greater limitations on tech exports to China,' said Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University. While the Chinese government has expressed willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration, the U.S. president has also held off the imposition of tariffs on imported goods from China, Mexico, and Canada. Instead, he released a broad trade memo that urged the United States Trade Representative to assess China’s compliance with the 'Phase 1' trade deal that his administration signed with Beijing in 2020, which required Beijing to increase purchases of U.S. exports by $200 billion over two years. Additionally, Trump signed an executive order that would delay the ban on the popular social media app TikTok for 75 days but threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese products if Beijing didn’t approve a potential deal with TikTok. 'And if we said, well, ‘You’re not going to approve it’, then that’s a certain hostility, and we’ll put tariffs of 25, 30,40, 50%, even 100%,' Trump said on Monday, after signing the executive order for TikTok. Rich said Trump’s decision to delay imposing tariffs on Chinese products shows the U.S. president’s desire to 'pressure China to make some concessions' that he can declare as a victory. 'I suspect the talk of sticking it to China will return in the absence of some face-saving concession or if other policies start to falter, as a perceived tough-on-China stance taps into the broader concern among many Americans,' he told VOA in a written response. Some Chinese merchants said Trump’s decision to delay the imposition of tariffs on Chinese products allows them to be better prepared for similar scenarios in the future. 'I am finding other ways to export products to my American customers by shifting operations to Southeast Asia,' a Chinese apparel exporter surnamed Yuan in Shanghai, who asked to be identified only by his last name due to security concerns, told VOA in a written response. While Trump’s incoming cabinet includes several politicians known for their hawkish stance on China, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, analysts say it’s unclear how the Trump administration’s China policies will shape up. 'The ultimate decision-maker is Trump, and if China gives Trump what he thinks he needs, those hawkish people and their beliefs will quickly be sidelined and they may not have influence on U.S.-China policy,' Dexter Roberts, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told VOA by phone. Despite the lack of clarity on the Trump administration’s China policies, Shen in Shanghai said official comments from Beijing and Washington suggest their initial exchanges have been 'quite positive.' 'This might mean there would be less misunderstandings and I think both sides won’t waste this new opportunity to engage with each other,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-seeks-more-cooperation-with-us-as-trump-takes-office/7944615.html	2025-01-21T06:12:10-08:00

Quad foreign ministers meet in Washington in signal of Trump's China focus	Washington — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will hit the ground running on Tuesday, hosting a meeting in Washington of his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan one day after President Donald Trump started his second term in office. The meeting of the so-called 'Quad,' four countries sharing concerns about China's growing power, will happen at the State Department and is designed to signal that countering Beijing is a top priority for the new president. It could also set the stage for the leaders of the Quad countries to hold a summit relatively early in the Trump presidency, a person involved in the planning meetings said. Trump officials were working on scheduling another gathering of the foreign ministers at the White House as well, a person involved in planning meetings said. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who met her Indian and Japanese counterparts in Washington over the weekend, said the invitation for Quad foreign ministers to attend Trump's inauguration showed a dedication to close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. 'It's a demonstration of the collective commitment of all countries to the Quad, an iron-clad commitment in this time where close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific is so important,' Wong said on Sunday of the foreign ministers' invitation to Washington. Aside from the meeting itself, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who was confirmed on Monday as Trump's top diplomat, is expected to meet separately with the three foreign ministers on Tuesday. The Quad grouping met many times during the administration of former President Joe Biden, with a focus on Beijing's military and economic activities in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the South China Sea where U.S. allies have pushed back against Beijing's territorial claims. The grouping has also pledged to advance cooperation in cybersecurity to protect supply chains and critical infrastructure, including undersea cables. For Australia, it will be important to secure an assurance from Washington about the massive AUKUS defense project, designed to allow Australia to acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines and other advanced weapons such as hypersonic missiles. China has denounced the Quad as a Cold War construct and says the AUKUS alliance would intensify a regional arms race.	https://www.voanews.com/a/quad-foreign-ministers-meet-in-washington-in-signal-of-trump-s-china-focus-/7944516.html	2025-01-21T04:51:16-08:00	
Russia's Putin discusses 'multipolar global order' with China's Xi hours after Trump inauguration	Moscow — Russian President Vladimir Putin had a call Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, emphasizing the two countries' close ties, a day after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. president. The two leaders have developed strong personal links that helped bring relations between Moscow and Beijing, growing even closer after Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. China has become a major customer of Russian oil and gas and a source of key technologies amid sweeping Western sanctions on Moscow. In Tuesday's call with Xi, Putin emphasized that Russia-China relations are based on shared interests, equality and mutual benefits, noting that they 'don't depend on internal political factors and the current international environment.' 'We jointly support the development of a more just multipolar global order and work to ensure indivisible security in Eurasia and the world as a whole,' Putin told Xi in remarks carried by the Russian state TV. 'Joint efforts by Russia and China play an important stabilizing role in global affairs.' Xi similarly praised close cooperation between Moscow and Beijing, saying it helps 'bring positive energy to reforming and developing the global system.' While neither leader directly mentioned Trump in the televised fragment of their call, the timing of the conversation may signal that Putin and Xi want to coordinate their action in dialogue with the new U.S. administration. The Chinese president had a call with Trump on Friday and expressed hope for positive ties with the U.S. Trump had threatened to impose tariffs and other measures against China in his second term, while also hinting at ways in which the two rival powers could cooperate on issues such as regional conflicts and curbing the export of substances used in the production of fentanyl. Putin, who is yet to talk to Trump, congratulated him on taking office in televised remarks during a video call with officials and welcomed his intention to open a dialogue with Moscow. Trump told reporters Monday after taking office that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had told him he wanted to make a peace deal and voiced hope that Putin would follow suit. He added that Putin would be destroying Russia by failing to make a deal, pointing out Russia's economic troubles, including high inflation. Putin hailed Trump's openness to dialogue as he spoke to Russia's Security Council members shortly before the U.S. president's inauguration. 'We hear the statements from Trump and members of his team about their desire to restore direct contact with Russia, which were halted through no fault of ours by the outgoing administration,' Putin said on Monday. 'We also hear his statements about the need to do everything to prevent World War III. We certainly welcome such an approach and congratulate the U.S. president-elect on taking office.' The Russian leader also stressed that dialogue between the two nations should be based on 'equal basis and mutual respect, taking into account the important role our countries play on some key issues on the global agenda, including the strengthening of global stability and security.' Putin also noted that Moscow is open to dialogue with the Trump administration on the conflict in Ukraine, emphasizing the need to respect Russia's interests and adding that 'the most important thing is to remove the root causes of the crisis.' 'As for the settlement of the situation, I would like to underline that its goal should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but a long-term peace based on respect for the legitimate interests of all people, all nations living in this region,' Putin said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-putin-discusses-multipolar-global-order-with-china-s-xi-hours-after-trump-inauguration-/7944498.html	2025-01-21T04:36:25-08:00	
Next release of Gaza hostages set for Saturday, Hamas says	Hamas says it will release another round of hostages on Saturday, as a ceasefire with Israel held into a third day and U.N. humanitarian agencies moved aid into Gaza to help Palestinian civilians. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that the next group of hostages would be four Israeli women, who would be set free in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. With the ceasefire holding Tuesday, but more than five weeks remaining before a second phase would begin, questions remained about how quickly and successfully Israel and Hamas will negotiate the terms of the next phase. U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office Monday after officials from his team and former president Joe Biden’s administration pushed to achieve a ceasefire before the change in power, expressed some doubts about the truce. 'I’m not confident,' Trump told reporters Monday. 'That’s not our war. It’s their war.' Trump said his administration 'might' help with reconstruction efforts in Gaza and compared the territory to a 'massive demolition site.' Fifteen months of war has devastated the Gaza Strip, destroying many of the homes that Palestinians who fled in search of safety hoped to return to with the halt in fighting. The ceasefire has so far included the return of three hostages who had been held in Gaza as well as 90 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 915 aid trucks entered Gaza on Monday. The current conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, with most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/next-release-of-gaza-hostages-set-for-saturday-hamas-says-/7944490.html	2025-01-21T04:13:54-08:00	
Taliban free 2 Americans in prisoner swap with US	Islamabad — Taliban authorities in Afghanistan announced Tuesday the release of two American nationals as part of a prisoner exchange for one of their members, who was held in the United States on narcotics-terrorism charges. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kabul identified the freed Afghan as Khan Mohammad and described him as a 'mujahid,' a term the Taliban use for their fighters. The statement said that the man was arrested nearly two decades ago in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar and subsequently extradited to the U.S., where a federal court convicted him, resulting in his imprisonment for life in California. The de facto Afghan government did not name the two freed American citizens or specify how many had been freed, but relatives and U.S. media reports identified them as Ryan Corbett, 42, and William Wallace McKenty, 69. 'Today, our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan’s life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,' his family stated Tuesday. Limited public information is available about McKenty as his family reportedly requested U.S. authorities to maintain his anonymity. The prisoner exchange was in the making for many months and reportedly occurred during Democratic President Joe Biden’s final hours in office before Republican President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Monday. Corbett's family statement praised both the Trump and Biden administrations for their efforts to facilitate the prisoner exchange. The Taliban said Tuesday that Qatar played an 'effective role' in facilitating their prisoner swap agreement with the United States. U.S. officials and relatives have reported that two other American captives, George Glezmann, a former airline mechanic, and Mahmood Habibi, a naturalized American, remain in Taliban custody in Afghanistan. Habibi and Glezmann were apprehended shortly after a U.S. drone strike in July 2022 killed fugitive al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri in his hideout in an affluent Afghan capital neighborhood. Glezmann, 65, was lawfully visiting Kabul as a tourist when he was seized by the Taliban’s intelligence services without charge, his relatives said. Habibi’s family says he was arrested by the Taliban, along with 30 other employees of the company he worked at, following the U.S. drone strike. While his co-workers were released, Habibi’s whereabouts remain unknown, and Taliban officials have refuted claims that he is in their custody. 'It was our hope that Ryan, George, and Mahmoud would be returned to their families together, and we cannot imagine the pain that our good fortune will bring them,' Corbett’s family stated Tuesday. Habibi's relatives welcomed the reunion of Corbett and McKenty with their families, confident the Trump administration will intensify efforts to secure his freedom from his 'wrongful' detention.

Biden leaves office and Washington after 50 years but says 'we're not leaving the fight'	WASHINGTON — Joe Biden on Monday wrapped up a more than 50-year political career, but promised that 'we're not leaving the fight,' as he bid farewell to the presidency and flew to California to unwind with his family and ease back into private life. Biden spoke not long after watching his successor, Republican President Donald Trump, pledge during his inaugural address to 'completely and totally reverse' everything that his Democratic predecessor did. In the final hours before the noontime transfer of executive power, Biden extended courtesies to the man he had turned out of the Oval Office four years ago. Trump denied losing the 2020 election and refused to offer similar niceties to Biden upon his inauguration in 2021. The bitter cold day opened with Biden and his wife, Jill, receiving Trump, and his wife, Melania, for a traditional Inauguration Day meet-and-greet over tea at the White House. 'Welcome home,' Biden told Trump. Afterward, the rivals, who share a history of political animosity, rode in a limousine to the Capitol where Trump was sworn in as the 47th president. 'Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,' Trump said about the work of the Biden administration. Biden sat expressionless in the front row. As Trump gave his address, the residence staff at the White House got to work clearing out the remainder of Biden's belongings so they could move Trump and his family back in. The work of turning over the White House includes redecorating the Oval Office. Walls in the press offices that were bare in the morning after most of the staff had ended their government service were decorated by midafternoon with fresh photographs of Trump. After Trump's address, the new president and his wife walked the Bidens outside to a Marine helicopter that had been waiting on the Capitol grounds to fly them to Joint Base Andrews for a farewell event with his staff. 'We couldn't have done anything we did without you,' Biden told those who worked for his administration in the White House. 'No president gets to choose the moment they enter history, but they get to choose the team they enter history with, and we chose the best damn team in the world.' Even though they may feel 'knocked down' by the turn of events, he said what was important was how quickly they get back up. 'We're leaving office. We're not leaving the fight,' Biden said, urging them to stay engaged. And he appeared to joke about Trump's speech, chuckling as he said, 'we heard the inaugural address today. We got a lot more to do.' Biden then made the sign of the cross and everyone laughed. He and the first lady then walked across the tarmac to the familiar blue-and-white Air Force plane he flew on as president for the flight to Santa Ynez, California.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-leaves-office-and-washington-after-50-years-but-says-we-re-not-leaving-the-fight-/7944438.html	2025-01-21T02:37:02-08:00	
China's population falls for a third straight year, posing challenges	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China's population fell last year for the third straight year, its government said Friday, pointing to further demographic challenges for the world's second most populous nation, which is now facing both an aging population and an emerging shortage of working age people. China's population stood at 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year. The figures announced by the government in Beijing follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet. China three years ago joined Japan and most of Eastern Europe among other nations whose population is falling. The reasons are in many cases similar: Rising costs of living are causing young people to put off or rule out marriage and childbirth while pursuing higher education and careers. While people are living longer, that's not enough to keep up with rate of new births. Countries such as China that allow very little immigration are especially at risk. China has long been among the world’s most populous nations, enduring invasions, floods and other natural disasters to sustain a population that thrived on rice in the south and wheat in the north. Following the end of World War II and the Communist Party’s rise to power in 1949, large families reemerged and the population doubled in just three decades, even after tens of millions died in the Great Leap Forward that sought to revolutionize agriculture and industry and the Cultural Revolution that followed a few years later. After the end of the Cultural Revolution and leader Mao Zedong's death, Communist bureaucrats began to worry the country’s population was outstripping its ability to feed itself and began implementing a draconian 'one child policy.' Though it was never law, women had to apply for permission to have a child and violators could face forced late-term abortions and birth control procedures, massive fines and the prospect of their child being deprived an identification number, effectively making them non-citizens. Rural China, where the preference for male offspring was especially strong and two children were still ostensibly allowed, became the focus of government efforts, with women forced to present evidence they were menstruating and buildings emblazoned with slogans such as 'have fewer children, have better children.' The government sought to stamp out selective abortion of female children, but with abortions legal and readily available, those operating illicit sonogram machines enjoyed a thriving business. That has been the biggest factor in China’s lopsided sex ratio, with as many as millions more boys born, raising the possibility of social instability among China’s army of bachelors. Friday’s report gave the sex imbalance as 104.34 men to every 100 women, though independent groups give the imbalance as considerably higher. More disturbing for the government was the drastically falling birthrate, with China’s total population dropping for the first time in decades in 2022 and China being narrowly overtaken by India as the world’s most populous nation the following year. A rapidly aging population, declining workforce, lack of consumer markets and migration abroad are putting the system under severe pressure. While spending on the military and flashy infrastructure projects continues to rise, China’s already frail social security system is teetering, with increasing numbers of Chinese refusing to pay into the underfunded pension system. Already, more than one-fifth of the population is aged 60 or over, with the official figure given as 310.3 million or 22% of the total population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 30%, sparking discussion of changes to the official retirement age, which is one of the lowest in the world. With fewer students, some vacant schools and kindergartens are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people. Such developments are giving some credence to the aphorism that China, now the world’s second largest economy but facing major headwinds, will 'grow old before it grows rich.' Government inducements, including cash payouts for having up to three children and financial help with housing costs, have had only temporary effects. Meanwhile, China continued its transition to an urban society, with 10 million more people moving to cities for an urbanization rate of 67%, up almost a percentage point from the previous year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-population-falls-for-a-third-straight-year-posing-challenges/7944431.html	2025-01-21T02:16:49-08:00	
Firefighters brace for ‘dangerous’ windy, dry conditions in southern California	Fire authorities in southern California positioned crews and equipment ready to respond Tuesday to new wildfires as forecasters warned of dangerous fire conditions featuring dry air and strong winds. The National Weather Service said the particular window of concern was through late morning Tuesday, with the possibility of wind gusts reaching 160 kilometers per hour in areas to the north and northwest of downtown Los Angeles. 'Everyone needs to be on high alert,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Monday. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) spokesperson Brice Bennett said in a statement Monday that his agency — with help from federal, local and tribal firefighting agencies — have more than 2,500 people and has prepositioned equipment for quick deployment to combat any new outbreaks. At least 27 people have died in a series of wildfires across the Los Angeles area during the past two weeks as Santa Ana winds mixed with dry conditions on the ground to quickly spread blazes. The two largest fires are still burning, including the Palisades Fire near the coast on the western side of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the foothills to the north of the city. The Palisades Fire was 61% contained and has burned about 96 square kilometers, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton Fire was 87% contained after burning 57 square kilometers. Together, the fires have destroyed 14,000 structures since Jan. 7. California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Monday designed to protect Southern California residents from landslides and flooding. The order suspends some rules and regulations and speeds up the removal of debris that, if not removed promptly, could result in landslides, mudslides and flash floods. 'This order helps keep our emergency response focused on protecting communities, not permits and paperwork,' Newsom said.

Fire at ski resort in Turkey leaves 10 dead, 32 hurt	ANKARA, Turkey — A fire at a ski resort hotel overnight killed at least 10 people and injured 32 others in northwestern Turkey, authorities said on Tuesday, as TV footage showed crews fighting flames and smoke that engulfed the 11-story building. The blaze began on the restaurant floor of the hotel at Bolu's Kartalkaya ski resort at around 3:30 a.m. local time, Bolu Governor Abdulaziz Aydin told state broadcaster TRT. He said there were 234 guests at the Grand Kartal Hotel, which has a broad wooden exterior. The fire comes at the beginning of a nationwide two-week school holiday, a time when skiers from nearby Istanbul and Ankara usually head to the Bolu mountains. TV footage showed several fire engines surrounding the charred hotel at the base of the ski slopes, with white bed sheets tied together and dangling from one upper-floor window. The death toll had risen to 10, with 32 injured, from an earlier lower count, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X, adding more than 250 first responders attended to the incident. Investigators were looking into what caused the blaze, authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fire-at-ski-resort-in-turkey-leaves-10-dead-32-hurt/7944410.html	2025-01-21T01:10:14-08:00	
Ukrainian officials say Russian drones damaged residential buildings	Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russian drone attacks damaged residential buildings in several parts of central and southern Ukraine. The attacks were part of an assault that Ukraine’s military said involved 131 Russian drones and four ballistic missiles. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 72 of the drones, the air force said. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysask said on Telegram that Russian attacks damaged houses and a warehouse, injuring one person. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets reported Tuesday that falling drone fragments damaged four residential buildings, a school, a shop and a power line. Poltava Governor Filip Pronin said on Telegram that a drone fell on a house in his region, sparking a fire, while pieces of destroyed drones damaged six residential buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed 55 Ukrainian aerial drones, mostly in regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Russian air defenses knocked down 22 of the drones over Bryansk, 12 drones over Rostov and 10 over the Smolensk region, the ministry said. Other intercepts took place over Voronezh, Saratov and Kursk. Smolensk Govenror Vasily Anokhin said on Telegram that drone debris damaged several residential buildings, while Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a drone attack on a car injured two people.

Tens of thousands defy frigid weather for Trump’s inauguration	It’s been a long day in Washington, filled with tradition and some out-of-the-ordinary events as the United States swears in its 47th president. VOA’s Senior Washington Correspondent Carolyn Presutti brings us the sights and sounds from Inauguration Day 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-defy-frigid-weather-for-trump-s-inauguration-/7944389.html	2025-01-21T00:26:45-08:00	
Trump orders include withdrawing from WHO, halting US foreign aid	U.S. President Donald Trump issued a series of executive actions after taking office Monday, including moving to withdrawal from international health and climate bodies and directing a suspension of U.S. foreign aid. A set of orders focused on immigration, such as declaring an emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border, ending asylum and halting birthright citizenship for some children born in the United States. Trump also ordered vetting and screening 'to the maximum degree possible' all those who want to enter the United States, and for the government to identify countries that may have screening procedures deficient enough to warrant blocking their nationals from entering the United States. In his first term in office, Trump pursued an 'America First' form of foreign policy, and an order he signed Monday directs new Secretary of State Marco Rubio to focus State Department efforts on that mission. 'From this day forward, the foreign policy of the United States shall champion core American interests and always put America and American citizens first,' the order said. Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate accord, a repeat of a move he also made in his first term. Trump said the U.S. has a successful record of 'advancing both economic and environmental objectives' that should be a model to other countries. Nearly 200 countries signed the agreement aimed at limiting global warming with each country providing its own plan for limiting greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. In another repeat from his first time in office, Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organization due to complaints that the agency mismanaged the COVID-19 pandemic and gets too much funding from the U.S. Calling U.S. foreign aid 'not aligned with American interests,' Trump issued an order to pause foreign development assistance for 90 days and for the programs to undergo reviews. Funding for many programs has already been appropriated by Congress, so it was not clear how much aid would be initially affected by the order. Trump also reversed an order signed by former President Joe Biden last week that had removed Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terror. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel responded to Trump’s move Monday by calling it 'an act of arrogance and disregard for the truth.' On trade, Trump issued an order calling for a review of a number of trade agreements, including one with China and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He also specifically called for an assessment of 'unlawful migration and fentanyl flows' from Canada, Mexico and China. Ahead of taking office, Trump said those countries would need to act on those areas in order to avoid tariffs on goods sent to the United States. In response to a law passed during Biden’s term that would have blocked TikTok in the United States in connection with national security concerns, Trump signed an order telling the Justice Department not to enforce that ban until his administration can 'determine the appropriate course forward.' The law directed a TikTok ban unless its China-based parent company sold it to an approved buyer. U.S. officials promoting the ban expressed concerns that the Chinese government could obtain Americans’ digital data. Trump himself tried to carry out a similar ban during his first term, but in recent weeks has championed keeping TikTok available to U.S. users, including the potential for the U.S. government to acquire a stake in the company.

Trump supporters celebrate pardon of Jan. 6 rioters	WASHINGTON — The atmosphere was celebratory outside the Central Detention Facility prison in Washington late Monday night. Just hours after taking the oath of office, U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned about 1,500 people who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, during which Trump supporters tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Many of them were held in the Central Detention Facility in southeast Washington. Despite the frigid cold, their supporters gathered outside the building, looking forward to what they told VOA they hoped would be their speedy release. As of publication, that release had not happened yet. The police presence outside the prison was substantial throughout the night. So, too, was the media presence. And even though supporters at one point briefly rushed the prison entrance, only to be blocked by police, they still told VOA that the gathering was joyous and patriotic. While brandishing an American flag, Ben Pollock told VOA that two of his children — Olivia and Jonathan — were jailed for taking part in the attack. He said he himself was present that day, too, but that he didn’t enter the Capitol Building. Pollock, from Florida, said he was 'ecstatic, praising God' that his children would be released soon. 'It’s been such a spiritual journey.' Former fugitives Olivia and Jonathan Pollock are charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, as well as theft of government property, according to media reports. The latter is accused of grabbing an officer by the waist and pulling the officer down a set of stairs, and punching another officer in the face. Their father cried as he talked about Jan. 6 — not because he regretted that day, which he didn’t, but because he said he felt so deeply that those who were jailed for participating in the attack had been unfairly prosecuted. 'It’s broken my heart for four years. I’ve cried and cried and cried over these families,' Pollock said. 'Today is their day of freedom.' Pollock and others who spoke with VOA said they felt like Trump’s executive order meant that they were finally getting vindication for Jan. 6. For them, Trump’s pardon confirmed their belief that the 2020 election was rigged, they told VOA. It also represented the fulfillment of a promise that Trump had made during his campaign to absolve those who took part in the attack, they said. Numerous reports and investigations have shown that the 2020 election was not stolen. Election officials have confirmed the election was secure, and Trump and his allies have failed to produce any evidence to substantiate the allegations of fraud. Despite the evidence that the election was not stolen, several people outside the prison told VOA that Trump’s pardon reinforced their belief that it actually had been. 'The election was stolen. We all see it. The whole world saw it,' Stephanie Liu, from New York told VOA. Liu, who was present at the Capitol on Jan. 6, said she has come to the prison every month for the past two-and-a-half years to visit the imprisoned Jan. 6 rioters. 'Political prisoners should not exist in this country,' said Liu, who is originally from China. Helena Gibson, from the U.S. capital, made a similar point: 'This has been four long years of these Jan. 6 political hostages.' That language echoes Trump, who calls those who stormed the Capitol 'hostages' and 'unbelievable patriots.' One day after the attack, Trump said that 'those who broke the law' during the riot would 'pay.' But defending them ended up becoming a significant component of his 2024 presidential campaign. Tom Jeffries, from Virginia, said he was 'somewhat disappointed' that Trump didn’t mention the Jan. 6 defendants during his inaugural address. 'But knowing him, I knew that he hadn’t forgotten about it. He was waiting for the right time to do it,' Jeffries told VOA. 'That was my hope, and God granted my wish.' Trump’s decision to pardon those who took part in the attack was met with swift condemnation from Democrat lawmakers like Senator Chris Murphy. By pardoning the rioters, 'Trump has transformed American democracy,' Murphy said in a post on X. 'Political violence is now mainstream.' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also said those who invaded the Capitol should not have been pardoned. 'Trump is ushering in a Golden Age for people that break the law and attempt to overthrow the government,' Schumer said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-supporters-celebrate-pardon-of-jan-6-rioters-/7944388.html	2025-01-20T23:41:56-08:00	
Starry Sundance fest moves ahead in wake of LA fires	Los Angeles — The U.S. film industry's first big gathering since fires devastated Los Angeles will begin Thursday at the Sundance festival, where highlights include a glitzy new Jennifer Lopez musical and a dark Benedict Cumberbatch drama. Hollywood's annual pilgrimage to the Rocky Mountains to premiere the coming year's most-anticipated indie films is taking place in somber circumstances, after the blazes that killed at least 27 people and brought the entertainment capital to a halt. Festival chiefs held lengthy talks with filmmakers, including those 'who lost homes or were displaced' by the blazes, before deciding to press ahead, said Sundance director Eugene Hernandez. Organizers heard 'harrowing stories of people running out of their homes, evacuating... with their hard drives under their arms' to ensure their films survived, he told AFP. 'Everybody to a person just wants to look forward and wants to look ahead... it'll be a nice moment of reunion and community.' Among the 88 features being screened in Utah's Park City is 'Rebuilding,' about a rancher who loses everything in a wildfire. 'It takes on an added poignance, for those who will watch it next week,' said Hernandez. Josh O'Connor, known for 'The Crown' and 'Challengers,' plays the lead role. 'It's an incredible film, and one that we felt was important to show, based on that spirit of resilience,' said Sundance programming director Kim Yutani. 'I think it will be a particularly moving one for people to see.' J-Lo, Cumberbatch A-lister Lopez brings her first film to Sundance, with 'Kiss of the Spider Woman.' From 'Dreamgirls' director Bill Condon, the film is based on the Broadway adaptation of Argentine author Manuel Puig's famous novel. Lopez plays Aurora, a silver-screen diva whose life and roles are discussed by two mismatched prisoners as they form an unlikely bond in their grim cell. While harking back to grand Golden Age Hollywood musicals with its fabulous costumes and Lopez's 'knockout musical performance,' the film is a more dramatic and independent take on the genre, said Hernandez. Cumberbatch stars in another literary adaptation, 'The Thing With Feathers,' based on Max Porter's experimental and poetic novel about a grieving husband and two young sons. 'It's one of these juicy roles that big actors relish taking a bite out of,' said Yutani. Family tragedy and fatherhood are also the themes of 'Omaha,' with John Magaro ('Past Lives') delivering 'an emotional gut punch of a role' that could spell awards, according to Yutani. Elsewhere, Olivia Colman plays a mother taking her non-binary teen to visit their gay grandfather (John Lithgow) in 'Jimpa.' Rapper A$AP Rocky and late-night host Conan O'Brien make up the eclectic cast of mystery 'If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.' And 'The Bear' star Ayo Edebiri teams up with John Malkovich for thriller 'Opus,' about a young writer investigating the mysterious disappearance of a legendary pop star. Music, politics Music is also a prominent theme of Sundance's documentary selection, which has launched several of the most recent Oscar-winning non-fiction films. A new 'must-see' Jeff Buckley documentary features never-before-seen footage from 'three very important women in his life, including his mother,' said Yutani. Elegance Bratton explores the Chicago roots of house music with 'Move Ya Body: The Birth of House,' while Oscar-winning director Questlove examines funk pioneer Sly Stone in 'Sly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black Genius).' Politics will again be prominent. Former New Zealand leader Jacinda Ardern is expected in town to promote behind-the-scenes documentary 'Prime Minister.' 'The Jinx' director Andrew Jarecki explores violence and corruption in the U.S. prison system with 'The Alabama Solution.' And, days after the Gaza ceasefire agreement took effect, Palestinian-American director Cherien Dabis will unveil her 'groundbreaking' new film 'All That's Left of You,' which has been given a highly prominent Saturday evening premiere at Sundance's biggest venue. 'That is not an accident. This is a really special one,' said Yutani. 'I have not seen a film about a Palestinian family told in quite this way.' The 2025 Sundance Film Festival runs from Jan. 23 through Feb. 2.	https://www.voanews.com/a/starry-sundance-fest-moves-ahead-in-wake-of-la-fires-/7944385.html	2025-01-20T23:28:54-08:00	
China, EU, Ukraine leaders take Davos stage under Trump shadow	Davos, Switzerland — With Donald Trump back as US president with his confrontational style, Chinese, European and Ukrainian leaders are expected to defend global cooperation on Tuesday at the annual gathering of the world's elites in Davos. There will no doubt be a Trump-sized elephant in the rooms at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Swiss Alpine resort. even if some leaders avoid saying his name -- although the man will speak himself by video link on Thursday. Trump returned to the White House on Monday, bringing with him a more protectionist administration and fears he will deliver on promises to slap heavy tariffs on China and U.S. allies including Canada and the European Union. In his inaugural address, he vowed Washington will 'tariff and tax foreign countries.' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will kick the day off. She appeared, in a post on X as she arrived in Davos, to give a taste of what to expect, defending the 'need to work together to avoid a global race to the bottom' and wanting to 'forge new partnerships.' China, Ukraine China's Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang -- also a member of the Chinese Communist Party's apex of power that rules the country -- will speak immediately after von der Leyen. China is taking a cautious approach to Trump. After Chinese President Xi Jinping's conversation with Trump by phone on Friday, he said he hoped for a 'good start' to relations with the new administration. Although Trump said he would undertake sweeping trade penalties against China, he has also indicated he wants to improve ties -- and even stepped in to reverse a U.S. ban of Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok on national security grounds. Ukraine meanwhile is keeping a very close eye on what Trump's second mandate will involve. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to call on world leaders and company executives to maintain -- and even ramp up -- their support for his country's fight against Russia. Zelenskyy on Monday said he is hopeful Trump will help achieve a 'just peace.' European 'struggle' Europeans are set to dominate the forum’s key speeches here on Tuesday. Embattled German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will address the forum, likely his last as leader ahead of elections next month. Also speaking on Tuesday will be conservative leader Friedrich Merz, the favorite to succeed him as German chancellor. Europeans are fretting the most about Trump's return while countries from Brazil to China and India to Turkey believe he will be good for their countries and global peace, according to a survey last week from the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). The report accompanying the survey of over 28,500 people across 24 countries serves as a warning for European leaders to act cautiously. 'Europeans will struggle to find internal unity or global power in leading an outright resistance to the new administration,' the ECFR report's authors said. 'Better understand' Trump Middle East conflicts will also be high on the agenda as Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani speak in separate sessions during the first full day of the forum. As a fragile ceasefire holds in the Israel-Hamas war, the forum will host a discussion on how to improve aid delivery to the Palestinian territory of Gaza and how to kickstart the reconstruction and recovery after heavy bombardment. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will also deliver a special address on Tuesday, as the African continent's most industrialized country shows it is open for business. Despite suggestions Trump's return would overshadow the forum that began on the same day as his inauguration in Washington, WEF President Borge Brende said the president had brought fresh interest to the gathering. 'It has increased the interest in Davos because people feel they need to come together to better understand what's on its way,' Brende told AFP in an interview.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-eu-ukraine-leaders-take-davos-stage-under-trump-shadow/7944381.html	2025-01-20T23:16:20-08:00	
Malaysia seeks gag order on talk of jailed ex-PM's bid to reveal royal document	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia's attorney general's office is seeking a gag order to ban public discussion of former Prime Minister Najib Razak's judicial review claim that a document exists allowing him to serve his remaining prison sentence under house arrest, according to state news agency Bernama. Najib, jailed for his role in the multi-billion dollar 1MDB scandal, is pursuing a legal bid to compel authorities to confirm the existence of, and execute, an 'addendum order' that he said was issued last year as part of a pardon by then-King Al-Sultan Abdullah Ahmad Shah, entitling him to serve the remainder of his sentence at home. The issue has caused a huge stir in Malaysia, with disgraced political heavyweight Najib insisting the former king's addendum order was ignored by authorities when they announced the halving of his sentence last year. The former king's palace has issued a letter saying the document does exist. Yet Malaysia's law ministry said it has no record of it, its home minister has denied knowledge, and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has said 'we did not hide anything.' Bernama on Monday quoted Shamsul Bolhassan, deputy chief of the chambers' civil division, as saying the gag order request had been filed to a court. The official had previously said the case touched on sensitive issues, according to Bernama. Najib was found guilty in 2020 of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power for illegally receiving funds misappropriated from a unit of state investor 1Malaysia Development Berhad. He is on trial for corruption in several other 1MDB-linked cases and denies wrongdoing. Najib this month hailed as 'one step forward' the Court of Appeal's decision to overturn the dismissal of his attempt to access the document. The case will go back to court to be heard by another judge.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-seeks-gag-order-on-talk-of-jailed-ex-pm-s-bid-to-reveal-royal-document-/7944376.html	2025-01-20T22:57:55-08:00	
Trump issues sweeping pardon of 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday pardoned more than 1,500 of his supporters charged with crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including people who assaulted police, using his clemency powers on his first day in office to dismantle the largest investigation and prosecution in Justice Department history. Among those set to be released from prison are defendants captured on camera committing violent attacks on law enforcement as lawmakers met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. Leaders of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys extremist groups convicted of seditious conspiracy in the most serious cases brought by the Justice Department will also be freed from prison after having their sentences commuted. Trump is directing the attorney general to seek the dismissal of about 450 pending Jan. 6 cases. The pardons were expected after Trump's yearslong campaign to rewrite the history of the Jan. 6 attack that left more than 100 police officers injured and threatened the peaceful transfer of power. Yet the scope of the clemency still comes as a massive blow to the Justice Department's effort to hold participants accountable over what has been described as one of the darkest days in American history. Trump had suggested in the weeks leading up to his return to the White House that instead of blanket pardons he was going to look at the Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis. Vice President JD Vance had said just days ago that people responsible for the violence during the Capitol riot 'obviously' should not be pardoned. Casting the rioters as 'patriots' and 'hostages,' Trump has claimed they were unfairly treated by the Justice Department that also charged him with federal crimes in two cases he contends were politically motivated. Trump said the pardons end 'a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.' An attorney for Enrique Tarrio, the former national chairman of the Proud Boys who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy, said he expects his client to be released from prison Monday night. Tarrio, who was convicted of orchestrating a failed plot to keep Donald Trump in power after the Republican lost the 2020 election, is serving the longest sentence of any of the Jan. 6 defendants. The pardons come weeks after Trump's own Jan. 6 case was dismissed because of the Justice Department's policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants who didn't engage in any of the violence and destruction were charged with misdemeanor trespassing offenses, and many of those served little to no time behind bars. But the violence that day has been documented extensively through videos, testimony and other evidence showing rioters — some armed with poles, bats and bear spray — swarming the Capitol, quickly overrunning overwhelmed police, shattering windows and sending lawmakers and aides running into hiding. Police were dragged into the crowd and beaten. One officer screamed in pain as he was crushed in a doorframe, and another suffered a heart attack after a rioter pressed a stun gun against his neck and repeatedly shocked him. Officers have described in testimony fearing for their lives as members of the mob hurled insults and obscenities at them. Of the more than 1,500 people charged, about 250 people have been convicted of crimes by a judge or a jury after a trial. At least 1,020 had pleaded guilty to crimes as of Jan. 1. Only two people were acquitted of all charges by judges after bench trials. No jury has fully acquitted a Capitol riot defendant. More than 1,000 rioters have already been sentenced, with over 700 receiving at least some time behind bars. The rest were given some combination of probation, community service, home detention or fines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-issues-sweeping-pardon-of-1-500-jan-6-defendants/7944356.html	2025-01-20T21:38:13-08:00	
Trump lays out vision on first day of second term	President Donald Trump got right to work upon his return to the White House on Monday, announcing numerous executive actions on top-line issues like immigration and energy development and, in his inaugural address, promising to expand U.S territory – all the way, he said, to Mars. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lays-out-vision-on-first-day-of-second-term/7944343.html	2025-01-20T21:08:49-08:00	
In day steeped with tradition, Donald Trump is sworn in	WASHINGTON — Amid frigid temperatures in the nation’s capital, the peaceful transfer of power from one presidential administration to the next took place Monday. The inauguration events, starting with a church service and culminating in an oath and inaugural speech at the Capitol building, were attended by former presidents and their families, foreign dignitaries, and tech billionaires. Members of the 'press pool' — a group of reporters, photographers and video journalists — were on hand to capture the day’s events for the media outlets that make up the White House Correspondents' Association. Through the press pool, accredited journalists take turns covering the president’s daily activities to ensure 24-7 coverage of the American leader. VOA White House correspondent Misha Komadovsky was assigned to Monday morning’s inaugural events. 'Today, I’ll be your eyes and ears during the first steps of Donald Trump’s inauguration,' Komadovsky emailed at around 8 a.m. local time as part of his assignments. The pool report had noted that the inaugural events were to follow a traditional course: a morning church service and a meeting between the outgoing and incoming first families before traveling to the inauguration. The service at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Lafayette Park across from the White House has been a part of inauguration events since 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt attended a service before being sworn in as the 32nd president. Trump, as the 47th U.S. president, followed in his predecessors’ footsteps. He and first lady Melania Trump sat in the front row of the church, alongside his vice president, JD Vance, and second lady Usha Vance. Melania Trump wore a navy suit by New York-based designer Adam Lippes, paired with a wide-brimmed hat by American designer, Eric Javits. Dressing the first lady was an honor, Javits said, adding that his background in art has informed his ability to bring 'harmony and balance to the face' with his designs. In Melania Trump’s case, he told the AP, the designing was not difficult because the first lady is 'blessed with great bone structure, beauty and a wonderful sense of style.' Also attending Monday’s service — which took place the same day that the U.S. marks Martin Luther King Jr. Day — were members of the Trump family, including his children Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany and Barron Trump. Individuals whom the president has nominated for key roles in his administration also filled the pews, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Pete Hegseth, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel and Marco Rubio. Foreign dignitaries were also present. Leaders seen by the press pool included President Javier Milei of Argentina, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, and Britain’s former Conservative Party prime minister Boris Johnson. Some of the world’s richest individuals were also there, including Elon Musk of Tesla, social media platform X, and SpaceX; Apple CEO Tim Cook; and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew attended the service, as did media personality Tucker Carlson. TikTok had briefly gone offline Saturday evening following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding a law ordering the Chinese social media platform to sell to an American owner. Trump indicated he planned a 'joint venture' to allow TikTok to operate. Service was restored on Sunday, with a message to users that said that 'as a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.' Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who earlier this month was held in contempt of court twice over a defamation case stemming from Trump’s failed 2020 election, was also spotted at the service. Giuliani last Thursday settled the $148 million defamation judgment granted to two election workers in the U.S. state of Georgia. During Monday’s 25-minute church service, the choir sang 'America the Beautiful.' After the service concluded, Trump walked down the aisle, greeting guests along the way. He was seen patting Milei of Argentina on the shoulder. Next, keeping with tradition, outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden met with the incoming president and first lady at the White House. The First Families shared tea in the White House Blue Room before departing together for the U.S. Capitol. Because of extreme cold weather, the inauguration was held inside the Capitol rotunda, with music from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Combined Choir and the U.S. Marine Band. Opera singer Christopher D. Macchio sang 'Oh, America!' and singer Carrie Underwood performed 'America the Beautiful' with the Armed Forces Chorus and U.S. Naval Academy Glee Club. Former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were on hand for the inauguration, along with many members of the church service congregation and the Trump family, as faith leaders offered prayers. Tech billionaires including Musk, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were spotted at the inauguration, alongside the president’s supporters and U.S. lawmakers. Chief Justice John Roberts swore in the 47th president, on a Bible held by Melania Trump. The president was flanked by his children. Following the oath of office, a luncheon took place, followed by a military troop review and parade. As the ceremonial swearing in took place, new staffers at the White House were seen moving into their new offices and unpacking images of the president and first lady.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-day-steeped-with-tradition-donald-trump-is-sworn-in/7944323.html	2025-01-20T19:56:46-08:00	
Trump lays out vision on first day of second term	White House — On the historic first day of his second term in office, President Donald Trump laid out his vision for a bolder — and larger — United States. 'The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons,' he said in his inaugural address Monday. 'And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.' Then he got to work signing a stack of executive orders. He said they included a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border that would allow the deployment of troops, and a national energy emergency that would allow more domestic oil and gas extraction. He also declared that there are only two genders, male and female, and said he would order that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed the Gulf of America. Historians say that Trump made history on his second Day 1 by using what is historically a unifying speech to portray a future that many Americans may disagree with. 'Donald Trump did not do that. This was one of the most partisan presidential inaugural speeches — it was less an inaugural speech and more a State of the Union. He just listed a series of bullet points of projects he wanted to undertake, from deporting immigrants to seizing back the Panama Canal,' said Jeremi Suri, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin. Shortly after his inaugural speech, Trump spoke to a smaller group of supporters at the Capitol and reiterated claims that the 2020 election was 'totally rigged' — a claim without proof. He also pardoned some of those convicted over the violent events of Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters attempted to disrupt the certification of the election Trump lost. 'I think this was a better speech than the one I made upstairs, OK?' Trump said. Some of Trump's powerful supporters expressed their joy. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was among the billionaires who packed into the Capitol for the ceremony and hailed Trump's victory. After Trump was sworn in, Musk took to the stage of the rally at Capital One Arena to praise him. 'This was no ordinary victory,' he said. 'This was a fork in the road of human civilization.' Consumer advocacy groups are sounding alarms about some of the new president's quieter moves, ones they say seek to loosen regulations and benefit the extremely wealthy. 'When we think about why the incoming Trump administration wants to freeze regulations and halt public protections wholesale, it is at the behest of the wealthiest among us, corporate special interests,' said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen. 'They are who benefits when we don't have guardrails on the books.' Trump did not, on Monday, directly address foreign policy concerns such as Ukraine and competition with China — but Suri said his expansionist rhetoric sent a message. 'It's hard for the United States to tell [Russian President] Vladimir Putin or [Chinese President] Xi Jinping that they should not seek expansion when our president is talking about expansion, but insofar as we don't follow through on that rhetoric, we still are on very strong ground to say that invading your neighbor, as Putin has in Ukraine, or as China might potentially do in Taiwan, that is verboten, that crosses the line, so long as it's just words from us,' he said. 'If we were to go to war to try to seize the Panama Canal, that would certainly give a kind of carte blanche to Putin and Xi Jinping, because they make the same arguments for Ukraine and Taiwan.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lays-out-vision-on-first-day-of-second-term/7944313.html	2025-01-20T19:05:41-08:00	
Trump’s executive orders on immigration focus on border security, asylum restrictions, deportations	WASHINGTON — On the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump announced a series of executive actions addressing immigration and border security. Trump signed orders his officials called 'common-sense immigration policies.' These include declaring a national emergency at the U.S. southern border, deploying armed forces, border wall construction, ending asylum and ending birthright citizenship to some children born in the U.S., among others. During his inaugural address, Trump said, 'We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or more importantly, its own people.' In a call with reporters earlier in the day, Trump officials outlined the administration's plans to tackle what it describes as a 'national security and public safety crisis' at the U.S.-Mexico border. 'President Trump was elected by a resounding mandate to carry out the promises he made on the campaign trail, that includes his pledge to secure the southern border and carry out the largest deportation of migrant criminals in history,' an incoming White House official said, speaking on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous. Officials also emphasized the administration's commitment to implement what they call the largest deportation of migrant criminals in U.S. history. Here are some of the administration’s plans. National emergency at the border Trump said he will deploy the military to the U.S.-Mexico border, including the National Guard, to assist existing law enforcement officers. Officials emphasized that border security is national security, and the administration is committed to securing the border through use of the military. 'What this action does is it deploys armed forces [and] erects physical barriers by directing [Department of Defense] and [Department of Homeland Security] secretaries to finish the wall along the border. … We're going to reinstate the Remain in Mexico [policy],' the official said. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, wrote on X that without Mexico’s permission, the promise to bring back Remain in Mexico is 'just words on a paper.' The Remain in Mexico policy, created during the first Trump administration, requires some asylum-seekers at the southern border to wait in Mexico until their hearings in U.S. immigration court. Juan Ramon de la Fuente, Mexico's secretary of external relations, said in a news conference Monday morning that if 'they reinstate [Remain in Mexico], this is something we don’t agree with. We have a different focus. We want to adjust it. ... The desire is to keep the same policies as now.' When asked about the number of troops expected to be deployed to the border, Trump administration officials said that decision would ultimately be made by the secretary of defense. The administration is also rescinding the Biden administration border policies by giving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents expanded enforcement authority and establishing federal task forces to work with state and local law enforcement in deportation efforts. Mass deportations Another announcement centers on undocumented immigrants across the country. The Republican president repeatedly promised during his campaign to carry out mass deportations, targeting at least 11 million undocumented individuals. In the press call with reporters, the Trump officials said the administration will provide immigration officers with the necessary 'authorities' to enforce existing laws. In his campaign, Trump vowed to eliminate President Joe Biden's deportation priorities, which targeted individuals with criminal records and those considered national security threats, and instead to expand enforcement to include all undocumented immigrants. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School, wrote in an email to VOA that mass deportation efforts and raids may get the most attention, but deportations will not increase rapidly right away. 'If a person already has an outstanding order of deportation, they can be deported immediately. But that is a relatively small number. Most people picked up will be put into deportation proceedings in immigration courts. Those courts already have a backlog of over 3.8 million cases. Given that backlog, it will be years before many people will find out whether they will be deported or allowed to stay based on asylum or some other form of protection,' he wrote. Release of migrants The incoming administration also announced an end to the practice of releasing migrants into the U.S. while they await their immigration court hearings, commonly known as 'catch-and-release.' The Trump officials did not explain how they would handle an increase in immigrant detention. Refugee program Trump is also ending the refugee resettlement program. During his first administration, he progressively lowered the annual ceiling for refugee admissions to a historic low of 15,000 for fiscal 2021. Refugee advocates said at the time the reductions marked a departure from the United States’ long-standing role in global refugee resettlement. Erol Kekic, senior vice president of programs at Church World Service, wrote in an email to reporters that his group is urging President Trump to reconsider. Church World Service is one of the nine national refugee resettlement agencies authorized by the federal government to assist refugees in starting new lives. 'Even a brief pause in the program can have a devastating impact; on those displaced by violence and persecution, families separated by oceans and continents, and our communities who embrace the spirit of welcome inherent to our great nation,' he wrote. Ending asylum and CBP One app One of Trump’s orders calls for the immediate deportation of migrants who crossed the border illegally without a chance to plead their case to an asylum officer. Shortly after Trump's inauguration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a notice on its website saying the agency was no longer using the CBP One app, which had facilitated the legal entry of nearly 1 million people into the United States with eligibility to work. The app allowed migrants to apply for an appointment to come to the border and apply for humanitarian parole or other forms of legal processing. The use of parole under the CBP One system was part of the Biden administration's broader efforts to manage migration flows and provide legal pathways to entry, rather than having individuals cross the border illegally. However, parole granted through CBP One did not guarantee permanent legal status; it typically allowed individuals to stay temporarily and, in some cases, apply for work authorization while their immigration status was being reviewed. The notice by the CBP One app also confirmed that all existing appointments had been canceled. Birthright citizenship Finally, Trump signed an order to eliminate birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship grants automatic U.S. citizenship to anyone born on American soil, a right established by the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The new administration's actions are expected to face significant legal and political challenges, with immigrant advocacy groups voicing concerns over the implications of these policies. The ACLU of Northern California, a nonprofit organization in the United States dedicated to defending individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and laws, wrote in an email to the press they 'stand ready.' 'We are ready to do so again, from day one of the second Trump administration. … We will defend immigrants’ rights to due process in the face of mass deportations,' the email read.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-executive-orders-on-immigration-focus-on-border-security-asylum-restrictions-deportations/7944289.html	2025-01-20T18:15:22-08:00	
Senate confirms Rubio as secretary of state, Trump's first Cabinet member	WASHINGTON — The Senate quickly confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of state on Monday, voting unanimously to give President Donald Trump the first member of his new Cabinet on Inauguration Day. Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, is among the least controversial of Trump's nominees, and the vote was a decisive 99-0. Another pick, John Ratcliffe for CIA director, is also expected to have a swift vote. Action on others, including former combat veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, is expected later in the week. 'Marco Rubio is a very intelligent man with a remarkable understanding of American foreign policy,' Senator Chuck Grassley, the senior-most Republican, said as the chamber opened. It's often tradition for the Senate to convene immediately after the ceremonial pomp of the inauguration to begin putting the new president's team in place, particularly the national security officials. During Trump's first term, the Senate swiftly confirmed his defense and homeland security secretaries on his first day in office. Former President Joe Biden's choice for director of national intelligence was confirmed on his own Inauguration Day. With Trump's return to the White House, and his Republican Party controlling majorities in Congress, his outsider Cabinet choices are more clearly falling into place, despite initial skepticism and opposition from both sides of the aisle. Senate Majority Leader John Thune moved quickly Monday, saying he expected voting to begin 'imminently' on Trump's nominees. Democrats have calculated it's better for them to be seen as more willing to work with Trump rather than simply mounting a blockade to his nominees. They're holding their opposition for some of his other picks who have less support, including Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health secretary. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his party would 'neither rubber-stamp nominees we feel are grossly unqualified, nor oppose nominees that deserve serious consideration.' Rubio, he said, is an example of 'a qualified nominee we think should be confirmed quickly.' Senate committees have been holding lengthy confirmation hearings on more than a dozen of the Cabinet nominees, with more to come this week. And several panels were expected to meet late Monday to begin voting to advance the nominees to the full Senate for confirmation. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced Rubio's nomination late Monday. The Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Intelligence Committee, respectively, advanced the nominations of Hegseth and Ratcliffe. Rubio, a well-liked senator and former Trump rival during the 2016 presidential race, has drawn closer to the president in recent years. He appeared last week to answer questions before the Foreign Relations Committee, where he has spent more than a decade as a member. As secretary of state, Rubio would be the nation's top diplomat and the first Latino to hold the position. Born in Miami to Cuban immigrants, he has long been involved in foreign affairs, particularly in South America, and has emerged as a hawk on China's rise. During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio warned of the consequences of America's 'unbalanced relationship' with China. While he echoes Trump's anti-globalist rhetoric, Rubio is also seen as an internationalist who understands the power of U.S. involvement on the global stage. Rubio will take over for outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has said he hopes the Trump administration continues Biden's policies in the Middle East to end the war in Gaza and to help Ukraine counter Russian nomination. The Senate is split 53-47, but the resignation of Vice President JD Vance drops the GOP majority to 52 until his successor arrives. Republicans need almost every party member in line to overcome Democratic opposition to nominees. Objection from any one senator, as is expected with Hegseth and several other choices, would force the Senate into procedural steps that would drag voting later into the week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-rubio-as-secretary-of-state-trump-s-first-cabinet-member-/7944227.html	2025-01-20T16:57:01-08:00	
Biden issues preemptive pardons before exiting White House	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden used his constitutional power Monday to preemptively pardon several individuals, including some of his relatives, just minutes before Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. Without naming Trump or the incoming administration, Biden said in a statement that he believes in the rule of law but warned about the threat of partisan politics and pointed to possible retribution as the main concern behind his decision to grant the preemptive pardons. 'I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics,' Biden’s statement read. 'But these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.' Among those granted pardons is Trump’s former Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired General Mark Milley. Political differences between Trump and Milley that both men vented in public during Trump’s first term in office led to Trump’s supporters branding Milley as disloyal. Milley has reportedly referred to Trump as a 'fascist.' Citing 'ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties,' Biden extended pardons to members and staff of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. That includes former Republican Representative Liz Cheney. Biden also preemptively pardoned the U.S. Capitol and Washington police officers who testified before the committee. 'The Select Committee fulfilled this mission with integrity and a commitment to discovering the truth,' Biden said. The statement continued, 'Rather than accept accountability, those who perpetrated the January 6th attack have taken every opportunity to undermine and intimidate those who participated in the Select Committee in an attempt to rewrite history, erase the stain of January 6th for partisan gain, and seek revenge, including by threatening criminal prosecutions.' Biden also preemptively pardoned his former chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who retired in December 2023. Fauci and his family have received threats from those who opposed his approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the issuance of mask mandates. There’s a history of U.S. presidents pardoning family members for specific criminal convictions. Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden in December for gun and tax offenses as well as for any offenses he may have committed 'from January 1, 2014, through December 1, 2024.' But on Monday, Biden also pardoned other relatives who aren’t under investigation, including his brother, James Biden; James Biden’s wife, Sara Biden; his sister, Valerie Biden Owens; Valerie Owens’ husband, John Owens; and his brother, Francis Biden. 'My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan politics. Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end,' Biden’s statement said. 'The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.' Biden’s preemptive pardons contradict the stance he publicly shared on the matter on December 3, 2020, shortly before he took office. CNN anchor Jake Tapper asked Biden’s opinion on Trump's reported consideration of a wave of preemptive pardons before exiting the White House. 'Well, it concerns me in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice,' Biden replied. He further underscored that his administration wouldn’t approach pardons in that way. Trump has himself promised to pardon many of his supporters who attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021. He has characterized those arrested as 'patriots' who were wrongly prosecuted. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-issues-preemptive-pardons-before-exiting-white-house-/7944198.html	2025-01-20T16:52:13-08:00	
‘Dangerous fire weather conditions’ predicted in Southern California	The National Weather Service (NWS) is predicting even more 'dangerous fire weather conditions' in Southern California, citing the area’s 'low humidity and the return of very strong winds' from Monday into Tuesday. 'Take action now to prepare your home and loved ones for another round of EXTREME WIND and FIRE WEATHER, starting tomorrow afternoon: Worst winds Mon afternoon – Tue morning,' NWS Los Angeles posted on social media platform X. 'Everyone needs to be on high alert,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Monday. Brice Bennett, spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), said in a statement Monday that his agency — with help from federal, local and tribal firefighting agencies — had more than 2,500 people and had prepositioned equipment for quick deployment for any new outbreaks, following the NWS warning. At least 27 people have died in the fires that have erupted across Los Angeles, as battle-weary firefighters have struggled to bring the blazes under control. The death toll is expected to rise. The Palisades and Eaton fires together have destroyed 14,000 structures since they exploded January 7, during the fierce Santa Ana winds. As of Monday, the Palisades fire was 59% contained and the Eaton fire was 87% contained. A critical-risk-of-fire-weather warning has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center for Southern California with gusts expected to reach up to 96 kph for lower elevations and 120 kph or more in higher locations. The weather service said there is an extremely critical risk in place for the ongoing fire locations in the San Gabriel and Santa Monica mountains. California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Monday designed to protect Southern California residents from landslides and flooding. The order suspends some rules and regulations and speeds up the removal of debris that, if not removed promptly, could result in landslides, mudslides and flash floods. 'This order helps keep our emergency response focused on protecting communities, not permits and paperwork,' Newsom said. Residents whose homes have somehow survived the fires are finding they are not home free. According to The New York Times, people are finding their homes still standing but filled with a slurry of smoke, ash, chemicals and other contaminants. 'It smelled worse inside our house than outside,' resident Marcos Barron, 53, told the Times. Another resident, Arlynn Page, said she wanted to stay to rebuild in Altadena because she loves the community. 'But breathing this air? I don’t know,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dangerous-fire-weather-conditions-predicted-in-southern-california/7943961.html	2025-01-20T16:04:02-08:00

World leaders congratulate Trump on inauguration	World leaders on Monday are congratulating President Donald Trump on his inauguration as the 47th president of the United States. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was among those who congratulated Trump. 'President Trump is always decisive, and the peace through strength policy he announced provides an opportunity to strengthen American leadership and achieve a long-term and just peace, which is a top priority,' Zelenskyy said. The third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war is approaching at the end of February. Trump previously promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day after becoming president, or even before his inauguration. More recently, Trump advisers have said resolving the conflict will now take months or even longer. Trump has voiced skepticism of continued U.S. military support for Kyiv. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also congratulated President Trump. 'I believe that working together again will raise the U.S.-Israeli alliance to even greater heights,' Netanyahu said. A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began Sunday, just one day before Trump assumed the presidency. 'I look forward to working with you to return the remaining hostages, to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities and end its political rule in Gaza, and to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel,' Netanyahu added. Congratulations also rolled in from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, as well as U.S. allies like Germany, Italy and Britain. 'The U.S. is our closest ally, and the aim of our policy is always a good transatlantic relationship,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pointed to the longtime relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. 'For centuries, the relationship between our two nations has been one of collaboration, cooperation and enduring partnership,' Starmer said. 'With President Trump’s longstanding affection and historical ties to the United Kingdom, I know that depth of friendship will continue.' And Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who attended the inauguration at the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, said she is 'certain that the friendship between our nations and the values that unite us will continue to strengthen the cooperation between Italy and the USA.' But not all of the messages were congratulatory. Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino rejected a portion of Trump’s inaugural address, in which Trump reaffirmed his desire to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal. The United States fully ceded control of the strategically important canal to Panama in 1999. 'On behalf of the Republic of Panama and its people, I must fully reject the words outlined by President Donald Trump regarding Panama and its canal in his inaugural speech,' Mulino said in a statement.

Melania Trump brings steely fashion game back to Washington	WASHINGTON — Where in the world is Melania Trump? Back in Washington in a sharply tailored outfit that exudes international woman of mystery as her husband once again becomes president of the United States. Wearing a long navy coat and matching wide-brimmed hat — which shielded her eyes in most photos and hindered her commander-in-chief husband's attempts to give her a peck before his swearing-in — Melania's fit drew snark on social media and a flurry of comparisons to a 1980s video game character. 'Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?' quipped the internet, referring to the franchise that spun off into a popular 1990s geography game show for kids, and featured a criminal mastermind dressed in a long, carmine trench coat and eye-obscuring fedora. Melania Trump's coat and skirt were silk wool Adam Lippes, an independent American designer based in New York, an ensemble paired with an ivory blouse tightly wrapped at the Slovenian-born former model's neck. 'The tradition of the presidential inauguration embodies the beauty of American democracy, and today we had the honor to dress our first lady, Mrs. Melania Trump,' said Lippes in a statement that emphasized American manufacturing over political ideology. 'Mrs. Trump's outfit was created by some of America's finest craftsmen, and I take great pride in showing such work to the world.' The hat was by New York milliner Eric Javits. 'She cut the figure of a mafia widow or high-ranking member of an obscure religious order, and a bit of 'My Fair Lady,'' wrote Rachel Tashjian, style critic for The Washington Post. American first ladies don't get much of a voice — but their sartorial choices are broadcast to the world and scrutinized for subtext and statements. The late Rosalynn Carter, for example, drew strong reactions by wearing a dress she had already worn — gasp! — when her husband, Jimmy, was inaugurated in 1977. The point was to show empathy for the economic struggles of Americans — but sometimes what the people really want is aspirational glamour. In recent years, first ladies have routinely turned to independent designers for inaugural events: in 2021, Jill Biden wore a sparkling blue coat-and-dress combo by Markarian, a small brand in New York. Michelle Obama made waves in 2009 in a lemon-colored outfit by Isabel Toledo, wearing Thom Browne at her husband's second swearing-in. She wore gowns by Jason Wu to both series of inaugural balls. Melania Trump, for her part, channeled Jackie Kennedy to kick off her first turn in the White House, wearing Ralph Lauren — a heritage-brand favorite on both sides of the political aisle — to the daytime events in 2017. She swapped her powder-blue cashmere dress and matching asymmetrical bolero jacket with opera gloves for a silk crepe gown by Herve Pierre that year, both looks that signaled a sense of buoyancy as she began her new role as a political wife. Her shadowy-chic 2025 look marks a sharp departure as she enters tenure two. 'For her second round as first lady, the fashion game — the tool she brandishes most often and most forcefully, even if the public sometimes struggles to divine her sartorial messages — is likely to be one of steely, precise armor, of clothes with brash and exacting tailoring,' wrote the Post's Tashjian. 'For the past year, she has worn a wardrobe of mostly black, but this does not seem intended to make her disappear into the background.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/melania-trump-brings-steely-fashion-game-back-to-washington/7943817.html	2025-01-20T13:38:40-08:00	
East Congo hospital sees 'influx' of wounded as conflict escalates	GOMA, CONGO — A hospital in Goma has taken in more than 200 wounded since early January as fighting intensifies in eastern Congo, the Red Cross and local sources told AFP Monday. In recent weeks, the Congo's restive east has seen escalating clashes between the Congolese army and the M23 Movement — an armed group backed by Rwanda. With the M23 closing in on Goma, the provincial capital's hospital has had to tend to more and more people hit by the fighting, according to the Red Cross. 'We have seen an influx of wounded people since the start of January,' Myriam Favier, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in North Kivu province, told AFP. 'Between the 1 and 21 of December we saw 100 patients (and) between the 1 and 20 January we had 211 patients,' Favier added. On Monday the fighting reached the hills of Sake, a town approximately 20 kilometers west of Goma. Explosions could be heard from Goma in the morning, according to AFP journalists. Since its resurgence in late 2021, the M23 — which claims to defend ethnic Tutsis — has seized vast swathes of the Congo's mineral-rich east. In early January the M23 seized control of Masisi, the administrative capital of Masisi territory located 80 kilometers from Goma. 'Most alarming' The Congolese army has since been attempting to retake the city in a counteroffensive that has provoked a fresh wave of displacements. More than 230,000 people have fled violence in eastern Congo since the start of the year, the United Nations said Friday, labeling it one of the world's 'most alarming' humanitarian crises. Humanitarian charity Doctors Without Borders on Monday said in a statement it was 'reiterating' its call for 'respect for health and humanitarian facilities.' The statement came after two of its workers were 'slightly injured when a rocket hit the MSF garage next to the Masisi General Referral hospital [and] ... on the same day, another rocket hit a latrine near the hospital.' Several security sources told AFP the intensity of the fighting is currently at a level not seen for months, with a high number of deaths and the use of heavy artillery. An expert’s report commissioned by the U.N. Security Council said in July that 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan soldiers had been fighting alongside the M23 rebels and that Kigali had 'de facto control' of the group's operations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/east-congo-hospital-sees-influx-of-wounded-as-conflict-escalates-/7943766.html	2025-01-20T12:54:58-08:00	
At least 80 people killed in northeast Colombia as peace talks fail, official says	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — More than 80 people were killed in the country's northeast over the weekend following the government's failed attempts to hold peace talks with the National Liberation Army, a Colombian official said. Twenty others were injured in the violence that has forced thousands to flee as Colombia's army scrambled to evacuate people on Sunday, according to William Villamizar, governor of North Santander, where many of the killings took place. Among the victims were community leader Carmelo Guerrero and seven people who sought to sign a peace deal, according to a report that a government ombudsman agency released late Saturday. Officials said the attacks happened in several towns located in the Catatumbo region near the border with Venezuela, with at least three people who were part of the peace talks being kidnapped. Thousands of people are fleeing the area, with some hiding in the nearby lush mountains or seeking help at government shelters. 'We were caught in the crossfire,' said Juan Gutierrez, who fled with his family to a temporary shelter in Tibu after they were forced to leave behind their animals and belongings. 'We had no time to grab our things. ... I hope the government remembers us. ... We are helpless here.' Colombia's army rescued dozens of people on Sunday, including a family and their pet dog, whose owner held a pack of cold water against the animal's chest to keep it cool as they evacuated by helicopter. Defense Minister Ivan Velasquez traveled to the northeast town of Cucuta on Sunday where he held several security meetings and urged armed groups to demobilize. 'The priority is to save lives and guarantee the security of communities,' he said. 'We have deployed our troops throughout the entire region.' Officials also prepared to send 10 tons of food and hygiene kits for approximately 5,000 people in the communities of Ocaña and Tibu, the majority of them having fled the violence. 'Catatumbo needs help,' Villamizar said in a public address on Saturday. 'Boys, girls, young people, teenagers; entire families are showing up with nothing, riding trucks, dump trucks, motorcycles, whatever they can, on foot, to avoid being victims of this confrontation.' The attack comes after Colombia suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army, or ELN, on Friday, the second time it has done so in less than a year. Colombia's government has demanded that the ELN cease all attacks and allow authorities to enter the region and provide humanitarian aid. 'Displacement is killing us here in the region,' said José Trinidad, a municipal official for the town of Convención, located in the North Santander region. 'We're afraid the crisis will worsen.' Trinidad called on insurgent groups to sit down and hammer out a new agreement so 'us civilians don't have to suffer the consequences that we're suffering right now.' The ELN has been clashing in Catatumbo with former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a guerrilla group that disbanded after signing a peace deal in 2016 with Colombia's government. The two are fighting over control of a strategic border region that has coca leaf plantations. In a statement Saturday, the ELN said it had warned former FARC members that if they 'continued attacking the population ... there was no other way out than armed confrontation.' The ELN has accused ex-FARC rebels of several killings in the area, including the Jan. 15 slaying of a couple and their 9-month-old baby. Army commander General Luis Emilio Cardozo Santamaría said Saturday that authorities were reinforcing a humanitarian corridor between Tibú and Cúcuta for the safe passage of those forced to flee their homes. He said special urban troops also were deployed to municipal capitals 'where there are risks and a lot of fear.' The ELN has tried to negotiate a peace deal with the administration of President Gustavo Petro five times, with talks failing after bouts of violence. ELN demands include that it be recognized as a political rebel organization, which critics have said is risky.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-80-people-killed-in-northeast-colombia-as-peace-talks-fail-official-says/7943754.html	2025-01-20T12:53:25-08:00	
No day-one tariffs coming from Trump, but trade overhaul planned, official says	President Donald Trump will issue a broad trade memo on Monday that stops short of imposing new tariffs on his first day in office but directs federal agencies to evaluate U.S. trade relationships with China, Canada and Mexico, a Trump administration official said. After weeks of intense global speculation over which duties Trump would impose immediately after being sworn in as U.S. president, news that Trump would take more time on tariffs drove a relief rally in global stocks and a dive in the dollar against major currencies. Trump mentioned no specific tariff plans in his inaugural address but repeated his intention to create the External Revenue Service, a new agency to collect 'massive amounts' of tariffs, duties and other revenues from foreign sources. 'I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families,' Trump said. 'Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.' Trump added that his policies would make America 'a manufacturing nation once again.' During his election campaign, Trump vowed to impose steep tariffs of 10% to 20% on global imports into the U.S. and 60% on goods from China to help reduce a trade deficit that now tops $1 trillion annually. He said after his November election that he would sign 'all necessary documents' upon taking office to impose an immediate 25% import surcharge on imports from Canada and Mexico if they failed to clamp down on the flow of illicit drugs and migrants entering the U.S. illegally. Such duties would tear up long-standing trade agreements, upend supply chains and raise costs, according to trade experts. The official, confirming a Wall Street Journal report that cited a summary of Trump's memo, said the new president will instead direct agencies to investigate and remedy persistent trade deficits and address unfair trade and currency policies by other nations. The memo will single out China, Canada and Mexico for scrutiny but will not announce new tariffs, the official said. It will direct agencies to assess Beijing's compliance with its 2020 trade deal with the U.S., as well as the status of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the official said. Relief rally The U.S. dollar slumped broadly on the news against a basket of major trading partners' currencies, with particularly large upswings in the euro, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan. MSCI's measure of global stock markets rose. U.S. financial markets are closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Some industry groups and trade lawyers in Washington had speculated that Trump would invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law with sweeping powers to control imports in times of national emergency, to impose immediate tariffs. But the forthcoming trade memo signals a more methodical approach that would likely involve trade investigations under other legal authorities such as the Section 232 national security trade law and the Section 301 unfair trade practices statute. Trump invoked these laws during his first term, and probes on steel and aluminum and Chinese imports took months to complete. 'It sounds like maybe he's been listening to the people telling him that immediate tariffs would really hurt the financial markets,' said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But Reinsch and other trade analysts say they still expect Trump to press ahead with a global tariff early in his administration. 'The universal tariff was a core part of the economic plan he ran on, and I think he’s going to do what he said he would,' said Kelly Ann Shaw, a former White House trade adviser during Trump's first term. 'This is an idea he's supported for a long time,' Shaw, now with the Hogan Lovells law firm, said in an interview last week. Past trade playbook In his 2017-2021 first term, Trump's administration used investigations to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and launch duties on some $370 billion worth of Chinese imports, igniting a tit-for-tat tariff war between the world's two largest economies. The U.S. and China ended the conflict in 2020 with a deal for Beijing to boost its purchases of U.S. exports from farm goods to aircraft by $200 billion annually but never followed through as the pandemic hit. The forthcoming memo indicates that Trump's administration will try to push China to keep those commitments. Trump also had threatened to quit the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, blaming it for draining U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico and prompting a renegotiation of the trade pact with tighter rules of origin for autos and stronger labor and environmental standards. Trump won a sunset provision in USMCA that will allow him to renegotiate it again in 2026, and the tariff threats against Mexico and Canada are seen by some trade analysts as a gambit to open those talks early.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-day-one-tariffs-coming-from-trump-but-trade-overhaul-planned-official-says/7943735.html	2025-01-20T12:33:14-08:00

Linda Gradstein reports for VOA from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Trump supporters disappointed they couldn't watch inauguration in person	WASHINGTON — The National Mall in Washington was lined with hundreds of portable toilets Monday, but it’s unlikely many of the portable restrooms got much use. They had been set up for the hundreds of thousands of people who were expected to watch as Donald Trump took the oath of office to become the 47th president of the United States. But Monday’s cold temperatures, which hovered around minus 6.6 degrees Celsius, meant Trump’s swearing-in ceremony was moved indoors. The last-minute change left many Trump supporters feeling disappointed because they had traveled to Washington to see Trump’s inauguration in person, they told VOA. Unable to watch the inauguration like they had planned, some gathered on the National Mall on Monday morning, as close to the U.S. Capitol Building as the fences allowed. Melanie Voll, from Ohio, had received tickets from her representative, Bob Latta, to watch the inauguration. 'With this beautiful sunshine, and no wind, it’s extra disappointing,' Voll said. She and her son both wore 'Make America Great Again' hats as they walked down the National Mall. 'We’re from the Midwest, so we’re used to the cold,' she added. Those with tickets for the Presidential Platform and members of Congress were still able to attend the ceremony in person. But moving the inauguration indoors meant the vast majority of ticketed guests, like Voll, were unable to watch the inauguration in person. Friends Emma and Paige, from Kentucky and South Carolina, agreed they were disappointed that the inauguration was moved indoors. 'Absolutely we were disappointed,' Paige said. 'The whole reason was to come and be able to stand outside and watch it happen, but we’re still enjoying the day. It’s a nice day outside.' They declined to share their last names because 'we’ve got jobs,' Paige said. Carmen and Jeff Mayo, from Yakima, Washington, told VOA they were also disappointed that they couldn’t watch the inauguration in person, but added they were happy that Trump would be president again. 'The main thing is that it happens and that he is sworn into office and the changes begin to occur,' Carmen Mayo said. Unable to watch the inauguration outside, some Trump supporters planned to watch from Capital One Arena in Washington. A 76-year-old Falun Dafa member named Angela, who declined to provide her last name, told VOA that’s where she was headed after stopping at the National Mall. Falun Dafa, also known as Falun Gong, is a religious movement banned by Beijing. Angela said she voted for Trump because 'I think the most important thing is that people are kind to each other.' While speaking with VOA, she emphasized that she was speaking in her personal capacity, not for the religious organization. Others, like Jeff Wood from Texas, said he wasn’t able to buy a ticket to the Capital One event before it sold out. But since he had already planned to come to Washington, he decided to still come. 'Might as well come see what’s happening,' he said. Not everyone on the National Mall was a Trump supporter. One man staged a small protest in defense of transgender rights. Civil rights groups say they view Trump’s agenda as a threat to transgender rights. Trump on Monday plans to sign an executive order declaring that the U.S. government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, as well as orders rolling back protections for transgender people and diversity, equality and inclusion programs within the federal government, according to an official in his new administration. A trio of Norwegian tourists said it was a coincidence that they were in Washington on Inauguration Day. 'It’s very interesting,' Lise Johnsen said. And many vendors on the streets of Washington sold Trump merchandise. One of them, Jordan Steckler, said he didn’t support Trump, but that he was selling the merchandise to make money. Other vendors, like Cecelia Garcia, were major Trump supporters. Originally from Mexico but now based in California, Garcia said she drove across the country to sell merchandise on Inauguration Day. Garcia also said she was present during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the Capitol, during which Trump supporters tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Garcia said she didn’t enter the building but was selling her merchandise outside. 'It was beautiful,' she said. On Monday, with just hours left in his presidency, President Joe Biden pardoned members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack to shield them from potential politically motivated retribution by the new Trump administration. Trump has said repeatedly that he will pardon people who participated in the attack.

Death toll rises to 86 from gasoline tanker blast in central Nigeria	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigeria's emergency agency said the death toll from a weekend gasoline tanker explosion in north central Niger state has risen to 86. Explosions that kill dozens who converge on crashed tanker trucks to scoop up spilled fuel have been common for years in Nigeria, and the problem is only becoming worse. The National Emergency Management Agency, or NEMA, said about 50 people sustained burns in Saturday’s tanker explosion in central Nigeria, in addition to those killed. The victims are currently receiving treatment at local hospitals. The 60,000-liter fuel tanker crashed in central Niger State, near Abuja, spilling its contents. Officials said locals rushed to the scene with generators to siphon fuel from the tanker, triggering the explosion. 'A mass burial has been conducted where the people that died at the scene of the incident have been put to rest,' said Manzo Ezekiel, NEMA spokesperson, adding that the injured were taking to various primary and secondary medical facilities. At least three times in recent months, tanker explosions in Nigeria have caused dozens of deaths. A similar incident to Saturday’s killed 170 people in northern Jigawa State in October. In September, another 48 people died trying to scoop up fuel after a tanker collided with a truck full of cattle in Niger state. The problem starts with frequent road accidents involving the tankers. According to Nigeria's Road Safety Corps, there were about 1,500 tanker accidents in 2020. The Petrol Tanker Drivers Association blames the frequency of these crashes on poor road conditions and a lack of enforcement of road safety measures, including speed and load limits. When the tankers crash, locals quickly move in, hoping to take away some fuel before police arrive. 'I'm a tanker driver, I know how it is. The roads are bad,' said Augustine Egbon, chairman of the Petrol Tanker Drivers Association. 'Secondly, my advice to everybody is that as soon as tanker has an accident nobody should go there because sometimes when tanker falls it will take almost two or three hours, it's when people start going there that's where the fire will start.' Nigeria has an aging 5,000-kilometer-long oil pipeline but most of the 50 million liters of gasoline consumed here daily are transported by roads to pumps. Authorities have pledged to address the issue and enforce stricter regulations. The recent surge in gasoline prices — rising fivefold since President Bola Tinubu scrapped fuel subsidies in May 2023 — has driven many to risk their lives to retrieve fuel during accidents. The locals often use or sell the fuel they collect from crash sites.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-rises-to-86-from-gasoline-tanker-blast-in-central-nigeria-/7943640.html	2025-01-20T11:07:08-08:00

Biden commutes sentence for Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier, convicted in killing of FBI agents	WASHINGTON — With just moments left before he leaves office, President Joe Biden commuted the life sentence of Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier, who was convicted in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents. Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and wasn't eligible for parole again until 2026. He was serving life in prison for the deaths of the agents during a standoff on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. He will transition to home confinement, Biden said in a statement. The fight for Peltier's freedom is entangled with the Indigenous rights movements. Nearly half a century later, his name remains a rallying cry. An enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa in North Dakota, Peltier was active in the American Indian Movement, which began in the 1960s as a local organization in Minneapolis that grappled with issues of police brutality and discrimination against Native Americans. It quickly became a national force. The movement grabbed headlines in 1973 when it took over the village of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge reservation, leading to a 71-day standoff with federal agents. Tensions between the movement and the government remained high for years. On June 26, 1975, agents came to Pine Ridge to serve arrest warrants amid battles over Native treaty rights and self-determination. After being injured in a shootout, agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were shot in the head at close range, FBI has said. Also killed in the shootout was American Indian Movement member Joseph Stuntz. Two other movement members, Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted of killing Coler and Williams. After fleeing to Canada and being extradited to the United States, Peltier was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced in 1977 to life in prison, despite defense claims that evidence against him had been falsified.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-commutes-sentence-for-indigenous-activist-leonard-peltier-convicted-in-killing-of-fbi-agents/7943477.html	2025-01-20T09:14:57-08:00	
Indian court sentences police volunteer to life in prison in rape, killing of trainee doctor	NEW DELHI — An Indian court on Monday sentenced a police volunteer to life in prison after finding him guilty in the rape and killing of a trainee doctor last year, a crime that sparked nationwide protests over inadequate safety for women and led to a speedy trial in the country's slow-moving justice system. Sanjay Roy, 33, who has consistently maintained his innocence, can appeal the judgment in a higher court. The killing of the 31-year-old physician while she was on duty at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the country. Police discovered the woman's bloodied body at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital's seminar hall last Aug. 9. An autopsy found she had been strangled and sexually assaulted. Federal police, who investigated the case, said the crime deserved the death penalty. Parents of the victim had also sought the death penalty for Roy and said they suspected more people were involved in the crime. The case was initially investigated by Kolkata police but later the court handed over the probe to federal investigators after state government officers were accused of mishandling the investigation. After the assault, doctors and medical students across India held protests and rallies demanding better security. Thousands of women also protested in the streets demanding swift justice for the victim. Roy was arrested a day after the crime, and arguments in the case began in November. The assault prompted India's Supreme Court to set up a national task force to suggest ways to enhance safety in government hospitals. Many crimes against women go unreported in India due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence, as well as a lack of faith in the police. Women's rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where communities sometimes shame victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing. In 2012, the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus galvanized massive protests across India. It inspired lawmakers to order harsher penalties for such crimes, as well as the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases. The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders. Four men sentenced to death for the 2012 crime were hanged in 2020. The rape law amended in 2013 also criminalized stalking and voyeurism and lowered the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16. Activists say new sentencing requirements haven't deterred rapes and the number of recorded rape cases has increased. In 2022, police recorded 31,516 reports of rape — a 20% jump from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-court-sentences-police-volunteer-to-life-in-prison-in-rape-killing-of-trainee-doctor/7943385.html	2025-01-20T08:38:45-08:00	
Trump seeks return of US military equipment from Afghan Taliban	Ayaz Gul — President-elect Donald Trump says that future financial assistance to Afghanistan will be contingent upon the return of U.S. military equipment by the Taliban leaders currently in power. Trump’s remarks at a Sunday rally in Washington on the eve of his January 20 inauguration have heightened uncertainty regarding his administration’s stance on the crisis-hit South Asian nation. 'They [Biden administration] gave billions of billions of dollars to the Taliban. They gave our military equipment, a big chunk of it, to the enemy,' Trump said. He referred to the tumultuous and hasty withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021, ordered by President Joe Biden. 'If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re not going to give them the money unless they give back our military equipment. ... So, we will give them a couple of bucks; we want the military equipment back,' Trump stated without elaborating. A report issued by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2022 revealed that approximately $7 billion worth of military equipment was left behind in Afghanistan following the completion of the military withdrawal. The equipment in question, which included aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment, and other materials, was subsequently seized by the Taliban. The de facto Afghan rulers have since repeatedly displayed the U.S. military gear in their so-called victory day celebrations over the past three years. The foreign troop exit stemmed from the February 2020 Doha Agreement that the first Trump administration negotiated with the then-insurgent Taliban. Biden completed and defended the military withdrawal, saying the choice he had was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban. Following the withdrawal, the Biden administration largely isolated the Taliban and imposed new sanctions on the group. Washington, however, has continued to be the largest donor to Afghanistan, a country that the United Nations says is suffering through one of the severest humanitarian crises in the world. U.S. officials have also engaged in diplomatic efforts with the Taliban to negotiate the release of certain U.S. detainees and assisted in relocating Afghan allies who had helped American forces. US gives cash for humanitarian aid The billions of dollars that Trump repeatedly has referred to are likely the cash shipments being channeled through the U.N. and non-governmental organizations to support humanitarian programs in Afghanistan. Washington remains the primary donor and has spent approximately $3 billion in humanitarian aid since the U.S. withdrawal. Thomas Ruttig from the independent Afghanistan Analysts Network warned of challenges for the Taliban under the Trump administration. He noted that some members of Congress and incoming administration officials took part in the 20-year U.S. mission in Afghanistan and have been highly critical of the Taliban. Despite this, he stated that countering regional terrorism is a significant concern in Washington, and it could potentially encourage the Trump administration to seek cooperation with the Taliban to combat terrorist organizations, including the Afghanistan-based affiliate of the Islamic State terrorist organization known as IS-Khorasan. Ruttig said that Tim Burchett, Republican vice chair of the U.S. Congress’s Foreign Affairs Committee, recently introduced a bill, the 'No Tax Dollars for Terrorists Act,' to ensure that U.S. tax money does not end up in the hands of the Taliban. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan denies that cash shipments for humanitarian programs are financing the Taliban. The mission says the current setup – in which cash is physically brought to Afghanistan and placed in designated U.N. accounts in a private bank – is in place because of a ban on international banking transfers and ongoing liquidity issues. 'All these funds are then distributed directly to the United Nations entities, as well as to a small number of approved and vetted humanitarian partners in Afghanistan,' according to the mission. Taliban leaders have rejected Trump’s assertions that their government received U.S. financial aid, stating that they do not expect or seek any assistance from Washington. 'Instead, it (U.S.) has confiscated and frozen billions of dollars that rightfully belong to the people of Afghanistan,' said a Taliban statement in response to Trump’s remarks earlier this month. Ruttig warns that punitive measures and sanctions to pressure the Taliban into submission might also provoke them to stop cooperation with international stakeholders. 'Today, the US-Taliban Doha Agreement is still considered valid and obliges the Taliban to restrict ISKP and other groups from using their shelter in Afghanistan to commit terrorist acts in the West. This could be jeopardized by new quasi-sanctions on them,' he said in written comments. Taliban hopes for better relations Masuda Sultan, an Afghan American advocate for women’s rights, is doubtful the new Trump administration will substantially change its stance on the Taliban. Instead, she expects the U.S. will cut aid contributions to U.N.-funded programs like the World Food Program that have supported the country’s most vulnerable. At the same time, Taliban leaders appear publicly optimistic about a favorable shift in U.S. policy under the Trump presidency, attributing this to their Doha pact with his previous Trump administration. Kabul promptly welcomed Trump’s election victory just one day after he was declared the winner of the United States presidential vote. The Taliban foreign ministry issued a formal statement expressing its hope that 'the incoming U.S. administration will adopt a pragmatic approach to ensure tangible advancement in bilateral relations, allowing both nations to open a new chapter of relations grounded in mutual engagement.' Earlier this month, Taliban Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai commended Trump as a 'decisive' and 'courageous' leader. Stanikzai suggested that Trump reconsider Biden’s policy and adopt a new approach. 'We want to build good relations with the international community and the Western countries,' Stanikzai said in televised remarks in local language. 'An enemy doesn’t remain an enemy forever, and a friend doesn’t remain a friend forever either,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-seeks-return-of-us-military-equipment-from-afghan-taliban-/7943249.html	2025-01-20T06:40:59-08:00	
Biden pardons Fauci and Milley in effort to guard against potential 'revenge' by Trump	Washington — President Joe Biden has pardoned Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, using the extraordinary powers of his office in his final hours to guard against potential 'revenge' by the incoming Trump administration. The decision by Biden comes after Donald Trump warned of an enemies list filled with those who have crossed him politically or sought to hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss and his role in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump has selected Cabinet nominees who backed his election lies and who have pledged to punish those involved in efforts to investigate him. 'The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,' Biden said in a statement. 'Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.' It's customary for a president to grant clemency at the end of his term, but those acts of mercy are usually offered to everyday Americans who have been convicted of crimes. But Biden has used the power in the broadest and most untested way possible: to pardon those who have not even been investigated yet. And with the acceptance comes a tacit admission of guilt or wrongdoing, even though those who have been pardoned have not been formally accused of any crimes. 'These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing,' Biden said, adding that 'Even when individuals have done nothing wrong — and in fact have done the right thing — and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.' Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health for nearly 40 years and was Biden's chief medical adviser until his retirement in 2022. He helped coordinate the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and raised the ire of Trump during that time. He has become a target of intense hatred and vitriol from people on the right, who blame him for mask mandates and other policies they believe infringed on their rights, even as tens of thousands of Americans were dying. Mark Milley is the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and called Trump a fascist and detailed Trump's conduct around the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Biden is also extending pardons to members and staff of the Jan. 6 committee, including former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both Republicans, as well as the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the committee. Biden, an institutionalist, has promised a smooth transition to the next administration, inviting Trump to the White House and saying that the nation will be OK, even as he warned during his farewell address of a growing oligarchy. He has spent years warning that Trump's ascension to the presidency again would be a threat to democracy. His decision to break with political norms with the preemptive pardons was brought on by those concerns. Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued; he announced on Friday he would commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. He previously announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just weeks before Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented spate of executions, 13, in a protracted timeline during the coronavirus pandemic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-pardons-fauci-and-milley-in-an-effort-to-guard-against-potential-revenge-by-trump/7943096.html	2025-01-20T04:48:39-08:00	
Israel-Hamas ceasefire in place with first group of hostages, prisoners freed	A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was holding Monday, with the two sides in the early stages of a six-week pause in fighting that could lead to an end to the war that began in October 2023. So far three of the 99 hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza have been released, with 30 others set to be freed in the first stage of the agreement. Israel also has set free 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, all of them women and teenagers, according to Hamas, with hundreds more to follow. The United Nations has surged badly needed food aid to Gaza and says it plans to bring in 150 trucks of food every day to help Palestinian civilians who have seen their lives upended by the fighting. More than 1.8 million people are in need of emergency shelter in Gaza, according to the U.N., which also estimated in a report last year that it could take until 2040 to rebuild the territory’s destroyed housing. The ceasefire began around midday Sunday, and hours later a Red Cross convoy brought hostages Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher safely back to Israel. Early Monday, Israel freed the 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, with large buses taking them from Israel’s Ofer prison just outside the West Bank city of Ramallah. Palestinians crowded the buses, chanting and cheering, as celebratory fireworks burst overhead. The ceasefire came after months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. The talks intensified during the past few weeks, with teams from both the outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump pushing for a deal before Trump’s Monday inauguration. The Palestinian death toll from Israel’s counteroffensive after the October 2023 attack has reached more than 46,900, with most of them women and children, although the Israeli military contends, without providing evidence, that it has killed 17,000 militants. In addition to the people being released and aid going into Gaza, the agreement also calls for Israeli troops to pull back into a buffer zone inside of Gaza and for many displaced Palestinians to be able to return home. Top Israeli officials support the ceasefire, but not all of them. Israel's hard-line national security minister said his Jewish Power faction was quitting the government in protest over the ceasefire agreement. Itamar Ben-Gvir's departure weakens Netanyahu's coalition but will not affect the truce. Negotiations on the far more difficult second phase of this ceasefire should begin in just over two weeks. Major questions remain, including whether the war will resume after the first phase and how the rest of the hostages in Gaza will be freed. VOA U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-hamas-ceasefire-in-place-with-first-group-of-hostages-prisoners-freed/7943036.html	2025-01-20T02:55:30-08:00	
Australian government pledges $1.24 billion in green aluminum push	SYDNEY — Australia's Labor government on Monday pledged $1.24 billion in production credits to help support the country's four aluminum smelters switch to renewable power before 2036. Aluminum is one of the most polluting nonferrous metals to make, as its current production is mostly powered by coal. Green aluminum usually refers to metal produced using solar, wind or hydropower. The country's four aluminum smelters are run by Rio Tinto and Alcoa. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, in his latest election pitch, said the smelters would receive government support for each metric ton of low-carbon aluminum they produce. His center-left government has made renewable energy a major theme ahead of a national election, which must be called by May. The Australian government is targeting 82% of power supply to come from renewables by 2030, but remains well short of the target, at 40% now, even after pledging to underwrite new wind, solar and battery projects with more than $24.5 billion. 'We want Australian workers to make more things here,' Albanese said in a statement. 'We've got all the ingredients right here for a world-leading metals industry - from the best solar and wind resources, to the critical minerals and facilities, as well as a highly skilled workforce.' The Australian Aluminum Council said it had been seeking production credits for the aluminum sector, the sixth-largest producer of the metal in the world, to attract private capital and ensure the industry remains globally competitive amid rising costs and longer regulatory processes. 'These new aluminum production credits should provide some of the transitional support needed as Australia's energy infrastructure and systems develop, and energy pricing returns to competitive levels,' Council CEO Marghanita Johnson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-government-pledges-1-24-billion-in-green-aluminum-push/7943007.html	2025-01-20T02:06:15-08:00	
South African police launch manhunt for gang leader of illegal mine	JOHANNESBURG — South African police have launched a manhunt for a Lesotho gang member believed to have controlled operations at an illegal gold mine where 78 bodies were recovered last week during a police siege, from which he escaped. The alleged kingpin, known as 'Tiger,' surfaced from the mine in Stilfontein while it was under police surveillance and escaped from custody with the help of officials, a statement on Monday from the South African Police Service said. 'Extensive investigations and tracing operations are underway to find those officials who aided his escape between shaft 11 and the Stilfontein police holding cells,' the statement said. Police were widely condemned for the months-long operation in which they cut off food and water supplies to the miners in an attempt to force them out of the mine to face arrest. The stand-off culminated in a state-sponsored rescue operation last week in which 246 survivors were retrieved from the deep mine, many of whom were emaciated and weak from hunger. But police claim the gang leaders were to blame for the deaths, citing reports from some miners who said there was food underground but the kingpins kept it for themselves. Thousands of people are believed to be involved in illegal gold mining in abandoned industrial mines in South Africa in search of leftover gold. Some of the workers spend months at a time underground. The lucrative industry is known to be run by Lesotho-based gangs, and police say some of the workers are illegal immigrants recruited from neighboring countries without knowledge of what they have come to do. Tiger was named in statements by miners as a ring leader who ran operations, the police statement said. 'He is also being accused by some illegal miners... (as) being allegedly responsible for some deaths, assault and torture that is alleged to have taken place according to videos in police possession. He is also alleged to have hoarded and kept food away from other illegal miners,' it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-african-police-launch-manhunt-for-gang-leader-of-illegal-mine/7943004.html	2025-01-20T01:49:17-08:00	
China unveils plan to build 'strong education nation' by 2035	BEIJING — China issued its first national action plan to build a 'strong education nation' by 2035, which it said would help coordinate its education development, improve efficiencies in innovation and build a 'strong country.' The plan, issued Sunday by the Communist Party's central committee and the State Council, aims to establish a 'high quality education system' with accessibility and quality 'among the best in the world.' The announcement was made after data on Friday showed China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the number of deaths outpacing a slight increase in births, and experts cautioning that the downturn will worsen in the coming years. High childcare and education costs have been a key factor for many young Chinese opting out of having children, at a time when many face uncertainty over their job prospects amid sluggish economic growth. 'By 2035, an education power will be built,' the official Xinhua news agency said, adding that China would explore gradually expanding the scope of free education, increase 'high-quality' undergraduate enrolment, expand postgraduate education, and raise the proportion of doctoral students. The plan aims to promote 'healthy growth and all-round development of students,' making sure primary and secondary school students have at least two hours of physical activity daily, to effectively control the myopia, or nearsightedness, and obesity rates. 'Popularizing' mental health education and establishing a national student mental health monitoring and early warning system would also be implemented, it said. It also aims to narrow the gap between urban and rural areas to improve the operating conditions of small-scale rural schools and improve the care system for children with disabilities and those belonging to agricultural migrant populations. The plan also aims to steadily increase the supply of kindergarten places and the accessibility of preschool education.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-unveils-plan-to-build-strong-education-nation-by-2035/7942986.html	2025-01-20T00:28:43-08:00	
India's 'digital arrest' scammers stealing savings of citizens	Bengaluru, India — Within five hours, while sitting at home in India, retired professor Kamta Prasad Singh handed over his hard-earned savings to online fraudsters impersonating police. The cybercrime known as 'digital arrest' — where fraudsters pose online as law enforcement officials and order people to transfer huge amounts of money — has become so rampant that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has issued warnings. Singh told AFP that money was his life savings. 'Over the years, I have skipped having tea outside, walked to avoid spending on public transport,' the 62-year-old said, his voice breaking. 'Only I know, how I saved my money.' Police say scammers have exploited the vast gap between the breakneck speed of India's data digitalization, from personal details to online banking, and the lagging awareness of many of basic internet safety. Fraudsters are using technology for data breaches, targeting information their victims believe is only available to government authorities, and making otherwise unlikely demands appear credible. Indians have emptied their bank accounts 'out of sheer fear,' Modi said in an October radio broadcast, adding fraudsters 'create so much psychological pressure on the victim.' 'Ruined' Mobile phones, and especially video calling, have allowed fraudsters to reach straight into people's homes. India runs the world's largest biometric digital identity program — called 'Aadhaar,' or foundation in Hindi — a unique card issued to India's more than one billion people, and increasingly required for financial transactions. Scammers often claim they are police investigating questionable payments, quoting their target's Aadhaar number to appear genuine. They then request their victim make a 'temporary' bank transfer to validate their accounts, before stealing the cash. Singh, from India's eastern state of Bihar, said the web of lies began when he received a call in December, seemingly from the telecom regulatory authority. 'They said... police were on their way to arrest me,' Singh said. The fraudsters told Singh that his Aadhaar ID was being misused for illegal payments. Terrified, Singh agreed to prove he had control of his bank account, and after spiraling threats, transferred over $16,100. 'I have lost sleep; don't feel like eating,' he said. 'I have been ruined.' 'Rot in proverbial hell' The surge of online scams is worrying because of 'how valid they make it look and sound,' said police officer Sushil Kumar, who handled cybercrimes for half a decade. The perpetrators range from school dropouts to highly educated individuals. 'They know what to search for on the internet to find out basic details of how government agencies work,' Kumar added. India registered 17,470 cybercrimes in 2022, including 6,491 cases of online bank fraud, according to the latest government data. Tricks vary. Kaveri, 71, told AFP her story, on condition her name was changed. She said fraudsters posed as officials from the U.S. courier FedEx, claiming she had sent a package containing drugs, passports and credit cards. They offered her full name and Aadhaar ID details as 'proof,' followed by well-forged letters from the Central Bank of India and Central Bureau of Investigation, the country's top investigative agency. 'They wanted me to send money, which would be returned in 30 minutes,' she said, adding she was convinced when they sent a 'properly signed letter.' She transferred savings from a house sale, totaling around $120,000, in four instalments over six days, before the fraudsters vanished. Kaveri says those days felt 'like a tunnel.' Meeta, 35, a private health professional from Bengaluru, who also did not want to be identified, was conned by fake police via a video call. 'It seemed like a proper police station, with walkie-talkie noises,' she said. The scammers told her to prove she controlled her bank account by taking out a loan of 200,000 rupees, or $2,300, via her bank's phone app, before demanding she make a 'temporary' transfer. Despite making it clear to the bank that she had been scammed, Meeta continues to be asked to pay back the loan. 'My trust in banks has mostly gone,' she said, before cursing the thieves. 'I hope they rot in proverbial hell.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-digital-arrest-scammers-stealing-savings-of-citizens/7942984.html	2025-01-20T00:21:03-08:00	
Civil rights leaders, King family issue call to action as inauguration falls on MLK Day	WASHINGTON — When President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as president of the United States inside the Capitol's rotunda, he will do so facing a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the federal holiday commemorating King's legacy. It's a disquieting contrast for some civil rights advocates who wish to fulfill the late reverend's dream of non-violent social revolution. Events honoring King and advocating for his vision of a just society will occur across the nation as many in the U.S. observe the peaceful transfer of power in the capital. The concurrent events have been met with mixed feelings by civil rights leaders, who broadly reviled Trump's rhetoric and stances on race and civil rights during his third presidential campaign. But many leaders, including King's own family, see the juxtaposition as a poignant contrast and a chance to refocus the work of advancing civil rights in a new political era. 'I'm glad it occurred on that day because it gives the United States of America and the world the contrast in pictures. Is this the way you want to go — or is this the way you want to go?' said the Rev. Bernice King, the late King's youngest daughter and CEO of the King Center. 'It's not a day that he can be the star, which he loves to be,' King's daughter said of Trump. 'He has to contend with that legacy on that day, regardless of how he manages it and handles it in his presentation. I hope those around him are advising him well to honor the day appropriately in his speech.' This is the third time in the nearly 40 years since the federal King holiday became law that it coincides with a presidential inauguration. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also were sworn in for their second terms on the holiday. Both praised King in their remarks; it is yet to be seen if and how Trump — who falsely claimed his first inauguration had larger crowds than King's March on Washington — will acknowledge the day. 'Will he sound a message of unity and a presidency for all, or will he continue to focus on his base and some of the divisive policies he's championed, like an anti-DEI stance, rounding up immigrants and cutting important parts of the social safety net through this DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) process?' asked Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League civil rights group. Morial added that Trump's inauguration landing on MLK Day represented 'a contradiction of values.' Many civil rights leaders will spend the day commemorating King's legacy after a week of public and private organizing, giving speeches and strategizing how to respond to the incoming administration's agenda. 'It's the best of times and the worst of times,' said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, an organization whose members mentored, collaborated and clashed with King throughout the Civil Rights Movement. 'Our mission doesn't change. Our job is to make democracy work for all, to make sure that equal protection is ensured under the law,' Johnson said. He added that the group 'doesn't want to assume' the Trump administration can't be a partner on advancing civil rights or racial justice. On Wednesday, Johnson and other civil rights leaders met with Congressional Black Caucus members on Capitol Hill to discuss how to work with and to oppose the Trump administration. That same day, the National Action Network, a civil rights group founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton, hosted a breakfast at which Vice President Kamala Harris urged attendees to stay motivated. 'Ours is a journey,' she said. 'Whatever the outcome of any particular moment, we can never be defeated. Our spirit can never be defeated, because when that happens, we won't win.' Martin Luther King III, the late King's eldest son, prayed with Harris on stage. King had campaigned for Harris in the fall and called her an advocate who 'speaks to our better angels' and 'embodies Dr. King's legacy.' Many racial justice advocates are set to organize demonstrations, vigils and community service events to mark the holiday and prepare for what they consider an adversarial administration. Some groups are reflecting on parallels and differences with how King organized in the face of explicitly white supremacist state and local governments and geopolitical tumult. 'The hostility is similar, particularly in that there is a mobilized, active and aggressive extremist-right hell bent on unraveling rights and any sense of shared purpose, shared problems or shared solutions,' said Maya Wiley, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. What differs, Wiley said, is the understanding 'there has to be opportunity for everyone.' King himself worried the legal protections he dedicated his life to realizing would not be followed by greater anti-discrimination efforts or social programs. He proposed it would take white Americans embracing a deeper kinship with Black Americans and engaging in economic and social solidarity to see change. A year before his 1968 assassination, King wrote in his final book that giving a Black person their 'due' often required 'special treatment.' 'I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according to their individual merits,' King wrote in the 1967 book, 'Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community.' 'But this is a day which demands new thinking and the reevaluation of old concepts.' King's advocacy for 'new concepts' found an heir in the enactment of affirmative action policies in workplaces and schools. Many advocates of diversity, equity and inclusion policies see such programs as realizing his vision, though that argument has come under withering scrutiny from conservative activists. Trump's views on race have been criticized for decades. The federal government sued Trump for allegedly discriminating against Black apartment seekers in the 1970s. He was instrumental in promoting the 'birther' conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the U.S. And his campaign rhetoric about immigrants and urban communities since 2015 up to November's election has been derided as prejudiced. As president, Trump enacted some criminal justice reform laws that civil rights advocates praised but then proposed harsh crackdowns on 2020 racial reckoning protests. In April, Trump did not dispute the notion that 'anti-white racism' now represents a greater problem in the U.S. than systemic racism against Black Americans. 'I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country and that can't be allowed either,' Trump said during an interview with Time magazine. Janiyah Thomas, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said Trump's inauguration would be 'monumental, turning a new leaf and ushering in the golden age of America' and said Americans should remember 'wise words' from King: 'We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.' At the end of his life, King reflected on the early backlash to civil rights, especially with integrated housing developments, interracial marriage and necessary economic and social programs. He expressed frustration with then-President Lyndon B. Johnson for prolonging the Vietnam War rather than making a greater investment in anti-poverty efforts. 'This is where the civil rights movement stands today. We will err and falter as we climb the unfamiliar slopes of steep mountains, but there is no alternative, well-trod, level path,' King wrote. 'There will be agonizing setbacks along with creative advances. Our consolation is that no one can know the true taste of victory if he has never swallowed defeat.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/civil-rights-leaders-king-family-issue-call-to-action-as-inauguration-falls-on-mlk-day-/7942973.html	2025-01-19T23:50:22-08:00	
Ukraine reports downing 93 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 93 of the 141 drones that Russian forces launched overnight in attacks targeting regions across the country. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Vinnytsia regions, Ukraine’s air force said. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that Russian attacks, which also included artillery and missiles, damaged four high-rise buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it destroyed more than 30 Ukrainian aerial drones late Sunday and early Monday. Kaluga Governor Vladislav Shapsha said on Telegram that falling debris from a destroyed drone sparked a fire at a business that was quickly extinguished. In Belgorod, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a drone attack hit a car, injuring a woman. The Ukrainian assault also damaged six houses, Gladkov said. Russian air defense also shot down drones over the Bryansk, Kursk, Ryazan, Oryol and Tatarstan regions. Some information for this report was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-reports-downing-93-russian-drones/7942969.html	2025-01-19T23:37:16-08:00	
Donald Trump set to assume US presidency again	Donald Trump returns to the U.S. presidency Monday with an inauguration ceremony in Washington that will make him the first president to serve non-consecutive terms since the 1890s. Millions of Americans are expected to watch on television as the 78-year-old Trump takes the oath of office for a new four-year term in the White House while President Joe Biden, 82, leaves the presidency after a single term. The inauguration ceremony will be a scaled-down event due to frigid weather, with about 600 people witnessing the change of power inside the Capitol instead of the typical outdoor event where 250,000 people had secured tickets. The traditional inaugural parade along Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House has also been canceled because of the weather, with bands, marching units, drill teams and the like now parading past Trump, his wife, Melania Trump and other officials in his new administration at the nearby 20,000-seat Capital One Arena. Lavish black-tie balls are still planned for Monday evening. Trump pledged late Sunday to 'act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country,' as he spoke to supporters in Washington. 'Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and prosperity,' Trump said. He has pledged to sign a flurry of executive orders upon entering office, including those undoing Biden administration policies. Prominent among his pledges during the election campaign was carrying out mass deportations of people who are in the country illegally. Trump has also vowed to quickly impose heightened tariffs on key trading partners, including Canada, China and Mexico. The incoming president says he plans to pardon many of the 1,500 supporters of his who stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, to try to block Congress from certifying that Biden won the 2020 election. Trump has called those arrested and convicted 'patriots' and 'hostages' wrongly prosecuted. Charges that Trump, a Republican, tried to illegally overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden were dropped when he defeated his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election because of a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Trump will become the first felon to serve as U.S. president, after his conviction last year on 34 criminal charges linked to falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star Stormy Daniels, although a judge declined to penalize him in any way. Trump vowed for months to end Russia’s war on Ukraine before he takes office, but in recent days his aides have said the goal now is to try to reach a truce in the fighting in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be around the end of April. He also wants more oil drilling in the U.S. even though in 2023, U.S. energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Two transgender issues have also drawn Trump’s attention. Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, telling his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in women’s sports. 'I will keep men out of women’s sports, 100%, immediately, first day,' Trump told one political rally during the campaign. He also frequently has assailed gender-affirming care, which can include hormone therapy. 'On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on so-called ‘gender affirming care.’' Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse	https://www.voanews.com/a/donald-trump-set-to-assume-us-presidency-again/7942954.html	2025-01-19T22:28:13-08:00	
Taiwan's premier says opposition's budget cuts would cripple key government functions	TEIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan's premier said on Monday the government faced a crisis in day-to-day operations, including national security, because of large cuts to this year's budget proposed by opposition parties, who have cited a need to cut waste. Although Lai Ching-te won the presidential election last year, his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lost its majority in parliament, giving the opposition the most seats and legislative control that includes spending proposals. The main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), together with the small Taiwan People's Party, has proposed a record $6.55 billion in cuts to the budget, about 7% of the total, saying they are targeting waste. The opposition has also proposed freezing another $8.25 billion in spending, a number the cabinet said was 20 times higher than the past average, urging calm and rationality. Speaking to reporters ahead of voting on the budget in parliament on Monday and Tuesday, Premier Cho Jung-tai called it an unprecedented 'budget storm' that would hurt government functions from national security to health care. 'Please withdraw all proposals that would paralyze the government and impact national security,' Cho said. 'It will lead to administrative departments finding it hard to operate, and even basic tasks will be hard to carry out.' 'Hostile China will be very pleased,' Cho added, pointing to cuts to security units, including the digital ministry, which tackles an average of 2.4 million cyber attacks a day, most of which Taiwan says are launched by Chinese cyber forces. Over the weekend, the defense ministry urged the opposition to rethink a 15% cut to its overseas travel budget, which it said will deal a 'very bad impact' to the military's engagements with allies. The opposition has proposed cutting the budgets of some departments, including the China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council, to less than $1. On Saturday, the KMT said that the DPP was trying to protect a 'fat cat budget' filled with waste and that the cuts remained in the proposal stage, accusing the ruling party of rumor mongering and trying to spread fear. 'The budget cut proposals we have seen so far are all in the state of not yet being finalized, but the DPP is so nervous that they are shouting harder than anyone else to protect the green fat cat budget,' it said, referring to the DPP's party color.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-premier-says-opposition-s-budget-cuts-would-cripple-key-government-functions/7942946.html	2025-01-19T21:44:50-08:00	
South Korea braces for Trump's policies with biggest-ever export finance support	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea pledged on Monday a record amount of financing support for exporters to mitigate any negative impact from changes in U.S. trade policies as Donald Trump was poised to be sworn in for his second presidency. The government plans to provide 360 trillion won, or $247.74 billion, worth of policy financing to exporting companies through state-run banks and institutions this year, according to a statement released by the finance ministry. 'There are concerns that external uncertainty will be heightened under the incoming U.S. administration and adversely affect exports,' the ministry said. The ministry said it would also boost insurance support to guard against foreign exchange volatility to $966 million this year, from $827 million last year, and spending on government projects, such as trade fairs and delegations, to $2 billion from $1.45 billion. Sectors particularly under threat of new U.S. policies are semiconductors and rechargeable batteries, the ministry said, whereas defense, nuclear energy and shipbuilding sectors are seen as more promising because of room for cooperation with the United States. U.S. President-elect Trump, who takes office later on Monday, has pledged to impose stiff tariffs on major trading partners, such as Mexico, Canada and China, which are also expected to affect South Korean companies running factories in those countries. Economists say there are worries that the Trump administration will introduce trade policies against South Korea too, after Asia's fourth-largest economy earned a record-high surplus of $55.7 billion in trade with the U.S. in 2024, up 25.4% from 2023. The Korea International Trade Association, South Korea's biggest group of exporting companies, projects export growth to slow to 1.8% this year. Last year, South Korea's exports rose 8.1% to a record high of $683.7 billion, as sales to the U.S. rose 10.4%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-braces-for-trump-s-policies-with-biggest-ever-export-finance-support/7942944.html	2025-01-19T21:17:15-08:00	
The state of the economy: What is Donald Trump inheriting?	Voters prioritized the economy in the 2024 election, sending Donald Trump back to the White House. But what economic legacy is Joe Biden passing on to the new administration? 'It's the economy, stupid.' Coined by political strategist James Carville, these famous words have become synonymous with U.S. election success since 1992. Despite the growing influence of issues like immigration, climate change and foreign policy, many voters still prioritize economic factors when casting their ballots. President-elect Donald Trump claimed he made 'the greatest economy in U.S. history' during his first term and vows to do so again in 2025. But a lot depends on what a president inherits from his predecessors. Low unemployment rates and a soaring stock market built under former President Barack Obama’s administration following the 2008 financial crisis gave Trump a strong foundation the first time around. So, what economic legacy will Trump inherit from Biden? Simply put, high employment rates, strong GDP growth and low inflation often characterize a healthy economy. The country was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic when Biden was sworn in, but the last four years have proven resilient. Biden’s administration created almost 16 million new jobs in America — a key sign of positive economic growth. That good news was overshadowed for many Americans by inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022, with prices increasing by 9.1%. That impacted people’s purchasing power and made everyday items feel expensive. Annual inflation has now eased to around 3% but is still higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and prices for many items remain significantly higher than at the end of Trump’s first term. While real wages have since increased in America, workers may still feel the strain of stubbornly high grocery prices. This was a global issue linked to supply chain challenges and Russia’s war with Ukraine, and ordinary people paid the price. But massive deficit spending under Biden to head off the threat of a major recession also contributed. Biden has preferred to emphasize the promising picture of the jobs market he’s passing on, noting that the United States recorded its lowest unemployment rate in more than half a century during his term. About 2.7 million jobs were lost during Trump’s first term, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So, he’ll face pressure to turn that legacy around. But Trump has already suggested mass layoffs across federal departments during his second term, which could increase unemployment rates if implemented. Another broad signal of a healthy economy is the increased value of goods and services, or GDP, which shows whether an economy is growing. The United States has long had the largest GDP in the world, surpassing nations such as India and China. GDP rose 7.6% during Trump’s first administration and increased by 11.8% under Biden, suggesting a strong post-pandemic recovery. Generally speaking, Biden's economic legacy is one of high employment, recovering GDP and declining inflation. But no president ever inherits a clean slate. The federal debt stands at $36.1 trillion, and public opinion about the economy is, at best, lukewarm. Some financial experts predict inflation may continue declining in 2025, but a broader context of geopolitical tensions, trade wars and climate change may also shape America’s financial future. Trump's task will be to sustain economic momentum while navigating the complexities of a rapidly evolving world.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-state-of-the-economy-what-is-donald-trump-inheriting-/7942933.html	2025-01-19T20:12:45-08:00	
How TikTok grew from a fun app for teens into a potential national security threat	SAN FRANCISCO — If it feels like TikTok has been around forever, that's probably because it has, at least if you're measuring via internet time. What's now in question is whether it will be around much longer and, if so, in what form? Starting in 2017, when the Chinese social video app merged with its competitor Musical.ly, TikTok has grown from a niche teen app into a global trendsetter. While, of course, also emerging as a potential national security threat, according to U.S. officials. On April 24, President Joe Biden signed legislation requiring TikTok parent ByteDance to sell to a U.S. owner within a year or to shut down. TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, filed a lawsuit against the U.S., claiming the security concerns were overblown and the law should be struck down because it violates the First Amendment. The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok, and the popular short form video service went dark in the U.S. — just hours before the ban was set to begin. Here's how TikTok came to this juncture: March 2012 ByteDance is founded in China by entrepreneur Zhang Yimin. Its first hit product is Toutiao, a personalized news aggregator for Chinese users. July 2014 Startup Musical.ly, later known for an eponymous app used to post short lipsyncing music videos, is founded in China by entrepreneur Alex Zhu. July 2015 Musical.ly hits #1 in the Apple App Store, following a design change that made the company's logo visible when users shared their videos. 2016 ByteDance launches Douyin, a video sharing app for Chinese users. Its popularity inspires the company to spin off a version for foreign audiences called TikTok. November 2017 ByteDance acquires Musical.ly for $1 billion. Nine months later, ByteDance merges it with TikTok. Powered by an algorithm that encourages binge-watching, users begin to share a wide variety of video on the app, including dance moves, kitchen food preparation and various 'challenges' to perform, record and post acts that range from serious to satirical. February 2019 Rapper Lil Nas X releases the country-trap song 'Old Town Road' on TikTok, where it goes viral and pushes the song to a record 17 weeks in the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The phenomenon kicks off a wave of TikTok videos from musical artists who suddenly see TikTok as a critical way to reach fans. TikTok settles federal charges of violating U.S. child-privacy laws and agrees to pay a $5.7 million fine. September 2019 The Washington Post reports that while images of Hong Kong democracy protests and police crackdowns are common on most social media sites, they are strangely absent on TikTok. The same story notes that TikTok posts with the #trump2020 tag received more than 70 million views. The company insists that TikTok content moderation, conducted in the U.S., is not responsible and says the app is a place for entertainment, not politics. The Guardian reports on internal documents that reportedly detail how TikTok instructs its moderators to delete or limit the reach of videos touching on topics sensitive to China such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre, Tibetan independence or the sanctioned religious group Falun Gong. October 2019 U.S. politicians begin to raise alarms about TikTok's influence, calling for a federal investigations of its Musical.ly acquisition and a national security probe into TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps. That investigation begins in November, according to news reports. December 2019 The Pentagon recommends that all U.S. military personnel delete TikTok from all phones, personal and government-issued. Some services ban the app on military-owned phones. In January, the Pentagon bans the app from all military phones. TikTok becomes the second-most downloaded app in the world, according to data from analytics firm SensorTower. May 2020 Privacy groups file a complaint alleging TikTok is still violating U.S. child-protection laws and flouting a 2019 settlement agreement. The company 'takes the issue of safely seriously' and continues to improve safeguards, it says. TikTok hires former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its chief executive officer in an apparent attempt to improve its U.S. relations. Mayer resigns three months later. July 2020 India bans TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in response to a border clash with China. President Donald Trump says he is considering banning TikTok as retaliation for China's alleged mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. August 2020 Trump issues a sweeping but vague executive order banning American companies from any 'transaction' with ByteDance and its subsidiaries, including TikTok. Several days later, he issues a second order demanding that ByteDance divest itself of TikTok's U.S. operations within 90 days. Microsoft confirms it is exploring acquisition of TikTok. The deal never materializes; neither does a similar overture from Oracle and Walmart. TikTok, meanwhile, sues the Trump administration for alleged violation of due process in its executive orders. November 2020 Joe Biden is elected president. He doesn't offer new policy on TikTok and won't take office until January, but Trump's plans to force a sale of TikTok start to unravel anyway. The Trump administration extends the deadlines it had imposed on ByteDance and TikTok and eventually lets them slide altogether. February 2021 Newly sworn-in President Joe Biden postpones the legal cases involving Trump's plan to ban TikTok, effectively bringing them to a halt. September 2021 TikTok announces it has more than a billion monthly active users. December 2021 A Wall Street Journal report finds TikTok algorithms can flood teens with a torrent of harmful material such as videos recommending extreme dieting, a form of eating disorder. February 2022 TikTok announces new rules to deter the spread of harmful material such as viral hoaxes and promotion of eating disorders. April 2022 'The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical,' a project created by two fans of the Netflix show as a TikTok project, wins the Grammy for Best Musical Theater Album. TikTok becomes the most downloaded app in the world, beating out Instagram, according to SensorTower data. June 2022 BuzzFeed reports that China-based ByteDance employees have repeatedly accessed the nonpublic information of TikTok users, based on leaked recordings from more than 80 internal TikTok meetings. TikTok responds with a vague comment touting its commitment to security that doesn't directly address the BuzzFeed report. TikTok also announces it has migrated its user data to U.S. servers managed by the U.S. tech firm Oracle. But that doesn't prevent fresh alarm among U.S. officials about the risk of Chinese authorities accessing U.S. user data. December 2022 FBI Director Christopher Wray raises national security concerns about TikTok, warning that Chinese officials could manipulate the app's recommendation algorithm for influence operations. ByteDance also said it fired four employees who accessed data on journalists from Buzzfeed News and The Financial Times while attempting to track down leaks of confidential materials about the company. February 2023 The White House gives federal agencies 30 days to ensure TikTok is deleted from all government-issued mobile devices. Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission warn that ByteDance could share TikTok user data with China's authoritarian government. March 2023 Legislators grill TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at a six-hour congressional hearing where Chew, a native of Singapore, attempts to push back on assertions that TikTok and ByteDance are tools of the Chinese government. January 2024 TikTok said it was restricting a tool some researchers use to analyze popular videos on the platform. March 2024 A bill to ban TikTok or force its sale to a U.S. company gathers steam in Congress. TikTok brings dozens of its creators to Washington to tell lawmakers to back off, while emphasizing changes the company has made to protect user data. TikTok also annoys legislators by sending notifications to users urging them to 'speak up now' or risk seeing TikTok banned; users then flood congressional offices with calls. The House of Representatives passes the TikTok ban-or-sell bill. April 2024 The Senate follows suit, sending the bill to President Biden, who signs it. May 2024 TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance sue the U.S. federal government to challenge a law that would force the sale of ByteDance's stake or face a ban, saying that the law is unconstitutional. June 2024 Former President Donald Trump joins TikTok and begins posting campaign-related content. July 2024 Vice President Kamala Harris joins TikTok and also begins posting campaign-related material. Dec. 6, 2024 A federal appeals court panel unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S. The panel of judges rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment. Dec. 27, 2024 President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a 'political resolution' to the issue. Jan. 17, 2025 The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning unless it's sold by its China-based parent company, holding that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app. A ban is set to into effect on Jan. 19, 2025. Jan. 18, 2025 TikTok users in the United States were prevented from watching videos on the popular social media platform just hours before a federal ban was set to take effect. 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,' a message in the app said. 'Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now.' The company's app was also removed from prominent app stores, including the ones operated by Apple and Google, while its website told users that the short-form video platform was no longer available. Jan. 19, 2025 Shortly after the app went dark for U.S. users, Trump said he would issue an executive order upon taking office to grant TikTok an extension so that it could remain online. A few hours later, TikTok restored service to users in the United States, saying that Trump had provided 'the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-tiktok-grew-from-a-fun-app-for-teens-into-a-potential-national-security-threat/7942904.html	2025-01-19T19:37:19-08:00	
Washington braces for Trump Inauguration	WASHINGTON — Metal fences, concrete barriers and security checkpoints still line many the walkways and cross streets of the National Mall – extending from the U.S. Capitol down past some of Washington’s most noted landmarks – as the nation prepares to swear in its 47th president. But while the 0.6-square-kilometer (146-acre) swath of land is often the highlight of many a tourist visit, it is no longer the focus of security efforts for when President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office for a second time. Frigid temperatures forecast for much of Monday led Trump to move the festivities inside – the inauguration to the U.S. Capitol Rotunda and the traditional inaugural parade to the nearby Capital One Arena. The changes, first announced Friday, presented a last-minute hitch for security and law enforcement officials, who had been planning for the inauguration for the past year. And it has left them, and the approximately 25,000 law enforcement and military personnel charged with security, with multiple challenges. 'We will shift those assets,' said the U.S. Secret Service’s Matt McCool, briefing reporters Sunday. 'We have not cut anything from what our original plan was,' he said. 'I’m very confident, with our partners here, we will be ready.' The numbers could make the situation especially trying. Organizers had expected about 250,000 ticketed guests to descend on the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall to watch the inauguration. Only a select few will be allowed into the Capitol Rotunda, which accommodates just 600 people. And the Capital One Area seats just 20,000. If even just a fraction of the 250,000 people who had planned on attending the inauguration try to get to the arena, there could be a crunch. Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said Sunday her force, bolstered by and about 4,000 police officers from across the U.S., will be ready. 'Nothing has really changed,' Smith told reporters. 'The police officers that were committed and dedicated to coming here, we’ll be flexible in how we’ll adjust [their] movement. … So, we will still have police officers in places and spaces around our city as we initially planned.' Some of those officers, Smith said, will still be assigned to the original parade route in anticipation that some people will try to get a glimpse of the presidential motorcade as it goes by. U.S. Capitol Police said they also anticipate having officers on the periphery of the West Front of the Capitol – now closed off with the inauguration moved indoors – ready to direct ticketed guests who will no longer be able to attend. In addition, the inaugural security contingent, which includes the U.S. Secret Service, the FBI, U.S. Capitol Police, Washington Metropolitan Police, and some 7,800 members of the U.S. Army and Air National Guard, will all be coordinated from a command center linked into an expanded network of cameras keeping watch on the city. And though security measures in some areas, including along parts of the National Mall, have been relaxed, officials said there will be plenty of reminders for anyone coming to Washington that this is no ordinary time. 'They will see tactical teams,' McCool said, during an earlier briefing with reporters last week. 'They'll see, officers and agents on rooftops, they’ll see checkpoints. They'll see road closures and barriers in concrete.' Even before the inauguration was moved inside, officials had been preparing for what they described as 'a higher threat environment,' cautioning the security plans for this inauguration were already more robust than in the past. 'The biggest threat, I think, for all of us remains the lone actor,' said Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger. 'That threat … remains the biggest justification for us being on this heightened stage state of alert.' Those concerns were heightened following the New Year’s Day terror attack and truck ramming in New Orleans and the Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Earlier this month Capitol Police arrested two men suspected of trying to disrupt the state funeral for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, one who tried to bring knives and a machete into the Capitol and another who set their car on fire. Research, including a recent survey by the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, adds to the concerns. 'Over 5% of the American public supports the use of force to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president,' Robert Pape, the project’s director, told VOA. 'That equates to 14,000,000 American adults,' he said. 'That's an unfortunately disturbing number.' Already, Trump was also the target of two attempted assassinations. There is also an ongoing threat from Iran. Despite repeated Iranian denials, U.S. security and law enforcement officials have accused Tehran of trying to kill Trump, unveiling one plot set to be carried out last year, in the days after the U.S. presidential election. For now, though, U.S. officials see no signs of impending trouble. 'The FBI is not currently tracking any credible or specific threats to the inaugural ceremony or the Capitol complex,' the bureau’s Washington Field Office told VOA. 'We will continue to work closely with our partners to share information and identify and disrupt any threats that may emerge.' Another source for concern is the tens of thousands of protesters, though so far, there have been no major incidents. Saturday’s People’s March, which was permitted to have as many as 50,000 protesters, sparked only brief tensions with Trump supporters. Another group, called We Fight Back, has permits for protests involving about 10,000 people in across several locations on Monday. 'Please note that [we] will ensure your right to peacefully protest and assemble,' said the Metropolitan Police Department’s Smith. 'However, I want to reiterate, as I always have, that violence, destruction and unlawful behavior will not be tolerated,' she said. 'Offenders will face swift and decisive consequences … anyone who thinks that they can come into this city to destroy property, we will be prepared to deal with them.' Kim Lewis contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/washington-braces-for-trump-inauguration/7942899.html	2025-01-19T18:07:36-08:00	
American journalist Austin Tice's mother, in Damascus, hopes to find missing son	Damascus, Syria — The mother of American journalist Austin Tice, who was taken captive during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2012, arrived in Damascus to step up the search for her son and said she hopes she can take him home with her. Tice, who worked as a freelance reporter for The Washington Post and McClatchy, was one of the first U.S. journalists to make it into Syria after the outbreak of the civil war. His mother, Debra Tice, drove into the Syrian capital from Lebanon with Nizar Zakka, the head of Hostage Aid Worldwide, an organization which is searching for Austin and believes he is still in Syria. 'It'd be lovely to put my arms around Austin while I'm here. It'd be the best,' Debra Tice told Reuters in the Syrian capital Saturday, which she last visited in 2015 to meet with Syrian authorities about her son, before they stopped granting her visas. The overthrow of Bashar al-Assad's regime in December by Syrian rebels has allowed her to visit again from her home in Texas. 'I feel very strongly that Austin's here, and I think he knows I'm here... I'm here,' she said. Debra Tice and Zakka are hoping to meet with Syria's new authorities, including the head of its new administration Ahmed al-Sharaa, to push for information about Austin. They are also optimistic that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday, will take up the cause. 'I am hoping to get some answers. And of course, you know, we have [the] inauguration on Monday, and I think that should be a huge change,' she said. 'I know that President Trump is quite a negotiator, so I have a lot of confidence there. But now we have an unknown on this (Syrian) side. It's difficult to know, if those that are coming in even have the information about him,' she said. Her son, now 43, was taken captive in August 2012, while traveling through the Damascus suburb of Daraya. Reuters reported earlier that in 2013 Tice, a former Marine, managed to slip out of his cell and was seen moving between houses in the streets of Damascus' upscale Mazzeh neighborhood. The New York Times first reported that brief escape and recapture. He was recaptured soon after his escape, likely by forces who answered directly to Assad, current and former U.S. officials said. Debra Tice came to Syria in 2012 and 2015 to meet with Syrian authorities, who never confirmed that Tice was in their custody, both she and Zakka said. She criticized outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, saying they did not negotiate hard enough for her son's release, even in recent months. 'We certainly felt like President Biden was very well positioned to do everything possible to bring Austin home, right? I mean, this was the end of his career. This would be a wonderful thing for him to do. So, we had an expectation. He pardoned his own son, right? So, where's my son?' Debra Tice said her 'mind was just spinning' as she drove across the Lebanese border into Syria and teared up as she spoke about the tens of thousands whose loved ones were held in Assad's notorious prison system and whose fate remains unknown. 'I have a lot in common with a lot of Syrian mothers and families, and just thinking about how this is affecting them — do they have the same hope that I do, that they're going to open a door, that they're going to see their loved one?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-journalist-austin-tice-s-mother-in-damascus-hopes-to-find-missing-son/7942874.html	2025-01-19T16:50:13-08:00	
Indonesia's Mount Ibu erupts more than 1,000 times this month	Ternate, Indonesia — A volcano in eastern Indonesia has erupted at least a thousand times this month, according to an official report Sunday as efforts were underway to evacuate thousands of villagers living near the rumbling mountain. Mount Ibu, on the remote island of Halmahera in North Maluku province, sent a column of smoke up to four kilometers (2.5 miles) into the sky in an eruption Wednesday. Indonesian officials raised its alert status to the highest level and called for the evacuation of 3,000 people living in six nearby villages. It was one of 1,079 eruptions by the volcano recorded since Jan. 1 by Indonesia's Geological Agency, sending columns of ash reaching between 0.3 and 4 kilometers above its peak, according to the agency's data gathered by AFP. The latest big eruption occurred Sunday at 1:15 a.m. local time as it spewed a towering cloud of ash 1.5 kilometers into the air. 'The ash was grey, with moderate to thick intensity, drifting southwest. A loud rumbling sound was heard all the way to Mount Ibu Observation Post,' the agency said in a statement. It added that the volcano had erupted 17 times on Sunday alone. Despite deciding to evacuate affected villagers, local authorities had only managed to evacuate 517 residents as of Sunday, pledging to persuade those who remained to stay in safe shelters. Many have refused to evacuate, arguing that they were used to the situation and were in harvest season. 'There might be economic considerations, as many residents are in the middle of harvesting crops. However, we will continue to educate the community and encourage them to evacuate,' said Adietya Yuni Nurtono, Ternate district military commander in charge of a safe shelter. Mount Ibu, one of Indonesia's most active volcanos, has shown a significant increase in activity since last June. Residents living near Mount Ibu and tourists have been advised to avoid a five- to six-kilometer exclusion zone around the volcano's peak and to wear face masks in case of falling ash. As of 2022, around 700,000 people were living on Halmahera island, according to official data. Indonesia, a vast archipelago, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity as it lies along the Pacific Ring of Fire. Last November, Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, a 1,703-meter (5,587-foot) twin-peaked volcano on the tourist island of Flores erupted more than a dozen times in one week, killing nine people in its initial explosion. Mount Ruang in North Sulawesi province erupted more than half a dozen times last year, forcing thousands from nearby islands to evacuate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-mount-ibu-erupts-more-than-1-000-times-this-month-/7942866.html	2025-01-19T16:31:11-08:00	
Trump's inauguration will be first attended by foreign leaders	For the first time in U.S. history, a president-elect will welcome foreign leaders for one of the most American political traditions — the peaceful transfer of power. President-elect Donald Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and conservative world leaders such as Argentine President Javier Milei and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni to the inauguration. Xi sent his vice president as his representative. No heads of state have previously made an official visit to the U.S. for the inauguration. Some of them, such as Milei and Paraguay's President Santiago Peña, were special guests Saturday night at the Hispanic Inaugural Ball, where several of Trump's nominees for key Cabinet positions made appearances. That included U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, chosen to lead the State Department, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tapped to head the Health and Human Services Department. Here is a look at the foreign leaders who are coming to Washington for the 60th inauguration: China Chinese President Xi Jinping was the first foreign leader whose invitation to the inauguration became public in December. Xi will not attend but is sending Vice President Han Zheng. The announcement to dispatch Han was made Friday by the country's foreign ministry, and it comes as the rivalry between the U.S. and China may escalate under Trump. Several of Trump's Cabinet picks are known China hawks, including Rubio, who has called China 'the most potent, dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.' Trump has vowed to impose tariffs and other measures on China. But the two leaders spoke on the phone Friday and discussed trade, fentanyl and TikTok. Trump said the call was a 'very good one.' Argentina Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the Nov. 5 election, traveling from Buenos Aires to the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago club. Milei is scheduled to attend one of the official inaugural balls that Trump will attend on Inauguration Day, as well as the swearing-in ceremony. The self-described 'anarcho-capitalist,' who has carried out an audacious economic agenda in the South American nation, got a hug from Vivek Ramaswamy, a Trump insider, on stage at Hispanic ball before delivering remarks. Ramaswamy called him 'an inspiration.' Milei also receives praise frequently from billionaire Elon Musk for implementing a series of austerity measures that laid off tens of thousands of government workers, froze public infrastructure projects and imposed wage and pension freezes below inflation. Musk and Ramaswamy will lead a non-governmental effort to cut federal government spending, regulations and personnel. Milei hopes good relations with the U.S. could help Argentina reach a new deal with the International Monetary Fund. Italy Meloni is another leader who has recently visited Mar-a-Lago. Her weekly agenda says she will attend the swearing-in ceremony. Meloni kept unexpectedly good relations with Democratic President Joe Biden but is likely to form a more natural alliance with Trump. She is considered a key interlocutor between Europe and the U.S. Georgia Pro-Western former Georgia President Salome Zourabichvili will attend the ceremony as a guest of Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson. Georgia has been wracked by protests following a parliamentary election that opposition groups alleged was rigged. She has maintained she is still the legitimate leader of the former Soviet republic after Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as president late last month from a party that critics have accused of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Kavelashvili's ruling party has denied those accusations. Zourabichvili told Fox News that Georgia could be 'the big success for America or the big problem for America' in the region because 'Russia is always trying to dominate.' France French President Emmanuel Macron, who met with Trump last month in Paris during the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening, won't be at Trump's inauguration. But far-right figures from the country have said they are traveling for the inauguration. Eric Zemmour, a talk show pundit turned conservative politician, and his partner, Sarah Knafo, a member of the European Parliament, said they will attend. Zemmour was convicted multiple times of inciting racist or religious hatred. Prominent far-right politician Marion Maréchal said in a statement that she would go as well. She is a member of the European Parliament and niece of the leading conservative figure in France eyeing the 2027 presidential election. Who else? The offices of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and Paraguayan President Santiago Pena have said they were invited to the inauguration and planned to attend. Pena, a conservative economist turned politician, praised Trump's agenda and said at the Hispanic ball that he hoped for deeper ties between U.S. and Latin America. Taiwan sent legislative speaker Han Kuo-yu and seven others to Washington for Trump's inauguration, but Taiwan's foreign ministry said its delegates would not attend the ceremony now that it has been moved indoors because of cold weather. Taiwan's official Central News Agency, citing Taiwan's foreign ministry, also reported that the delegates would meet American politicians and think tank scholars to cement Taiwan-U.S. relations. It's unclear if they will meet Trump. Trump has criticized Taiwan for pulling some of the semiconductor industry from the U.S., but U.S.-Taiwan relations also significantly improved during his first term. On a phone call Friday between Trump and Xi, the Chinese president urged the incoming U.S. leader to approach the Taiwan issue 'with prudence' because it is about China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Beijing claims the self-governed island as Chinese territory and vows to annex it by force if necessary.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-inauguration-will-be-first-attended-by-foreign-leaders/7942860.html	2025-01-19T16:22:06-08:00	
Trump promises 'brand new day,' harsh immigration limits at pre-inauguration victory rally	Washington — Donald Trump told thousands of roaring supporters he would impose severe limits on immigration on his first day in office, vowing to swiftly fulfill the central promise of his presidential campaign on Sunday at a rally inside a packed Washington arena a day before he returns to power. 'By the time the sun sets tomorrow, the invasion of our country will have come to a halt,' he said to cheers at a 'Make America Great Again Victory Rally' at the Capital One Arena. Trump repeated his campaign pledge to launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, which would remove millions of immigrants. An operation of that scale, however, would likely take years and be hugely costly. The rally resembled the free-wheeling campaign speeches that have been a Trump staple since his first White House run in 2016. 'This is the greatest political movement in American history, and 75 days ago, we achieved the most epic political victory our country has ever seen,' he said. 'Starting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed of strength and fix every single crisis facing our country.' The event marked his first major address in Washington since his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, that preceded the storming of the U.S. Capitol by an angry mob of his supporters. Trump has said he will pardon many of the more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the attack. Trump said he would 'get radical woke ideologies the hell out of our military' and order the military to construct a missile defense shield over the U.S., though he has yet to offer details on how to carry it out. He also promised to reverse the 'over-classification' of government documents, a seeming reference to his federal indictment for retaining classified papers after leaving office. That case, along with a separate federal indictment for plotting to overturn the 2020 election, was dropped by the Justice Department after Trump won in November. The indoor hockey and basketball venue will also host some of Monday's inauguration festivities after forecasts of bitter cold prompted officials to move the planned outdoor events inside. He also pledged to release classified documents relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Earlier on Sunday, Trump had breakfast with Republican U.S. senators at Blair House, the guest quarters across from the White House. John Cornyn, Susan Collins, Ted Cruz, Rick Scott and Tim Scott were among the attendees seen leaving the event. He later placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington. Trump saluted the tomb as a military bugler played 'Taps.' Ahead of the event, Trump's fans, many dressed in the campaign's trademark red jackets and MAGA hats, waited in a cold, driving rain along several downtown Washington blocks, some chanting 'USA! USA!' Val Tordjman, 58, had traveled across the country from Denver with tickets to watch the inauguration. When he heard the ceremony was being moved inside, notably cutting the size of the in-person audience, he said, 'I felt like crying.' Tordjman said he planned to spend the night on the street next to the arena, despite temperatures forecast to plunge to around 19 degrees Fahrenheit (-7 degrees Celsius). He said he had yet to see Trump in person. 'This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,' he said. Large swaths of the streets around the U.S. Capitol and White House have been blocked off by steel fences since last week, and police were visible throughout the city. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew planned to attend the rally, hours after the company announced it was restoring its service thanks to Trump's promise to delay a U.S. ban that took effect on Sunday. Chew is also expected to join other tech executives at Trump's inauguration on Monday, including the world's richest man, Elon Musk, a close Trump confidant who made a brief appearance on stage with Trump. Trump took credit for bringing TikTok back online and said the U.S. would do a 'joint venture' to save the app alongside bidders to buy the company. The inauguration is scheduled for noon ET (1700 GMT) on Monday, when Trump will take the presidential oath of office inside the rotunda of the Capitol building, after the cold weather prompted organizers to move the ceremony indoors. Approximately 25,000 law enforcement personnel will be on hand to provide security.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-promises-brand-new-day-harsh-immigration-limits-at-pre-inauguration-victory-rally/7942852.html	2025-01-19T16:10:21-08:00	
WHO says needs full access to Gaza after Israel-Hamas truce	Geneva — The World Health Organization said Sunday it was ready to pour much-needed aid into Gaza after the Israel-Hamas truce takes effect but that it would need 'systematic access' across the territory to do so. Much of the Gaza Strip's health infrastructure has been demolished by the more than year-long war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas before a truce took hold Sunday. While the United Nations' health body was 'ready to scale up the response' to address the territory's critical needs, the WHO said, 'it is critical that the security obstacles hindering operations are removed.' 'WHO will need conditions on the ground that allow systematic access to the population across Gaza, enabling the influx of aid via all possible borders and routes, and lifting restrictions on the entry of essential items,' the agency said in a statement. Until the truce, Israel had complete control over the volume and nature of aid allowed into Gaza. Warning that the 'health challenges ahead are immense,' the Geneva-based agency estimated the cost of rebuilding Gaza's battered health system in the years to come at 'billions in investment.' Last week the WHO put the figure at more than $10 billion. 'Only half of Gaza's 36 hospitals remain partially operational, nearly all hospitals are damaged or partly destroyed, and just 38% of primary health care centers are functional,' the WHO said. Basing its figures on those provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which the U.N. considers reliable, the WHO put the war's toll in Gaza at more than 46,600 people killed and over 110,000 injured. A quarter of those injured 'face life-changing injuries and will need ongoing rehabilitation,' the U.N. body estimated. Around another 12,000 people need to be evacuated for urgent treatment elsewhere, it added, while warning the destruction of health infrastructure had had knock-on effects. The WHO also expressed concern over the 'breakdown of public order, exacerbated by armed gangs' interfering with aid deliveries to Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-says-needs-full-access-to-gaza-after-israel-hamas-truce/7942614.html	2025-01-19T15:55:55-08:00	
Pope calls for Gaza ceasefire to be 'immediately respected'	Vatican City — Pope Francis called Sunday for a ceasefire in Gaza to be 'immediately respected,' as he thanked mediators and urged a boost in humanitarian aid as well as the return of hostages. 'I express gratitude to all the mediators,' the Argentine pontiff said shortly after the start of a truce between Israel and Hamas began. 'Thanks to all the parties involved in this important outcome. I hope that, as agreed, it will be immediately respected by the parties and that all the hostages will finally be able to go home to hug their loved ones again,' he said. 'I pray so much for them, and their families. I also hope that humanitarian aid will even more quickly reach... the people of Gaza, who have so many urgent needs,' Francis said. 'Both Israelis and Palestinians need clear signs of hope. I hope that the political authorities of both, with the help of the international community, can reach the right two-state solution. 'May everyone say yes to dialogue, yes to reconciliation, yes to peace,' he added. A total of 33 hostages taken by militants during Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel are scheduled to be returned from Gaza during an initial 42-day truce. Under the deal, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are to be released from Israeli jails. The truce is intended to pave the way for an end to more than 15 months of war sparked by Hamas' attack, the deadliest in Israeli history. It follows a deal struck by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of negotiations, and takes effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration as U.S. president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-calls-for-gaza-ceasefire-to-be-immediately-respected-/7942606.html	2025-01-19T15:19:26-08:00	
Cutting Afghanistan funds 'biggest threat to helping women,' aid chief warns	Funding cuts to Afghanistan are the biggest threat to helping the country’s women, the chief of a top aid agency warned Sunday. Jan Egeland, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said women and girls were bearing the brunt of dwindling financial support for nongovernmental groups and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. The NRC helped 772,484 Afghans in 2022. That number fell to 491,435 in 2023. Last year, the aid agency helped 216,501 people. Half of its beneficiaries are women. Egeland, who has made several visits to Afghanistan since 2021, said: 'We see one after the other peer organization cutting programming and staff in the last two years. The biggest threat to programs helping Afghan women is funding cuts. The biggest threat to the future well-being of Afghan women is [the lack of] education.' The Taliban takeover in August 2021 drove millions into poverty and hunger after foreign aid stopped almost overnight. Sanctions against the country’s new rulers, a halt on bank transfers and frozen billions in Afghanistan’s currency reserves have cut off access to global institutions and the outside money that supported the aid-dependent economy before the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces. The U.N. and others have urged the international community to continue supporting the beleaguered country. Organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council have helped keep public services afloat through education and health care programs, including nutrition and immunization. But women and girls face more obstacles in accessing health care and education because of restrictions imposed by authorities and an ongoing shortage of female medical professionals, also exacerbated by Taliban decrees. Egeland said Afghan women and girls had not forgotten world leaders telling them their 'number one priority' was education and human rights. 'Now we can’t even fund livelihood programming for widows and single mothers,' he told The Associated Press by telephone from the western province of Herat. The international community provided humanitarian assistance in many countries where they disagreed with local policies. But opposition to Taliban policies, together with a 'general starving' of aid funding in many countries, was worsening the shortfall in Afghanistan, he said. Egeland said most of his discussions with Taliban officials on his trip were about the need to resume classes for women and girls. 'They still argue that it will happen, but the conditions are not right,' he said. 'They say they need to agree on what the conditions are.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cutting-afghanistan-funds-biggest-threat-to-helping-women-aid-chief-warns/7942601.html	2025-01-19T15:08:01-08:00

California marine sanctuary protects waters from oil drilling	After President Joe Biden announced a ban on oil and gas drilling off most of the U.S. coastline in early January, President-elect Donald Trump quickly vowed to reverse it after he takes office on January 20. But there is one section of the California coast that has gained more permanent protection from drilling - a new national marine sanctuary. Genia Dulot takes us underwater for a look.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-marine-sanctuary-protects-waters-from-oil-drilling/7942585.html	2025-01-19T14:40:58-08:00	
Weary Los Angeles firefighters brace for 'last' dangerous winds	Los Angeles — Exhausted Los Angeles firefighters braced Sunday for the return of yet more dangerously strong gusts, as California's governor slammed 'hurricane-force winds of misinformation' surrounding blazes that have killed 27 people. The two largest fires, which have obliterated almost 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) and razed entire neighborhoods of the second biggest U.S. city, were for the first time both more than half contained, officials announced. But the National Weather Service warned that powerful winds and low humidity would again bring 'dangerous high-end red flag fire weather conditions' from Monday, with gusts up to 130 kilometers (80 miles) per hour potentially returning. 'This is the last... we hope, of the extreme' wind events, said Governor Gavin Newsom. It will be 'the fourth major wind event just in the last three months — we only had two in the prior four years,' he told MSNBC's 'Inside with Jen Psaki' show. Officials were accused of being unprepared for the outbreak of fires this month. Now, 135 fire engines and their crews are prepositioned to tackle new outbreaks, along with helicopters and bulldozers, said Newsom. Firefighters, who since Jan. 7 have been battling flames, digging trenches and uprooting vegetation to create perimeters around fires non-stop, said the largest conflagration, the Palisades Fire, was 52% contained. That fire has killed at least 10 people. Evacuation orders were lifted this weekend for dozens of neighborhoods in upscale western Los Angeles. Farther east, the Eaton Fire, which killed at least 17 in the Altadena suburbs, is 81% contained. More residents were able to return to their homes there too. Others reunited with missing pets they had feared were dead. Serena Null told AFP of her joy at finding her cat, Domino, after having to leave him behind as flames devoured her family home in Altadena. The pair were reunited at NGO Pasadena Humane, where Domino — suffering singed paws, a burnt nose and a high level of stress — was taken after being rescued. 'I just was so relieved and just so happy that he was here,' a tearful Null told AFP. No 'magical spigot' As Los Angeles learns the true scale of the devastation, political bickering has intensified. Donald Trump, set to be sworn in Monday as U.S. president, has sharply criticized California officials. He falsely claimed that Newsom had blocked the diversion of 'excess rain and snow melt from the North.' Los Angeles's water supplies are mainly fed via aqueducts and canals originating from entirely separate river basins farther east. 'What's not helpful or beneficial... is these wild-eyed fantasies... that somehow there's a magical spigot in northern California that just can be turned on, all of a sudden there will be rain or water flowing everywhere,' said Newsom. Citing conversations with firefighters on the ground during 100 mile-per-hour windstorms that first sparked the fires, Newsom added: 'There's not a municipal system in the world that's designed to address a fire of that acuity.' The governor blamed Elon Musk — the Tesla and SpaceX owner poised to play a key role advising the incoming administration — 'and others' for 'hurricane-force winds of mis- and dis-information that can divide a country on a myriad of issues.' President-elect Trump said he hopes to visit the region soon, 'probably at the end of the week.' Emergency officials Sunday continued to survey the damage, going house-to-house with dogs in search of human remains, and ramping up the daunting task of clearing endless tons of debris. The region has experienced its driest start of the year since 1850, according to Newsom. Well into its typical rainy season, Los Angeles has had almost no rain since May. Although rain is still not expected imminently, Newsom warned of the need to prepare 'for potential flooding in the next week or two,' as rain, when it comes, pours down hillsides denuded by the fires. 'I prepositioned 2,500 National Guard. We're going to start some sandbagging operations,' he said. 'We're dealing with extremes that we have never dealt with in the past' due to the changing climate, said the governor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/weary-los-angeles-firefighters-brace-for-last-dangerous-winds/7942562.html	2025-01-19T13:35:44-08:00	
Keke Palmer’s ‘One of Them Days,’ ‘Mufasa’ race for No. 1	WASHINGTON — The Keke Palmer buddy comedy 'One of Them Days' opened in first place on the North American box office charts on a particularly slow Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. The R-rated Sony release earned $11.6 million from 2,675 theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday, beating Disney’s 'Mufasa: The Lion King' by a hair. By the end of Monday's holiday, 'Mufasa' will have the edge, however. 'One of Them Days' cost only $14 million to produce, which it is expected to earn by Monday. The very well-reviewed buddy comedy stars Palmer and SZA as friends and roommates scrambling to get money for rent before their landlord evicts them. Notably it’s the first Black female-led theatrical comedy since 'Girls Trip' came out in 2017 and it currently carries a stellar 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But the marketplace was also quite weak overall. The total box office for Friday, Saturday and Sunday will add up to less than $80 million, according to data from Comscore, making it one of the worst Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekends since 1997. 'For an individual film like ‘One of Them Days’ this was a great weekend,' said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. 'You can still find success stories within what is overall a low grossing weekend for movie theaters.' The Walt Disney Co.’s 'Mufasa' was close by in second place with $11.5 million from the weekend, its fifth playing in theaters. Globally, the Barry Jenkins-directed prequel has made $588 million. It even beat a brand-new offering, the Blumhouse horror 'Wolf Man,' which debuted in third place with $10.6 million from 3,354 North American theaters. Writer-director Leigh Whannell’s monster tale starring Christopher Abbott and Julia Garner did not enter theaters with great reviews. It currently carries a 53% on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviews don’t generally affect the success of horror movies in their first weekend, but audiences also gave it a lackluster C- CinemaScore in exit polls. The Blumhouse production and Universal Pictures release cost a reported $25 million to make and is expected to reach $12 million by the close of Monday’s holiday. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' was in fourth place with $8.6 million and 'Den of Thieves 2' rounded out the top five with $6.6 million. In specialty releases, Brady Corbert's 215-minute post-war epic 'The Brutalist' expanded to 388 screens where it made nearly $2 million over the weekend. A24 reported that it sold out various 70mm and IMAX showings. The studio also re-released its Colman Domingo drama 'Sing Sing' in theaters and prisons, where over 1 million incarcerated people in 46 states were able to view the film. The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend has seen major successes in the past. Dergarabedian noted 'Bad Boys for Life,' which had a three-day opening of $62.5 million in 2020, and 'American Sniper,' which earned $89.3 in its first weekend in wide release in 2016. 'This is a year that’s going to get a big boost starting with ‘Captain America: Brave New World’ and ‘Paddington in Peru’ in February,' Dergarabedian said. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. 'One of Them Days,' $11.6 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $11.5 million. 3. 'Wolf Man,' $10.6 million. 4. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $8.6 million. 5. 'Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,' $6.6 million. 6. 'Moana 2,' $6.1 million. 7. 'Nosferatu,' $4.3 million. 8. 'A Complete Unknown,' $3.8 million. 9. 'Wicked,' $3.6 million. 10. 'Babygirl,' $2 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/keke-palmer-s-one-of-them-days-mufasa-race-for-no-1-/7942568.html	2025-01-19T13:32:48-08:00	
Donald Trump set to assume US presidency again	A hallmark of the nearly 250-year American democracy is the quadrennial peaceful transfer of presidential power, and it is set to unfold again on Monday, with Donald Trump, the 45th president until he lost his 2020 reelection bid, set to be inaugurated as the country’s 47th leader after winning last November’s election. Millions of Americans are expected to watch on television as the 78-year-old Trump takes the oath of office for a new four-year term in the White House while President Joe Biden, 82, leaves the presidency after a single term. But only about 600 people will see Trump sworn in live, with the ceremony moved into the U.S. Capitol Rotunda at Trump’s behest. An arrival Sunday night of an Arctic blast of frigid air into Washington could push the temperature to -6 Celsius at noon on Monday, when the traditional outdoor swearing-in ceremony would normally be held on the steps of the Capitol overlooking the National Mall. It is expected to be the coldest Inauguration Day in Washington in 40 years, when Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration was also moved inside in 1985. About 250,000 tickets to Trump’s planned outdoor ceremony on the Capitol steps had been handed out to his supporters and dignitaries but inaugural officials said they now can simply keep the ducats as commemorative souvenirs. The traditional inaugural parade along Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House has also been canceled because of the weather, with bands, marching units, drill teams and the like now parading past Trump, his wife, Melania Trump and other officials in his new administration at the nearby 20,000-seat Capital One Arena, with thousands of other celebrants literally left out in the cold. Lavish black-tie balls are still planned for Monday evening. Trump’s ascendancy to power again comes with some historical footnotes: He will become the first felon to serve as U.S. president, after his conviction last year on 34 criminal charges linked to falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star Stormy Daniels, although a judge declined to penalize him in any way. Charges that Trump, a Republican, tried to illegally overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden were dropped when he defeated his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election because of a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Trump will also become the second U.S. president to serve a second nonconsecutive term, after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. Beyond the pomp and circumstances of U.S. inaugurals, both Trump’s supportive Republican colleagues and opposition Democrats will be closely watching to see what policy changes he quickly announces with executive orders to undo Biden edicts or simply to push forward with planks from his winning campaign against Harris. Trump’s Day 1 promises are wide-ranging, but whether he signs orders affecting all of them or spreads out some of them to the coming days is not certain. Perhaps his most persistent claim from the campaign trail is that he plans to deport more than 11 million undocumented migrants living in the United States, starting with migrants who have been convicted of crimes and then others who have been ordered to return to their home countries after losing asylum bids to stay in the U.S. But an apparent Trump plan to begin the immigration crackdown on Tuesday in Chicago leaked to U.S. media outlets, leaving Trump’s handpicked 'border czar,' Tom Homan, to say that that the timing of the deportation plan is now being reconsidered. 'We’re looking at this leak and will make a decision based on this leak,' Homan told The Washington Post. 'It’s unfortunate because anyone leaking law enforcement operations puts officers at greater risk.' Nonetheless, Homan said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency 'will start arresting public safety threats and national security threats on day one. We’ll be arresting people across the country, uninhibited by any prior (Biden) administration guidelines. Why Chicago was mentioned specifically, I don’t know.' 'This is nationwide thing,' he said. 'We’re not sweeping neighborhoods. We have a targeted enforcement plan.' Trump has also vowed to close the southwestern U.S. border with Mexico and force would-asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their claims to stay in the U.S. are adjudicated. All of his get-tough-on-migrant plans are sure to draw legal challenges from advocates supporting those seeking a new life in the U.S., possibly leaving Trump’s actions in limbo for extended periods, weeks, maybe months. Related to immigration, Trump says he wants to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the United States, although it is part of the U.S. Constitution, so it is not clear how he plans to try to do that unilaterally. Trump has also vowed to quickly impose heightened tariffs on key trading partners, including Canada, China and Mexico. The incoming president says he plans to pardon many of the 1,500 supporters of his who stormed the Capitol building on January 6, 2021, to try to block Congress from certifying that Biden won the 2020 election. Trump has called those arrested and convicted 'patriots' and 'hostages' wrongly prosecuted. It is not clear whether Trump will pardon only those convicted of relatively minor offenses or include those convicted of attacking the 140 law enforcement officials who were injured in the mayhem four years ago. Trump vowed for months to end Russia’s war on Ukraine before he takes office, but in recent days his aides have said the goal now is to try to reach a truce in the fighting in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be around the end of April. Trump also wants more oil drilling in the U.S. even though in 2023, U.S. energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Two transgender issues have also drawn Trump’s attention. Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, telling his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in women’s sports. 'I will keep men out of women’s sports, 100%, immediately, first day,' Trump told one political rally during the campaign. He also frequently has assailed gender-affirming care, which can include hormone therapy. 'On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on so-called ‘gender affirming care.’'	https://www.voanews.com/a/donald-trump-set-to-assume-us-presidency-again/7942546.html	2025-01-19T12:41:08-08:00

Biden urges Americans to 'keep the faith' as he spends final full day as president in South Carolina	NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — Joe Biden spent his final full day as president Sunday in South Carolina, urging Americans to 'keep the faith in a better day to come' and reflecting on the impact of the civil rights movement in pushing him into politics. On the eve of Monday's inauguration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, Biden delivered a final farewell from a state that holds special meaning after his commanding win in its 2020 Democratic primary set him up to achieve his life's goal of being elected president of the United States. Biden spoke to the congregation of Royal Missionary Baptist Church about why he entered public service — Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were political heroes, he said — and he thanked South Carolina for its support: 'I owe you big.' Monday is the federal holiday honoring King, the slain civil rights leader. 'We know the struggle to redeeming the soul of this nation is difficult and ongoing,' Biden said. 'We must hold on to hope. We must stay engaged. We must always keep the faith in the better day to come.' He added: 'I'm not going anywhere' — and the congregation applauded. Before the service, as hostages started to be released under a Middle East ceasefire that the U.S. helped broker, Biden said 'the guns in Gaza have gone silent.' The agreement to halt the fighting between Israel and Hamas was one he had outlined in May. 'Now it falls on the next administration to help implement this deal. I was pleased to have our team speak as one voice in the final days,' Biden said. He noted that the three hostages released Sunday 'appear to be in good health' and he offered some advice to Trump on maintaining the hard-won deal. 'Success is going to require persistence, and continuing support for our friends in the region and the belief in diplomacy backed by deterrence,' Biden said. After Biden spoke on the ceasefire, he and first lady Jill Biden took their seats in the front pew at the church. At least several hundred congregants sang gospel songs, rising to their feet and swaying and clapping. A choir led the musical selections from behind the pulpit before the program later shifted to focus on King. Biden was introduced by Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a key ally who referred to the president as his 'longtime friend.' Clyburn cited a number of presidents who were underappreciated during their time in office but are now looked on more fondly with the passage of time. He added Biden to that list. 'So I want to say to you, good friend, very little appreciation has been shown recently but faint not. History will be very proud of you,' Clyburn said. The Bidens also will tour the International African American Museum in South Carolina. It was built on a waterfront site where tens of thousands of enslaved Africans were brought to the U.S. from the late 1760s through 1808, according to the museum's website. Back in 2020, Biden saw his campaign flounder after he lost the opening contests in New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. But at the fourth stop, South Carolina — where Black voters make up a majority of the Democratic electorate — he was lifted to victory after Clyburn's endorsement. 'I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,' Clyburn said at the time. After winning election and taking office, Biden pushed for South Carolina to move to the head of the line and be the state that opened the Democratic Party's nominating process for 2024, instead of New Hampshire. He easily won the state's primary that year. 'In 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the presidency,' Biden said in a statement after winning the primary for the second time. 'Now in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again — and making Donald Trump a loser — again.' It didn't turn out that way. After faltering in a debate against Trump, Biden dropped out of the race under pressure from many Democrats, though Clyburn notably was not among them. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced him as the Democrats' nominee. She lost to Trump. Clyburn said Biden told him he wanted to visit the African American history museum, which Clyburn helped start. They were planning to spend some time together there. 'This is his way of saying 'thank you,'' Clyburn said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-urges-americans-to-keep-the-faith-as-he-spends-final-full-day-as-president-in-south-carolina/7942529.html	2025-01-19T11:59:20-08:00	
Hamas frees 3 hostages during ceasefire with Israel	Hamas released three hostages Sunday as part of a newly reached ceasefire deal with Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden, on his last full day in office, spoke from Charleston, South Carolina about the development.

4 Moroccan truck drivers disappear on Burkina-Niger border	Rabat, Morocco — Four Moroccan truck drivers went missing Saturday as they crossed the restive border area between Burkina Faso and Niger, according to a source from the Moroccan Embassy in Burkina Faso and a Moroccan transport union. Three trucks, one carrying a spare driver, disappeared as they drove without an escort from Dori in Burkina Faso to Tera in Niger, an area known for jihadi threats, the diplomatic source said. Junta-led Burkina Faso and Niger are battling Islamist militant groups linked to al-Qaida and Islamic State, whose insurgencies have destabilized Sahel states in West Africa over the past decade. The Moroccan diplomatic source said the embassy was working together with Burkina Faso authorities to find the drivers. Authorities in Burkina Faso have been organizing security convoys to escort trucks in the border area to protect against militant attacks, the source said. The trucks set off after waiting for a week without getting an escort, Echarki El Hachmi, secretary general of Morocco's transporters' union, told Reuters. The trucks, loaded with infrastructure equipment, departed weeks ago from Casablanca heading to Niger, he said. El Hachmi urged more protection in areas of high risk as the number of Moroccan trucks crossing the Sahel continues to rise. Earlier this month, a convoy of Moroccan trucks was attacked on the Malian border with Mauritania, although there were no casualties, El Hachmi said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moroccan-truck-drivers-disappear-on-burkina-niger-border/7942513.html	2025-01-19T11:27:13-08:00	
Heavy snow, frigid Arctic blast put 70 million across US under winter storm warnings	Boston — Tens of millions of residents along the East Coast are bracing for several centimeters of snow Sunday followed by dangerously cold temperatures that will take hold in much of the country from the Northern Plains to the tip of Maine. Winter storm warnings issued by the National Weather Service have already gone into effect for parts of the Mid-Atlantic through Monday morning, with the forecast projecting up to 15 centimeters of snow. Warnings will begin in New England on Sunday afternoon, with parts of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Connecticut seeing as much as 25 centimeters of snow. Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland, projected that as many as 70 million residents will be under some kind of winter storm hazards warning in the coming days including in New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Large cities like Philadelphia, New York and Boston could see several centimeters of snow this evening with the highest totals being outside of major cities. 'There will certainly be some more hazardous road conditions anywhere from D.C. up the whole I-95 corridor and then inland from there later today and tonight,' Chenard said. 'Then it gets quite cold behind that. By Monday morning, any roads that haven’t been treated or cleared will still likely be some hazardous travel conditions.' Return of the Arctic blast But the snow is just the start of a chaotic week of weather. Much of the eastern half of the United States will be enduring some of the coldest temperatures this winter, if not for several years. An area from the Rockies into the Northern Plains will see colder than normal temperatures starting Sunday into the coming week, with temperatures dropping to minus 34 degrees C to minus 48 C on Sunday and Monday. Wind chills of minus 40 C were already being clocked in parts of North Dakota and Minnesota. Sub-zero wind chills are forecast to reach as far south as Oklahoma and the Tennessee Valley. The cold weather forecast for Monday for Washington, D.C., prompted President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural ceremony to be moved inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. 'It’s going to be a cold day in Washington, D.C. on Monday. That's for sure,' Chenard said, noting temperatures will be in the 20s with wind gust upwards of 48 kph. As happened earlier this month, this latest cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. The cold air will moderate as it moves southward and eastward, but the central and eastern U.S. will still be cold with highs in the teens and 20s on Monday into Tuesday, Chenard said. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast also will have highs in the teens and 20s, lows in the single digits and below minus 18 C and wind chills below zero. Unusual wintry mix The colder temperatures will reach down into the South early this week, where as many as 30 million people starting Monday could see a wintry mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The unusual conditions are expected to stretch from Texas into northern Florida and the Carolinas. Impacts are expected to start in Texas on Monday night and spread across the Gulf Coast and Southeast on Tuesday into Wednesday. A combination of frigid air with a low pressure system over the Gulf is behind the storm, which could bring heavy snow just south of the Interstate 20 corridor across northern Louisiana and into Mississippi and a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain near the Interstate 10 corridor from Houston to Mobile, Alabama. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry on Saturday issued a state of emergency in advance of the wintry weather. He encouraged Louisianans to be prepared and to monitor the weather forecast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-snow-frigid-arctic-blast-put-70-million-across-u-s-under-winter-storm-warnings-/7942472.html	2025-01-19T10:18:39-08:00	
What does does the future hold for Africa’s Generation Beta?	London — Demographers say the first members of Generation Beta are being born this month, following on the heels of Millennials, Gen Z and Gen Alpha. VOA spoke with African futurists on what they think will define the lives of the continent's Gen B'ers, from AI to better life expectancy and economic growth. Labels like Baby Boomers, Millennials or Generation Alpha are increasingly used globally to describe people born about the same time, often sharing similar experiences and challenges. VOA spoke with African futurists and scientists to understand how Gen B, who will be born between now and 2039, can expect Africa to have changed by the time they are adults. Halidou Tinto is a scientist from Burkina Faso, who is conducting cutting edge research with the recently developed malaria vaccine. He says futurists believe that people born in Africa in 2024-2025 can reasonably expect that malaria will no longer be a major public health problem in the years to come, and especially when these babies become adults. More than 200 million people in Africa catch malaria each year, and a half-million people die of it, according to the World Health Organization. Malaria is particularly deadly for children. According to UNICEF, the U.N.’s children’s agency, improvements in public health like this will lead to a brighter future for children born in coming years. Paul Quarles Van Ufford, a social policy adviser for UNICEF, says 'Children born today, also, are less likely to die before their fifth birthday and one of the big progress stories in Africa, because of vaccination, management of diseases and that there is less poverty is that child mortality has reduced.' He says that life expectancy in Africa has increased 'exponentially' in the last 20 years. Data from the U.N. shows that if current trends continue, Africa’s life expectancy could reach 70 by 2050, compared to 61 years old now. Researchers in Kenya — who have recently developed an Artificial Intelligence, or AI, chat bot to educate young people about HIV and AIDS — say the role of AI is going to grow in Africa. Dr. Consolata Gakii, with the University of Embu, says 'The young people are coming up with, utilizing AI to solve societal or local problems, from image processing to precision of weather, there is so much that is happening within our country,' she said. Jakkie Cilliers, head of African Futures at the South Africa based Institute for Security Studies, says Gen B’s relationship with technologies like AI will only expand in coming years. 'It’s a future of more freedom and more self-dependence, a future of innovation, a future in which technology really leads to benefit the ordinary person and the relationship between technology and the individual, I think is, just every year, is going to expand,' he said. Cilliers adds that tech will allow greater access to the globally developing 'gig economy,' which means workers will become less reliant on the government. He also says that about the time Gen B members become adults, the continent will pass an important milestone. For the first time, there will be more people of working age on the continent than dependents, like children and older people. That could lead to an explosion in economic growth. Although there are many challenges facing Africa, Generation Beta has a lot to get excited about.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-does-oes-the-future-hold-for-africa-s-generation-beta-/7942399.html	2025-01-19T09:12:28-08:00	
Who are the Israelis released, recovered on 1st day of ceasefire?	JERUSALEM — Three hostages held by Hamas were released Sunday after 471 days in captivity as part of a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. A gradual release of dozens of captives over the next several weeks has been agreed on. The truce and release of hostages sparked hope and trepidation among Israelis. Many fear that the three-phase deal could collapse before all the hostages return, or that they will arrive in poor health. Others worry that the number of captives who have died is more than predicted. Some 250 people were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered 15 months of war. Around 100 hostages still remain in Gaza, after the rest were released or their bodies recovered. Hours before the ceasefire Sunday, which many hope is the first step to end the war, Israel announced that it had retrieved the body of Oron Shaul, a soldier who was killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war and whose remains have been held by the militants since then. Here's a look at the three hostages released Sunday: Romi Gonen, 24 Romi Gonen was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That morning, Gonen's mother, Merav, and her eldest daughter spent nearly five hours speaking to Gonen as militants marauded through the festival grounds. Gonen told her family that roads clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible and that she would seek shelter in some bushes. Then she said words that continue to echo in her mother’s head every day. 'Mommy I was shot, the car was shot, everybody was shot. ... I am wounded and bleeding. Mommy, I think I’m going to die,' she recounted Romi as saying, in a news conference a few weeks after the abduction. At a loss for what to do, Leshem Gonen tried to convince her daughter that she wasn’t going to die, to start breathing and treat her wounded friends. According to Merav, Gonen's last word during the call was a shriek of 'Mommy!' as approaching gunfire and the men’s shouts drowned out everything. Then the phone shut off. Israeli authorities identified her phone's location in Gaza. Over the past 15 months, Merav has been one of the most outspoken voices advocating for the return of the hostages, appearing nearly daily on Israeli news programs and traveling abroad on missions. 'We are doing everything we can so the world will not forget,' Merav told The Associated Press on the six-month anniversary of Hamas' attack. 'Every day we wake up and take a big breath, deep breath, and continue walking, continue doing the things that will bring her back.' Emily Damari, 28 Emily Damari is a British-Israeli citizen kidnapped from her apartment on Kibbutz Kfar Aza, a communal farming village hit hard by Hamas' assault. She lived in a small apartment in a neighborhood for young adults, the closest part of the kibbutz to Gaza. Militants broke through the border fence of the kibbutz and ransacked the neighborhood. Damari's mother, Mandy, said she loves music, traveling, soccer, good food, karaoke and hats. Kibbutz Kfar Aza said that Damari was often the 'glue that held her close-knit friend group together' and she was always organizing gatherings of friends around the best barbecue corner in the entire kibbutz. 'I hold on to that sliver of hope that I still keep in my heart that she is surviving, in spite of her suffering,' Mandy Damari said in front of Damari's burned apartment last January. 'I am desperate, angry, and terrified for her life.' Doron Steinbrecher, 31 Doron Steinbrecher is a veterinary nurse who loves animals, and a neighbor to Damari in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. At 10:20 on Oct. 7, 2023, Steinbrecher called her mother. 'Mom, I’m scared. I’m hiding under the bed, and I hear them trying to enter my apartment,' her brother, Dor, recalled. She was able to send a voice message to her friends. 'They’ve got me! They’ve got me! They’ve got me!' in the moments of her abduction. That message was key in helping her family understand that Doron had been kidnapped. Steinbrecher was featured in a video released by Hamas on Jan. 26, 2024, along with two other female Israeli soldiers. Her brother said the video gave them hope that she was alive but sparked concern because she looked tired, weak, and gaunt. In total, militants killed 64 people and 22 soldiers, and kidnapped 19 people from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on Oct 7. With the return of Steinbrecher and Damari, there are still three members of the kibbutz held in Gaza: American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65, and twins Gali and Ziv Berman, 27. Remains of Oron Shaul, 20 Oron Shaul was a soldier killed on July 20, 2014, during fighting between Israel and Hamas. His body and that of another soldier, Hadar Goldin, had been held by militants since then despite a public campaign to return them by their families. The Hostages Families Forum, which represents relatives of the captives, called the Shaul family an 'inseparable part' of the group. Militants still hold the bodies of Goldin as well as two Israelis who crossed into Gaza in 2014 and 2015 on their own.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-are-the-israelis-released-recovered-on-1st-day-of-ceasefire/7942373.html	2025-01-19T08:16:24-08:00

80 killed in northeast Colombia as peace talks fail, official says	BOGOTÁ — More than 80 people have been killed in the country’s northeast region following failed attempts to hold peace talks with the National Liberation Army, a Colombian official said. Twenty others have been injured, according to William Villamizar, governor of North Santander, where many of the killings occurred. Among the victims are community leader Carmelo Guerrero and seven people who sought to sign a peace deal, according to a report that a government ombudsman agency released late Saturday. Officials said the attacks occurred in several towns located in the Catatumbo region near the border with Venezuela, with at least three people who were part of the peace talks being kidnapped. Thousands of people are fleeing the area, with some hiding in the nearby lush mountains or seeking help at government shelters. 'Catatumbo needs help,' Villamizar said in a public address Saturday. 'Boys, girls, young people, teenagers, entire families are showing up with nothing, riding trucks, dump trucks, motorcycles, whatever they can, on foot, to avoid being victims of this confrontation.' The attack comes after Colombia suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army (ELN) on Friday, the second time it has done so in less than a year. Colombia’s government has demanded that the ELN cease all attacks and allow authorities to enter the region and provide humanitarian aid. The ELN has been clashing in Catatumbo with former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a guerrilla group that disbanded after signing a peace deal in 2016 with Colombia's government. The two are fighting over control of a strategic border region that has coca leaf plantations. The ELN said in a statement Saturday that it had warned former FARC members that if they 'continued attacking the population...there was no other way out than armed confrontation.' The ELN has accused ex-FARC rebels of several killings in the area, including the Jan. 15 slaying of a couple and their 9-month-old baby. Colombia's army said Sunday that it rescued a local community leader and a relative that the ELN was persecuting, but dozens more awaited rescue. Defense Minister Iván Velásquez was scheduled to travel to the northeast town of Cúcuta while officials prepared to send 10 tons of food and hygiene kits for approximately 5,000 people in the communities of Ocaña and Tibú, most of them having fled the violence. The ELN has tried to negotiate a peace deal with the administration of President Gustavo Petro five times, with talks failing after bouts of violence. ELN demands include that it be recognized as a political rebel organization, which critics have said is risky.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-northeast-colombia-as-peace-talks-fail-official-says-/7942361.html	2025-01-19T08:10:25-08:00	
Biden posthumously pardons Black nationalist Marcus Garvey	Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday posthumously pardoned Black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who influenced Malcolm X and other civil rights leaders and was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Also receiving pardons were a top Virginia lawmaker and advocates for immigrant rights, criminal justice reform and gun violence prevention. Congressional leaders had pushed for Biden to pardon Garvey, with supporters arguing that Garvey's conviction was politically motivated and an effort to silence the increasingly popular leader who spoke of racial pride. After Garvey was convicted, he was deported to Jamaica, where he was born. He died in 1940. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said of Garvey: 'He was the first man, on a mass scale and level' to give millions of Black people 'a sense of dignity and destiny.' It's not clear whether Biden, who leaves office Monday, will pardon people who have been criticized or threatened by President-elect Donald Trump. Issuing preemptive pardons — for actual or imagined offenses by Trump's critics that could be investigated or prosecuted by the incoming administration — would stretch the powers of the presidency in untested ways. Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued. He announced on Friday that he was commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. He also gave a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes. The president has announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just as Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented number of executions, 13, in a protracted timeline during the coronavirus pandemic. A pardon relieves a person of guilt and punishment. A commutation reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn't exonerate the wrongdoing. Among those pardoned on Sunday were: — Don Scott, who is the speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates in a chamber narrowly controlled by Democrats. He was convicted of a drug offense in 1994 and served eight years in prison. He was elected to the Virginia legislature in 2019, and later became the first Black speaker. 'I am deeply humbled to share that I have received a Presidential Pardon from President Joe Biden for a mistake I made in 1994 — one that changed the course of my life and taught me the true power of redemption,' Scott said in a statement. —Immigrant rights activist Ravi Ragbir, who was convicted of a nonviolent offence in 2001 and was sentenced to two years in prison and was facing deportation to Trinidad and Tobago. —Kemba Smith Pradia, who was convicted of a drug offense in 1994 and sentenced to 24 years behind bars. She has since become a prison reform activist. President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence in 2000. —Darryl Chambers of Wilmington, Delaware, a gun violence prevention advocate who was convicted of a drug offense and sentenced to 17 years in prison. He studies and writes about gun violence prevention. Biden commuted the sentences of two people: —Michelle West, who was serving life in prison for her role in a drug conspiracy case in the early 1990s. West has a daughter who has written publicly about the struggle of growing up with a mother behind bars. —Robin Peoples, who was convicted of robbing banks in northwest Indiana in the late 1990s and was sentenced to 111 years in prison. The White House said in a statement that Peoples would have faced significantly lower sentences today under current laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-posthumously-pardons-black-nationalist-marcus-garvey-/7942340.html	2025-01-19T07:44:57-08:00	
In photos: Israel - Hamas ceasefire	A ceasefire in Gaza tales effect Sunday after Israel’s Cabinet approved a deal, with 24 ministers voting in favor and eight ministers rejecting the agreement. The deal to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas was achieved after more than a year of negotiations, with mediation from the United States, Qatar and Egypt. U.S. President Joe Biden first endorsed the deal in May. The Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel killed some 1,200 people and left some 250 others captive. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, The Associated Press reported. Israel responded with an offensive that has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half the dead, The Associated Press said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-photos-israel---hamas-ceasefire/7942338.html	2025-01-19T07:39:05-08:00	
Trump says he will issue an executive order Monday to get TikTok back up	Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that he plans to issue an executive order that would give TikTok's China-based parent company more time to find an approved buyer before the popular video-sharing platform is subject to a permanent U.S. ban. Trump announced the decision in a post on his Truth Social account as millions of TikTok users in the U.S. awoke to discover they could no longer access the TikTok app or platform. Google and Apple removed the app from their digital stores to comply with a federal law that required them to do so if TikTok parent company ByteDance didn't sell its U.S. operation to an approved buyer by Sunday. He said his order would 'extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect' and 'confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order. 'Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,' Trump wrote. The law gives the sitting president authority to grant a 90-day extension if a viable sale is underway. Although investors made a few offers, ByteDance previously said it would not sell. In his post on Sunday, Trump said he 'would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture,' but it was not immediately clear if he was referring to the government of an American company. 'By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up,' Trump wrote. 'Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.' The federal law required ByteDance to cut ties with the platform's U.S. operations by Sunday due to national security concerns posed by the app's Chinese roots. The law passed with wide bipartisan support in April, and U.S. President Joe Biden quickly signed it. TikTok and ByteDance sued on First Amendment grounds, and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the statute on Friday. Millions of TikTok users in the U.S. were no longer able to watch or post videos on the platform as of Saturday night. 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,' a pop-up message informed users who opened the TikTok app and tried to scroll through videos. 'Unfortunately that means you can't use TikTok for now.' 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,' a pop-up message informed users who opened the TikTok app and tried to scroll through videos. 'Unfortunately that means you can't use TikTok for now.' The service interruption TikTok instituted hours early caught most users by surprise. Experts had said the law as written did not require TikTok to take down its platform, only for app stores to remove it. Current users were expected to continue to have access to videos until the app stopped working due to a lack of updates. The company's app also was removed from prominent app stores, including the ones operated by Apple and Google. Apple told customers with its devices that it also took down other apps developed by TikTok's China-based parent company, including one that some social media influencers had promoted as an alternative. The Biden administration stressed in recent days that it did not intend to implement or enforce the nationwide ban before Trump takes office on Monday. Trump, who once favored a TikTok ban, said in an NBC News interview on Saturday that he was thinking about granting ByteDance a 90-day extension to find an approved buyer for the app's U.S. operations. 'We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned,' read the pop-up message the app's users now see under the headline, 'Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.' The only option the message gives to U.S. users is to close the app or click another option leading them to the platform's website.

Money laundering fears hang over Thailand’s online gambling plans	BANGKOK — Thailand’s plans to legalize online gambling are raising fears that criminal gangs will use the industry to move and launder their illicit proceeds as they have done with gambling operators in neighboring countries. Prasert Jantararuangtong, Thailand’s minister of digital economy and society, said last week that a bill could be ready within a month. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, widely seen as a major force behind the current government, led by his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, avidly endorsed the idea as well last week. The averred impetus for the push has been both economic and legal. Thaksin claimed a regulated online gambling industry could net the government nearly $3 billion in annual revenue. By bringing an industry already operating in the shadows into the light, Prasert said the move could also drive out the criminals currently behind many of the betting sites. 'The goal is to regulate underground gambling operations, bringing them into the legal framework and ensuring proper taxation,' Prasert told reporters. The push for online gambling is moving ahead as the government is preparing to legalize physical casinos inside integrated resorts featuring hotels, shopping malls and other entertainment. A related bill is due for debate in the National Assembly soon, after winning approval from the prime minister’s Cabinet on Monday. Gambling in Thailand is currently restricted to betting on state-run horse races and an official lottery. Many have been warning that expanding the scope of legal gambling in Thailand, especially online, is rife with risk. Bringing underground gambling operations under government regulation can do some good, Benedikt Hofmann, deputy representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, told VOA. 'But it also opens the door for ostensibly legitimate investments and use of the system by criminal actors for their illicit purposes, especially in a region rife with such actors. As we have seen in the Philippines, creating legal licensing and regulatory frameworks for gambling operators, like the POGO scheme, did not prevent the system from being taken over by highly problematic actors,' he said. The Philippines launched POGO, the Philippines Offshore Gaming Operator, in 2016 to license online gambling operators, but shut down the program last year. In a state of the nation address in July, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the industry had morphed into a hotbed of cyberscamming, money laundering and human trafficking. Hofmann said online gambling sites often spring up from physical casinos and can turbocharge their criminal activities. 'Taking advantage of the online space, these operations function around the clock and are theoretically accessible from anywhere in the world, so the reach and volume of both licit and illicit funds processed are much larger. They also offer easier ways to integrate crypto transactions and reduce customer touchpoints, making them highly attractive for money laundering,' he said. In a 2023 report, the UNODC said Southeast Asia’s transnational crime syndicates had effectively turned the region’s casinos and online betting sites into their own shadow banking network, using them to move and launder tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars a year in earnings from illegal gambling, drug trafficking, cyberscams and other organized crime. Besides the Philippines, many of those casinos and betting sites operate just across the border from Thailand in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Amanda Gore, director of the Center for Global Advancement and a forensic accountant who has investigated financial crime around the world, said Thailand’s neighborhood puts the country at high risk of having its own online gambling industry exploited. 'Because they’ve got the same sort of geographical issues … the drug trafficking, the organized crime; it’s all in that area. So, they’re going to have to be extremely strict, and if they’re not then it’s probably going to end up going the same way as the Philippines,' she told VOA. Gore said the operators behind these online gambling sites often move from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in search of the most permissive conditions, and warned that some of those recently shut out of the Philippines could look to Thailand next unless it passes strong laws and backs them up with strict enforcement. 'The key is going to be whether they have a strong enforcement presence behind those regulations and laws as well, because if they don’t, I think it’s going to be very, very vulnerable to the criminal groups in the region, particularly from the money laundering perspective,' she said. Government officials have said they are aware of the risks and insisted they would only roll out the casinos and online gambling licenses with the necessary guardrails, but they have yet to provide any details. Spokespersons for the prime minister’s office and the ministries of interior and digital economy and society did not reply to VOA’s requests for elaboration. Rangsiman Rome, an opposition lawmaker in Thailand’s House of Representatives who chairs the committee on national security, told VOA that he supports the legalization of casinos and a limited online gambling industry in principle but believes the government is not yet up to the task of managing either safely. 'The current law, including law enforcement, is not enough to protect Thai society from the gray capital, the mafia or … money laundering,' he said. 'Because now the money laundering already happens, it happens every day, and it looks like the Thai authorities don’t know how to stop this.' Rangsiman said the government should give itself, lawmakers and the public more time to study and debate the pros and cons before pressing ahead, and that it should focus on rooting out the corruption in the agencies that would be tasked with enforcing any new laws on casinos and gambling first. Thailand has arrested dozens of police officers for running or protecting underground gambling operations in recent years. 'We see a lot of corruption that happens in Thailand, so we have to fix this before we allow the casinos,' Rangsiman said. Gore suggested Thailand study well-established gambling commissions such as the United Kingdom’s, which she said could offer useful lessons on how to sanction operators that fail to follow the rules. The UNODC’s Hofmann said Thailand should also focus on making sure its regulators carefully vet casino investors and players, and consider foregoing online gambling and cryptocurrency payments altogether. 'Even then, risks will remain,' he said, 'as we have seen with organized crime infiltrating casino sectors around the world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/money-laundering-fears-hang-over-thailand-s-online-gambling-plans-/7942266.html	2025-01-19T05:36:50-08:00	
Taliban minister urges leadership to lift Afghan female education ban	Islamabad — A senior Taliban leader has publicly criticized his government’s policy of prohibiting female education in Afghanistan, calling it a 'personal choice' rather than an interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. The rare public rebuke from Sher Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban deputy foreign minister, comes amid persistent international calls for Afghanistan’s rulers to permit girls’ education in secondary schools and beyond, as well as to remove restrictions on women’s access to public life at large. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, and their reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, has introduced his strict interpretation of Sharia to govern the conflict-ravaged country through dozens of edicts, primarily curbing girls’ access to education beyond the sixth grade and prohibiting most women in workplaces and public life at large. 'We call on the leadership of the Islamic Emirate [Taliban] to make education accessible to everyone,' Stanikzai told a religious seminary graduation ceremony in the Afghan border province of Khost. 'There is no justification for denying this, just as there was no justification for it in the past, and there shouldn't be one at all,' he asserted in a speech Afghan TOLO news aired Sunday, following the ceremony the day before. Stanikzai suggested that the world is critical of the Taliban’s curbs on women and 'this is precisely the problem' that they have with the Afghan government, which has not been officially recognized by any country, primarily over its treatment of the female population. 'Today, we are committing an injustice against 20 million people out of a total population of 40 million. We have stripped them of all their rights by closing the doors to schools and universities for them, giving them away as compensation in personal disputes, and preventing them from choosing their husbands,' Stanikzai said. 'Are we truly following Sharia? … The path we are currently following is guided by personal choice, not Sharia,' he said. Stanikzai has been publicly speaking out against bans on female education, but his latest relatively harsh remarks represent the first direct challenge to the edicts issued by Akhudzada from his base in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar that primarily targeted women. The Taliban regained power after years of launching insurgent attacks against U.S.-led international forces, which ultimately withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021. This withdrawal was a result of a February 2020 agreement negotiated between then-President Donald Trump’s administration and the Taliban, with Stanikzai leading the insurgents in the discussions. In a speech earlier this month, Stanikzai described Trump, who is set to return to the U.S. presidency Monday, as a 'decisive' and 'courageous' U.S. leader, predicting a shift in Washington’s policies toward Afghanistan under the new Trump administration. 'We hope that he takes positive steps forward. We will also come forth, God willing. We want to build good relations with the international community and the Western countries,' Stanikzai said. The United Nations and global human rights defenders have persistently denounced Taliban restrictions on women. Last August, the Taliban announced a new law on the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which bars women from traveling or using public transportation without a male guardian. The law requires women and girls to cover their faces in public and prohibits them from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house. Richard Bennett, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, has documented in his reports 'an institutionalized system of discrimination, segregation, disrespect for human dignity, and exclusion of women and girls.' The Taliban banned Bennett from visiting the country in September.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-minister-urges-leadership-to-lift-afghan-female-education-ban-/7942251.html	2025-01-19T04:47:10-08:00	
ASEAN tells Myanmar junta peace, not election, is priority	LANGKAWI, MALAYSIA — Southeast Asian nations told Myanmar's military government on Sunday its plan to hold an election amid an escalating civil war should not be its priority, urging the junta to start dialogue and end hostilities immediately. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations called on the warring sides in member nation Myanmar to stop the fighting and told the junta's representative to allow unhindered humanitarian access, said Malaysia's foreign minister as the country takes over chairing ASEAN this year. 'Malaysia wants to know what Myanmar has in mind,' Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan told a press conference after a ministerial retreat on the island of Langkawi. 'We told them the election is not a priority. The priority now is to cease fire.' Myanmar has been in turmoil since early 2021 when its military overthrew the elected civilian government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, triggering pro-democracy protests that morphed into a widening armed rebellion that has taken over swaths of the country. Despite being battered on multiple fronts, its economy in tatters and dozens of political parties banned, the junta plans this year to hold an election, which critics have widely derided as a sham to keep the generals in power through proxies. Malaysia announced the appointment of former diplomat Othman Hashim as special envoy on the crisis in Myanmar, where the United Nations says humanitarian needs are at 'alarming levels,' with nearly 20 million people -- more than a third of the population -- needing help. Mohamad said Othman would visit Myanmar 'soon.' South China Sea a concern Othman is tasked with convincing all sides in Myanmar to implement ASEAN's five-point peace plan, which has made no progress since it was unveiled months after the coup. ASEAN has barred the ruling generals from attending its meetings over their failure to comply. Myanmar is represented by a senior diplomat. 'We want Myanmar to adhere to the Five-Point Consensus, to stop hostilities and have dialogue, it's very simple,' Mohamad said. 'What we want is unhindered humanitarian aid that can reach all in Myanmar.' Malaysia takes the chair of the 10-member bloc as it contends not only with the conflict in Myanmar but with Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea, the site of heated confrontations between ASEAN member the Philippines and China, a major source of the region's trade and investment. Vietnam and Malaysia have also protested over the conduct of Chinese vessels in their exclusive economic zones, which Beijing says are operating lawfully in its waters. China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, a conduit for about $3 trillion of annual shipborne trade. China and ASEAN have committed to drafting a code of conduct for the South China Sea, but talks have moved at a snail's pace. Mohamad said ministers welcomed progress so far but 'highlighted the need to continue the momentum to expedite the code of conduct.' The foreign minister of U.S. ally the Philippines told Reuters on Saturday it was time to start negotiating thorny 'milestone issues' for the code, including its scope, whether it can be legally binding and its impact on third-party states.	https://www.voanews.com/a/asean-tells-myanmar-junta-peace-not-election-is-priority/7942175.html	2025-01-19T00:39:04-08:00	
US Treasury Department imposes sanctions on Chinese company over Salt Typhoon hack	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday imposed sanctions on alleged hacker Yin Kecheng and cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., accusing both of being involved in a series of hacks against American telecom companies. The intrusions, known under the name Salt Typhoon, have allegedly exposed a huge swath of Americans' call logs to Chinese spies and rattled the U.S. intelligence community. In some cases, hackers are alleged to have intercepted conversations, including between prominent U.S. politicians and government officials. Some lawmakers have described them as the worst telecom hacks in U.S. history. In a statement, the Treasury described Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co. as a hacking company with strong ties to China's Ministry of State Security, an intelligence agency. It said that Yin Kecheng was based in Shanghai, had worked as a hacker for more than a decade, and also had ties to the MSS. It further alleged he was tied to the recent breach at the U.S. Treasury. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Yin Kecheng or Sichuan Juxinhe. China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing routinely denies responsibility for cyberespionage campaigns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-department-imposes-sanctions-on-chinese-company-over-salt-typhoon-hack/7942173.html	2025-01-19T00:21:32-08:00	
Papua's noken bag symbolizes knotted legacy of resilience, identity	JAYAPURA, Indonesia — The woman carries bananas, yams and vegetables in a knotted bag on her head as she wanders through a market in a suburban area of Jayapura in eastern Indonesia. Even in the Papua capital and bigger cities of the province, a noken bag where people carry their daily essentials is a common sight. The distinctive bag, handcrafted from natural fibers like tree bark or leaves, is woven and knotted with threads of Papuan heritage. The U.N. cultural agency UNESCO recognized the traditional bag as needing urgent safeguarding in 2012 because there are fewer crafters making noken and more competition from factory-made bags. Crafter Mariana Pekei sells her handmade bags daily in Youtefa market in Jayapura, along with other women from her village. 'It is difficult to craft from the tree bark,' Pekei said. They collect the raw materials from melinjo trees or orchids, facing dangers like mosquitoes in the forest. They then process the material into thread fibers, including by spinning the fibers together in their palms and on their thighs, which can cause wounds and scar their skin. 'If it's made of yarn, we can craft, knot it directly with our hands,' Pekei said. The price of noken depends on the material as well as the craftsmanship. A small bag can be made in a day, but the bigger ones require more creativity from the maker and more precision and patience. Sometimes, the noken is colored by using natural dyes, mostly light brown or cream with some yellowish brown. 'Those are the color of Papuan people and the Papuan land,' Pekei said. With its seemingly simple yet intricate winding technique and the symbolism it holds, the noken has become a valuable item passed down from generation to generation. For people from outside Papua, noken are much desired and can be found easily at markets or souvenir stores. Despite the high transportation costs, crafters often journey from their remote villages to Jayapura, determined to sell their noken and share their craft with the city. But more than just a practical tool for carrying goods or souvenir, Pekei said that a noken serves as a powerful cultural symbol, representing the resilience, unity and creativity of the Papuan people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/papua-s-noken-bag-symbolizes-knotted-legacy-of-resilience-identity-/7941443.html	2025-01-18T23:36:15-08:00	
New documentary questions who took famous napalm attack photo	It is one of the 20th century's most memorable images: a naked girl, screaming, running from a napalm bombing during the Vietnam War. More than a half-century later, a new documentary is calling into question who took it — and the retired Associated Press photographer long credited for the photo insists it was his, while his longtime employer says it has no evidence of anyone else being behind the camera. The film about the Pulitzer Prize-winning picture, 'The Stringer,' is scheduled to debut next week at the Sundance Film Festival. Both photographer Nick Ut and his longtime employer are contesting it vigorously, and Ut's lawyer is seeking to block the premiere, threatening a defamation lawsuit. The AP, which conducted its own investigation over six months, concluded it has 'no reason to believe anyone other than Ut took the photo.' The picture of Kim Phuc running down a road in the village of Trang Bang, crying and naked because she had taken off clothes burning from napalm, instantly became symbolic of the horrors of the Vietnam War. Taken on June 8, 1972, the photo is credited to Ut, then a 21-year-old staffer in AP's Saigon bureau. He was awarded the Pulitzer a year later. Now 73, he moved to California after the war and worked for the AP for 40 years until retiring in 2017. The film's allegations open an unexpected new chapter for an image that, within hours of it being taken, was beamed around the planet and became one of the most indelible photographs of both the Vietnam War and the turbulent century that produced it. Whatever the truth, the film's investigations apparently relate only to the identity of the photographer and not the image's overall authenticity. The dispute puts the filmmakers, who call the episode 'a scandal behind the making of one of the most-recognized photographs of the 20th century,' at odds with Ut, whose work that day defined his career. It also puts them at cross purposes with the AP, a global news organization for whom accuracy is a foundational part of the business model. How did the questioning of the photo begin? It's difficult, so many years later, to overestimate the wallop that this particular image packed. Ron Burnett, an expert on images and former president of the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, called it 'earth-shattering.' 'It changed the way photos have always been thought about and broke the rules for how much violence you can show to the public,' Burnett said. The photo sat unchallenged for much of its 53-year existence. All these years later, a counter-narrative has emerged that it was instead taken by another person, someone who worked for NBC News at the time and also lives now in California. The person allegedly had delivered his film to the AP's office as a 'stringer,' a non-staff member who provides material to a news organization. The husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner are behind the film. On his website, Knight described 'The Stringer' as 'a story that many in our profession did not want told, and some of them continue to go to great lengths to make sure isn't told.' 'The film grapples with questions of authorship, racial injustice and journalistic ethics while shining a light on the fundamental yet often unrecognized contributions of local freelancers who provide the information we need to understand how events worldwide impact us all,' Knight wrote. Knight did not return a message seeking comment from the AP on Thursday. A representative from Sundance also did not return a message about a cease-and-desist letter from Ut's lawyer, James Hornstein, trying to stop the film's airing. Hornstein would not make Ut available for an interview, saying he anticipated future litigation. Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their evidence. AP declined. That hampered the AP's own investigation, along with the passage of time. Horst Faas, chief of photos for AP in Saigon in 1972, and Yuichi 'Jackson' Ishizaki, who developed Ut's film, are both dead. Many of the Saigon bureau's records were lost when communists took over the city, including any dealings with 'the stringer.' Negatives of photos used back then are preserved in AP's corporate archives in New York, but they provided no insight for the investigation. Still, the AP decided to release its own findings before seeing 'The Stringer' and the details of the claim that it is making. 'AP stands prepared to review any evidence and take whatever remedial action might be needed if their thesis is proved true,' the news organization said. Some who were there are sure about what happened The AP said it spoke to seven surviving people who were in Trang Bang or AP's Saigon bureau that day, and all maintain they have no reason to doubt their own conclusions that Ut had taken the photo. One was Fox Butterfield, a renowned longtime New York Times reporter, who also said that he was contacted by Turner for the documentary. 'I told them what my memory was and they didn't like it, but they just went ahead anyway,' Butterfield told AP. Another was photographer David Burnett, who said he witnessed Ut and Alexander Shimkin, a freelance photographer working primarily for Newsweek, taking photos as Kim Phuc and other children emerged from smoke following an attack. Shimkin was killed in Vietnam a month later, according to the investigation. A key source for the story in 'The Stringer' is Carl Robinson, then a photo editor for the AP in Saigon, who was initially overruled in his judgment not to use the picture. AP reached out to Robinson as part of its probe, but he said he had signed an NDA with Knight and the VII Foundation. Knight followed up, saying Robinson would only speak off the record, which the AP concluded would have prevented the news organization from setting the record straight. Robinson did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on Thursday. On duty that day in Saigon, Robinson had concluded that Ut's picture could not be used because it would have violated standards prohibiting nudity. But Faas overruled him, and senior AP editors in New York decided to run the picture for what it conveyed about war. The AP questioned Robinson's long silence in contradicting Ut's photo credit, and showed a photo from its archives of Robinson with champagne toasting Ut's Pulitzer Prize. In a 2005 interview with corporate archives, Robinson said he thought AP 'created a monster' when it distributed the photo because much of the world's sympathies were focused on one victim, instead of war victims more broadly. Former AP correspondent Peter Arnett, who believes Ut made the image, said Robinson wrote to him after Faas' death in 2012 to make the allegation that Ut had not taken it; he said he did not want to do it while Faas was still alive. According to the AP investigation, Arnett said Robinson told him that Ut had 'gone all Hollywood' and he didn't like it. Hornstein characterized Robinson, who was dismissed by AP in 1978, as 'a guy with a 50-year vendetta against the AP.' He also questioned the long silence by the man supposedly identified in the documentary as the person who really took the photo. The lawyer also produced a statement from Kim Phuc, who said that while she has no memory of that day, her uncle has repeatedly told her that Ut took the picture and that she had no reason to doubt him. Ut also took her to the nearest hospital after the photo was taken, she wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-documentary-questions-who-took-famous-napalm-attack-photo-/7940043.html	2025-01-18T23:35:40-08:00	
Banning cellphones in schools gains popularity in US	little rock, arkansas — Arkansas' Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' use of cellphones needs to be banned during the school day. At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year. Here is a look at the push by states for such bans. Why are states banning cellphones at schools? The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children's mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people's lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times. Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them. Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices. 'It doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,' she said. What states are enacting bans? At least eight states — California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia — have enacted measures banning or restricting students' use of cellphones in schools. The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi. A 2024 California law requires the state's nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026. Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day. Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 school districts signed on. Sanders said she now wants to require all districts to ban cellphones during the school day, but the proposal will leave it to the districts on how to craft the policy. 'Teachers know [cellphones are] a huge distraction, but much bigger than that is that it is impacting the mental health of so many of our students,' Sanders told reporters on Thursday. Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics. What is the opposition to the bans? The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency. Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time. But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active-shooter situation. Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation. Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media for children but that the bans sought by states are too broad. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said. 'We have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,' she said. 'We've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/banning-cellphones-in-schools-gains-popularity-in-us/7940051.html	2025-01-18T23:19:48-08:00	
Chili paste heats up dishes and warms hearts at northeastern Tunisia's harissa festival	NABEUL, Tunisia — For years, Tunisians have been picking bright red peppers, combining them with garlic, vinegar and spices and turning them into a saucy spread called harissa. The condiment is a national staple, found in homes, restaurants and food stalls throughout the coastal North African nation. Brick-red, spicy and tangy, it can be scooped up on bread drizzled with olive oil or dabbed onto plates of eggs, fish, stews or sandwiches. Harissa can be sprinkled atop merguez sausages, smeared on savory pastries called brik or sandwiches called fricassées. In Nabeul, the largest city in Tunisia's harissa-producing Cap Bon region, local chef and harissa specialist Chahida Boufayed called it 'essential to Tunisian cuisine.' 'Harissa is a love story,' she said at a festival held in honor of the chili paste sauce in the northeastern Tunisian city of Nabeul earlier this month. 'I don't make it for the money.' Aficionados from across Tunisia and the world converged on the 43-year-old mother's stand to try her recipe. Surrounded by strings of drying baklouti red peppers, she described how she grows her vegetables and blends them with spices to make harissa. The region's annual harissa festival has grown in the two-plus years since the United Nations cultural organization, UNESCO, recognized the sauce on a list of items of intangible cultural heritage, said Zouheir Belamin, the president of the association behind the event. He said its growing prominence worldwide was attracting new tourists to Tunisia, specifically to Nabeul. UNESCO in 2022 called harissa 'an integral part of domestic provisions and the daily culinary and food traditions of Tunisian society, adding it to a list of traditions and practices that mark intangible cultural heritage including Ukrainian borscht and Cuban rum. Already popular across North Africa as well as in France, the condiment is gaining popularity throughout the world from the United States to China. Seen as sriracha's North African cousin, harissa is typically prepared by women who sun-dry harvested red peppers and then deseed, wash and ground them. Its name comes from 'haras' – the Arabic verb for 'to crush' – because of the next stage in the process. The finished peppers are combined with a mixture of garlic cloves, vinegar, salt, olive oil and spices in a mortar and pestle to make a fragrant blend. Variants on display at Nabeul's Jan. 3-5 festival used cumin, coriander and different spice blends or types of peppers, including smoked ones, to create pastes ranging in color from burgundy to crimson. 'Making harissa is an art. If you master it, you can create wonders,' Boufayed said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chili-paste-heats-up-dishes-and-warms-hearts-at-northeastern-tunisia-s-harissa-festival/7938697.html	2025-01-18T23:17:14-08:00	
Netanyahu says ceasefire will not begin unless Hamas provides list of hostages	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday the Israel-Hamas ceasefire set to go into effect at 8:30 a.m., local time, would not start as scheduled unless Hamas provided a list of hostages set for release Sunday. 'The prime minister instructed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] that the ceasefire, which is supposed to go into effect at 8:30 a.m., will not begin until Israel has the list of released abductees that Hamas has pledged to provide,' Netanyahu’s office said Sunday. Hamas blamed the delay in sharing the names on 'technical' reasons, adding in a statement that it was 'affirming its commitment' to the ceasefire deal that was announced last week. 'The delay in providing the names of those to be released in the first batch is due to technical reasons,' the group said in a statement. A ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war is set to begin Sunday morning at 8:30 a.m., local time, mediator Qatar said Saturday after Israel’s Cabinet voted to approve the truce and hostage release agreement. Following a meeting that lasted more than six hours into the early morning on Saturday, the Israeli government ratified the agreement that could lead to a permanent end to the 15-month war with Hamas in the besieged Gaza enclave. 'The government has approved the framework for the return of the hostages. The framework for the hostages’ release will come into effect on Sunday,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. Netanyahu’s office said the deal 'supports achieving the objectives of the war.' But later on Saturday, Netanyahu said Israel will not proceed with the ceasefire until it gets the list of the 33 hostages who will be released by Hamas in the first phase of the deal, according to media reports. 'Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. The sole responsibility lies with Hamas,' Netanyahu said in a statement on social media platform X. Also on Saturday, Israel’s ultra-nationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir quit Netanyahu’s Cabinet in protest over the ceasefire deal, according to media reports. He previously said the deal was 'reckless' and that it would 'erase the achievements of the war.' In a Saturday statement, Hamas — designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries — contended that Israel had 'failed to achieve its aggressive goals' and 'only succeeded in committing war crimes that disgrace the dignity of humanity.' The war in Gaza began when Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages. Of those hostages, just under 100 are thought to remain in Hamas custody, but about one-third are believed to be dead. Gaza authorities say nearly 47,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in subsequent Israeli military operations. Without providing evidence, Israel says the death toll includes thousands of militants it has killed. The U.S. and Qatar and Egypt, which have been mediating negotiations between Israel and Hamas for months, announced the ceasefire on Wednesday. The ceasefire will begin with a three-week pause in fighting, and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Thirty-three of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages, including women, children, men over 50 and ill and wounded captives, are expected to be released in this phase. In return, Israel will release almost 2,000 Palestinians from its jails. The White House said it expects three female hostages to be released to Israel in the afternoon through the Red Cross. Israel’s Justice Ministry published their details early on Saturday, plus the cease-fire agreement, which said 30 Palestinian prisoners would be released for each female hostage on Sunday. After Sunday, lead U.S. negotiator Brett McGurk said the agreement calls for four more female hostages to be released after seven days, followed by the release of three further hostages every seven days. In this first phase of the three-stage deal, Israeli troops also will pull back to the edges of Gaza, and many Palestinians will be able to return to what remains of their homes as increased aid flows into the enclave, which has been decimated in the war. Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said Saturday the deal provides for the entry of 600 trucks per day into Gaza, including 50 trucks of fuel. Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued since the cease-fire was announced, including on Saturday. Israeli tanks shelled the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City, while airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza, according to residents. Medics in Gaza said five people were killed in an airstrike that hit a tent in the Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The Israeli army said it conducted strikes on 50 'terror targets' across the territory on Friday alone, the army said in a statement on Saturday. At least 123 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks since the ceasefire was announced a few days ago, according to the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-says-ceasefire-will-not-begin-unless-hamas-provides-list-of-hostages-/7942164.html	2025-01-18T23:06:46-08:00	
TikTok goes dark for US users; company pins hope on Trump	WASHINGTON — TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would 'most likely' give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned.' Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. 'The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,' Trump told NBC. 'If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.' It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action. 'We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,' press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement. The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. 'China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,' a spokesperson said. Users move to alternatives Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users -- mostly younger people -- scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their share prices rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. 'This is my new home now,' wrote one user in a RedNote post, tagged with the words 'tiktokrefugee' and 'sad.' Minutes after TikTok's U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly called Twitter. 'I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a few days,' wrote @RavenclawJedi. NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to access the internet from servers around the world, said it was 'experiencing temporary technical difficulties.' Web searches for 'VPN' spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a 'hair on fire' moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a 'political resolution' of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-stops-working-for-us-users-disappears-from-apple-google-stores/7942155.html	2025-01-18T21:20:36-08:00	
As Trump returns to White House, his family circle looks different	When Donald Trump returns to the White House on Monday, his family circle will look a little different than it did when he first arrived eight years ago. His youngest son, Barron, was in fifth grade back then. He's now a college freshman who towers over his 1.8-meter-plus dad. Granddaughter Kai, who was 9 in 2017, is now an aspiring social media influencer and impressive golfer. Grandson Joseph, who posed in Trump's lap with a Lego model of the White House last time, is 11 now. After working in his first administration, the most prominent relatives in Trump's political sphere, daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared, are now in Florida. Family members can provide presidents with a ready source of moral and sounding-board support, companionship and even relief from the world's problems. The president-elect has five children — three of whom are married — from his marriages to Ivana Trump, Marla Maples and current wife Melania Trump. He has 10 grandchildren, with an 11th on the way. A look at Trump's family circle, then and now: Melania Trump, Trump's wife THEN: She spent the opening months of Trump's term at the family's Manhattan penthouse so that 11-year-old Barron wouldn't have to switch schools in the middle of the year. After moving to the White House, she traveled around the United States and to other countries, alone and with Trump, partly to promote her 'Be Best' children's initiative while fiercely guarding her privacy. NOW: She avoided active campaigning during Trump's 2024 run, limiting her public appearances to key moments, such as the campaign's launch, the Republican National Convention and election night. She released a self-titled memoir late last year and will be the subject of a documentary distributed by Amazon Prime Video that is expected to be released this year. While some doubt that Trump's 54-year-old wife will spend much time at the White House, she said on Fox News' Fox & Friends that she has already packed and picked out the furniture she wants to take to the executive mansion. Donald Trump Jr., Trump's eldest son THEN: Trump's eldest son, now 46, campaigned for his father in 2016 and 2020. NOW: Trump Jr.'s influence has grown to the point that he lobbied his father to choose close friend JD Vance for vice president. He also pushed for former Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the president-elect's picks for director of national intelligence and health and human services, respectively. Trump Jr. helps run the family real estate business and is an honorary chairman of Trump's transition. He has a podcast and has said his role is to prevent 'bad actors' from getting into the administration. He recently flew on his father's airplane to Greenland; the president-elect has expressed a desire to take control of the mineral-rich Danish territory. Trump Jr. has five children — or 'smurfs,' as he sometimes refers to them — with his former wife, Vanessa Trump. They are Kai Madison, 17; Donald John III, 15; Tristan Milos, 13; Spencer Frederick, 12; and Chloe Sophia Trump, 10. Ivanka Trump, Trump's eldest daughter THEN: Ivanka, 43, campaigned for her father in 2016 and moved her family from New York City to Washington to work in his White House as a senior adviser. She was on the campaign trail in 2020, too, but she and her family moved to Florida and retreated from the spotlight after his loss. NOW: As Trump geared up for the 2024 run, Ivanka announced that she loved and supported him but was getting out of politics to focus on her husband and their three kids. She did, however, join her father and other family members on election night and when he rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange in early December after Time magazine named him Person of the Year. Ivanka and her husband have three children: Arabella Rose, 13; Joseph Frederick, 11; and Theodore James Kushner, 8. Eric Trump, Trump's second son THEN: The 40-year-old helped run the family business and participated in his father's campaigns. NOW: Eric is also an honorary chair of the transition and a close adviser to his father. But he continues to focus more on running the family business. In September, he and his brother started a crypto platform called World Liberty Financial, and their father helped launch it in an interview on the X social media platform. Eric and his wife, Lara, have two children: Eric Luke, 7, and Carolina Dorothy Trump, 5. Tiffany Trump, Trump's youngest daughter THEN: Trump's daughter with second wife Marla Maples was 23 and a recent University of Pennsylvania graduate who kept a low profile when Trump was first elected. NOW: She was more present in the 2024 campaign but still largely avoids the spotlight. Tiffany, 31, and her husband, Michael Boulos, are expecting their first child this year. Boulos is a businessman who traveled with Trump in the final stretch of the campaign. His father is Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman who helped Trump with the influential Arab American community in the swing state of Michigan. Trump has named Massad Boulos to be a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Barron Trump, Trump's youngest son THEN: At the start of Trump's first term, Barron and his mother stayed at the family's Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan so he could finish his school year. When they got to Washington, his soccer net appeared in what's known as the first lady's garden. NOW: Barron, 18, is a freshman New York University business student. His parents and Trump campaign officials credit him for recommending podcasts popular with young men that the president-elect appeared on during the campaign. Barron will have a bedroom in the White House, Melania Trump said on Fox & Friends. 'I'm very proud of him, about his knowledge, even about politics and giving an advice to his father,' his mother said on the program. 'He brought in so many young people. He knows his generation.' Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law THEN: Trump's daughter-in-law, 42, campaigned for him during all his runs. After Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, she considered running for a U.S. Senate seat from her home state of North Carolina but ultimately decided against it. She became a Fox News commentator. NOW: As Trump revved up his 2024 campaign, he installed his daughter-in-law as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, where she was a TV-ready advocate overseeing fundraising, voter outreach and the party's 'election integrity' initiative. She stepped down from the RNC after the election and removed her name from consideration as a possible successor to Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Trump's choice for secretary of state. Lara Trump is passionate about fitness and has her own line of activewear. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law THEN: Kushner, 44, was also a key figure in Trump's 2016 campaign. He joined his wife in the White House as a senior adviser, a role that included working on U.S. policy toward Israel and the broader Middle East. NOW: Kushner has stepped out of the political spotlight — but his father could soon step in. Trump announced after the election that he intends to nominate Charles Kushner, a real estate developer, to be U.S. ambassador to France. The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after he pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign contributions. Kai Trump, one of Trump's granddaughters THEN: Kai was in elementary school when her grandfather became president. NOW: Donald Trump Jr.'s 17-year-old granddaughter is an aspiring social media influencer. Her behind-the-scenes video from election night garnered 3.7 million views on YouTube. Other posts related to her grandfather have been watched millions more times on TikTok. Kai delivered her first public speech at the Republican convention and is an avid golfer who sometimes plays with her grandfather. Arabella Kushner, one of Trump's granddaughters THEN: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner's daughter was 6 when her grandfather showed China's Xi Jinping a video of her, in a traditional Chinese dress, belting out Chinese-language songs. 'It's very good, right? She's very smart,' Trump said. Xi responded that Arabella was her grandfather's 'little angel' and a 'messenger of China-U.S. relations.' NOW: Arabella is 13 and enjoys singing, playing the piano, horseback riding and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, according to a social media post from her mother.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7942106.html	2025-01-18T18:38:19-08:00

Niger journalist held after channel suspended, association says	NIAMEY, NIGER — A major journalist in Niger was in custody Saturday, an association said, a day after the private TV channel he runs was suspended following a report critical of the military-led regime. Seyni Amadou, editor in chief of Canal 4 TV, has been arrested, said CAP-Medias-Niger, which represents media workers in the country. On Friday, Niger's communications ministry announced the channel had been taken off the air for a month. State television channel Tele Sahel said Canal 3 TV had been punished 'for violating the rules of ethics and deontology.' Canal 3 told AFP in a statement that the suspension was 'linked to a broadcast on the ranking of ministers' in the government of Prime Minister Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine, a civilian appointed by the military regime. In the report's ranking, Zeine was placed first and several of his ministers were called the 'soft underbelly' of the government. CAP said in a statement Friday it regretted Amadou's arrest and detention and called for the rights of journalists to be respected. 'Never in the history of media regulation in Niger has the decision to suspend a media been taken by the executive, including in so-called exceptional periods,' it added. CAP called on Communications Minister Sidi Raliou Mohamed to reconsider his decision. Niger lies 80th out of 180 countries on the 2024 Press Freedom Index published by Paris-based media rights campaigners Reporters Without Borders (RSF). Already in November, another journalist at Canal 3, Serge Mathurin Adou, was detained and later convicted on allegations he attempted to destabilize fellow junta-led Sahel nation Burkina Faso. General Abdourahamane Tiani, the chief of Niger's powerful presidential guard, in 2023 ousted president Mohamed Bazoum, a key ally of the West in fighting jihadis in sub-Saharan Africa. Since the coup, Niger's military rulers have turned their back on former colonial power France and forged ties with fellow juntas in Burkina Faso and Mali, as well as with Russia. It has also blocked international channels including Radio France International (RFI), France 24 and the BBC.	https://www.voanews.com/a/niger-journalist-held-after-channel-suspended-association-/7942127.html	2025-01-18T17:35:22-08:00	
Rubio vows to oppose Thai Uyghur deportations as US secretary of state	WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, is pledging to press Thailand to prevent the deportation of 48 Uyghurs held there since 2014 after fleeing alleged persecution in Xinjiang, in northwest China. 'Thailand is a very strong U.S. partner, a strong historical ally,' Rubio said during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday. 'That is an area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results because of how important that relationship is and how close it is.' Describing the Uyghurs' plight in China as 'one of the most horrifying things that has ever happened,' he said, 'These are people who are basically being rounded up because of their ethnicity and religion, and they are being put into camps … stripped of their identity… and into forced labor — literally, slave labor.' Human rights advocates say returning the Uyghurs to China risks torture, long imprisonment, or disappearance. Rubio, a leading critic of Beijing, co-sponsored the 2021 Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans imports from Xinjiang unless free of forced labor. His stance for human rights in China has subjected him to Chinese sanctions since 2020. China refutes accusations of genocide Both the Biden and previous Trump administrations have classified China's actions in Xinjiang as genocide, while a 2022 United Nations report said Beijing's policies may constitute crimes against humanity. China rejects these accusations, framing its actions as anti-terrorism measures. The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok claimed on Wednesday that Uyghur detainees in Thailand had terrorist ties. 'A small number of individuals, enticed by external forces, fled abroad and even joined the 'East Turkestan Islamic Movement,' [ETIM] a terrorist organization recognized by the United Nations, becoming terrorists themselves,' the embassy stated. Although ETIM was listed as a terror group in 2002, the U.S. delisted it in 2020, citing no 'clear and convincing evidence of ETIM's existence,' according to Congressional Research Service. Julie Millsap, government relations manager at the Washington-based group No Business With Genocide, dismissed China's claims. There has been 'no evidence presented to link these men to terrorism,' Millsap told VOA. 'The PRC cannot claim concurrently that it has a population of happy, dancing Uyghurs while labeling asylum seekers as extremists.' Arslan Hidayat, team lead of the Save Uyghur campaign by U.S.-based Justice for All, said Uyghur detainees in Thailand recently faced a troubling development. 'Last week, I learned from the detainees that Thai immigration officers attempted to photograph 43 Uyghur detainees and have them sign documents similar to those used in 2015, when more than 100 Uyghurs were forcibly repatriated to China,' Hidayat told VOA Friday. 'Fearing a repeat of that mass deportation, the detainees refused and launched a hunger strike, which continues to this day,' he said. 'Degrading treatment or even torture' In addition to the 43 Uyghurs in Thailand's IDC, five are imprisoned after a failed escape attempt. A U.N. report cited 'degrading treatment or even torture' and five deaths, including two children, urging Thai authorities against deportation without due process and individual protection assessments. Human Rights Watch on Friday urged Thailand to release detained Uyghurs and grant them safe passage to a third country. 'Successive Thai governments have kept the Uyghurs in inhumane detention, while under pressure from the Chinese government to send them to China,' said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, calling on Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra's government to end this cycle. VOA contacted the Thai Embassy in Washington and the Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry for comment on the Uyghurs' status and the reports of potential repatriation but received no response. Babar Baloch, global spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, told VOA the agency is closely monitoring the situation and has sought assurances from Thai authorities. 'We continue to remind the authorities of their obligations on non-refoulement and to advocate for alternatives to detention,' he said Friday. Zumretay Arkin, vice president of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress, cited ongoing discussions between China and Thailand about deportations in the context of the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic relations. 'We remain concerned about their fate and continue to increase public pressure,' Arkin told VOA, adding that her group had called on partner organizations to organize global protests outside Thai diplomatic missions. Family torn apart Rahile, a 32-year-old Uyghur mother of three living in Turkey, has been separated from her husband, detained in Bangkok for nearly a decade. She asked that his name not be used, fearing reprisal from Thai authorities. 'We had just built our home [in Xinjiang] and were living a normal life when everything turned into a nightmare 12 years ago,' she told VOA from Kayseri, Turkey, requesting her last name be withheld to protect relatives in southern Xinjiang. Their ordeal began in 2013 when a Uyghur working for the Chinese government warned her husband that his name was on a detention list as authorities targeted Uyghur men under vague suspicions of alleged separatism and extremism. 'My husband learned of an escape route and asked if I would follow or stay behind,' Rahile said. 'People around us were disappearing. He had no choice but to leave.' The couple fled without passports, relying on smugglers to cross into Southeast Asia. Intercepted in Thailand in 2014, Rahile and her two young sons spent 18 months in detention before Turkey resettled more than 170 women and children. Her husband remained with more than 150 Uyghur migrants in Thailand. Weeks later, over 100 Uyghurs were forcibly deported to China. 'They were never heard from again,' she said. 'I was relieved my husband was still in Thailand. I hoped we'd reunite soon.' A decade later, her youngest son, born in Thai detention, has never met his father. 'The space was so cramped my children could sleep, but I had to stand,' she said. 'Now, my husband has endured that pain for 11 years.' In Turkey, Rahile juggles jobs to support her family after initial aid from the local community. 'My children ask why their father isn't here,' she said. 'I have no answer for them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-vows-to-oppose-thai-uyghur-deportations-as-us-secretary-of-state/7942121.html	2025-01-18T17:27:22-08:00	
Macron praises World War II French Resistance activist, author	PARIS — France's President Emmanuel Macron has paid tribute to former French Resistance activist and author Genevieve Callerot, who has died at age 108. Callerot, who was among the last survivors of the groups that fought the country's World War II occupation by Nazi Germany, died Thursday in a care home in Saint-Aulaye-Puymangou, a town in the Dordogne region of southwestern France where she had lived since childhood, according to local media reports. A statement from the presidential Elysee Palace said Macron offered 'his heartfelt condolences to her loved ones, to all those who were illuminated by her solar presence, and finally to those whose lives she saved.' Callerot 'takes with her a little piece of France, a certain France that is tough on suffering and intimidation, tender toward the beauty of the world, as quick to raise its fist in the face of oppression as it is to extend its hand,' the statement said. Born in 1916, Callerot was 24 when France surrendered to Adolf Hitler's invasion forces in June 1940, an event 'which forever marked her life and revealed her to herself,' the statement said. It said she and her family joined a Resistance network that smuggled people across the demarcation line that separated Nazi-occupied areas that included Paris, northern France and the country's Atlantic seaboard and the so-called free zone governed by the French Vichy administration that collaborated with the Nazi occupiers. She participated in the escape of 200 men and women, including Jews and American and British war-wounded, 'whose lives she saved with anonymous heroism, and who often never knew what they owed' her, Macron's office said. It said German forces took her into custody three times — twice releasing her for lack of evidence and holding her in prison for several weeks the third time. She and her husband worked as farmers after the war. When she was 67, she published her first novel — Les cinq filles du Grand-Barrail, or The Five Girls of Grand-Barrail — about a family of sharecroppers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-praises-world-war-ii-french-resistance-activist-author/7942123.html	2025-01-18T17:18:43-08:00	
Trump arrives in Washington for inaugural celebrations	WASHINGTON — Donald Trump arrived in Washington on Saturday night ahead of his second inauguration as president. Trump flew in on a U.S. military C-32 aircraft from West Palm Beach, Florida, with his wife, Melania Trump, and their son, Barron, on a flight dubbed Special Air Mission 47 — a nod to Trump becoming the 47th president on Monday. It's a courtesy that's traditionally been extended by the outgoing administration to the incoming one. Trump did not make a government plane available to President Joe Biden ahead of his inauguration in 2021. Instead, the Democrat flew to Washington on a privately chartered aircraft. Trump's celebration of his return to power was set to get underway Saturday evening with a fireworks showcase at his Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, about 30 miles outside Washington. With a blast of Arctic air expected to leave the nation's capital with frigid temperatures on Inauguration Day, organizers were also scrambling to move inside most of Monday's outdoor events, including the swearing-in ceremony. 'I think we made the right decision. We'll be very comfortable now,' Trump told NBC News in a phone interview Saturday. On Pennsylvania Avenue leading to the White House, crews were breaking down metal bleachers that would have been used for outdoor inauguration viewing stands. Timothy Wallis, 58, flew in for the inauguration from Pocatello, Idaho, with friends. The group had tickets to watch the ceremony outside but haven't been able to get tickets to any of the indoor events. 'We found out on the plane,' he said about the change of plans. Wallis said he was disappointed about the switch and a little bemused because he's used to cold weather at home. 'We left snow to come here,' he said. 'I brought my gloves!' Trump, a Republican who left office in 2021 after his refusal to accept his loss to Democrat Joe Biden, led a mob to overrun the Capitol. He then broke tradition by skipping Biden's inauguration. Biden will adhere to one of the most potent symbols of the democratic handover, welcoming Trump to the White House and joining him on the ride to the Capitol before Trump takes the oath of office. The first time Trump was sworn into office eight years ago, the former reality TV star billionaire came in as an outsider disrupting Washington's norms, delivering a dark inaugural address as his swearing-in drew large protests and some clashes in the street. On Saturday, the protests were far less noticeable, eclipsed by the ceremonies and celebrations around Trump's taking power. As one more marker of Trump's remarkable comeback, the events surrounding his inauguration will be more celebrity-studded than the last time, along with a noticeable turnout by a cadre of tech-world billionaires. While Trump holds court at his Virginia golf club Saturday evening, Vice President-elect JD Vance will attend a reception for Cabinet members and host a dinner in Washington. On Sunday, the eve of his inauguration, Trump is scheduled to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery before heading to a rally at Capital One Arena in Washington. The rally will be followed by a private dinner. On Inauguration Day, Trump will start with the traditional prayer service at St. John's Episcopal Church before heading to the White House for a customary tea with the outgoing president and first lady. Trump then heads to the Capitol, where his ceremony has been moved indoors. It's not quite clear how the ceremony will be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda, which holds 600 people. More than 250,000 guests were ticketed to view the inauguration from around the Capitol grounds. After Trump takes the oath of office and delivers his inaugural address, there will be a ceremonial farewell to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As the new Republican government takes power, Trump will head to a signing ceremony at the Capitol to approve some of his first official acts, followed by a congressional luncheon and review of U.S. troops. The planned traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue has morphed into an indoor event because of the cold, with Trump again planning to speak to his gathered supporters before he heads to the White House for a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. A trio of glitzy balls will follow in the evening, punctuated by musical performances.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-arrives-in-washington-for-inaugural-celebrations-/7942119.html	2025-01-18T16:56:45-08:00	
Journalists in Haiti demand justice, bury 2nd colleague killed by gangs	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — The young boy wore a suit and bow tie to his stepfather's funeral Saturday, where he demanded a handkerchief and wiped tears off his mother's face as they buried Marckendy Natoux, one of two journalists killed by gangs in Haiti. Natoux was fatally shot on Christmas Eve in one of the worst attacks on the press in the troubled Caribbean country, with gangs opening fire during what was supposed to be the reopening of Haiti's largest public hospital. The 42-year-old father of two spoke four languages and worked for several local and U.S. media outlets. He also taught English and Spanish and was known for his kindness. 'Natoux was a protector of journalists,' recalled Oriol Jacklin, a journalist with Radio Regard FM. 'He worked with everyone and respected everybody.' Natoux did marketing for Voice of America's Creole service and worked for the U.S. Agency for Global Media and the Boston Caribbean Network, among others. On December 24, he traveled to downtown Port-au-Prince with other journalists to cover the anticipated reopening of Haiti's General Hospital, which gangs had pillaged. Shortly after he arrived, gunmen opened fire. 'He was killed for bringing news to the world,' said Natoux's colleague, René Celias. Johnson 'Izo' Andre, considered Haiti's most powerful gang leader and part of the Viv Ansanm coalition of gangs that have taken control of 85% of Port-au-Prince, posted a video on social media claiming responsibility. He said he had not authorized the hospital's reopening. Natoux's colleague, Jacalin, also blamed the government for the attack, which led to the health minister being replaced. 'You shouldn't invite someone to cover a media event in an area you know is dangerous,' Jacalin said. 'The negligence of the government took the life of two journalists, one police officer and left five other journalists with bullet wounds and awaiting surgeries.' Also killed was Jimmy Jean, a 44-year-old father of six who worked for the online news outlet Moun Afe Bon. He was buried Thursday. Robest Dimanche, spokesperson for the Online Media Collective, a group that defends the rights of online journalists in Haiti, said Natoux was 'full of talent and integrity' as he condemned both killings. 'This was a very dark day,' he said. 'We are asking the authorities to not let this crime go unpunished.' But it's unlikely those responsible will be brought to justice. Last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) ranked Haiti as one of the top offenders worldwide in letting journalists' murders go unpunished. At least seven murders remain unsolved since 2019. Natoux and Jean were among the more than 5,600 people reported killed across Haiti last year despite the launch of a United Nations backed mission led by Kenyan police to help quell gang violence. On Saturday, an additional 217 Kenyan officers arrived to join 400 others who arrived last year as the U.S. and other countries seek a U.N. peacekeeping mission, warning that the current mission lacks funding and personnel. As friends and family mourned Natoux on Saturday, his small stepson used a handkerchief to wipe tears off his mother's face and then wiped his own as a family friend cradled the boy's head and whispered something in his ear. When the funeral ended, loved ones lifted Natoux's coffin high into the air. One colleague placed his hand on the Haitian flag draped over it as anguished wails filled the church.	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalists-in-haiti-demand-justice-bury-2nd-colleague-killed-by-gangs-/7941920.html	2025-01-18T15:36:28-08:00	
Kenya deploys more police officers to Haiti to tackle gang violence	NAIROBI, KENYA — Kenya's interior minister said the east African nation has deployed another 217 police officers to Haiti as part of a multinational force to curb gang violence. Kipchumba Murkomen said in a statement Saturday that the police officers left Kenya on Friday. 'The Kenya-led mission has made tremendous progress in reducing gang violence, earning praise across the globe,' said Mukomen, who shared a photo of himself with some of the officers aboard a plane. Kenya's 'commitment to this historic mission is unwavering,' he said. Kenya first sent troops to the Caribbean nation in June and the total deployment now exceeds 600. Kenya's President William Ruto has pledged to deploy 1,000 troops as part of the United Nations-backed force in Haiti. Gang violence has left more than 700,000 Haitians homeless in recent years, with many crowding into makeshift and unsanitary shelters after gunmen razed their homes. More than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti last year, according to the United Nations. The number of killings increased by more than 20% compared with all of 2023, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office. In addition, more than 2,200 people were reported injured and nearly 1,500 kidnapped, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-deploys-217-more-police-officers-to-haiti-to-tackle-gang-violence-/7941912.html	2025-01-18T15:09:09-08:00	
Iran unveils underground missile base amid tension with US, Israel	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran unveiled an underground naval missile base at an undisclosed Gulf location on Saturday, state TV said, two days before the start of Donald Trump's second term as president of the United States. It was unveiled at a time when tension with Washington is widely expected to rise. Iranian leaders are concerned that Trump might empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike Iran's nuclear sites, while tightening U.S. sanctions on its oil industry through his 'maximum pressure' policy. State television showed Revolutionary Guards chief General Hossein Salami visiting the secret base during war games. He said it was one of several built underground for vessels capable of launching long-range missiles and carrying out distant warfare. 'We assure the great nation of Iran that their young people are capable of coming out honorable and victorious from a battle on the seas against enemies big and small,' Salami said. State television said the base was built at a depth of 500 meters somewhere in the Gulf and it showed tunnels with long rows of what it said were a new version of Taregh-class radar-evading speedboats that can launch cruise missiles. Earlier this month, Iran started military exercises that are due to last two months and have already included war games in which the Revolutionary Guards defended nuclear installations in Natanz against mock attacks by missiles and drones. Iran, which says its ballistic missiles are an important deterrent and retaliatory force against the U.S. and Israel, has in the past unveiled several underground 'missiles cities.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-unveils-underground-missile-base-amid-tension-with-us-israel-/7941897.html	2025-01-18T14:32:19-08:00

Trump 'most likely' will give TikTok 90-day extension to avoid US ban	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he 'most likely' would give TikTok 90 more days to work out a deal that would allow the popular video-sharing platform to avoid a U.S. ban. Trump said in an NBC News interview that he had not decided what to do but was considering granting TikTok a reprieve after he is sworn into office Monday. A law that prohibits mobile app stores and internet hosting services from distributing TikTok to U.S. users takes effect Sunday. Under the law passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden last year, TikTok’s China-based parent company had nine months to sell the platform’s U.S. operation to an approved buyer. The law allows the sitting president to grant an extension if a sale is in progress. 'I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at. 'The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate. You know, it’s appropriate,' Trump told 'Meet the Press' moderator Kristen Welker in a phone interview. 'We have to look at it carefully. It’s a very big situation. 'If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7941823.html	2025-01-18T10:39:17-08:00	
When Trump takes office, it’s unclear who will lead Pentagon	WASHINGTON — It is unclear who will take over at the Pentagon and the military services when the top leaders all step down Monday as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. As of Friday, officials said they had not yet heard who will become the acting defense secretary. Officials said the military chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force were getting ready to step in as acting service secretaries — a rare move — because no civilians had been named or, in some cases, had turned down the opportunity. As is customary, all current political appointees will step down as of noon on Inauguration Day, leaving hundreds of key defense posts open, including dozens that require Senate confirmation. In addition to the top job and all three service secretaries, all of their deputies and senior policy staff will leave. The Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to vote Monday on Trump's choice to head the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, but the full Senate vote may not happen until days later. As a result, someone from the Biden administration would have to take over temporarily. For the service secretaries, officials said that while things could still change before the inauguration, the Trump team is eyeing General Randy George, chief of staff of the Army, to be that service's temporary head. They said General David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, and Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the Navy chief, are aware they may have to step in if no civilian is named as acting secretary, and they are preparing for that possibility. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal deliberations, said many senior Biden administration leaders are reluctant to serve in the incoming Trump administration because they are concerned about policy changes they may be required to handle or enforce. Usually, only people appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate serve as a defense or service secretary, including in an acting capacity during a transition. Trump could pull a confirmed member of the Biden administration from another agency and put that person at the Pentagon. Civilian control of the military is a key tenet, but under the law the military chiefs of the services — who are all Senate confirmed — can take over on a temporary basis. It's rare, but it did happen more than 30 years ago. Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine Corps Reserve two-star general, said that in 1993, Admiral Frank Kelso, who was Navy chief, was asked to serve as acting Navy secretary when Bill Clinton became president because civilian leaders did not step up. 'It doesn’t happen very often,' said Punaro, who spent 14 years as a staff director on the Senate Armed Services Committee and has advised nominees through the confirmation process for decades. 'Normally you don’t want the active-duty military serving in the civilian control positions. The practical reality is they are wearing both hats.' The transition to a new secretary of defense has usually been an orderly process. Four years ago, the deputy secretary of defense under Trump, David Norquist, became acting secretary for the two-day gap between the inauguration of Democratic President Joe Biden and the Senate vote to confirm Lloyd Austin as Pentagon chief. President Barack Obama asked his Republican predecessor's defense secretary, Robert Gates, to stay on as his own Pentagon leader in 2009. In 2017, Jim Mattis, Trump's pick to be secretary during his first term, was confirmed on Inauguration Day. Various administrations have handled the handover differently. In many cases, people have been asked to stay on in a temporary role. In one recent instance, officials said, the comptrollers of the services stepped in as acting secretaries because a key job in the coming months is to put together the massive, complex budget and more often the money people are considered less political. This year's gap is further complicated by the fact that Trump and Hegseth have both pledged to rid the Defense Department of what they call 'woke' generals — or those who have supported diversity programs. That raises the possibility that even as the administration struggles to fill its political appointee slots, it may also be carving holes in the military leadership structure that will have to be filled. When Senator Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, asked Hegseth during his nomination hearing if he intended to fire the current Joint Chiefs chairman, General CQ Brown, he answered, 'Senator, every single senior officer will be reviewed based on meritocracy, standards, lethality and commitment to lawful orders they will be given.' Hegseth previously said that Brown should be fired. Conservative groups have compiled lists of generals they believe should be fired for supporting diversity programs. If Brown is fired, the vice chairman would take over until a new chairman is confirmed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/when-trump-takes-office-it-s-unclear-who-will-lead-pentagon/7941818.html	2025-01-18T10:28:44-08:00	
With Trump’s inauguration indoors, few guests will see ceremony in person	Moving the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump indoors due to expected freezing temperatures means most guests with tickets will not be able to attend the ceremony in person. 'Those with tickets for the Presidential Platform and members of Congress will be able to attend in person,' the Joint Inaugural Committee said. But the 'vast majority of ticketed guests will not be able to attend the ceremonies in person.' 'We strongly suggest people who are in Washington for the event attend other indoor events at indoor venues of their choice to watch the inauguration,' the committee said. On Inauguration Day, temperatures in the U.S. capital are expected to hit a low of 11 degrees Fahrenheit (-11 degrees Celsius) and a high of just 23 degrees Fahrenheit (-5 degrees Celsius), and it is expected to feel even colder with the wind chill. The frigid temperatures mean Trump's inauguration is expected to be the coldest in 40 years, according to meteorologists. 'I don’t want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way,' Trump said on Truth Social. President Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration in 1985 was the last time a swearing-in ceremony was moved indoors. Many of the more than 220,000 ticketed guests who had been set to watch from the U.S. Capitol grounds will be unable to watch in person as Trump takes the oath of office. The U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement that the ticketed outside areas on the West Front of the Capitol will be closed Monday. In an email to House of Representatives offices, the House Sergeant at Arms asked congressional offices to tell their constituents who had been given tickets that they were now 'commemorative' since most of them will not be able to watch in person as Trump becomes president. What’s more, 250,000 people without tickets were expected to stand on the National Mall for the outdoor ceremony, according to a permit issued to Trump’s inaugural committee by the National Park Service. Trump said supporters can watch the ceremony on screens inside the Capital One Arena, a professional sports and concert venue in downtown Washington. It holds 20,000 people. Capital One Arena also will be the site of a Sunday afternoon Trump victory rally. The American band the Village People will perform, among others. Moving Trump’s inauguration inside means it won’t be possible to compare crowd size to previous inauguration ceremonies. After his first inauguration in 2017, Trump expressed frustration with media reports indicating that the crowd on the National Mall was smaller than the one that witnessed the swearing-in of former President Barack Obama in 2009, according to reports. With Trump’s inauguration just days away, various civil rights, racial justice and reproductive health groups organized a demonstration called the People’s March in downtown Washington on Saturday. Tens of thousands of people were expected to take part in the protest against Trump. Rather than narrowly focusing on the president-elect, the demonstration is focusing on a broader set of goals around women’s and reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, immigration, climate and democracy, organizers said. The People’s March is a rebrand of the Women’s March, when more than 1 million people filled the streets of Washington the day after Trump was sworn in for the first time in 2017, according to various media reports. Another protest is scheduled for Inauguration Day, but it’s unclear if that will be affected by the freezing temperatures. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-trump-s-inauguration-indoors-few-guests-will-see-ceremony-in-person/7941801.html	2025-01-18T10:00:15-08:00	
Swedish forces in Latvia make their largest NATO deployment to date	WARSAW, POLAND — Hundreds of Swedish troops arrived in Latvia on Saturday to join a Canadian-led multinational brigade along NATO's eastern flank, a mission Sweden is calling its most significant operation so far as a member of the Western defense alliance. A ship carrying parts of a mechanized infantry battalion arrived early Saturday in the port of Riga, the Latvian capital, escorted by the Swedish air force and units from the Swedish and Latvian navies, the Swedish armed forces said in a statement. Latvia borders Russia to its east and Russia ally Belarus to its southeast. Tensions are high across Central Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sweden's armed forces said that the mission of 550 troops will contribute to the alliance’s deterrence and defense efforts and ensure stability in the region, and that it 'marks Sweden’s largest commitment yet since joining NATO' last year. Commander Lieutenant Colonel Henrik Rosdahl of the 71st Battalion said he felt great pride in contributing to the alliance's collective defense. 'It’s a historic day, but at the same time, it’s our new normal,' he said. The Swedish troops join one of eight NATO brigades along the alliance’s eastern flank. The battalion is stationed outside the town of Adazi, near Riga. Sweden formally joined NATO in March as the 32nd member of the trans-Atlantic military alliance, ending decades of post-World War II neutrality and centuries of broader nonalignment with major powers as security concerns in Europe spiked following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Finland also abandoned its longstanding military neutrality to join NATO in April 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-forces-in-latvia-make-their-largest-nato-deployment-to-date/7941785.html	2025-01-18T09:36:42-08:00	
Firefighters make progress containing California fires	Firefighters are making some progress in containing the blazes that have leveled complete neighborhoods in the U.S. city of Los Angeles. As of Saturday morning, the Palisades Fire was 43% contained, up from 31% contained on Friday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. That fire has burned through nearly 10,000 hectares of land. Meanwhile, the Eaton Fire was 73% contained by Saturday morning, up from 65% contained on Friday, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton Fire has burned through more than 5,700 hectares of land. Those two fires have killed at least 27 people and destroyed more than 12,300 structures. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that 18 people are still missing after the fires. The cause of the Palisades Fire is still under investigation. The department has not yet filed an incident report. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s potential liability for the Palisades Fire will depend on whether the utility’s power lines or assets were involved in sparking the wildfire, according to a Friday report by the credit rating agency Moody’s. But Moody’s said the utility’s distribution lines and other infrastructure will likely not substantially impact its finances and credits because much of the department’s power infrastructure in the fire area was underground, shielding it from damage. Calmed winds mean some residents have been allowed back into neighborhoods affected by the Eaton and Palisades fires. Although winds have calmed down in the area over the past few days, the National Weather Service said dangerous conditions are expected to return next week. The strongest winds are predicted Tuesday night. In the wake of the fires that have destroyed so many homes, some residents are now struggling to find affordable places to live as rent surges and the status of insurance settlements remains uncertain. Some information in this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/firefighters-make-progress-containing-california-fires/7941777.html	2025-01-18T09:17:29-08:00	
Nigeria fuel tanker truck blast kills at least 60	MAIDUGURI, NIGERIA — At least 60 people were killed and more injured in northern Nigeria on Saturday when a fuel tanker truck overturned and spilled the cargo, which exploded, the Federal Road Safety Corps said. The accident in Niger state follows a similar blast in Jigawa state in October that killed 147 people, one of the worst such tragedies in Africa's most-populous nation. Kumar Tsukwam, FRSC sector commander for Niger state, said most of the victims were impoverished residents who had rushed to scoop up the spilled gasoline after the truck overturned. 'Large crowds of people gathered to scoop fuel despite concerted efforts to stop them,' Tsukwam said in a statement. 'Suddenly, the tanker burst into flames, engulfing another tanker. So far 60 corpses [have been] recovered from the scene.' Tsukwam said firefighters put out the blaze. Such accidents have become common in Africa's largest oil producer, killing dozens of people in the country grappling with its worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. The price of fuel in Nigeria has soared more than 400% since President Bola Tinubu scrapped a decades-old subsidy when he took office in May 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-fuel-tanker-truck-blast-kills-at-least-60/7941772.html	2025-01-18T09:09:21-08:00	
Far from home, exiled journalists say Russia is always on their minds	PRAGUE — 'Are you going to ask why I brought you here?' asked Alexey Levchenko as he arrived in Prague's Smichov neighborhood. It was a brisk October morning, and the editor of the Russian outlet The Insider had suggested the meeting place: a small park with a Baroque fountain featuring the Roman god Neptune held aloft by bears. The neighborhood's architecture, Levchenko said, reminds him of Russia's second-biggest city, St. Petersburg. 'It's difficult to know that I can't come back to St. Petersburg,' said Levchenko, who often visited the city from his home in Moscow. 'It's one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and one of my favorites.' Levchenko left Russia in 2021, a few months before the war began in Ukraine. He made his way to Prague, which has a history as a hub for dissident writers. Although the Czech capital was once subject to Soviet rule, it's different from Russia, Levchenko said. But for a fleeting moment, when he visits the Smichov neighborhood, the similarities can make him feel as if his life hasn't been upended. Watchdogs estimate about 1,500 journalists fled Russia after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and escalated its repression of dissent and independent media. Some journalists went to Berlin, Riga and Tbilisi. Others, like Levchenko, found refuge in Prague. And while they enjoy a degree of safety to continue reporting, the journalists must also contend with the emotional turmoil that comes with being forced to leave your family and friends, your home and culture, for an unfamiliar place. The journalists also maintain a fractured relationship with their homeland, characterized by nostalgia and homesickness as well as hope and a commitment to the work that forced them into exile in the first place. Some, like Levchenko, look for comfort in their new surroundings. Others turn to the experiences of exiles who came before them. After Alesya Marokhovskaya left Moscow in 2022, she began reading the memoirs of other Russian exiles. The editor-in-chief of the investigative outlet IStories says she found some solace and camaraderie in their writing. She read the works of writers such as Boris Zaitsev, Vladimir Veidle and Marina Tsvetaeva, the latter of whom lived in exile during the 1920s and 1930s, including in Prague. Marokhovskaya hoped their experiences would offer some guidance or wisdom. But what struck her most was that their writing often centered around a deep longing to return to Russia. 'They just lived for this goal, and they forgot to live in real life,' Marokhovskaya said when we met outside a cafe in Prague. Unlike those exiles, Marokhovskaya decided she couldn't cling to what was likely a false hope. She accepts that she may never return home. 'I will try to create my life where I am,' she said. Moscow has long targeted independent journalists with lawsuits, arrests and killings, say watchdogs. But repression reached new heights after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022. A law that prohibits spreading what Moscow deems 'false information' about the war has made it all but impossible for Russian journalists to report accurately on the conflict. The penalty is 15 years in prison. The severe risks forced many journalists to make a difficult decision. Anna Ryzhkova, who works with the Russian outlet Verstka, left her family and friends for exile in Tbilisi and later Prague. But if she had stayed in Russia, she says, she would have needed to stop her work to stay safe. That would have been the ultimate sacrifice. 'If I stayed in Moscow, and I saw my colleagues working and me staying silent, I think that would be sacrificing,' Ryzhkova said. Like Marokhovskaya, Ryzhkova has resigned herself to the reality that returning home is a far-off prospect. 'I will need to build something new here,' she said. More than 1,500 kilometers now lie between her and Russia, but Ryzhkova and the other exiles I spoke with said their homeland consumes a large part of their daily lives. It's a jarring tension that leaves some feeling as if they left part of themselves behind in Russia. 'I'm working in Russia in my mind,' Marokhovskaya said. 'It's really not easy. Sometimes I'm falling asleep, and I'm still there, still in Russia, not here.' It's common for exiles to feel caught between different places and never truly at home, according to Lyndsey Stonebridge, a professor at the University of Birmingham who writes about exile. 'You're always existing in two places at once,' she said. Toward the end of World War II, the concept of 'inner emigration' emerged to describe people who stayed in Nazi Germany but whose minds moved elsewhere as a form of resistance. Exiled Russian journalists appear to have flipped that concept, Stonebridge said, because they physically left Russia, but their minds remain at home. Outside the cafe in Prague, as trams rumble past every few minutes, Marokhovskaya said she counts the city of Moscow among the things she misses the most. Gazing into her half-drunk cappuccino, she said, 'The main problem is I miss a Moscow that doesn't exist anymore because the city has changed.' Moscow is now filled with banners and advertisements for people to join the army. Pro-war 'Z' posters and symbols are everywhere. The mood is different, she said. Being in exile often brings mixed feelings, including homesickness and grief, Stonebridge said. 'You must be in mourning for the country you've left, but also the country that you think you could still live in,' she said. That longing can also reflect optimism for the future, Stonebridge said. 'It's not just nostalgia, but nostalgia's twin, which is hope,' she said. That phenomenon is underscored in the mindset of many of the journalists who say they are committed to reporting on Russia because they are committed to improving their country. 'It's really easy to hate the government and love the country,' Marokhovskaya said. 'I'm a patriot for my country, and the Russian government — they're not.' In his 1984 essay on exile in the literary magazine Granta, the Palestinian American academic Edward Said warned against romanticizing exile. 'Exile is strangely compelling to think about but terrible to experience. It is the unhealable rift forced between a human being and a native place,' wrote Said, who was exiled himself. For Ryzhkova, the homesickness is constant. 'It is something that I feel in the air at any time,' she said. 'It's not that it really hurts much, but it is still with you every moment.' The journalist speaks with her family every day, but she finds it upsetting to know that she can't help as much as if she had stayed. When her grandmother broke her leg recently, Ryzhkova said, all she could do was call to check on her. 'That is really painful for me,' she said. Ryzhkova, like the other journalists I spoke with, is grateful to the Czech government for providing a haven. But feeling out of place is inevitable. Still, brief moments offer a respite — like a concert by the Russian singer Zemfira, who has lived in exile herself since the start of the war. Everyone at the concert spoke Russian, Ryzhkova said. 'That's a nice feeling,' she said. Back in Smichov on the tour of what reminds Levchenko of home, he proclaimed that 'nostalgia is not only buildings.' It is found in other things, too, like a Russian supermarket that offers a taste of home. Across the Vltava River, the store is where Levchenko comes when he and his Russian friends have parties. Here, he can purchase Russian pickles and cabbage, caviar and vodka. The store also sells colognes that Levchenko said were popular during the Soviet years, and wool caps that are worn when visiting Russian saunas known as banya. Not all saunas are created equal, Levchenko said, but Czech saunas are an adequate replacement for the banya that Levchenko frequented in Moscow. His tour ended at Pelmenarna, a restaurant specializing in Russian dumplings called pelmeni and vareniky. Levchenko ordered the ones filled with beef and pork. 'Many people want to reconstruct their life' through the different elements of Russian culture found and created in exile, Levchenko said. Does Levchenko try to reconstruct his former life? 'Sometimes, yes,' Levchenko said. The journalist explained that nostalgia can also come from unexpected places — even Starbucks. One branch in Prague has a similar interior to one he used to frequent in Moscow. 'It's funny that Starbucks can remind you of home,' Levchenko said. He sipped his vodka and shrugged.	https://www.voanews.com/a/press_freedom_russia_exile_media_prague_homesick/7941756.html	2025-01-18T08:59:01-08:00	
Gaza ceasefire to begin Sunday morning as Israel continues strikes	A ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war is set to begin Sunday at 8:30 a.m., mediator Qatar said Saturday after Israel’s Cabinet voted to approve the truce and hostage release agreement. Following a meeting that lasted more than six hours into the early morning on Saturday, the Israeli government ratified the agreement, which could lead to a permanent end to the 15-month war with Hamas in the besieged Gaza Strip enclave. 'The government has approved the framework for the return of the hostages. The framework for the hostages’ release will come into effect on Sunday,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. Netanyahu’s office said the deal 'supports achieving the objectives of the war.' But in a statement Saturday, Hamas — designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries — contended that Israel had 'failed to achieve its aggressive goals' and 'only succeeded in committing war crimes that disgrace the dignity of humanity.' The war in Gaza began when Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages. Just under 100 hostages are thought to remain in Hamas custody, but about one-third of those are believed to be dead. Gaza authorities say nearly 47,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in subsequent Israeli military operations. Without providing evidence, Israel says the death toll includes thousands of militants it has killed. The United States, Qatar and Egypt, which have been mediating negotiations between Israel and Hamas for months, announced the ceasefire on Wednesday. The ceasefire will begin with a three-week pause in fighting and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Thirty-three of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages, including women, children, men over 50 and ill and wounded captives, are expected to be released in this phase. In return, Israel will release almost 2,000 Palestinians from its jails. The White House said it expects three female hostages to be released to Israel in the afternoon through the Red Cross. Israel’s Justice Ministry published their details early on Saturday, plus the ceasefire agreement, which said 30 Palestinian prisoners would be released for each female hostage on Sunday. After Sunday, lead U.S. negotiator Brett McGurk said, the agreement calls for four more female hostages to be released after seven days, followed by the release of three further hostages every seven days. In this first phase of the three-stage deal, Israeli troops will pull back to the edges of Gaza, and many Palestinians will be able to return to what remains of their homes as increased aid flows into the enclave, which has been decimated in the war. Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said Saturday the deal provides for the entry of 600 trucks per day into Gaza, including 50 trucks of fuel. Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued since the ceasefire was announced, including on Saturday. Israeli tanks shelled the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City, while airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza, according to residents. Medics in Gaza said five people were killed in an airstrike that hit a tent in the Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The Israeli army said in a statement Saturday that it conducted strikes on 50 'terror targets' across the territory on Friday alone. At least 123 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks since the ceasefire was announced a few days ago, according to the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service. Some information in this report was provided by Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-ceasefire-to-begin-sunday-morning-as-israel-continues-strikes/7941724.html	2025-01-18T08:06:50-08:00	
Colombian government suspends talks with left-wing rebels after clashes	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Friday that he was suspending peace negotiations with National Liberation Army guerrillas after a day of violence between armed groups in the northeast that left at least 30 people dead. The violence took place in the Catatumbo region, on the border with Venezuela, where rival groups have for years been fighting for control of the cocaine trade. The latest fighting pitted rebels from the left-wing National Liberation Army, or ELN — the biggest of the armed groups still active in Colombia — against dissidents from the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which signed a peace deal with the state in 2016 after more than 50 years of war. Petro accused the ELN of committing 'war crimes,' and said on a social network, 'That is why we are suspending dialogue with this group, because the ELN shows no willingness to make peace.' Colombia's first left-wing president, Petro launched negotiations with the various armed groups that still control parts of Colombia after being elected in 2022 on a promise to pursue 'total peace.' The talks with the ELN broke down for several months last year after the group launched a deadly attack on a military base. William Villamizar, governor of North Santander department, told Blu Radio the latest clashes between the ELN and FARC dissidents erupted on Thursday. 'Data from the field indicates at least 30 people killed and more than 20 injured,' he said, blaming the clashes on a 'territorial dispute' linked to the cocaine trade. Colombian ombudsman Iris Marin told Blu Radio that ELN members were attacking civilians, going 'house to house' in the area around the town of Tibu in search of people it believed to be related to the FARC dissidents. She said preliminary reports indicated that 'dozens' of families had been displaced and more than 20 people were missing. On Thursday, the United Nations reported that five former FARC combatants had been killed. The deal with FARC aimed at ending the longest-running war in the Americas, involving leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries, drug gangs and the military. But holdout FARC splinter groups and the ELN refused to make peace. In November the government and ELN agreed at talks in Venezuela to resume the peace process, but the military and the rebels have continued to trade fire. Experts said the cocaine trade is at the heart of the unrest. Tibu, scene of this week's fighting, lies in one of the country's biggest areas for the production of coca — the main ingredient in cocaine, of which Colombia is the world's leading producer.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombian-government-suspends-talks-with-left-wing-rebels-after-clashes/7941564.html	2025-01-18T03:40:58-08:00	
Gaza ceasefire set to begin one day before Trump’s inauguration	WHITE HOUSE — Israel’s Cabinet approved a deal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, with 24 ministers voting in favor and eight ministers rejecting the agreement. The deal is scheduled to be implemented beginning Sunday. The deal to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas was achieved after more than a year of negotiations, with mediation from the United States, Qatar and Egypt. President Joe Biden first endorsed the deal in May. The warring parties agreed to it on Wednesday, and it was subsequently approved by the Israeli Cabinet early Saturday in Israel. Starting midday on Monday when President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated, it will be up to his administration to see that the deal is enforced. The agreement has three phases, each of which will last six weeks. The terms of phases two and three are still being negotiated, but under phase one the cessation of hostilities is expected to continue if six weeks pass before the next phase is finalized. Phase one includes withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas and more aid for Gaza, as well as the release of some Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons and some hostages held by Hamas, including Americans. The U.S. and other Western countries have designated Hamas as a terrorist group. The release of American hostages is a 'fundamental component' of Trump's interest in ending the war swiftly, according to Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, nonresident senior fellow with the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council's Middle East Programs. Whether Trump will sustain pressure for the deal to proceed to phase two, when all of the hostages are set to be released, and to phase three, when reconstruction of Gaza will begin, remains to be seen, Alkhatib told VOA. Alkhatib expressed concern that after the first phase Trump will be 'so disinterested' in Gaza that the agreement will amount to 'little more than a freezing of the conflict.' This would be disastrous for Palestinians in Gaza and the goal of Palestinian statehood, he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Friday that he had received 'unequivocal guarantees' from both Biden and Trump that if negotiations on phase two fail, Israel 'will return to intense fighting with the backing of the United States.' Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Two-state solution The Biden administration’s goal has been Palestinian statehood under the two-state solution. This could pave the way to bringing Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords — the 2020 deal brokered under the first Trump administration that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Biden had sought to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, which maintains it will not consider normalizing relations until Israel commits to a 'credible path' to a Palestinian state. Washington and Riyadh had been exploring the expansion through a package that would include, among other offers, American security guarantees for the Saudis. Those efforts stalled after the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught. Now Trump appears to be aiming to use the momentum of the Gaza ceasefire to add Saudi Arabia into the accords. 'We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further expand the Historic Abraham Accords,' Trump posted on social media Wednesday following the announcement that a ceasefire deal has been reached. Saudi Arabia has never formally recognized Israel since its creation in 1948. As a de facto leader of the Arab and Islamic world, Riyadh’s recognition would represent a breakthrough for the Jewish state. Trump’s main objective now is to ensure that whatever happens in Gaza does not prevent him from securing that deal, while Israel’s goal is to ensure whatever happens in Gaza doesn't prevent cooperation with the U.S. over Iran, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the department of political studies at Bar Ilan University. 'So, I'm not sure that it makes sense to think beyond the first phase at this point,' Rynhold told VOA. Trump and Israel will 'work out their positions on Gaza precisely against the shadow of those two things,' he added. Trump’s role in securing the deal In the same social media post Wednesday, Trump took credit for his role in securing the ceasefire. 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,' Trump wrote. For months the Biden administration has progressively included Trump’s team in peace talks, beginning with an Oval Office meeting a week after Trump won the election. At that Nov. 13 meeting, Biden proposed that they work together to push the deal through. 'We’ve sent a signal to the incoming team that we’re prepared to work with them on this issue,' national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that day. Shortly after, Sullivan and Biden’s top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, began coordinating with their successors on the Trump team, Mike Waltz and Steve Witkoff, said a senior administration official who spoke with reporters on background Wednesday. The Biden official said that in the final days leading up to the ceasefire, Witkoff worked in tandem with McGurk in an 'almost unprecedented,' cross-administration partnership that was 'highly constructive, very fruitful.' But he declined to elaborate on Witkoff’s and Trump’s role in securing the deal, other than saying that the presidential transition provided a 'natural' deadline for a diplomatic breakthrough. Pressure on Israel Critics have accused Biden of failing to use U.S. military support as leverage over Netanyahu to reach a deal or moderate Israel’s campaign that has taken tens of thousands of Palestinian lives. Publicly, Biden officials have largely echoed Israel in faulting Hamas for the failure of the talks. But some Israeli security officials and many observers also blame Netanyahu for blocking progress, including by repeatedly introducing fresh demands in negotiations. With Trump’s victory, Netanyahu’s calculations may have changed, said Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies. 'Trump injected a kind of fear factor into this process that was missing before,' she told VOA. 'He can't triangulate anymore the way he would play Biden off of the Republican Congress. There's nowhere for Netanyahu to run, nowhere to hide, and so he took this deal he couldn't refuse.' Trump’s pressure may have also created space for Netanyahu to resist ultimatums from far-right allies who had threatened to leave his governing coalition if a ceasefire deal is made, which would mean an end to the prime minister’s term. Eight Israeli far-right politicians, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, rejected the deal but it is still unclear whether they will leave the coalition. 'Netanyahu finally called their bluff,' Blumenfeld said. 'Or maybe actually, Trump called Netanyahu’s bluff, because he was using these right-wing Cabinet members all along as an excuse not to make the concessions that he didn't want to make.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-ceasefire-set-to-begin-one-day-before-trump-s-inauguration-/7941448.html	2025-01-18T02:52:19-08:00

Australia declares disaster in areas of storm-hit east	SYDNEY — Authorities declared a natural disaster Saturday in parts of eastern Australia where gales have toppled trees and knocked out power to tens of thousands of homes. Heavy rain, lightning and winds as strong as 100 kph have swept across Sydney and other areas of New South Wales since Wednesday. With many power lines felled, about 30,000 properties remained without electricity Saturday -- down from a peak of more than 260,000, said the state's emergency services minister, Jihad Dib. 'This is an incident that is affecting the whole state,' he told reporters. Emergency services had responded to more than 7,000 incidents around New South Wales, he said. 'We know that it has not been an easy thing to go through.' Disasters had been declared so far in three local government areas, he said, unlocking support for people seeking emergency housing, essential items, repairs and clean-ups. Electricity network Ausgrid said 140,000 customers had lost power Wednesday and another 68,000 since Friday, with some areas experiencing winds of up to 100 kph. Police reported that an elderly man was killed in the storms when his car was hit by a tree on Wednesday in Cowra, about 230 kilometers west of Sydney.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-declares-disaster-in-areas-of-storm-hit-east/7941544.html	2025-01-18T02:25:46-08:00	
2 judges shot dead at Iran's supreme court: media	TEHRAN, IRAN — Two judges were killed in a shooting attack on Saturday at the Supreme Court building in Tehran, state media reported. 'Three judges of the Supreme Court were targeted. Two of them were martyred,' the Judiciary's Mizan Online website reported, adding that the 'assailant killed himself.' State news agency IRNA also reported that one other person was injured in the attack. Mizan identified the two slain judges as Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghisseh, adding that they worked on cases 'fighting crimes against national security, espionage and terrorism.' The motive behind their killing were not immediately clear, but Mizan said the assailant was not involved in any cases before the Supreme Court, without providing further details on the attacker's identity. Authorities said an investigation into the incident was launched, Mizan added. Veteran judge Moghisseh, 68, was sanctioned in 2019 by the United States for having 'overseen countless unfair trails, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded,' according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Razini, 71, held several important positions in Iran's judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt by assailants 'who planted a magnetic bomb in his vehicle,' according to Mizan. Though attacks targeting judges are rare, Iran has seen a number of shootings targeting high-profile figures over the past years. In October, a Shiite Muslim preacher was shot dead in the southern city of Kazeroun after leading Friday prayers. In April 2023, a powerful cleric identified as Abbas Ali Soleimani was also shot dead at a bank in the northern province of Mazandaran. And in August 2005, renowned Iranian judge Hassan Moghaddas was murdered by two gunmen who climbed into his car in the middle of a busy business district in Tehran. Two men convicted over his killing were publicly executed by hanging two years later.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judges-shot-dead-at-iran-s-supreme-court-media/7941542.html	2025-01-18T02:15:00-08:00	
South Korea's president in court as investigators seek to extend detention	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was in court for the first time Saturday for a crucial hearing that will decide whether to extend his detention as investigators probe his failed martial law bid. Yoon's supporters rallied outside the court and scuffled with police as he arrived in a blue van, weeks after throwing the nation into chaos by attempting to suspend civilian rule. The president's Dec. 3 martial law bid lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them. Yoon was subsequently impeached by parliament and resisted arrest for weeks, holed up in his guarded residence until he was finally detained Wednesday in a dawn raid. South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him. But the disgraced president remains in custody after investigators requested a new warrant Friday to extend his detention. He decided to appear in court 'with the intention of restoring his honor,' the president's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun told AFP before the hearing. A spokesperson for Seoul Western District Court later confirmed to AFP that the hearing commenced with the president in attendance. After reviewing the request to extend Yoon's detention, a judge is expected to announce her decision Saturday night or early Sunday. Outside the court, AFP journalists saw crowds of Yoon's backers waving flags and holding 'release the president' placards. Police officers formed a chain to prevent them reaching the court entrance, which has been closed to the public since Friday evening over safety concerns. More legal woes If approved, as expected, the new warrant would likely extend Yoon's detention by 20 days. This would give prosecutors time to formalize an indictment for insurrection, a charge that could see him jailed for life or executed if found guilty. If indicted, the president would probably be detained for the duration of the trial. Once 'the warrant is issued this time, (Yoon) will likely be unable to return home for an extended period,' political commentator Park Sang-byung told AFP. Yoon said Wednesday he had agreed to leave his compound to avoid 'bloodshed,' but that he did not accept the legality of the investigation. He has refused to answer investigators' questions, with his legal team saying the president explained his position on the day he was arrested. The president has also been absent from a parallel probe at the Constitutional Court, which is mulling whether to uphold his impeachment. If the court rules against Yoon, he will lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. He did not attend the first two hearings this week, but the trial, which could last months, will continue in his absence. Although Yoon won the presidential election in 2022, the opposition Democratic Party has a majority in parliament after winning legislative polls last year. The Democratic Party has celebrated the president's arrest, with a top official calling it 'the first step' to restoring constitutional and legal order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-president-in-court-as-investigators-seek-to-extend-detention/7941537.html	2025-01-18T01:55:54-08:00
