South Korean jet accidentally drops bombs on village, injuring seven	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A South Korean fighter jet accidentally dropped eight 500-pound bombs outside of a designated firing range north of Seoul on Thursday, injuring at least seven people, South Korean officials said. In a statement, South Korea’s Air Force said a KF-16 fighter jet 'abnormally dropped' the MK-82 bombs during a live fire exercise at 10:04 a.m. local time. The fighter jet was participating in U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises near the inter-Korean border, said an official with South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense. At least some of the bombs landed in a populated village, severely injuring at least four people and damaging a church and two residential buildings, according to the country’s national fire agency. Pictures in local media showed at least two houses whose roofs were crumbling and windows shattered. A nearby church also appeared to suffer significant structural damage. The live fire drill took place early Thursday at the Seungjin Fire Training Field in Pocheon, just 25 kilometers south of the border with North Korea. According to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, the exercise involved more than 160 pieces of military hardware and was set to be attended by Gen. Xavier Bronson, the top U.S. commander in Korea, and South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Kim Myung-soon. The drill marked the allies’ first exercise of its kind this year and was held in connection with the upcoming annual Freedom Shield exercise, Yonhap reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-jet-accidentally-drops-bombs-on-village-injuring-seven/8000717.html	2025-03-05T20:53:28-08:00	
12 Chinese nationals indicted in hacking-for-hire scheme	The U.S. Justice Department announced indictments Wednesday against 12 Chinese nationals accused in a global hacking campaign targeting U.S.-based dissidents, news organizations, government agencies and a large religious organization. According to court documents, China's Ministry of Public Security and Ministry of State Security used a network of private companies and hackers-for-hire to steal information and help locate dissidents and critics throughout the world. 'Today's announcements reveal that the Chinese Ministry of Public Security has been paying hackers-for-hire to inflict digital harm on Americans who criticize the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),' said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI's Cyber Division in a statement. The suspects include two officers in China's Ministry of Public Security, eight employees of a company known as i-Soon, and two members of a group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 27 (APT27). A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, told The Associated Press Wednesday that the allegations were a 'smear' and said, 'We hope that relevant parties will adopt a professional and responsible attitude and base their characterization of cyber incidents on sufficient evidence rather than groundless speculation and accusations.' All of those indicted are at large, and the Justice Department is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information about the MPS officers and i-Soon, the Chinese company that employed most of the hackers. The company is accused of selling stolen information 'to China's intelligence and security services to suppress free speech and democratic processes worldwide, and target groups deemed a threat to the Chinese government,' according to a news release from the FBI. i-Soon also conducted computer intrusions on its own initiative, charging 'the MSS and MPS equivalent to between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked,' the indictment said. The company also provided training in hacking skills to the government agencies. Among the group's targets were a large religious organization critical of the Chinese government that previously sent missionaries to China, and a group that promoted human rights and religious freedom in China. The New York Assembly and multiple news organizations in the United States were targeted, including those that have opposed the Communist Party of China or delivered uncensored news to China. Foreign targets included a religious leader, a Hong Kong newspaper and the foreign ministries of Taiwan, India, South Korea, and Indonesia, according to the Justice Department release. Separate indictments were issued against the two men connected to APT27, Zhou Shuai and Yin Kecheng, 'for their involvement in the multi-year, for-profit computer intrusion campaigns dating back, in the case of Yin, to 2013,' the Justice Department release stated. The State Department announced a reward of up to $2 million for information leading to the arrest of Zhou and Yin. They are accused of hacking numerous 'U.S.-based technology companies, think tanks, law firms, defense contractors, local governments, health care systems, and universities, leaving behind them a wake of millions of dollars in damages,' the release stated. Yin is accused in a U.S. Treasury Department hack between September and December 2024. The two face several charges that include computer network conspiracy, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. 'As evidenced by today's and previous announcements, China offers safe harbor for private sector companies that conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States and its partners,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. The indictments were the result of a joint investigation by the Justice Department, FBI, Naval Criminal Investigative Service and Departments of State and the Treasury. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-nationals-indicted-in-hacking-for-hire-scheme/8000685.html	2025-03-05T19:09:01-08:00	
Vance visits Mexico border, says US won’t invade Mexico	U.S. Vice President JD Vance led a trio of White House officials on a visit Wednesday to a key crossing point on the Texas-Mexico border, where he echoed President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration push and assured Americans that U.S. forces don’t plan to invade Mexico. His trip to the small border town of Eagle Pass, Texas, comes on the heels of Trump’s defiant Tuesday night address before Congress, where Trump described his program of arrests and deportations as 'getting them out and getting them out fast.' Vance’s words also follow Trump’s move to designate drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. 'I'm not going to make any announcements about any invasions of Mexico here today,' Vance said. 'The president has a megaphone and of course, he'll speak to these issues as he feels necessary. But what designating cartel organizations allows us to do is deploy the full resources of the United States military to engage in serious border enforcement.' Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who accompanied Vance, echoed him, saying, 'Our objective is to keep the American people safe.' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, also in Texas with Vance and Gabbard, emphasized that he thinks 'border security is national security,' and clarified what role troops might serve, as they are legally prohibited from performing civilian law enforcement actions. 'The Defense Department has assets that we can bring to bear, not just troops, not just surveillance, not just equipment, but actual planning and capabilities that enhance what Border Patrol is already doing,' he said. Immigration advocates told VOA that the current lull in border crossings, which Vance also touted, might be misleading and criticized Trump’s enforcement-based strategy. 'The ebb and flow of border numbers — under Trump and under [former President Joe] Biden — demonstrate why global migration is complicated, and why we need a full immigration overhaul from Congress to equip America for 21st century migration and to align with our interests and values, not the enforcement-only agenda of this administration,' Vanessa Cardenas, executive director of America’s Voice, told VOA via email. 'The reality is that the Trump administration’s immigration policies aren’t making Americans more safe or secure, and certainly aren’t advancing our economic interests or common sense. Instead, they come at a high cost for all Americans and move us further from the real solutions we need,' Cardenas said. Meanwhile, in Washington, Representative James Comer, the Republican leader of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, grilled four big-city mayors on their policies that limit law enforcement’s cooperation with immigration enforcement. 'Sanctuary cities make us all less safe and are a public safety nightmare,' Comer said. 'We cannot let pro-criminal alien policies in obstructionist sanctuary cities continue to endanger American communities and the safety of federal immigration enforcement officers.' The mayor of Colorado’s most populous city pushed back at lawmakers. 'Americans expect us to do more than point fingers,' said Mayor Mike Johnston, who is a Democrat. 'They expect us to solve problems. So, if Denver can find a way to put aside our ideological differences long enough to manage a crisis we didn't choose or create, it seems only fair to ask that the body that is actually charged with solving this national problem, this Congress, can finally commit to do the same.' In his address to Congress, Trump asked the legislative body for more funding for immigration enforcement, even as they stare down a mid-March budget resolution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-visits-mexico-border-says-us-won-t-invade-mexico-/8000678.html	2025-03-05T18:26:04-08:00

Appeals court allows removal of watchdog in legal fight over Trump firing	WASHINGTON — An appeals court in Washington on Wednesday removed the head of a federal watchdog agency in the latest twist in a legal fight over President Donald Trump's authority to fire the special counsel. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with the Trump administration in allowing the immediate removal of Hampton Dellinger as head of the Office of Special Counsel while the court considers legal arguments in the case. Dellinger is likely to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Dellinger sued Trump last month after he was fired even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president 'only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.' U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Saturday ruled that Dellinger's firing was unlawful and quickly reinstated him in the job while he pursued his case. It was that order that the appeals court lifted Wednesday. Dellinger's lawyers say allowing the president to fire the special counsel without cause would have a chilling effect on the important duties of the office to protect whistleblowers. The Trump administration has argued that the law protecting the special counsel from removal is unconstitutional and unfairly prevents the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head. The Office of Special Counsel is responsible for guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing. It investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing. Wednesday's appellate ruling came as Dellinger is also challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration's shake-up of the federal government. After a request from Dellinger's office, a government panel that enforces workers' rights ruled Wednesday that more than 5,000 employees fired by the Trump administration should be put back on the job at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. While the order applies only to the USDA workers, Dellinger released a statement 'calling on all federal agencies to voluntarily and immediately rescind any unlawful terminations of probationary employees.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/appeals-court-allows-removal-of-watchdog-in-legal-fight-over-trump-firing-/7999665.html	2025-03-05T17:56:47-08:00

US stops sharing air quality data, raising scientists’ concerns	NEW DELHI — The U.S. government will stop sharing air quality data gathered from its embassies and consulates, worrying local scientists and experts who say the effort was vital to monitor global air quality and improve public health. In response to an inquiry from The Associated Press, the State Department said Wednesday that its air quality monitoring program would no longer transmit air pollution data from embassies and consulates to the Environmental Protection Agency's AirNow app and other platforms, which allowed locals in various countries, along with scientists around the world, to see and analyze air quality. The change was 'due to funding constraints that have caused the Department to turn off the underlying network' the department said in a statement. However, it added, embassies and consulates were directed to keep their monitors running and the sharing of data could resume if funded is restored. The funding cut, first reported by The New York Times, is one of many under President Donald Trump. The U.S. air quality monitors measured dangerous fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which can penetrate deep into the lungs and lead to respiratory diseases, heart conditions, and premature death. The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution kills around 7 million people each year. Reaction was immediate from scientists who said the data were reliable, allowed for air quality monitoring around the world and helped prompt governments to clean up the air. Bhargav Krishna, an air pollution expert at New Delhi-based Sustainable Futures Collaborative, called the loss of data 'a big blow' to air quality research. 'They were part of a handful of sensors in many developing countries and served as a reference for understanding what air quality was like,' Krishna said. 'They were also seen to be a well-calibrated and unbiased source of data to cross-check local data if there were concerns about quality,' he added. 'It's a real shame,' said Alejandro Piracoca Mayorga, a Bogota-based freelance air quality consultant. U.S. embassies and consulates in Lima, Sao Paulo and Bogota had the air monitoring. 'It was a source of access to air quality information independent of local monitoring networks. They provided another source of information for comparison.' Khalid Khan, an environmental expert and advocate based in Pakistan, agreed, saying the shutdown of air quality monitoring will 'have significant consequences.' Khan noted that the monitors in the city of Peshawar in Pakistan, one of the most polluted cities in the world, 'provided crucial real-time data' which helped policymakers, researchers and the public to make decisions on their health. 'Their removal means a critical gap in environmental monitoring, leaving residents without accurate information on hazardous air conditions,' Khan said. He said vulnerable people in Pakistan and around the world are particularly at risk because they are the least likely to have access to other reliable data. In Africa, the program provided air quality data for over a dozen countries including Senegal, Nigeria, Chad and Madagascar. Some of those countries depend almost entirely on the U.S. monitoring systems for their air quality data. The WHO's air quality database will also be affected by the closing of U.S. program. Many poor countries don't track air quality because stations are too expensive and complex to maintain, meaning they are entirely reliant on U.S. embassy monitoring data. In some places, however, the U.S. air quality monitors propelled nations to start their own air quality research and raised awareness, Krishna said. In China, for example, data from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing famously contradicted official government reports, showing worse pollution levels than authorities acknowledged. It led to China improving air quality.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-raising-scientists-concerns-/7999654.html	2025-03-05T17:38:19-08:00	
Analysts warn of China advances in Myanmar, see Rubio as key to US response	washington — U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia, especially Myanmar, can advance America's national security, economic interests and broader strategic goals in countering China’s expanding influence, foreign policy analysts say. When U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January, he pledged that under President Donald Trump, the State Department’s top priority would be the United States. In a subsequent policy statement, Rubio argued for a pragmatic foreign policy that makes America more secure, 'stronger and more prosperous.' Some analysts say this approach should address the Asia-Pacific, particularly Myanmar, where Chinese influence has grown since the 2021 military coup. Under isolation and conflict, the ruling junta relies on Beijing for economic and military support. Southeast Asia focus With Rubio overseeing foreign policy, some experts see an opening for Washington to revamp its approach in Myanmar as part of a broader Indo-Pacific strategy. Hunter Marston, a researcher at the Australian National University, said Rubio recognizes Myanmar’s strategic importance in the U.S.-China rivalry. 'I do think there’s the possibility that the State Department will have some high-level interest in Myanmar,' Marston said. 'This could be an opportunity, as I’ve argued in my commentaries for the Stimson Center, to review existing policy, assess its failures and explore adjustments that could make U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia more effective.' Zachary Abuza, a Southeast Asia security expert at the National War College, said Myanmar is central to the U.S.-China competition. 'Southeast Asia is where the United States and China compete most directly, and this is, in particular, true in Myanmar,' he said. Abuza noted Myanmar’s location at the South and Southeast Asia crossroads, which is critical for regional security and economic stability. He warned that China’s expanding presence in Rakhine State, including deep-sea ports, raises security concerns. 'If there’s ever a military conflict with China over Taiwan, for example, the oil and gas pipelines that supply Kunming will be very important,' he said. He added that China and Russia leverage Myanmar to project power in the Indian Ocean. 'We do not want the Chinese to build up or have access to ports in Rakhine,' Abuza said. 'We would like the Russians not to be able to pull into Yangon port.' Rare earth elements Abuza highlighted Myanmar’s rare earth elements, which are crucial for high-tech industries. 'China has a near monopoly, maybe not in mining anymore, but in reprocessing,' he said. 'This is an absolute national security threat to the United States.' He cited data indicating China obtains about 40% of its rare earths from Kachin State. The International Energy Agency reports that Myanmar’s share of global rare earth production rose from 0.2% to 14% from 2015 to 2023. Global Witness, an organization that investigates human rights and environmental abuses, says China’s imports from Myanmar hit $1.4 billion in 2023, and China controls 90% of global rare earth processing in the world. China’s growing foothold Since the 2021 coup, the junta’s reliance on China has grown as international sanctions isolate Myanmar. 'China has expanded its foothold in influence in the country,' Marston said, noting that ethnic armed groups also recognize Beijing’s interests. A Pacific Forum paper found that China prioritized the Rakhine State for its Belt and Road Initiative, tapping natural resources and access to the Bay of Bengal. Nyunt Than, president of the Burmese American Democratic Alliance, said Myanmar’s strategic role extends beyond infrastructure and shapes China’s broader regional ambitions. 'Another key issue is China’s internal economic disparity,' he said. 'While coastal regions are highly developed, the inland areas lag significantly behind.' Nyunt Than explained that Beijing aims to turn Yunnan province into a major transportation and trade hub for Southeast Asia, including plans for a high-speed railway connecting Kunming to the region. US regional focus Marston argued that the U.S. reluctance to back Myanmar’s resistance — fearful of provoking China — has enabled Beijing’s advancement there. 'China has incrementally expanded its influence and presence in the country, regardless of U.S. policy,' he said. At his January confirmation hearing, Rubio underscored ASEAN’s strategic role. On his first day as secretary of state, he met with Quad partners — India, Japan and Australia — to counter China’s influence. Activists like Nyunt Than see this as proof that Washington values the region’s strategic importance. 'From Rubio’s remarks and how he views ASEAN, it is evident that U.S. policymakers understand Myanmar’s significance,' he said. Experts, including Abuza, are optimistic that Rubio’s regional knowledge could lead to a more robust U.S. policy. 'I think Secretary of State Rubio has a very good understanding of Southeast Asia,' Abuza said. 'He is well aware of what communist governments are capable of and willing to do to advance their interests,' Abuza said, citing Rubio’s Cuban American background. Marston concurred that Washington should engage more stakeholders, including ethnic armed groups seeking a federal democracy, because China’s involvement will persist regardless of U.S. policy. 'China is going to be involved whether or not the U.S. is active in Myanmar,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-warn-of-china-advances-in-myanmar-see-rubio-as-key-to-us-response/7999628.html	2025-03-05T17:09:19-08:00

Moscow aims to exploit US-Europe rift, experts warn	As European Union leaders prepare for emergency talks to ramp up military spending after the Trump administration suspended aid to Ukraine, several Russia experts say Moscow is trying to capitalize on fragmenting Western cohesion. Following last week’s televised Oval Office clash between U.S. and Ukrainian leaders, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov on Monday accused Europe of seeking to prolong the war, adding that changes in U.S. 'foreign policy configurations' largely coincide with Moscow’s vision. The comments came before an EU financial summit planned for Thursday that aims to grapple with stabilizing continental security and helping Ukraine after decades of dependence on the U.S. defense umbrella. In a recent interview with the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called President Donald Trump a 'pragmatist' whose motto is 'common sense.' He also said, 'All tragedies in the world' over the past 500 years 'originated in Europe or occurred owing to European policies,' while 'the Americans played no seditious, let alone ‘inflammatory,’ role.' Calling Europe Enemy No. 1 is 'becoming the main trend in the Kremlin’s policy,' said exiled independent Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin. 'Therefore, having changed his tune … [Lavrov] explained to the audience that the U.S. is, if not a friend, then a reliable partner, and that means Britain and France are always to blame for everything.' Oreshkin also said the relatively positive U.S. depiction shows the Kremlin is hoping for an 'aggravation of contradictions' between Europe and America. But Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov said it was premature for Russian authorities to assume Trump is taking Russia’s side in the war. Trump’s 'interest, which he equates with the interests of the United States, is to end the conflict,' Kolesnikov told VOA. 'But there are two sides to the conflict. And if during future negotiations ... [Trump] remains dissatisfied with the intransigence of the Russian side, no one will stand on ceremony. New [U.S.] sanctions and measures to reduce oil prices will follow with the same decisiveness and speed as [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy's ‘punishment.’' Kolesnikov was referring to the contentious Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, in which top U.S. officials accused him of being insufficiently grateful for U.S. military support. The meeting concluded without the signing of an expected defense deal involving Ukrainian rare-earth minerals. With long-held certainties about U.S. reliability as a security partner suddenly in doubt, EU and NATO leaders gathered Sunday in London to map out a path forward. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for uniting 'around a new plan for a just and enduring peace,' while French President Emmanuel Macron said his country and Britain had agreed on an alternative peace plan envisaging a one-month partial ceasefire to end mutual attacks on energy infrastructure, followed by a second stage involving sending peacekeepers to Ukraine. The White House on Monday announced temporary suspension of all U.S. military aid to Kyiv, although Trump during an address to Congress on Tuesday said Zelenskyy had signaled renewed interest in inking the U.S.-proposed defense deal. According to U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe, Trump on Wednesday halted intelligence cooperation with Ukraine. Against this unclear backdrop, Russian officials have refrained from criticizing the U.S. administration and Trump personally while shifting their line of attack from the United States toward Europe. Thursday’s summit in Brussels comes as the EU is arguably at its weakest point, fragmented by the steady rise of a hard right that is often pro-Russian. EU leaders are also expected to discuss whether to place more arms contracts with Ukraine’s defense industry, and to help integrate it into the European industrial network. The Trump administration has demanded that Europeans spend as much as 5% of GDP on defense, well beyond the NATO benchmark of at least 2%. Seven European allies still fall short of even that target. The U.S. spends around 3.4%, according to NATO figures, and a Pentagon audit that could reduce that is pending.

Trump delays 25% tariff on vehicle imports from Mexico, Canada	U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday delayed a new 25% tariff on vehicle imports from Mexico and Canada for a month, amid fears that a trade war between the neighboring countries could hurt the 'Big 3' U.S. automakers. The U.S. leader spoke with top officials at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis before announcing the tariff delay, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. She said Trump urged the automakers to move their Mexican and Canadian production to the United States to avoid the tariffs altogether. But Trump's stiff new levies on the U.S.' two biggest trading partners remain in place for other products, although Leavitt said the president is open to hearing the case for other possible exemptions. Continuing tariffs threaten jobs in Canada, says official Trump announced the vehicle tariff delay in a statement after speaking earlier in the day with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who, according to The Associated Press, is not willing to lift Canada's retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves any tariffs on Canada. 'Both countries will continue to be in contact today,' Trudeau's office said. Doug Ford, the Ontario provincial premier, said earlier that if the U.S. tariff on Canadian vehicle exports to the U.S. remained in place, production at Canadian auto plants would start to shut down in about 10 days. 'People are going to lose their jobs,' he said. Trump imposed the duties on Mexico and Canada at midnight Monday, along with doubling tariffs on Chinese imported goods, to 20%. His action caused stock markets to plunge and threatened to boost the price of U.S. consumer goods and products that businesses need to operate. Mexico, Canada and China all said Tuesday they would retaliate against Trump's tariffs by increasing their own against U.S. products sent to their countries. Trump said on his Truth Social media platform that Trudeau called him Wednesday morning to ask what could be done about the new U.S. tax. 'I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped,' the president wrote. 'He said that it's gotten better, but I said, 'That's not good enough.' The call ended in a 'somewhat' friendly manner!' Tariffs not eliminated Earlier in the week, Trudeau said Canada has surged personnel and equipment to the border to stop the flow of fentanyl to the United States, as Trump had demanded as a possible path to averting the new tariff on Canadian imports. 'Because of this work — in partnership with the United States — fentanyl seizures from Canada have dropped 97% between December 2024 and January 2025 to a near-zero low of 0.03 pounds seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection,' Trudeau said. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television that Trump's new tariffs will not be fully eliminated. 'There are going to be tariffs, let's be clear,' Lutnick said. 'But what [Trump is] thinking about is which sections of the market that can maybe — maybe — he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2,' when Trump has said he will impose reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world that tax imports from the U.S. The Canadian government said that nothing less than abandoning the new U.S. tariffs was acceptable. 'We're not interested in meeting in the middle and having some reduced tariff. Canada wants the tariffs removed,' Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In a speech Tuesday night to the U.S. Congress, Trump acknowledged the tariff turmoil, saying, 'Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. There will be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that. It won't be much.' Trump has justified the new tariffs as a way to push Mexico and Canada to curb the flow of migrants and illicit drugs, especially the deadly opioid fentanyl, into the United States. Both countries said they had made major strides in meeting Trump's demands on migration and drug trafficking, but he ultimately imposed the same 25% duties he first announced in early February. 'It may be a little bit of an adjustment period,' he said, claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. 'You have to bear with me again, and this will be even better.' Trudeau was incensed on Tuesday at Trump's tariff on Canadian exports, announcing he would retaliate with his own on more than $100 billion worth of American goods over the course of 21 days. 'Today, the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,' Trudeau said. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would announce her country's counter-tariff increase against U.S. goods on Sunday. China placed tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports.

Trump administration takes down list of federal properties for possible sale	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday took down a directory of federal facilities it had listed for possible sale that included some of the U.S. government's most iconic properties. The apparent change of course came one day after the U.S. General Services Administration posted a list of 443 properties it said it might sell to save on maintenance costs. On Wednesday, GSA's 'noncore property list' was blank. GSA did not explain why it took down the list. The agency said in a statement that it had received an 'overwhelming amount of interest' and planned to release a new list soon. GSA's list had included the headquarters of more than a dozen federal agencies, including the GSA's own building. Skyscrapers in Chicago, Atlanta and Cleveland and major tax-processing centers were on the list, as was the Old Post Office, the historic building that once housed the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called the initial list outrageous and said any sale would need to be done in an orderly fashion. 'You cannot dump buildings on the market without preparation or a plan, because it would be antithetical to making this the most beautiful capital city in the world,' she said at a briefing. The potential sell-off appeared to be part of Trump's effort to slash the federal government, led by tech billionaire Elon Musk. The downsizing drive has led to 100,000 workers taking buyouts or being laid off.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-takes-down-list-of-federal-properties-for-possible-sale/7999262.html	2025-03-05T13:47:07-08:00

White House confirms talks with Hamas continuing amid ceasefire uncertainty	WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that U.S. officials have had 'ongoing talks and discussions' with representatives of U.S.-designated terror group Hamas. Confirmation of the talks in Doha, Qatar, come as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains in the balance. Leavitt declined to provide details on the substance of the talks. 'Look, dialogue and talking to people around the world to do what's in the best interest of the American people is something that the president has proven is what he believes is [a] good-faith effort to do what's right for the American people,' she said. Leavitt added that Israel has been consulted about the direct engagement with Hamas officials, but noted that there are 'American lives at stake.' Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages — including Edan Alexander, an American citizen — as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza. The continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains uncertain. President Donald Trump has signaled that he has no intention of pushing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from a return to combat if Hamas doesn't agree to terms of a new ceasefire proposal, which the Israelis have billed as being drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. Adam Boehler, Trump's nominee to be special envoy for hostage affairs, participated in the direct talks with Hamas. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase. The talks between U.S. and Hamas representatives were first reported earlier Wednesday by the news site Axios.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-confirms-talks-with-hamas-are-continuing-amid-ceasefire-uncertainty-/7999171.html	2025-03-05T12:27:17-08:00	
US board reinstates thousands of fired federal employees	A U.S. board that reviews the firings of federal employees on Wednesday ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to temporarily reinstate thousands of workers who lost their jobs as part of President Donald Trump's layoffs of the federal workforce. Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit System Protection Board, ordered the USDA to reinstate fired probationary employees for 45 days while a challenge to the terminations plays out. The decision was issued a day after a federal judge blocked Trump from firing Harris, a Democrat, and removing her from her position with the board without cause before her term expires in three years. The administration is appealing that decision. 'This is great news and needs to be done with all impacted agencies with similarly situated employees as fast as possible,' said J. Ward Morrow, assistant general counsel at the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents some of the reinstated workers. Tanya Torst, who was fired from the U.S. Forest Service, a USDA agency, on Feb. 15, said she would be thrilled to return to her former job fundraising for a group of six national forests, though she worried about talk of shutting federal offices nationwide and of further staff reductions later this month. 'We're thrilled to come back, but we're hoping they have a place for us.' The USDA and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump and Elon Musk, the architect of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, are spearheading an unprecedented effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy, including through job cuts. It's estimated that more than 20,000 federal employees, almost all probationary workers, have lost their jobs and another 75,000 have taken a buyout, out of the 2.3 million federal civilian workforce. Probationary workers typically have less than a year of service in their current roles although some are longtime federal workers. Union efforts to contest the mass firings in federal court have faced procedural hurdles with judges questioning whether unions had standing to bring the cases or finding that they should have been brought to administrative boards like the MSPB. The merit board has proved to be a potential roadblock in the Trump administration's efforts to purge the federal workforce. The board hears appeals by federal government employees when they are fired or disciplined. It has already halted the firing of six other such employees at various agencies at the request of a watchdog agency whose leader Trump has also sought to fire, Hampton Dellinger of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. Dellinger, an appointee of Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, on Tuesday said that he had asked the board to halt the firing of thousands of USDA employees. Dellinger argued that the Trump administration's firing of the probationary employees was done unlawfully and without regard to the workers' rights while circumventing regulations governing mass reductions in the federal workforce. Harris agreed, saying she found reasonable grounds to believe that the agency fired them in violation of federal law. The board ordered all probationary USDA employees terminated since Feb. 13 to be temporarily reinstated. Dellinger in a statement welcomed the decision. He said his agency would continue investigating the firing of other federal probationary employees, and he called on federal agencies that had recently fired such workers to immediately reinstate them. 'Voluntarily rescinding these hasty and apparently unlawful personnel actions is the right thing to do and avoids the unnecessary wasting of taxpayer dollars,' he said. Like with Harris, Trump has sought to remove Dellinger from office, only to be stymied by the courts. The administration is appealing a decision from Saturday by a federal judge holding that Trump's firing of Dellinger was unlawful.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-board-reinstates-thousands-of-fired-federal-employees/7999153.html	2025-03-05T12:12:36-08:00	
Islamic State in retreat after offensive in Somalia's Puntland	WASHINGTON — One month ago, on the morning of Feb. 4, forces from Somalia’s Puntland region attacked Islamic State terror group fighters, who responded with drones, suicide attacks and infantry charges. Regional officials said 15 soldiers were killed in the fighting near the village of Qurac. But hours later, the terrorist fighters were forced to vacate their positions, leaving behind at least 57 of their dead. The following week, the Islamic State, also known as IS, ISIS or Daesh, carried out a major counterattack, sending multiple suicide bombers and a wave of fighters against Somali forces in the Togjaceel valley, in Puntland’s Cal Miskaad mountains. Regional officials say the gun battle resulted in some 100 fatalities — 28 soldiers and more than 70 militants. But again, IS fighters had to retreat, and soon lost three bases to the Puntland forces. The battles are part of a recent offensive against Islamic State fighters holed up in the mountains of semi-autonomous Puntland. Observers say the success, while most certainly welcome, came somewhat as a surprise. Military commanders had expected that as they got closer to the area’s main IS strongholds of Shebaab, Dhaadaar and Dhasaan, that the terror group would fight hard and launch frequent counterattacks. But that has not been the case. The Puntland forces have been capturing caves and small villages one after the other, and they have routed IS from the strategic 40-kilometer-long Togjaceel Valley, from Turmasaale to Dhasaan. Somali officials told VOA it appears that the IS fighters, rather than trying to hold their positions, have fled, breaking into three groups, all headed in different directions. About 100 IS fighters, along with some family members, have sought to escape to Karinka Qandala, another mountainous area to the north of the group’s former stronghold in the Togjaceel Valley. Two larger groups fled to Tog Miraale and Tog Curaar, to the west and northwest. The group that went northwest, according to officials, was hit by airstrikes in the vicinity of Miraale Village. 'Intelligence assessments indicate a high likelihood of attempts to establish new safe havens following their retreat,' according to Brigadier General Ahmed Abdullahi Sheikh, the former commander of Somalia’s U.S.-trained Danab forces. 'The offensive, though appearing conventional, has consistently involved guerilla tactics,' said Sheikh, who has been closely following the offensive in his home region. 'The Togjaceel Valley defeat will likely drive ISIS to intensify asymmetric warfare, launching an attempt on irregular campaign against Puntland.' Sheikh said he believes Puntland’s counterterrorism force has the numbers and the resources to carry out a protracted conflict with IS. The United Arab Emirates has been providing air support, including airstrikes against the militants. The United States also carried out two rounds of airstrikes targeting IS last month. The U.S. strikes are thought to have killed 16 militants, including Ahmed Maeleninine, described by U.S. officials as a 'recruiter, financier and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe.' The Pentagon declined comment when asked about the apparent IS retreat. But a U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss an ongoing operation, indicated Washington is prepared to potentially lend additional help. 'The Department remains committed to supporting our partners in our shared efforts to disrupt, degrade and defeat terrorist organizations in the Horn of Africa,' the official told VOA. Other observers said the 'persistent' pressure by the Somali forces, along with help from the U.S. and UAE, appears to be paying off. 'Indications [are] that the Puntland forces are making real progress against ISIS in Somalia’s hideouts,' a former senior Western counterterrorism official told VOA, requesting anonymity to discuss the ongoing developments. 'The question is whether they [the Puntland forces] will be able to continue to hold the captured hideouts, or whether ISIS will be able to return in the coming weeks and months,' the official said. If the Somali forces are able to hold the captured territory, though, the damage to the terror group could extend well beyond Somalia’s borders. 'Given the central role of the al-Karrar office in financing the wider ISIS network, there could be some knock-on impact,' said the former Western counterterrorism official. Al-Karrar is one of nine regional Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group’s capabilities. Since 2022, the office has been a key cog in the terror group’s financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Africa. Concerns, however, remain. Regional security analysts warn IS could regroup if Puntland’s counterterrorism forces are unable to maintain their pursuit. 'Their mobile special forces have been the pointed end of the spear,' said Samira Gaid, a Horn of Africa security analyst. 'For the moment, it appears that the Puntland forces are committed and well resourced,' she told VOA. 'However, much will depend on the Puntland forces then securing and manning the territories it will liberate to ensure the group does not make a comeback.' As for IS, the terror group is 'attempting to melt into the population, though this is difficult,' said Gaid. 'It’s the natural progression when faced by a force that is superior.' The tactic also may have bought IS time to hide some of its most prominent and most important leaders. Somali forces have found no trace of Abdul Qadir Mumin, thought to lead not just IS-Somalia but the entire IS terror operation. IS-Somalia operational commander Abdirahman Fahiye Isse and IS-Somalia finance chief Abdiweli Mohamed Yusuf are also in hiding. Somali officials have nonetheless appealed to them, and to Fahiye in particular, to surrender. 'The people whom you think will give you a sanctuary are guiding the army,' Puntland military commander General Adan Abdihashi said after capturing Mumin’s headquarters on March 1. 'Don’t put young people in harm’s way,' Abdihashi said. 'I swear to God, you will get the punishment you deserve.' Said Abdullahi Deni, Puntland region’s leader, has also offered IS members in Somalia, including women and children, a chance to surrender and for foreign fighters to possibly even return to their countries of origin. 'They [IS] envisioned it as a place where they cannot be seen, strategically a tough place, and gives them access to the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Gulf,' he said. But he has warned Puntland’s forces are prepared to hunt and eliminate remnants of the terror group 'until all terrorists, their movement and their bases are eliminated.' Various estimates from Somali and Western counterterrorism officials put the number of IS fighters in Somalia at up to 1,600, bolstered by an influx of fighters from Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen. Experts such as Samira Gaid said IS-Somalia’s growing numbers combined with the difficult terrain in Puntland’s mountains may have led to overconfidence. 'The miscalculation to face the Puntland forces seemed to have been their folly,' she said, adding that about 500 IS fighters have been killed in the recent fighting. IS-Somalia has suffered 'grave losses,' Gaid said, 'and will most likely not be recovering in the short to medium term.'

US mayors defend 'sanctuary city' laws protecting migrants in congressional hearing	Mayors of four of the largest cities in the U.S. appeared before lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday to defend their so-called 'sanctuary city' laws, which restrict local officials in helping enforce federal immigration regulations. The Republicans who lead the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee have long criticized such laws, as has U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican who returned to the White House in January promising to deport more unauthorized immigrants, including asylum-seekers, than his predecessors. In opening remarks, Committee Chairman James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, told the mayors of Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York City, all Democrats, that Congress should vote against sending even 'a single penny' of federal funding to sanctuary cities. 'These reckless sanctuary policies also force federal immigration officers to go into local communities to apprehend criminal illegal aliens,' Comer said. 'If sanctuary cities were to simply communicate and work with federal immigration authorities, then federal agents could arrest criminal illegal aliens in a secure environment like a state or local jail.' The mayors defended the laws as making all their residents safer, even as lawmakers on the committee, which is known for its sometimes combative hearings, interrupted some answers that went beyond a 'yes' or 'no.' State and municipal officials have said the U.S. Constitution's Tenth Amendment prevents the U.S. government from commandeering local officials to enforce federal law. All the mayors said they have always and will always honor criminal arrest warrants issued by courts. The specifics of sanctuary laws vary from city to city, and some have been on the books for decades, but they are generally intended to afford migrants similar due-process rights as those of citizens. Ranking Member Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia, said sanctuary city laws are 'in full compliance of federal law.' 'They do not obstruct ICE from carrying out its duties,' Connolly said, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, adding that local police, not federal agents, were in the best position to ensure public safety. New York Mayor Eric Adams has said he is willing to help with Trump's deportation efforts as he tries to get Trump to dismiss a federal criminal indictment charging him with corruption. Some Republicans questioned Adams, a Democrat, more gently than they did the other mayors, while at least three Democrats asked Adams if, as some federal prosecutors have alleged, the mayor had struck an improper agreement with the Trump administration to escape prosecution. 'There's no deal, there's no quid pro quo, and I did nothing wrong,' Adams replied to Representative Robert Garcia, a Democrat from California, who also called on Adams to resign. Adams, who is running for reelection, has said he wants the city's laws weakened to allow cooperation with the federal government's deportation efforts where a migrant has been only accused, but not convicted, of a serious crime. He also wants to allow federal immigration agents back on Rikers Island, the city's main jail complex. New York City Council members have said they will not weaken the law. In his remarks to the House, Adams said New York City always complies with local, state and federal law. He said he had no tolerance for criminals, but also that he 'must create an atmosphere that allows every law-abiding resident, documented or not, to access vital services without fear of being turned over to federal authorities.' 'If an undocumented person refuses to seek medical care until they have a medical emergency, our city's health care system will be strained, and if an undocumented individual witnesses a crime but is afraid to call 911 for fear of being turned over to federal authorities, criminals will roam free,' Adams said. His fellow mayors relayed similar concerns about migrant children and parents being afraid of going to schools, police stations, churches or clinics, including migrants who had acquired legal permanent residency or U.S. citizenship but feared being profiled because of their accent or skin color. 'A land ruled by fear is not the land of the free,' Boston Mayor Michelle Wu told the lawmakers, at times translating her remarks into Spanish and other languages. In most cases, sanctuary laws forbid local officials from arresting or detaining a person the federal government suspects of violating its immigration laws unless a judge has issued an arrest warrant. Even in sanctuary cities, ICE officials are free to arrest people they have cause to believe are living in the U.S. without authorization, typically a civil, not criminal, violation. ICE has a major field office in Manhattan, and its officers arrest hundreds of migrants across New York City each year under both Republican and Democratic presidents. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security can deport non-citizens once an immigration judge issues a final order of removal. The main point of contention has been over how cities handle what ICE calls detainer requests for the minority of migrants who end up in local custody. ICE officials routinely ask local prison, jail or police officials to continue to detain a migrant who was free to leave custody for up to 48 additional hours: the migrant has posted bail, a judge has ordered their release, or they have completed a prison sentence. The majority of these requests come without a judge's warrant, which some federal judges have ruled violates the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. In New York City and elsewhere, local officials must ignore the requests unless they come with a judge's warrant and the migrant has been convicted of a violent felony. ICE officials must instead arrest the migrant independently, typically at their home or place of work, which they say makes their job more difficult and dangerous. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston told the panel his city had honored more than 1,200 criminal arrest warrants from ICE in recent years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-mayors-defend-sanctuary-city-laws-protecting-migrants-in-congressional-hearing/7999114.html	2025-03-05T11:55:46-08:00

South Korea, Poland sign deal to boost economic, defense cooperation	WARSAW, POLAND — South Korea and Poland signed a cooperation agreement on Wednesday as the democratic allies increasingly find themselves united by concerns about the global security situation despite the vast geographical distance between them. Foreign ministers Cho Tae-yul of South Korea and Poland's Radek Sikorski signed an action plan which outlines their relations in the areas of politics, economy, defense and culture through 2028. 'We both reaffirmed that there is a need to further strengthen our cooperation for transregional security cooperation, encompassing both Europe and the Indo-Pacific within the framework of the NATO-IP4 partnership,' said Cho, referring to NATO's partnership with allies in the Indo-Pacific region, South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. South Korea and Poland have been strategic partners since 2013, with South Korea in recent years becoming a major supplier of weapons as NATO member Poland carries out a massive investment program to modernize its armed forces. 'Poland is the largest recipient of Korean military equipment worldwide, and we would like to further develop this cooperation with the prospect of relocating production and technology transfer to Poland,' Sikorski told reporters. 'Poland can also serve as a hub for further promotion of Korean military equipment in Europe and for the rebuilding of Ukraine.' The two nations share concerns about the situation in Ukraine, which lies on Poland's eastern border and has sent jitters across NATO's eastern flank. South Korea and Poland, along with other European allies, have also been concerned about North Korea's support for Russia in the war, including its dispatch of North Korean soldiers to fight alongside the Russians. Seoul worries that Russia could reward North Korea with transfers of sensitive technology to enhance its nuclear and missile programs. Cho told a news briefing that his country is launching an assistance package of over $2 billion, building on $400 million provided to Ukraine last year, 'to address Ukraine's urgent needs in energy, infrastructure, health care and education.' Sikorski and Cho also discussed expanding access to Polish food products in the South Korean market. 'Poland is now Korea's fifth largest trading partner within the EU (European Union), and Korea has become the largest Asian investor in Poland as of 2024. This is a testament to the trust and potential both nations see in each other's economic future,' Cho said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-poland-sign-deal-to-boost-economic-defense-cooperation/7999007.html	2025-03-05T11:05:35-08:00	
Syria vows to rid itself of Assad's chemical weapons legacy	THE HAGUE — Syria's foreign minister vowed on Wednesday to swiftly rid the country of chemical weapons remaining after the downfall of Bashar al-Assad's government and appealed to the international community for help. Asaad Hassan al-Shibani spoke during closed-door meetings at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, where he became the first Syrian foreign minister to address the disarmament agency. Following a sarin gas attack that killed hundreds of people in 2013, Assad-led Syria joined the agency under a U.S.-Russian deal and 1,300 metric tons of chemical weapons and precursors were destroyed. But three inquiries — by a joint U.N.-OPCW mechanism, the OPCW's Investigation and Identification team, and a U.N. war crimes probe — concluded that Syrian government forces under Assad used the nerve agent sarin and chlorine barrel bombs in attacks during the civil war that killed or injured thousands. As part of membership, Damascus was supposed to undergo inspections but for more than a decade the OPCW was prevented from uncovering the true scale of the chemical weapons program. 'Syria is ready ... to solve this decades-old problem imposed on us by a previous regime,' Shibani told delegates. 'The legal obligations resulting from breaches are ones we inherited, not created. Nevertheless, our commitment is to dismantle whatever may be left from it, to put an end to this painful legacy and ensure Syria becomes a nation aligned with international norms.' Earlier on Wednesday, OPCW chief Fernando Arias called Syria's political shift 'a new and historic opportunity to obtain clarifications on the full extent and scope of the Syrian chemical weapons program.' Shibani said planning had begun, but that the help of the international community would be critical. Syria would require technical assistance, logistical assistance, capacity building, resources and expertise on the ground, he said. 'Although the Assad regime stalled for many years, we understand the need to act quickly, but we also understand that this needs to be done thoroughly. For that, we cannot succeed alone,' he said. Syria's declared stockpile has never accurately reflected the situation on the ground, OPCW inspectors have concluded. They now want to visit roughly 100 sites that may have been tied to Assad's decades-old chemical weapons program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-vows-to-rid-itself-of-assad-s-chemical-weapons-legacy/7998918.html	2025-03-05T10:04:46-08:00	
Democratic congressman Sylvester Turner of Texas dead at 70	WASHINGTON — Democratic U.S. Representative Sylvester Turner, a former mayor of Houston, who was sworn into office in November, died on Tuesday, fellow lawmakers said, hours after he posted about attending President Donald Trump's address to Congress. The death of Turner, 70, temporarily widens Republicans' slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives to 218-214. A special election for Turner's replacement will have to be held to fill the vacancy. Turner served as mayor of Houston from 2016 through 2024 and was elected last year to take the House seat formerly held by Sheila Jackson Lee, who died in July 2024 at age 74. A spokesperson said Turner's office would issue a statement shortly. In a video message filmed outside his Washington office and posted on Tuesday, Turner said he was bringing to Trump's address a constituent whose daughter had a rare genetic disorder and relied on Medicaid insurance for treatment. 'My message to the current administration for tonight’s State of the Union: 'Don’t mess with Medicaid,'' Turner wrote in the post. 'President Trump and Elon Musk’s push to gut Medicaid is nothing short of a betrayal of the most vulnerable among us.' Republicans are trying to pass a spending bill that could significantly slash spending on popular social programs, including the Medicaid health insurance plan for low-income people, to pay for Trump's desired tax cut plan. Tributes to Turner poured in from Democratic politicians on social media. Representative Greg Casar of Texas told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Turner was 'a dedicated public servant,' and Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama posted on X that Turner 'leaves behind an extraordinary legacy of service.' The House has two other vacant seats, previously held by Republican Representatives Matt Gaetz and Michael Waltz, both of Florida. April 1 special elections have been scheduled to fill both, and Republicans are expected to win those contests, restoring Trump's party's full majority to 220.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7998850.html	2025-03-05T09:25:00-08:00	
US issues new Houthi-related sanctions	WASHINGTON — The United States imposed sanctions on Wednesday on seven senior members of Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement, the Treasury Department said. The men smuggled military-grade items and weapon systems into Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and negotiated buying weapons from Russia, the Treasury Department said in a statement. It also designated Abdulwali Abdoh Hasan Al-Jabri and his company Al-Jabri General Trading and Investment Company for recruiting Yemenis to fight in Ukraine on behalf of Russia and raising money to support Houthi military operations. 'The U.S. government is committed to holding the Houthis accountable for acquiring weapons and weapons components from suppliers in Russia, China and Iran to threaten Red Sea security,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. On Tuesday, the State Department said it was implementing the designation of the Houthi movement as a 'foreign terrorist organization' after President Donald Trump called for the move earlier this year. The move, however, triggered concerns it could affect regional security and worsen Yemen's humanitarian crisis because importers fear being hit with U.S. sanctions if supplies fall into Houthi hands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-issues-new-houthi-related-sanctions/7998778.html	2025-03-05T08:36:12-08:00

US-Pakistan operation to capture 'top terrorist' signals deep counterterrorism cooperation despite cold ties, experts say	ISLAMABAD — The U.S. Justice Department plans Wednesday to present in a federal court in Virginia the alleged mastermind of the August 2021 bombing that killed 13 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The justice department said Islamic State Khorasan operative Mohammad Sharifullah, also known as 'Jafar,' was charged on March 2 with 'providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization resulting in death.' Sharifullah is expected to appear in the justice system’s Eastern District of Virginia, the department said in a statement on its website. President Donald Trump broke the news of Sharifullah’s capture Tuesday night in a speech to Congress on Capitol Hill. 'Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity,' Trump said. 'And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.' The Abbey Gate bombing at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on August 26, 2021 also killed roughly 170 Afghans. Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K, a U.S. designated foreign terrorist organization linked with the Islamic State terror group, claimed responsibility. The suicide attack came amid the chaotic troop withdrawal at the end of the 20-year U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. In this speech, Trump hailed Pakistan for helping with the mission to arrest Sharifullah. 'And I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,' the U.S. president said. Sharifullah’s capture Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif identified Sharifullah as a 'top tier commander' and an Afghan national in a post on X. 'The wanted terrorist was apprehended in a successful operation conducted in Pakistan-Afghan border region,' Sharif said, without sharing details. The justice department said the mission was a multi-agency effort that also involved the CIA and the FBI. 'Sharifullah admitted to helping prepare for the Abbey Gate attack, including scouting a route near the airport for an attacker,' the department said. Sharifullah admitted to recognizing Abdul Rahman al-Logari who detonated the suicide bomb and admitted to playing a role in other attacks in Afghanistan and Russia, the statement added. Islamabad-based security affairs analyst Iftekhar Firdaus told VOA that Sharifullah, a resident of Kabul, joined ISIS-K in 2016. 'He was arrested in 2019 and then released during the jailbreak of the Afghan Taliban during their takeover of August 15, 2021,' said Firdaus, founder of The Khorasan Diary, an online platform that monitors militancy. If convicted, Sharifullah could get a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, the justice department said. Cooperation with Pakistan Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for acknowledging his country’s contribution in a post on the X social media platform. 'We thank U.S. President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,' Sharif posted. 'We will continue to partner closely with the United States in securing regional peace and stability,' the prime minister added. The arrest signals Islamabad and Washington are working closely on some security issues despite relations reaching a low since the end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan and the return of the Taliban to power. 'The arrest shows that counter-terrorism cooperation between Pakistan and the US remains robust even though relations are largely confined to a narrow bandwidth focused on counterterrorism,' former Pakistani ambassador to Washington, Maleeha Lodhi, told VOA. 'This is the first major development between both countries since the Trump administration took office,' Firdaus said. 'It also exemplifies the dependence of both countries on each other when it comes to counterterrorism cooperation.' Thaw in ties? Still, experts warned the joint effort and the public expression of gratitude from the highest offices should not be seen as a thaw in relations. 'One has to be careful not to over read the significance of a single event for Pakistan-US relations, that have been at a crossroads since the US exit from Afghanistan in 2021 and need high-level engagement for a reset,' Lodhi said. Most military aid to Pakistan remains blocked since Trump put a freeze on it during his first term in office. Many in Washington also blame Pakistan for the losses the United States incurred in the Afghan war. In congressional hearings soon after the troop withdrawal, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said Pakistan’s role in providing sanctuary to the Afghan Taliban needed to be 'fully examined.' Antony Blinken, then-Secretary of State, told Congress in a September 2021 hearing that the Biden administration would look into the role Pakistan played during the war. Nearly two dozen Republican senators also proposed a bill that called for 'an assessment of support by state and non-state actors, including the government of Pakistan, for the Taliban between 2001 and 2020.' Pakistan, a major non-NATO ally has consistently denied allegations of covertly providing support to Taliban while supporting the U.S. in the Afghan war. 'We remain steadfast in our resolve and unwavering commitment to combating terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations,' Sharif said in his X post Wednesday. In a post on X, Washington-based South Asia expert Micheal Kugelman said Pakistan is interested in a new security partnership with the U.S. 'Pakistan wants to leverage U.S. concerns about terrorism in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership with the U.S.,' said Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, adding 'it will be a hard sell to the administration.' The joint counter-terrorism operation comes just days after the Trump administration released $397 million for a program that supports Pakistan’s use of F-16 fighter jets acquired from Washington. Islamabad is stipulated to use the fighter jets for only for counterterrorism purposes, and not against archrival India.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-pakistan-operation-to-capture-top-terrorist-signals-deep-counterterrorism-cooperation-despite-cold-ties-experts-say-/7998510.html	2025-03-05T05:04:05-08:00	
Army surrounds South Sudan's vice president's home as his allies are arrested	JUBA, South Sudan — South Sudanese soldiers surrounded Vice President Riek Machar's home in the capital on Wednesday and several of his allies were arrested after an armed group allied to him overrun an army base in the country's north. Machar, whose political rivalry with President Salva Kiir has in the past exploded into civil war, said last month that the firing of several of his allies from posts in the government threatened the 2018 peace deal between him and Kiir that ended a five-year civil war in which more than 400,000 people were killed. Deputy army chief Gen. Gabriel Duop Lam, also loyal to Machar, was detained Tuesday over the fighting in the north, while Machar ally and Petroleum Minister Puot Kang Chol was arrested Wednesday alongside his bodyguards and family. No reason was given for the arrests. Neither Machar nor his SPLM-IO party have commented about the fighting, but Water Minister Pal Mai Deng, who is also the party's spokesperson, said Lam's detention 'puts the entire peace agreement at risk.' Western envoys last week urged leaders to de-escalate the tension. Ter Manyang Gatwich, Executive Director of the Center for Peace and Advocacy, has called for the immediate release of those detained to avert further escalation of violence and further bloodshed from degenerating into what he called a 'full-scale war.' South Sudan is yet to fully implement the 2018 peace agreement and elections that were scheduled for last year were postponed by two years due to a lack of funds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/army-surrounds-south-sudan-s-vice-president-s-home-as-his-allies-are-arrested-/7998483.html	2025-03-05T04:47:26-08:00	
Pope resting after sleeping through night with ventilation mask as he battles pneumonia	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis was resting Wednesday, the start of the solemn Lenten period leading up to Holy Week observances, after sleeping through the night with a ventilation mask as he undergoes hospital treatment for double pneumonia. In its latest update, the Vatican said that the pope rested well overnight, waking up shortly after 8 a.m. Pope Francis remained in stable condition, with a guarded prognosis, meaning he was not out of danger. The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, had two respiratory crises on Monday in a setback to his recovery. On Tuesday, he was breathing with just the help of supplemental oxygen after respiratory crises a day earlier, but resumed using a ventilation mask at night, the Vatican said. Francis' hospitalization began on Feb. 14 and is the longest of his 12-year papacy. Ash Wednesday Francis’ treatment continues as the Vatican prepares for Lent, the solemn period beginning with Ash Wednesday and leading up to Easter on April 20. A cardinal has been designated to take Francis’ place at Vatican celebrations, with a traditional service and procession in Rome On Ash Wednesday, observant Catholics receive a sign of the cross in ashes on their foreheads, a gesture that underscores human mortality. It is an obligatory day of fasting and abstinence for Catholics that signals the start of Christianity’s most penitent season. Vatican prepares for Lent without Francis The pope was also supposed to attend a spiritual retreat this coming weekend with the rest of the Holy See hierarchy. On Tuesday, the Vatican said the retreat would go ahead without Francis but in 'spiritual communion' with him. The theme, selected weeks ago and well before Francis got sick, was 'Hope in eternal life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-resting-after-sleeping-through-the-night-with-a-ventilation-mask-as-he-battles-pneumonia-/7998462.html	2025-03-05T03:16:53-08:00	
China aims high on growth, but challenges loom	China on Wednesday set its economic growth target at 5%.

China announces plans for major renewable projects to tackle climate change	BEIJING — China said on Wednesday it would develop a package of major projects to tackle climate change as it moves to bring its carbon dioxide emissions to a peak before 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060. The world's largest producer of climate-warming greenhouse gas said it would develop new offshore wind farms and accelerate the construction of 'new energy bases' across its vast desert areas, the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's economic planner, said in an official report published on Wednesday. 'China will actively and prudently work towards peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality,' the report read. Among the proposed projects cited in the report by the state planning agency was a controversial hydropower facility on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, which has raised concerns in India about its potential impact on downstream water flows. It also said it would develop a direct power transmission route connecting Tibet with Hong Kong, Macao and Guangdong in the southeast. However, coal will remain a key fuel, with the NDRC report saying the country will continue to increase coal production and supply this year, even as it plans for trials of low-carbon technology at its coal-fired power plants and to promote initiatives aimed at substituting fossil fuels with renewables. China has been struggling to strike a balance between fostering economic growth and meeting its environmental goals. The NDRC said the 3.4% reduction in the amount of carbon emissions per unit of economic growth last year 'fell short of expectations,' blaming rapid growth in energy consumption as well as extreme weather. China is not expected to meet its five-year goal to bring carbon intensity down by 18% by the end of this year, and it has not yet announced an annual target for 2025. It will also struggle to meet a separate target to cut the amount of energy consumed per unit of growth by 13.5% by the end of this year, despite exceeding expectations with a 3.8% reduction last year, analysts said. 'Despite the world record expansion of renewables, an inconvenient truth is that China's economy hasn't become much more energy efficient in recent years,' said Yao Zhe, global policy adviser with Greenpeace in Beijing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-announces-plans-for-major-renewable-projects-to-tackle-climate-change/7998428.html	2025-03-05T01:38:52-08:00	
Germany stops new aid to Rwanda over DR Congo conflict	BERLIN — Germany said on Tuesday it had halted new development aid to Rwanda and was reviewing its existing commitments in response to the African nation's role in the conflict in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. The German development ministry said Berlin had informed Rwanda in advance of the move and urged it to withdraw support for the M23 rebel group, which has made advances in eastern Congo. Congo, U.N. experts and Western powers accuse Rwanda of backing the group. Rwanda denies this and says it is defending itself against ethnic Hutu-led militias bent on slaughtering Tutsis in Congo and threatening Rwanda. Rwanda's foreign ministry called Germany's action 'wrong and counterproductive.' 'Countries like Germany that bear a historical responsibility for the recurring instability in this region should know better than to apply one-sided, coercive measures,' Rwanda's foreign ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday. The German ministry said Berlin last pledged aid of $98 million to Rwanda in October 2022 for the period 2022 to 2024. The M23 group has captured swathes of eastern Congo and valuable mineral deposits since January. The ongoing onslaught is the gravest escalation of a long-running conflict rooted in the spillover into Congo of Rwanda's 1994 genocide and the struggle for control of Congo's vast mineral resources.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-stops-new-aid-to-rwanda-over-dr-congo-conflict/7998426.html	2025-03-05T01:36:10-08:00	
Powerful US storms kill 2 and bring threats from critical fire weather to blizzard conditions	NEW ORLEANS — Powerful storms killed two people in Mississippi, tore the roofs off an apartment building and a nursing home in a small town in Oklahoma and threatened more communities across the nation Tuesday with wide-ranging weather. The large storm system also brought blinding dust storms to the Southwest, blizzards with whiteout conditions to the Midwest and fears of wildfires elsewhere. In Irving, Texas, a tornado with winds up to 177 kph struck, while another touched down in the 16,000-resident city of Ada, Oklahoma, according to preliminary information from the National Weather Service. There were also two tornadoes in Louisiana’s northern Caddo Parish and at least five in eastern Oklahoma. High winds forced some changes to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, which moved up and shortened the two biggest parades, to wrap them up before the bad weather moved in. The weather didn't stop Shalaska Jones and her 2-year-old daughter from waving at passing Mardi Gras floats and hoping to catch one of the coveted coconuts thrown to the crowd. 'We was coming out, rain, sleet or snow,' Jones said. The alarming weather could be one of the first big tests for the National Weather Service after hundreds of forecasters were fired last week as part of President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the federal government. Former employees said the firing of meteorologists who make crucial local forecasts nationwide could put lives at risk, though it was too soon to know the impact on forecasts and warnings for this storm. Deaths from storms in Mississippi Two people died due to the severe weather, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves posted on the social platform X, without going into detail. WAPT-TV reported that one person died from a falling power line in Madison County, while a driver in the same county was killed by a tree falling on his car. Hundreds of thousands left without power Storms that swept through Texas and Oklahoma brought high winds and rain, overturning tractor-trailers and damaging roofs. More than 178,000 customers were without power in Texas, about 23,000 in Louisiana, another 18,000 in Mississippi, about 88,000 in Alabama, more than 16,000 in Oklahoma and more than 23,000 in Tennessee, according to PowerOutage.us. More outages were expected as a line of storms raced across Mississippi and Louisiana and headed for Alabama, producing gusts of 113 kph, the weather service said. Central Plains and Midwest brace for blizzard conditions Blizzard conditions were forecast that could make travel treacherous. Schools will be closed Wednesday in several southern Minnesota districts with about 13 to 28 centimeters of snow expected. More concerning were winds forecasted to gust over 80 kph and stay high. The National Weather Service in the Twin Cities said on X Tuesday night that travel was not advised over a large portion of southern Minnesota. 'It’s tough to find a @MnDOT road camera that isn’t covered in ice or blocked completely by blowing snow,' the post said. South Dakota was expected to receive up to 12.7 centimeters of snow in some areas, and by Tuesday evening, high winds had already deteriorated road conditions. Jay Jones, who works at Love’s Truck Stop in Sioux Falls, said he saw garbage cans flying around as winds gusted around 80.5 kph. Parts of Interstate 29 heading north to North Dakota were shut down. 'It looks really bad out there,' Jones said, adding that he walked to work and would have to 'have to tough it out' on his way home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/powerful-us-storms-kill-2-and-bring-threats-from-critical-fire-weather-to-blizzard-conditions-/7998423.html	2025-03-05T01:25:30-08:00

Can Europe arm Ukraine now that US has halted military aid?	LONDON — Ukrainians reacted with alarm on Tuesday to Washington's announcement that it is halting military aid shipments to the country with immediate effect, a move that the Trump administration said was aimed at forcing all sides to the negotiating table. As news broke overnight Monday of the U.S. decision to halt military aid to Kyiv, Russian drones continued to rain down on Ukrainian cities, targeting Odesa in the south and Sumy in the northeast. Ukrainian lawmakers say the consequences of Washington's decision will be stark. 'This means that thousands of people will die,' Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko told The Associated Press. 'I just want to ask [U.S.] President [Donald] Trump just to reconsider, to give some time to Ukraine.' European pledge European leaders have said it is vital to continue weapons shipments to Kyiv. Analysts say there are doubts, however, over whether Europe can fill the shortfall and how long Ukraine can keep on fighting. As the geopolitics plays out, the war grinds on between Ukrainian forces and Russian invaders across the 960-kilometer front line. Close to the town of Pokrovsk west of Donetsk, the Ukrainian 14th Brigade is trying to hold off a Russian advance. The unit commander, who goes by the call sign 'Berf,' fears they could run out of ammunition. 'We fire an Italian howitzer. But we get a lot of ammunition, including of 105 mm caliber, from the U.S. It is NATO standard, which is used in both Europe and the U.S. But whether Europe will be able to supply us? I hope it will,' he told Reuters. Can Europe make up for the shortfall of military aid from the U.S.? 'There is a sharp limit to what Europe can do,' said Mark Galeotti, an analyst at Mayak Intelligence and the author of 'Forged in War,' a military history of Russia. 'There are certain systems, ranging from Patriot missiles all the way through to spare parts for the Abrams tanks and Bradley personnel carriers, that the Ukrainians are using, that the only way the Europeans can get [them] is by buying them on the open market. And that is going to take time,' Galeotti told VOA, adding that some weapons systems ordered on the open market in 2022 were arriving only now in Ukraine. Ukrainian weapons Ukraine, however, is far less reliant on the West than it was at the outset of the Russian invasion in 2022, said Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director general of the Royal United Services Institute in London. 'Increasingly, Ukraine has been producing its own weapons,' Chalmers told The Associated Press. 'It has a very large and growing defense industry, some of it financed from abroad, with a lot of cooperation from Western defense companies.' 'So probably about half the weapons which Ukraine is now using are provided by its own defense industry. And of the remainder, it's about half and half between the United States and the others, including the Europeans,' Chalmers said, adding that U.S. forces play a vital role 'in the logistical arrangements, which actually get the weapons from Poland into Ukraine.' 'And finally, the U.S. plays a very important role in providing information, intelligence to the Ukrainian forces,' Chalmers said. Peace negotiations The Trump administration said Tuesday the halt in military aid is 'to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.' 'We want the Ukrainians to have a sovereign and independent country,' U.S. Vice President JD Vance told reporters Tuesday. 'We think the Ukrainian troops have fought very bravely, but we're at a point here where neither Europe nor the United States nor the Ukrainians can continue this war indefinitely. So, it's important that everybody come to the table, and the president is trying to send a very explicit message: The Ukrainians have got to come to the table and start negotiating with President Trump.' Europe is taking a different approach. After hosting a meeting of European and Ukrainian leaders on Sunday, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer said a 'coalition of the willing' would seek to continue to support Kyiv. 'It's time to act. Time to step up and lead. The U.K. is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others. Europe must do the heavy lifting,' he said. In reality, Europe is not united in its support for Ukraine, said analyst Galeotti. 'Vice President Vance's claim — that a lot of the European leaders, who on social media and in public are foursquare behind Kyiv but in private they're actually much more skeptical — is not entirely incorrect. Do you essentially continue to hollow out your own armed forces and also alienate your most powerful security ally and guarantor in the name of defending Ukraine?' Zelenskyy appeal Zelenskyy appealed to the Trump administration Tuesday, writing on X that Ukraine was committed to peace. In a video posted online, Zelenskyy said, 'We must find the strength to move forward, respect one another — as we have always respected America, Europe, and all our partners — and work together to bring peace closer. I am grateful to everyone who supports Ukraine in this.' The cut in U.S. aid is a bitter outcome for some Ukrainians suffering under Russian bombardment. Those who spoke with VOA chose not to use their last names for safety reasons. Viktoria, a resident of Kyiv, said Ukraine was being unfairly punished. 'I hope that [Trump] will change his mind. The victim of aggression cannot be guilty of everything and be punished in addition to that,' she told VOA. Illia fled to Kyiv from his home in Donetsk following the invasion. 'Maybe Europe can help somehow. The hope is only on Europe now, no one else,' he said. Hanna, who fled the Russian invasion of Crimea, feared the impact of the cut in aid. 'This will have a serious impact, especially on the battlefield. The price will be human lives,' she said. Russia, meanwhile, welcomed Washington's decision to halt military aid for Ukraine, saying it might help 'to settle the situation by peaceful means.'

China sets moderate economic growth target amid looming trade war	Taipei, Taiwan — China set the economic growth target for 2025 at 5% on Wednesday, vowing to 'rise to the challenge and strive for success' amid a lack of domestic demand and a challenging external environment. Delivering the government work report at the start of China’s biggest political meetings of the year, Chinese Premier Li Qiang acknowledged that China’s trade and tech sectors face mounting external pressure caused by the intensification of protectionism around the world, the obstruction of the multilateral trading system, the increase of tariff barriers and rising geopolitical tensions. 'Domestically, the foundation for economic recovery is not yet solid, and there is insufficient demand, especially the sluggish consumption,' Li said during a speech delivered in front of thousands of members of the Chinese Communist Party, including Chinese President Xi Jinping. In light of these challenges, Li said the Chinese government aims to achieve the 5% economic growth target by 'vigorously boosting consumption, improving the efficiency of investment and expanding domestic demand on all fronts,' according to a readout released by China’s state-run Xinhua news agency. 'Achieving these goals won’t be easy, and it will require hard work,' he said. Analysts say the economic growth target shows China is prioritizing 'stability' over 'major economic progress' in 2025. 'A large part of China's economic growth last year was supported by exports, but the looming trade war with the United States has brought unpredictable risks to Chinese exports in 2025,' said Wang Kuo-chen, an economist at the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic Research in Taiwan. 'Since China’s domestic demand remains insufficient, they can only rely on boosting consumption to drive economic growth in 2025,' he told VOA by phone. To boost domestic consumption and demand, Li said Beijing will introduce some bold stimulus measures, including implementing more vigorous fiscal policies, lowering interest rates at the right time, and implementing economic policies aimed at 'improving people’s livelihoods and boosting domestic consumption.' The Chinese government will aim to direct more resources and capital to 'support the expansion of employment, help people increase their income, and strengthen consumption incentives,' Li said during the speech. Wang in Taiwan said while the Chinese government has repeatedly vowed to boost domestic consumption since last year, the exodus of foreign businesses and the overall trend of income reduction across the country will make it difficult for China to achieve this goal in 2025. 'As long as more capitals are poured into emerging industries such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, which are key sectors highlighted by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the private sector as a whole will remain weak, and there won’t be sufficient domestic demand,' Wang said. To maintain China’s competitiveness in emerging industries, Li said China in 2025 will focus on stimulating innovation and the digital economy. Relevant measures include better combining digital technology with manufacturing and market advantages and 'vigorously developing new-generation intelligent terminals such as intelligent network-connected new-energy vehicles and intelligent manufacturing equipment.' In addition to artificial intelligence, other emerging industries that Li said China also aims to further develop in 2025 include quantum technology, embodied technology, and 6G. Before the annual legislative meetings, Chinese President Xi Jinping held a symposium with leaders from several Chinese tech giants on February 17, urging 'efforts to promote the healthy and high-quality development of the country's private sector.' Some experts say that while the Chinese government wants to provide more state-led support to private companies in the AI and semiconductor industries, they will also ensure these companies 'align themselves with China’s national priorities.' 'The government knows it needs the private sector for innovation and job creation, but it also wants to maintain control at the same time,' Lizzi Lee, a fellow on the Chinese economy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA in an e-mail. China’s week-long legislative meetings come as Beijing and Washington gear up for a potential trade war. On Tuesday, the United States enhanced tariffs against all Chinese imports to 20%, prompting China to retaliate by imposing tariffs ranging between 10% to 15% on a wide range of agricultural products from the U.S. During his speech on Wednesday, Li said China will 'stick to the path of peaceful development, oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, and uphold international justice.' 'China is willing to work with the international community to call for an equal and orderly multipolar world and an inclusive economic globalization,' he said during the hour-long remarks. In light of the U.S. government’s tariff hikes against several countries, including allies such as Canada and Mexico, some analysts say Beijing is trying to present itself as a 'more responsible' global power. 'China might actually see an opportunity to show that it can act more responsibly on certain global issues,' Dali Yang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Chicago, told VOA by phone. VOA Mandarin’s Chuang Chih-wei and Yang Meng-li contributed reporting to the story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-sets-moderate-economic-growth-target-amid-looming-trade-war/7998344.html	2025-03-04T22:46:10-08:00	
Iran wraps up 'unprecedented' military exercises highlighting strengths, weaknesses, researchers say	WASHINGTON — Iran is wrapping up two months of its most intense military exercises in decades as it tries to deter potential attacks from its archrivals Israel and the United States, security researchers tell VOA. The Washington-based researchers also say the Iranian drills that began in late December, and were due to conclude by mid-March, have involved some weapons systems that pose a threat to the U.S. and Israel and others that expose weaknesses in Iran's deterrent capabilities. 'The pace, intensity and publicity of the exercises is unprecedented,' said Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Farzin Nadimi of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said he has been studying the Islamic Republic's military for the past 20 years. 'I have never seen them conduct so many drills in such a short period of time,' he said. Iranian state media reported the start of the exercises on Dec. 28. A week later, they said the exercises, codenamed 'Great Prophet 19,' were part of annual 'Eqtedar' ['Power'] drills that involved Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) ground forces engaging in war games in western Iran from Jan. 4-9. Several more exercises followed, including IRGC and Iranian Army air defense drills near nuclear facilities in Natanz, Fordow and the Arak reactor in Khondab; IRGC naval drills in the Persian Gulf; a second round of IRGC ground force drills in southwestern Iran; and an Army drill, codenamed 'Zulfiqar' in reference to a double-pointed sword in Islamic tradition, in southern Iran and the waters of the Gulf of Oman and northern Indian Ocean. On Feb. 26, Atomic Energy Organization of Iran chief Mohammad Eslami announced the start of a two-day 'nuclear defense drill' involving nuclear facilities, in comments to reporters, although he did not elaborate. There have been no state media reports about the outcome of those drills, which researchers said would typically involve electronic simulations. Iranian officials and state media have described the military exercises as having several goals, from boosting public morale to strengthening Iran's defensive and offensive capabilities, its integration of military forces, and its use of indigenous technologies to deter external threats. Heightened sense of threat 'The Iranians clearly see a heightened military threat from Israel and the U.S.,' Nadimi said. Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has toughened U.S. warnings of consequences for Iran if it refines its enriched uranium to weapons-grade levels and fashions it into a nuclear warhead. Tehran long has denied seeking nuclear weapons. 'They cannot have a nuclear weapon. And if I think that they will have a nuclear weapon, despite what I just said, I think that's going to be very unfortunate for them,' Trump said in a Feb. 4 joint news conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a Feb. 16 appearance with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem, Netanyahu noted that Israel had dealt what he called a 'mighty blow to Iran's terror axis' over the prior 16 months. That included Israel's first-ever aerial assault on the Islamic Republic, a sustained late-October strike on what Israel said were Iranian air defense and missile facilities in retaliation for a barrage of Iranian ballistic missiles on Israel earlier that month. 'Under the strong leadership of President Trump and with your unflinching support, I have no doubt that we can and will finish the job,' Netanyahu said. Responding to a VOA request for comment on Iran's military exercises, the Israeli military said it 'conducts continuous situational assessments to ensure preparedness for a wide range of scenarios, both defensive and offensive.' A spokesperson for Netanyahu declined to comment when asked by VOA about the Israeli government's assessment of the Iranian drills. The U.S. Defense Department did not respond to a VOA inquiry about its view of the exercises. Brian Carter of the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project said the Islamic Republic feels exposed because of recent setbacks to its proxies and allies in Lebanon and Syria. Israel killed the leaders of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah terror group and destroyed much of its weaponry in a two-month offensive from September to November, while Sunni Islamist rebels in Syria ousted its longtime Iran-allied autocratic ruler, Bashar Assad, in December. 'The Iranian air defense and naval exercises are meant to deter the U.S. and Israel from attacking key Iranian sites after Israel's degradation of Hezbollah left Iran without its primary deterrent against such an attack,' Carter said. 'Many of the ground exercises, on the other hand, seek to better protect western Iran from what Tehran sees as a renewed Sunni terrorist threat in Syria and Iraq.' Some of those Iranian drills involved weapons systems that could harm Israel and the U.S. if Iran retaliated for an attack, the researchers said. 'Iran's stockpile of long- and short-range ballistic missiles continues to pose a serious threat to Israel and U.S. bases in the region,' Nadimi said. 'Iran can fire hundreds of ballistic missiles at any given time and saturate Israeli or U.S. air defenses.' Carter said Iran's naval forces also have fast-moving small boats armed with anti-ship missiles that could swarm and threaten U.S. naval vessels in the region. Nadimi said one aspect of the recent exercises that exposed an Iranian weakness is the limited usage of advanced weaponry by Iranian forces. 'I have not seen widespread use of modern systems like Rezvan loitering munition FPV [First Person View] drones and Shahed-149 ‘Gaza’ high-altitude long endurance (HALE) drones by regular IRGC and Army units,' Nadimi said. 'Only Iran's elite military units have been using those systems widely.' Carter said another weakness is a reliance on indigenous Iranian air defense systems after Israel destroyed units of Iran's most advanced system, the Russian-made S-300, last October. 'It is unlikely that Iran could repel a U.S. or Israeli airstrike given the inferiority of the Iranian systems that have been used in these exercises relative to the modern U.S. and Israeli capabilities,' Carter said.

In response to Trump, Democrat calls for responsible changes to government	U.S. Senator Elissa Slotkin said Tuesday the country needs responsible changes and should be an engaged leader in an interconnected world, as she gave the Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress. Slotkin said prices for things such as groceries, housing and health care need to come down and that Trump does not have a credible plan to address them. She said Trump’s economic policies are going to make Americans 'pay in every part' of their lives, including tariffs and trade wars, a rising national debt and a potential recession. 'President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends,' Slotkin said. She also cited multibillionaire businessman Elon Musk, who under Trump is heading up the Department of Government Efficiency, highlighting concerns about widespread layoffs of federal workers and access his team has to Americans’ data. 'We need a more efficient government. You want to cut waste, I'll help you do it. But change does not need to be chaotic or make us less safe,' Slotkin said. She also spoke about the heated White House meeting last week during which Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for being 'disrespectful.' Slotkin said the meeting summed up Trump’s approach to the world. 'He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends like the Canadians in the teeth,' she said. 'He sees American leadership as merely a series of real estate transactions.' Slotkin said American democracy has been the aspiration of the world, and that right now it is at risk. Trump is seeking to carry out an 'America First' foreign policy, which has included orders to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, and to slash the work of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Slotkin said she would rather have the United States as a world leader than Russia or China. 'Donald Trump's actions suggest that in his heart he doesn't believe that we're an exceptional nation. He clearly doesn't think we should lead the world,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-response-to-trump-democrat-calls-for-responsible-changes-to-government/7998347.html	2025-03-04T21:58:45-08:00	
Trump declares ‘America is back,’ defends tariffs, other policies in address to Congress	Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump in a Tuesday night speech to a joint session of Congress defended his new tariffs on U.S. trading partners and pledged that more are coming. 'Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it’s our turn,' Trump said in what was his first address to U.S. lawmakers of his second term. The remarks came after the United States imposed 25% tariffs earlier Tuesday on exports from its two biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, and doubled an earlier 10% tariff on Chinese imports to 20%. China is the No. 3 U.S. trading partner. U.S. stock markets have taken a significant tumble, and the three countries have threatened retaliation, prompting concerns of a broader trade war. Trump also said the United States will begin imposing 'reciprocal tariffs' on all U.S. trading partners on April 2. 'Whatever they tariff us, we will tariff them,' he said. 'Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.' 'I wanted to make it April 1, but I didn’t want to be accused of April Fool’s Day,' Trump added. Trump also said he will impose a 25% tariff on imports of foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel. Trump’s address comes six weeks into his second term, which has been marked by tensions with U.S. allies, shifts in foreign policy and an overhaul of the federal government. The White House on Monday said the theme of the address was the 'renewal of the American dream.' With Vice President JD Vance and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson seated behind him, Trump began his speech by proclaiming that 'America is back,' triggering chants of 'USA' from Republican lawmakers. 'Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country,' he said. Trump also said his administration has 'accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years.' To date, Trump has signed nearly 80 executive orders — several of which are being challenged in court. Early in his speech, Trump touted his declaration of a national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border and deployment of the U.S. military and border patrol to 'repel the invasion of our country.' Trump said his administration has launched 'the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.' He also repeated the false claim that 21 million people entered the United States illegally during the Biden administration. Trump also took time during his address to laud a recent executive order he signed banning transgender women from women’s sports. He also falsely insinuated that transgender youth do not exist. The president has also signed other orders targeting transgender Americans. On shrinking the federal government, Trump, who imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring since returning to the White House, praised his adviser Elon Musk, the tech billionaire, whose Department of Government Efficiency has been behind the layoffs of tens of thousands of government workers and other cuts throughout the federal government. Trump said his administration 'will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy and we will restore true democracy to America again.' He added that any government workers who 'resist this change' will be 'removed from office immediately.' Democratic lawmakers — and some Republicans — have criticized the layoffs and cuts. During the address, Republican lawmakers were raucous in their support for Trump. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, protested in a mix of ways. Just a few minutes into his address, Trump was interrupted by jeering from the floor of the House, prompting Speaker Johnson to direct the sergeant at arms to remove Democratic Representative Al Green of Texas. Trump continued his address after Green was removed from the chamber. Several Democratic women lawmakers wore pink in protest of what they say are Trump policies that harm women. Some Democratic lawmakers walked out in the middle of Trump’s address; others skipped the speech entirely. In the subsequent Democratic rebuttal to Trump’s address, Senator Elissa Slotkin called for voters to get more involved with politics. 'It’s easy to be exhausted, but America needs you now more than ever. If previous generations had not fought for this democracy, where would we be today?' the Michigan senator said. Slotkin also criticized the widespread cuts to the government. 'We need a more efficient government. You want to cut waste? I’ll help you do it. But change doesn’t need to be chaotic or make us less safe,' she said. On the foreign policy front, Trump noted that he had again removed the United States from some international organizations and agreements: He froze foreign aid and withdrew the United States from what he called the 'unfair' Paris Climate Accord, the 'corrupt' World Health Organization and the 'anti-American' U.N. human rights council. Trump said he is working to end the war in Ukraine, which was started by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago. 'It’s time to stop this madness. It’s time to halt the killing. It’s time to end the senseless war,' he said. Trump’s comments come one day after the United States paused military aid to Ukraine and a few days after an acrimonious Oval Office meeting on Friday concluded with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy leaving the White House without an agreement. In his address, Trump said he received a letter Tuesday from Zelenskyy that said Kyiv is 'ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible.' 'I appreciate that he sent this letter,' Trump said. Trump’s address set the record for the longest address to a joint session of Congress at one hour and 40 minutes. The previous record was set by former President Bill Clinton at 1 hour and 28 minutes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-declares-america-is-back-defends-tariffs-other-policies-in-address-to-congress/7998336.html	2025-03-04T21:47:26-08:00	
Lakers’ James first NBA player to score 50,000 combined points in regular season, playoffs	LOS ANGELES — LeBron James became the first player in NBA history to score 50,000 combined points in the regular season and postseason Tuesday night. James surpassed the mark with a 3-pointer early in the first quarter of the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the New Orleans Pelicans. James got to 49,999 points Sunday night when he scored 17 while the Lakers beat the Clippers 108-102 for their sixth consecutive win. The 40-year-old James already is the top scorer in NBA history in both the regular season and the playoffs during a career in which he has rewritten all previous definitions of basketball longevity. James reached 50,000 points deep into his 22nd season, which ties him with Vince Carter for the most played in NBA history. Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who played 20 seasons, is second in NBA history with 44,149 combined points. And while nearly every other NBA player who lasted to his late 30s finished at a fraction of his peak powers, James' game shows no significant signs of decline in his 40s. He was named the NBA's Western Conference player of the month earlier Tuesday after he averaged 29.3 points, 10.5 rebounds, 6.9 assists and 1.2 steals in February while playing more than 35 minutes per game for the Lakers, who went 9-2 to surge into second place in the West. James began Tuesday at third in NBA history with 1,547 regular-season games played, trailing only Robert Parish (1,611) and Abdul-Jabbar (1,560). If he stays healthy and elects to return for a record 23rd season, he will likely surpass Parish next winter. James has also played in 287 postseason games, the most in NBA history. He became the league's career playoff scoring leader on May 25, 2017, when he surpassed Michael Jordan's total of 5,987 during the Cleveland Cavaliers' Eastern Conference finals game at Boston. James then became the top scorer in regular-season history on Feb. 7, 2023, when he topped Abdul-Jabbar's record of 38,387 points during the Lakers' game against Oklahoma City. James' prolific scoring is due in large part to his metronomic consistency. With his performance against the Clippers, he has scored at least 10 points in 1,277 consecutive games since Jan. 6, 2007 — by far the longest such streak in NBA history. James' player of the month award for February was his 41st, extending his own league record. He also became the oldest player to win the award, surpassing a 37-year-old Karl Malone in November 2000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lakers-james-first-nba-player-to-score-50-000-combined-points-in-regular-season-playoffs/7998305.html	2025-03-04T21:02:39-08:00	
Australians in some east coast areas urged to evacuate for 'very rare' cyclone	SYDNEY — Australia braced for a rare east coast tropical cyclone that is swirling toward Brisbane, its third-most populous city, with authorities urging residents in flood-prone suburbs to evacuate soon. Storm warnings on Wednesday stretched for more than 500 kilometers across the coast in the states of Queensland and New South Wales, impacting millions of people. Destructive wind gusts of up to 155 kph could develop from Thursday afternoon and tropical cyclone Alfred is expected to land as a Category 2 storm early on Friday morning near Brisbane, Queensland's capital. Total rainfall from the event could be as much as 800 mm in some regions, more than the average total for March and could cause life-threatening flash flooding, the Bureau of Meteorology said. 'This is a very rare event for southeast Queensland. ... It has been many decades since this part of the state experienced (a cyclone),' Queensland Premier David Crisafulli told reporters. He called on residents to heed evacuation orders. 'If you are in a storm tide zone or you're in an area where you know there is riverine flooding, you really need to consider and think about your evacuation plan now,' Crisafulli said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said heavy-lift helicopters have been deployed and offered to 'provide whatever resources are required' for the state governments. Many residents have left their homes as authorities rush to open evacuation centers. Sandbags are in short supply and supermarket shelves have been stripped bare as people stock up on essentials. Southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales were last hit by a cyclone more than half a century ago in 1974. The last time a cyclone threatened Brisbane was in 1990, but the system tracked south just before reaching the city. Schools in southeast Queensland will close and public transport will shut down on Thursday and Friday. A total of 122 schools in the north of New South Wales will be closed on Wednesday and Thursday, and vulnerable residents will be urged to relocate by Thursday morning, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said. 'We need to bunker down over the next 48 hours and get through what may be a very difficult time,' he told reporters. Qantas said it had canceled a number of flights from southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales, and more were likely over the coming days. The Ladies European Tour co-sanctioned WPGA Championship event was called off and the Australian Football League has postponed two matches in southern Queensland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australians-in-some-east-coast-areas-urged-to-evacuate-for-very-rare-cyclone/7998282.html	2025-03-04T20:30:32-08:00	
Musk fails in bid to block OpenAI becoming for-profit business	SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA — A U.S. judge on Tuesday denied Elon Musk's request to prevent OpenAI from becoming a for-profit business in a loss for the Tesla tycoon amid his feud with Sam Altman. U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Musk and his xAI startup failed to prove an injunction against OpenAI was necessary as the case heads to trial. Musk sued in California federal court to stop OpenAI from transitioning from a nonprofit to a for-profit business, arguing the startup violated antitrust law and betrayed his trust in their mission as a co-founder of OpenAI. The judge wrote that, while Musk did not prove the need for an injunction, she is prepared to expedite a trial on that claim later this year. The ruling leaves OpenAI free to continue its transition from nonprofit to for-profit enterprise. Musk's injunction bid argued that OpenAI's co-founders, including chief executive Altman, 'took advantage of Musk's altruism in order to lure him into funding the venture,' according to court documents. Musk contended in filings that it was clear his backing of OpenAI was contingent on it remaining a nonprofit, offering a few email exchanges to support the claim. 'Whether Musk's emails and social media posts constitute a writing sufficient to constitute an actual contract or charitable trust between the parties is debatable,' the judge said in her ruling. OpenAI's board chairman in February rejected a Musk-led offer to buy the valuable artificial intelligence company for $97.4 billion. 'OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition,' OpenAI Board Chair Bret Taylor said in a statement posted by the company on Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter. OpenAI currently operates in a hybrid structure, as a nonprofit with a money-making subsidiary. The change to a for-profit model, one that Altman says is crucial for the company's development, has exacerbated ongoing tensions with Musk. Musk and Altman were among the 11-person team that founded OpenAI in 2015, with the former providing initial funding of $45 million. Three years later, Musk left the company, with OpenAI citing 'a potential future conflict for Elon ... as Tesla continues to become more focused on AI.' Musk established his own artificial intelligence company, dubbed xAI, in early 2023 after OpenAI ignited global fervor over the technology. The massive cost of designing, training, and deploying AI models has compelled OpenAI to seek a new corporate structure that would give investors equity and provide more stable governance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-fails-in-bid-to-block-openai-becoming-for-profit-business-/7998259.html	2025-03-04T20:09:56-08:00	
Trump administration disbands 2 expert panels on economic data	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has disbanded two expert committees that worked with the government to produce economic statistics, potentially affecting the quality of data. The terminations by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were effective February 28 and communicated on Tuesday via email to one of the panels, the Federal Economic Statistics Advisory Committee (FESAC), which assisted with inflation and employment gross domestic product (GDP) data. The email read in part 'the Secretary of Commerce has determined that the purposes for which FESAC was established has been fulfilled and the committee has been terminated, effective February 28 2025.' The second group — the Bureau of Economic Analysis Advisory Committee, which consulted on a separate group of economic data — also was terminated. 'This will impact the quality of data because it's a core principle of federal statistical agencies that they continually improve and innovate,' Erica Groshen, a former FESAC member, told Reuters. 'Without a robust flow of information and advice between experts outside their agencies, it's going to be harder for them to do that.' The Commerce Department and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening. Groshen, who is also a former Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner, said FESAC was made up of academics, private-sector economists and data scientists, and focused on continually improving economic data produced by the BLS as well as the Commerce Department's statistical agencies, the Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis. The committees had been in place for at least two decades. The disbanding comes days after Lutnick said he would strip government spending from the GDP report, a move some economists said was impossible and intended to obscure the economic impact of deep spending cuts and mass layoffs being pursued by tech billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 'When you go down that rabbit hole, it's like trying to unscramble the eggs,' said Brian Bethune, an Economics professor at Boston College. 'For example, a lot of the defense spending goes to private contractors. So how can you cut that out of GDP? It's a ridiculous idea.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-disbands-2-expert-panels-on-economic-data-/7998249.html	2025-03-04T19:51:40-08:00	
China maintains defense spending increase at 7.2%	BEIJING — China will boost its defense spending by 7.2% this year, maintaining a steady growth rate as Beijing faces headwinds from three years of sluggish economic expansion amid mounting geopolitical challenges from Taiwan to Ukraine. The increase, announced on Wednesday in a government report to be released in parliament, matches last year's figure. It remains well above China's economic growth target for this year of roughly 5%, which analysts say was expected and reflected Beijing's ambitions for continued military modernization amid roiling geopolitical challenges. Since Xi became president and commander-in-chief more than a decade ago, the defense budget has grown to 1.78 trillion yuan ($245.65 billion) this year from 720 billion yuan in 2013. Xi aims to complete full military modernization by 2035, with China's military developing new missiles, ships, submarines and surveillance technologies. At the same time, the military is trying to improve combat readiness through more rigorous training and drills, according to official reports. Many of the drills involve Taiwan scenarios. The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies noted in a survey in February of the world's militaries that given China's wider economic constraints, 'authorities face increasingly sharp questions about which areas to prioritize.' The military budget increase comes despite numerous corruption scandals affecting the People's Liberation Army in the past two years that have felled two former defense ministers and a Central Military Commission member. China remains the world's second-biggest military spender behind the United States, whose proposed military budget for 2025 is $850 billion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-maintains-defense-spending-increase-at-7-2-/7998242.html	2025-03-04T19:33:34-08:00	
Judge extends nationwide block on Trump orders on transgender youth health care	A federal judge extended a nationwide block Tuesday on President Donald Trump's executive orders halting federal funding for providers of gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19. The judge's ruling came in a lawsuit filed earlier this month on behalf of families with transgender or nonbinary children who allege their health care has already been compromised by the president's orders. A national group for family of LGBTQ+ people and a doctors organization are also plaintiffs in the court challenge, one of more than 100 lawsuits opposing a slew of executive orders Trump has issued as he seeks to reverse the policies of former President Joe Biden. The preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge in Baltimore, a Biden nominee, keeps enforcement of the orders on hold while the case plays out, though the administration is expected to appeal. Several hospitals across the country halted such care for minors in the days after Trump's order to avoid losing federal funding. Another judge in Seattle has also blocked the orders in four states in a separate lawsuit filed by a group of Democratic-led states.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-extends-nationwide-block-on-trump-orders-on-transgender-youth-health-care-/7998238.html	2025-03-04T19:03:10-08:00	
Vatican says Pope Francis' prognosis 'remains guarded'	The clinical condition of Pope Francis remained stable, the Vatican said Tuesday evening, and he was 'alert, cooperative with therapies, and oriented.' However, the statement also said that Francis' prognosis 'remains guarded,' which means he is not out of danger. Francis, the leader of the world's nearly 1.4 billion Roman Catholics, has been in Rome's Gemelli Hospital for more than two weeks. He was admitted on February 14 with a case of bronchitis that worsened into double pneumonia. On Tuesday morning, the 88-year-old pontiff 'transitioned to high-flow oxygen therapy and underwent respiratory physiotherapy,' according to a Vatican statement. On Tuesday night, the pope was set to resume noninvasive mechanical ventilation throughout the night. While Francis' heart, kidney and blood measurements are stable, 'his health situation remains complex,' the Vatican said. On Monday, the pope underwent two bronchoscopies to remove 'a significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus.' The Vatican said Francis remained 'alert, oriented and cooperative at all times' during the procedures. However, Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Chicago's Northwestern Medicine, told The Associated Press, said Francis seems to be 'taking little steps forward and then steps back.' 'The fact that they had to go in there and remove [the mucus] manually is concerning, because it means that [the pope] is not clearing the secretions on his own,' said Coleman, who is not part of the pope's medical team. This hospital stay is Francis' longest during his time as pope. He is prone to lung infections, having had part of a lung removed when he was a young man. Francis' hospital stay is not the record amount of time a pope has been hospitalized. In 1981, Pope John Paul II spent 55 days in Gemelli for a minor operation that resulted in a serious infection that extended the pontiff's hospital stay.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-says-pope-francis-prognosis-remains-guarded-/7998228.html	2025-03-04T18:41:19-08:00	
US officials investigate brothers charged with human trafficking	TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA — Florida's attorney general announced Tuesday that his office has opened a criminal investigation into Andrew and Tristan Tate, brothers who are charged with human trafficking in Romania, days after they returned to the United States. Attorney General James Uthmeier announced on social media that he directed his office to work with law enforcement to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the Tate brothers. 'Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers,' Uthmeier said. After the Tates landed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Thursday, Governor Ron DeSantis told reporters that the brothers weren't welcome in the state, and that he would have the attorney general examine whether the state may have any jurisdiction over their alleged crimes. During an appearance Monday on the PPD Podcast, Andrew Tate said the governor was caving to media pressure. Tate said he has a U.S. passport and a right to visit his home country. He said he has broken no laws and that he has never even been tried, let alone convicted, of a crime. The Tates, who are dual U.S.-British citizens, were arrested in late 2022 and formally indicted last year in Romania on charges they participated in a criminal ring that lured women to that country, where they were sexually exploited. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny the allegations. Andrew Tate, 38, is a former professional kickboxer and self-described misogynist who is a hugely successful social media figure, attracting millions of followers, many of them young men and schoolchildren drawn in by the luxurious lifestyle the influencer projects online. He and his 36-year-old brother, Tristan, are vocal supporters of President Donald Trump. Andrew Tate previously was banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook for hate speech and his misogynistic comments, including that women should bear responsibility for getting sexually assaulted. The Tates left Romania after Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu said this month that a Trump administration official expressed interest in the brothers' case at the recent Munich Security Conference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-officials-investigate-brothers-charged-with-human-trafficking/7998201.html	2025-03-04T18:13:29-08:00	
Government watchdog wants thousands of federal workers to be reinstated	WASHINGTON — A government watchdog wants more than 5,000 probationary employees to be reinstated at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the latest example of resistance to President Donald Trump 's efforts to downsize the federal workforce. The Office of Special Counsel made the request Friday and disclosed it Tuesday. If the request is granted by the Merit Systems Protection Board, the employees would be back on the job for 45 days as an investigation continues. At that point, the board could be asked to make a final decision to reinstate them. Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger said the firings 'appear to have been carried out in a manner inconsistent with federal personnel laws.' It's possible that he could reach similar conclusions about employees at other departments as well. Probationary workers have been targeted for layoffs across the federal government because they're usually new to the job and lack full civil service protection. They were often summarily informed that they were being fired for poor performance. The case is proceeding at a moment of turbulence for the federal workforce and the offices responsible for protecting workers' rights. Not only are administration officials laying off thousands of employees, Trump wants to remove obstacles by firing Dellinger and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board nominated by President Joe Biden. Both attempts have been blocked through litigation, most recently on Tuesday when U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Trump did not have the power to remove Harris from office 'at will.' The attempt to fire her was illegal because he didn't seek to remove her for 'inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,' the judge said. The one-sentence email that informed Harris of her firing didn't cite any of those reasons, Harris' attorneys said. 'There are hard constitutional cases where the law remains unsettled and the Supreme Court has not spoken. This case is not among them,' they wrote in a court filing. Administration officials have already appealed Contreras' order. Harris was appointed in 2022 and has chaired the board since last March. Her term was due to expire in March 2028, but the White House notified her of her firing on Feb. 12. A second board member, Raymond Limon, retired Friday. Government attorneys argued that the judiciary doesn't have the authority to reinstate Harris or bar Trump from replacing her on the board. 'The American people elected President Trump to run the executive branch,' they wrote. 'And President Trump has determined that keeping [Harris] in office no longer serves the best interests of the American people. That democratically accountable choice should be respected.' The Merit Systems Protection Board is responsible for protecting federal government employees from political reprisals or retaliation for whistleblowing. Its administrative judges issue approximately 5,000 decisions annually. Trump's recent executive orders regarding federal employees have led to a surge in new appeals over the past few weeks, according to Harris' lawyers. 'Now more than ever, the Board's actual impartiality and the appearance of impartiality are critical,' they wrote. 'It is imperative that everyone — civil servants, courts, and the public at large — has confidence in the Board's ability to do its job, free from fear or favor.'

Can Europe arm Ukraine now that US has halted military aid?	U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 'pause' Monday to military aid shipments to Ukraine with immediate effect, which his administration said was aimed at forcing all sides to peace talks. As Henry Ridgwell reports from London, European leaders have said it is vital to continue weapons shipments to Kyiv — but there are doubts over how long Ukraine can keep on fighting.

US lists more than 400 federal buildings for possible sale	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration said on Tuesday it was considering selling some of the U.S. government's most iconic properties, including the headquarters of the Department of Justice, the FBI and the building that once housed Trump's luxury hotel. The General Services Administration (GSA), which manages federal properties, said it had identified 443 properties totaling more than 80 million square feet that 'are not core to government operations' and could be sold off. The potential sell-off appears to be part of Trump's effort to slash the size of the federal government, led by tech billionaire Elon Musk. The downsizing drive has already led to 100,000 workers taking buyouts or being fired. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has claimed that it has saved $105 billion so far, in part by canceling leases on government properties. Budget experts have cast doubt on the reliability of DOGE's data. The GSA said in a statement it could 'no longer hope' to secure the money to bring the properties up to date and said a sale could potentially save more than $430 million in annual operating costs. Some of the buildings on GSA's list, such as the Old Post Office, which formerly housed the Trump International Hotel, are newly renovated. Others, such as the FBI's crumbling J. Edgar Hoover Building, are widely seen as outdated. The GSA said in 2023 it would build a new FBI headquarters in Maryland. It was not clear how many of the buildings on GSA's list will eventually be put up for sale, or what sort of price they might bring. GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Several agencies whose headquarters could potentially be sold off also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The list includes the headquarters for several major government agencies, including the Veterans Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Federal Aviation Administration. GSA's own headquarters were also on the list. The list includes skyscrapers in Chicago, Atlanta and Cleveland, as well as several Internal Revenue Service hubs that process tax returns. The IRS said in an internal memo last week that it would sell those buildings starting in June, after the April tax filing season is complete.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lists-more-than-400-federal-buildings-for-possible-sale-/7998038.html	2025-03-04T16:14:48-08:00	
At UN, Trump's domestic policies enter international arena	UNITED NATIONS — The United States made clear Tuesday that it will no longer automatically support core United Nations platforms, including sustainable development and global goals that include eliminating poverty during a vote at the U.N. General Assembly. 'Therefore, the United States rejects and denounces the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development and the sustainable development goals, and will no longer reaffirm them as a matter of course,' U.S. representative Edward Heartney told the assembly. The U.S. voted against a resolution titled 'International Day of Peaceful Coexistence' that reaffirmed the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 'acknowledging that this includes a commitment to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.' Heartney said Americans voted in November’s election for their government to refocus on U.S. interests. 'Simply put, the globalist endeavors like Agenda 2030 and the SDGs lost at the ballot box,' he said. The measure passed the assembly with 162 countries in favor and three against — the United States, Israel and Argentina. The General Assembly creates 'International Days' to raise awareness of important global issues and promote peace and tolerance. There are more than 150 of them currently, including International Women’s Day, which is coming up on March 8, World Environment Day, International Mother Language Day and World Diabetes Day. On Tuesday, delegates voted to create an 'International Day of Hope,' as well as an 'International Day for Judicial Well-Being.' Washington stood alone, the sole no vote on both. Heartney said Washington 'strongly supports efforts to sustain peace and pursue diplomatic solutions to crises around the world and that individual rights are fundamental to U.S. security and the promotion of international peace.' 'This resolution, however, contributes to the unnecessary proliferation of multiple international days, many of which have a similar intent,' he said of the International Day of Hope proposal, noting that there is already an International Day of Peace and another on Happiness. 'The current draft resolution also contains references to diversity, equity and inclusion that conflict with U.S. policies that seek to eliminate all forms of discrimination and create equal opportunities for all,' Heartney added. The Trump administration has made the elimination of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI programs, a core pillar, saying it illegally promotes discrimination. Washington was also the sole vote against a resolution titled 'Education for Democracy,' which reaffirms 'the right of everyone to education' and recognizes 'the importance of equal opportunities for young people, including women.' The text recognizes 'that education for democracy nurtures responsible and active learners, capable of contributing effectively to peace and prosperity in their societies and beyond,' and notes the negative impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on global education. It calls on governments to invest more in quality education, to bridge the digital divide and 'to advance the prospects of future generations and foster the building of peaceful, just, democratic and sustainable societies.' On Feb. 24, Washington stunned the international community when it voted against a Ukrainian and European Union-drafted General Assembly resolution supporting a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine and submitted its own text that did not name Russia as the aggressor in the war. The assembly voted to amend the U.S. text to include language on Russia’s 'full-scale invasion' of Ukraine and supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. When the amended American text was put to a vote, Washington abstained. It was adopted with 93 states in favor, eight against and 73 abstentions. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they do carry the moral weight of the international community.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-trump-s-domestic-policies-enter-international-arena/7997792.html	2025-03-04T15:58:45-08:00

Wall Street falls again, wipes out post-election gains for S&P 500	Stocks racked up more losses on Wall Street Tuesday as a trade war between the U.S. and its key trading partners escalated, wiping out all of the gains since Election Day for the S&P 500. The Trump administration imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday and doubled tariffs against imports from China. All three countries announced retaliatory actions, sparking worries about a slowdown in the global economy. The S&P 500 fell 1.2%, with more than 80% of the stocks in the benchmark index closing lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.6%. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.4%. The tech-heavy index briefly reached a 10% decline from its most recent closing high, which is what the market considers a correction, but gains for Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech heavyweights helped pare those losses. Financial stocks were among the heaviest weights on the S&P 500 index. JPMorgan Chase fell 4% and Bank of America lost 6.3%. Markets in Europe fell sharply, with Germany's DAX falling 3.5% as automakers saw sharp losses. Stocks in Asia saw more modest declines. 'The markets are having a tough time even setting expectations for what this trade war could look like,' said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. The recent decline in U.S. stocks has wiped out all of the markets' gains since President Donald Trump's election in November. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses. Worries about tariffs raising consumer prices and reigniting inflation have been weighing on both the economy and Wall Street. The tariffs are prompting warnings from retailers, including Target and Best Buy, as they report their latest financial results. Target fell 3% despite beating Wall Street's earnings forecasts, saying there will be 'meaningful pressure' on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs. Best Buy plunged 13.3% for the biggest drop among S&P 500 stocks after giving investors a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast and warning about tariff effects. 'International trade is critically important to our business and industry,' said Best Buy CEO Corie Barry. Barry said China and Mexico are the top two sources for products that Best Buy sells, and it also expects vendors to pass along tariff costs, which would make price increases for American consumers likely. Imports from Canada and Mexico are now to be taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products subject to 10% import duties. The 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February was doubled to 20%. Retaliations were swift. China responded to new U.S. tariffs by announcing it will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and expanded controls on doing business with key U.S. companies. Canada plans on slapping tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. Mexico also plans tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.20% from 4.16% late Monday. It's still down sharply from last month, when it was approaching 4.80%, as worries have grown about the strength of the U.S. economy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wall-street-falls-again-wipes-out-post-election-gains-for-s-p-500-/7997781.html	2025-03-04T15:30:59-08:00

China's Liu Jiakun wins Pritzker Prize, 'Nobel' for architecture	NEW YORK — The Pritzker Prize, dubbed the 'Nobel' for architecture, was awarded Tuesday to China's Liu Jiakun, who was recognized for designs that celebrate 'everyday lives.' 'In a global context where architecture is struggling to find adequate responses to fast evolving social and environmental challenges, Liu Jiakun has provided convincing answers that also celebrate the everyday lives of people as well as their communal and spiritual identities,' the award's jury wrote in a statement. Born in 1956, Liu has worked on more than 30 projects in China ranging from academic and cultural institutions to civic spaces and commercial buildings. 'Architecture should reveal something it should abstract, distill and make visible the inherent qualities of local people,' Liu said in the statement, evoking his craft's capacity to create 'a sense of shared community.' Liu lives and works in his birth city of Chengdu, where he prioritizes the use of local materials and traditional building techniques. His projects include the Museum of Clocks in Chengdu, a large circular structure with a skylight that illuminates an interior strip of photographs. Alejandro Aravena, who won the award in 2016 and is chair of the jury, said Liu's works offer 'clues on how to confront the challenges of urbanization' especially because they are sometimes 'a building, infrastructure, landscape and public space at the same time.' 'Cities tend to segregate functions, but Liu Jiakun takes the opposite approach and sustains a delicate balance to integrate all dimensions of the urban life,' Aravena said. Liu, who is the 54th recipient of the Pritzker Prize, will be honored at a celebration in Abu Dhabi in spring, award organizers said. Last year's prize went to Japan's Riken Yamamoto, whose projects are credited with promoting human contact and who said at the time his objective was to 'design architecture that can bring joy to people around it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-liu-jiakun-wins-pritzker-prize-for-architecture/7997531.html	2025-03-04T11:09:44-08:00	
NASA's 2 stuck astronauts closing in on return to Earth after 9 months in space	CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA — NASA’s two stuck astronauts are just a few weeks away from finally returning to Earth after nine months in space. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have to wait until their replacements arrive at the International Space Station next week before they can check out later this month. They’ll be joined on their SpaceX ride home by two astronauts who launched by themselves in September alongside two empty seats. Speaking from the space station on Tuesday, Williams said the hardest part about the unexpected extended stay was the wait by their families back home. 'It’s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little more so than for us,' she said. Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing’s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty. Their homecoming was further delayed by the extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements. Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASA’s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency’s Alexander Gorbunov. Wilmore and Williams — retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers — have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-s-2-stuck-astronauts-closing-in-on-return-to-earth-after-9-months-in-space/7997516.html	2025-03-04T11:05:10-08:00	
Suicide bombings at Pakistan military base kill at least 9	PESHAWAR, PAKISTAN — Attackers launched two suicide bombings to breach a wall at a military base in northwestern Pakistan while others stormed the compound and were repelled in violence that killed at least nine people and injured 25, officials and a local hospital said. A group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban militant group claimed responsibility for the attack in Bannu, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and said dozens of Pakistani security forces were killed. The military did not immediately confirm any casualties, but Bannu District Hospital said at least nine people were dead. Plumes of gray smoke rose into the air and gunshots continued after the two explosions, police officer Zahid Khan said. Four of those killed were children, hospital officials said. The victims lived close to the scene of the blasts. The two suicide bombers blew themselves up near the wall of the sprawling military area, a security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. 'After a breach in the wall, five to six more attackers attempted to enter the cantonment but were eliminated. Operations in the area are still ongoing,' the security official said. The blasts happened after sunset, when people would have been breaking their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Jaish Al-Fursan claimed responsibility for the attack, the third militant assault in Pakistan since Ramadan started Sunday. In a statement, the group said the source of the blasts were explosive-laden vehicles. Militants have targeted Bannu several times. Last November, a suicide car bomb killed 12 troops and wounded several others at a security post. In July, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-laden vehicle and other militants opened fire near the outer wall of the military facility.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suicide-bombings-at-pakistan-military-base-kill-at-least-9/7997305.html	2025-03-04T10:50:02-08:00	
Supreme Court makes it harder for EPA to police sewage discharges	WASHINGTON — A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday made it harder for environmental regulators to limit water pollution, ruling for San Francisco in a case about the discharge of raw sewage that sometimes occurs during heavy rains. By a 5-4 vote, the court's conservative majority ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority under the Clean Water Act with water pollution permits that contain vague requirements for maintaining water quality. The decision is the latest in which conservative justices have reined in pollution control efforts. Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court that EPA can set specific limits that tell cities and counties what can be discharged. But the agency lacks the authority 'to include ‘end-result’ provisions,' Alito wrote, that make cities and counties responsible for maintaining the quality of the water, the Pacific Ocean in this case, into which wastewater is discharged. 'When a permit contains such requirements, a permittee that punctiliously follows every specific requirement in its permit may nevertheless face crushing penalties if the quality of the water in its receiving waters falls below the applicable standards,' he wrote. One conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett, joined the court's three liberals in dissent. Limits on discharges sometimes still don't ensure water quality standards are met, Barrett wrote. 'The concern that the technology-based effluent limitations may fall short is on display in this case,' Barrett wrote, adding that 'discharges from components of San Francisco’s sewer system have allegedly led to serious breaches of the water quality standards, such as ‘discoloration, scum, and floating material, including toilet paper, in Mission Creek.’' The case produced an unusual alliance of the liberal northern California city, energy companies and business groups. The EPA has issued thousands of the permits, known as narrative permits, over several decades, former acting general counsel Kevin Minoli said. The narrative permits have operated almost as a backstop in case permits that quantify what can be discharged still result in unacceptable water quality, Minoli said. With the new restrictions imposed by the court, 'the question is what comes in place of those limits,' Minoli said. Alito downplayed the impact of the decision, writing that the agency has 'the tools needed' to ensure water quality standards are met.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-makes-it-harder-for-epa-to-police-sewage-discharges/7997491.html	2025-03-04T10:49:35-08:00	
BlackRock strikes deal to bring ports on both sides of Panama Canal under American control	The Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports near the Panama Canal has agreed to sell shares of its units that operate the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., after President Donald Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane. In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries. The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing. In January, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports 'give China ready observation posts' to take action. 'This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,' Cruz said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jose Raul Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations. Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing. But while much attention was focused on Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the ports key ports at either end of the canal. Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blackrock-strikes-deal-to-bring-ports-on-both-sides-of-panama-canal-under-american-control-/7997361.html	2025-03-04T09:39:56-08:00	
Arab summit debates counterproposal to Trump Gaza plan	CAIRO — Arab leaders are debating an Egyptian counterproposal to U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip at an extraordinary summit in Cairo on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Arab media is sounding a note of skepticism over how the plan might be implemented, given Hamas’ insistence that it will not give up its 17-year reign over Gaza. Egypt's plan — which comes as a counterproposal to Trump's plan to resettle Palestinians outside Gaza while the territory is rebuilt — calls for residents of Gaza to remain inside the territory in seven locations in temporary housing while rubble is removed and demining takes place. Egypt and many other Arab states oppose the portion of Trump's plan that calls for Gaza Palestinians to be relocated outside the strip during rebuilding efforts. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi thanked Trump for his efforts to help rebuild Gaza. He also said Egypt proposes that a group of technocrats run the territory during an interim period, while a new Palestinian police force is trained and efforts are made to secure funding to rebuild. Egypt would host a donor's conference next month, el-Sissi said. Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains tense amid the possibility that conflict could erupt again after Israel accused Hamas, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist group, of using humanitarian aid as a 'principal source of revenue [for itself].' Israel halted aid shipments on Saturday. Said Sadek, who teaches political sociology at the Egypt-Japan University in Alexandria, told VOA that many Arabs oppose disarming Hamas and forcing the group to relinquish power to rebuild Gaza. 'Basically, this summit will discuss how to marginalize [or] sideline Hamas and having an international Muslim peace force and training Palestinian policemen, so that the process of reconstruction [takes] place,' Sadek said. 'The trouble, of course, is how can you force Hamas to leave Gaza [and] how can you deprive them of their weapons?' Saudi-owned al Arabiya TV reported that Arab leaders are expected to approve a proposal to ask the United Nations to help set up a joint Arab-international peace-keeping force to run Gaza during an interim period while a new Palestinian police force is trained. Egypt has refused to assume control over the territory it ruled from 1948 to 1967, when it was seized by Israel during the Seven Day War. Arab League spokesperson Jamal Rushdy tried to minimize disagreements over Egypt's Gaza plan, saying it is just the beginning on a long road to reconstruct the territory and secure the funds to do so. Hamas has ruled out transferring power and said it will keep its arms, which its leaders call a line they will not cross. Israel, in return, has threatened to resume hostilities, claiming that Hamas has recruited more fighters and restored its preconflict manpower to 30,000 men. Egyptian mediators have negotiated with Hamas — without a great deal of success — since it first grabbed control of Gaza in 2007, expelling the mainstream Fatah group and the Palestinian police force that was set up after Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arab-summit-debates-counterproposal-to-trump-gaza-plan/7997347.html	2025-03-04T09:33:34-08:00	
Re-arming Europe? EU tested to turn talk into action	Paris — With Washington’s sudden pause on military aid to Ukraine as a backdrop, worried European Union leaders meet in Brussels Thursday to discuss steps to beef up EU defenses against Russia. 'The question is no longer whether Europe’s security is threatened in a very real way, or whether Europe should shoulder more of its responsibility for its own security,' said European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen ahead of the summit, as she outlined a multi-pronged $840 billion defense financing plan for the 27-member bloc. 'The real question in front of us,' she said, 'is whether Europe is prepared to act as decisively as the situation dictates — and whether Europe is ready and able to act with speed and ambition that is needed.' That message has been resonating across multiple emergency summits that gathered European leaders fearful of possible U.S. disengagement, and has resulted in new European defense spending commitments, after years of Washington demands to take on more of the burden. But EU members also face steep challenges as they move to rearm, from sometimes shaky governments and economies, to skeptical populations and a surging far right that is often more favorable toward Russia. Especially concerning for many is the Trump administration’s possible pivot from a longstanding transatlantic alliance. 'It raises very big issues for the future of the European Union — and I think people in Europe are very aware of this,' said Ian Lesser, who heads the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund policy institute. 'Is Europe going to address these challenges, whether it’s on trade or defense — in a collective way? Or are countries, member states, going to go their own way?' Sense of urgency For many EU leaders, today’s message is unity. During a summit in London, EU countries and non-member Britain agreed to develop their own peace plan for Ukraine to present to Washington. France and Britain also backed a 'coalition of the willing' sending troops to Ukraine to enforce any peace deal. French President Emmanuel Macron — who has long called for a more militarily autonomous Europe — has also suggested extending France’s nuclear deterrence to other European countries. 'The sense of urgency is finally catching up with European leaders but it’s not sufficient at the moment,' said Olena Prokopenko, a senior German Marshall Fund fellow. 'We see different levels of understanding of the level of threat that Europe is facing at the moment.' 'I see some degree of — I don’t want to say panic — but really alarmed Europeans who realize they need to stick together as much as possible,' said Elie Tenenbaum, director of security studies at the French Institute for International Relations in Paris. Still, he added, Europe faces a daunting task. 'If the Europeans want to step up and make up for the loss of American aid to Ukraine, it needs to happen now,' Tenenbaum said. 'They need to put the money on the table, they need to pass on the orders to the defense industry.' Beyond Ukraine, the Brussels-based Bruegel policy institute estimates Europe would need 300,000 more troops and hundreds of billions more dollars to deter possible Russian aggression without the United States. Europe is 'lacking ammunition, we’re lacking replacement parts, we’re lacking readiness,' Tenenbaum said. Former French ambassador Michel Duclos, however, points to Europe’s assets. 'Yes, we are not in a good situation,' said Duclos, now an analyst at the Montaigne Institute research group in Paris. 'But at the same time, in demographic terms, in economic terms, we could be much stronger than Russia, if we are able to put our act together in defense terms.' Pushback Europe’s new security ambitions are already facing pushback. France’s powerful far-right National Rally party, for one, has rejected France including Europe in its nuclear deterrence capability, and leader Marine Le Pen describes an independent European defense as 'illusory.' Hungary’s Viktor Orban, noted for his friendly Kremlin ties, has called on Europe to instead enter direct talks to bring about a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Many European economies are struggling, while public support for Ukraine is fading in some countries. A pair of recent polls, for instance, shows that while two-thirds of French citizens believe Europe should continue supporting Kyiv, three-quarters don’t want French boots on the ground — except to enforce a possible peace. 'So far, European leaders have been trying to be more reassuring than alarming,' says analyst Tenenbaum, of the message many are sending their populations. 'But if they want to justify higher defense spending and risk taking, then they will need to be much more vocal' about the dangers the region is facing. For analyst Duclos, last week’s heated White House meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky offered an impetus to prepare Europeans for going it alone. 'What happened in the Oval Office last week was useful to make people understand we disagree not only on the means, instruments and policies, but on something more fundamental: on values, on the threat perception,' he said of growing transatlantic differences. 'And for the French public, it was the most powerful of wake-up calls.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/re-arming-europe-eu-tested-to-turn-talk-into-action/7997295.html	2025-03-04T08:49:13-08:00	
Putin hails Myanmar ties as junta chief visits Moscow	Moscow — President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday praised Russia's developing ties with Myanmar, during a visit by the Asian country's junta chief to its key ally. Russia is a crucial arms supplier to the isolated state, which is struggling to quell violent opposition to the junta's military rule. 'The relations between our countries are steadily developing,' Putin told junta chief Min Aung Hlaing in a televised meeting at the Kremlin. 'We have great potential,' he said, hailing growing trade ties. Min Aung Hlaing, who seized power in a 2021 coup, saluted Putin as a 'king' and backed Moscow's full-scale military offensive on Ukraine. 'I believe that victory must be yours under your strong and decisive leadership,' he told Putin. Both countries are under heavy Western sanctions — Myanmar following the 2021 coup and Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea and its ongoing three-year-long offensive on Ukraine. Russia exports some raw materials and fertilizers to Myanmar, and both sides have talked up the prospect of deepening economic ties alongside their military and political alliance. Meeting the Myanmar delegation earlier on Tuesday, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Moscow saw potential to boost cooperation in energy, nuclear, transport, agriculture and telecoms projects. Moscow's support has become vital to Myanmar's military — particularly the air force — as it battles an array of ethnic minority armed groups and pro-democracy guerrillas on multiple fronts. The junta suffered significant territorial losses after a 2023 rebel offensive but its air power has been pivotal to arresting the advance of opposition forces. Russia has sought to boost relations with anti-Western governments, particularly in Asia and Africa, since ordering troops into Ukraine in February 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-hails-myanmar-ties-as-junta-chief-visits-moscow/7997288.html	2025-03-04T08:41:38-08:00	
At least 3 Serbian lawmakers injured in parliament melee	BELGRADE, SERBIA — At least three lawmakers were injured on Tuesday, one of them seriously, after chaotic scenes in Serbia 's parliament, during which smoke bombs and flares were thrown, further fueling political tensions in the Balkan country. Lawmakers were scheduled to vote on a law that would increase funding for university education, but opposition parties said the ruling majority was also planning to approve dozens of other decisions. They said that was illegal and lawmakers should first confirm the resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and his government. Chaos erupted about an hour after the parliamentary session started, with opposition lawmakers blowing whistles and holding up a banner reading 'Serbia has risen so the regime would fall!' Hundreds of opposition supporters rallied outside the parliament building during the session. Video footage from the assembly hall showed clashes between lawmakers and flares and smoke bombs being thrown. Serbian media said eggs and water bottles also were thrown. Officials later said three people were injured in the disturbance, including lawmaker Jasmina Obradovic, who was taken to a hospital. Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic accused the opposition of being a 'terrorist gang.' Defense Minister Bratislav Gasic described those behind the incident as 'a disgrace to Serbia.' 'The vandalism of opposition MPs has exposed the nature of their personalities and the essence of their political agenda,' Gasic said. Serbia's populist President Aleksandar Vucic visited Obradovic in the hospital. 'Jasmina will win, Serbia will win,' Vucic said in a post on Instagram, showing him holding the lawmaker's hand in an emergency room. Demands by protesting students The incident reflects a deep political crisis in Serbia, where monthslong anti-corruption protests have rattled a populist government. Vucevic resigned in January as the government faced protests over the collapse in November of a concrete train station canopy in the Serbia's north that killed 15 people and which critics blamed on rampant corruption. Parliament must confirm the prime minister's resignation for it to take effect. A rise in education funding has been one of the demands by Serbia's protesting students, who have been a key driving force behind almost daily street protests that started after the Nov. 1 canopy collapse in Novi Sad. Showdown in parliament Opposition parties have insisted that the government has no authority to pass new laws. Leftist lawmaker Radomir Lazovic said the opposition was ready to support the passing of the student-requested education bill, but not the other decisions listed at the assembly agenda. Lazovic said, 'We can only discuss the fall of the government.' He said the only way out of the current crisis would be a transitional government that would create conditions for a free and fair election, a demand that the ruling populists have repeatedly rejected. Vucic and his ruling right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have imposed a firm grip on power in the past decades despite formally seeking European Union membership. Many in Serbia believe the fatal canopy collapse was the result of sloppy work and a disregard of safety regulations because of government corruption.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-3-serbian-lawmakers-injured-in-parliament-melee/7997272.html	2025-03-04T08:35:01-08:00	
Trump administration again labels Houthis 'terrorist organization'	WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department on Tuesday reinstated the 'foreign terrorist organization' designation for Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi group, fulfilling an order announced by President Donald Trump shortly after he took office. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the department had restored the designation, which carries with it sanctions and penalties for anyone providing 'material support' for the group. 'Since 2023, the Houthis have launched hundreds of attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, as well as U.S. service members defending freedom of navigation and our regional partners,' Rubio said in a statement. 'Most recently, the Houthis spared Chinese-flagged ships while targeting American and allied vessels.' The Houthis have targeted more than 100 merchant vessels in the critical trade corridor with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. In January, the group signaled that it would limit its attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip but warned that wider assaults could resume if needed. Trump's first Republican administration had similarly designated the Houthis in its waning days, but the designation had been revoked by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration over concerns it would badly affect the delivery of aid to Yemen, which was facing one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The United Nations said last month that it suspended its humanitarian operations in the stronghold of Yemen's Houthi rebels after they detained eight more U.N. staffers. The rebels in recent months have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen's capital. None of the U.N. staffers have been released. The Iranian-backed Houthis have been fighting Yemen's internationally recognized government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they descended from their stronghold in Saada and took control of Sanaa and most of the north.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-again-labels-houthis-terrorist-organization-/7997241.html	2025-03-04T08:15:15-08:00	
Floods in Indonesia's capital displace thousands	JAKARTA — Thousands of people were evacuated in Indonesia's capital Jakarta on Tuesday after floods swamped the region, officials said, with heavy rain expected to continue until next week. Torrential rain since Monday has triggered floods of up to 3 meters (9.8 feet) in and around Jakarta, the country's disaster agency said in a statement, blocking some roads and submerging over 1,000 houses and many cars. Jakarta Governor Pramono Anung raised the alert level to the second highest of the critical stages, calling on the local government to activate water pumps to extract water from flooded areas and conduct weather modification operations — which typically includes shooting salt flares into clouds to trigger rain before they reach land. Local media reported floodwaters also swamped a hospital in the eastern town of Bekasi, with water entering some wards, forcing the evacuation of patients to other buildings, while other parts of the hospital were hit by power outages. Rescuers on rubber boats sailed through thigh-high water to evacuate residents that had been trapped in floods since 4 a.m. (2100 GMT) at a housing complex in Bekasi, Reuters reporters said. The country's weather agency warned that heavy rain is forecast to hit the capital and surrounding cities until March 11. 'We need to be alert. ... But hopefully the weather modification could reduce rainfall,' said the agency's head Dwikorita Karnawati. Sri Suyatni, 50, said she did not have time to collect her belongings before evacuating and her entire house was submerged in flood water. 'I hope the floods will soon recede,' she said. The government has started building temporary shelters and distributing foods, clothes, and medications for the evacuees, said social affairs minister Saifullah Yusuf. Residents were also evacuated to schools, mosques and churches. The Greater Jakarta metropolitan area, home to more than 30 million people, is regularly hit by floods. But several local media reported the current situation, particularly in Bekasi, was the worst since 2020. Floods killed 60 in Jakarta in 2020, following the heaviest one-day rainfall since records began in 1866.	https://www.voanews.com/a/floods-in-indonesia-s-capital-displace-thousands/7997181.html	2025-03-04T07:35:17-08:00	
Turkey, Iran exchange grievances after Ankara criticizes Iran	ANKARA, TURKEY — Iran and Turkey have summoned each other's diplomats for discussions, officials said Tuesday, after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticized Tehran's policy of supporting militias in Syria and elsewhere. On Monday, a top aide to Iran's foreign minister met with the Turkish ambassador to Tehran and emphasized the need to avoid 'inappropriate remarks and unrealistic analyses that could lead to disputes and tensions in bilateral relations,' according to an Iranian Foreign Ministry statement. The Iranian official, Mahmoud Heidari, also told the Turkish ambassador that Muslim countries should focus their efforts on halting Israel's 'crimes and aggressions' in the Palestinian territories and Syria. Turkey reciprocated on Tuesday by inviting the Iranian charge d'affaires for discussions. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oncu Keceli said the Iranian diplomat was told that foreign policy matters should not be used for domestic political purposes and that messages should be communicated directly to Turkish officials, not publicly. In an interview with Al-Jazeera television aired last week, Fidan criticized Iran's foreign policy, describing Tehran's reliance on militias in the Middle East region as a 'risky' strategy and urging a change in policy. 'If you try to create unrest in another country by supporting a group there, another country might try to create unrest in your country by supporting a group here,' Fidan said. The tensions between the two neighbors come as the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria has weakened Iran's influence in the country, while enhancing Turkey's clout. The new, Sunni Islamist government views Iran-backed militias as a threat. The Iranian government spokesperson, Fatemeh Mohajerani, said Tuesday that Fidan's remarks were 'unconstructive.' She added: 'We hope not to witness a repeat of them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-iran-exchange-grievances-after-ankara-criticizes-iran/7997109.html	2025-03-04T07:02:19-08:00	
What to expect from China's annual political meetings	Taipei, Taiwan — Thousands of Chinese leaders, lawmakers, and business leaders are gathering in Beijing this week for China’s biggest political meetings of the year. The meetings, which will bring together top party officials, bureaucrats, military leaders and delegates, business heads, academics and others, are watched closely for signs of the Chinese government’s priorities for the year ahead. The gathering is also used to pass instructions down to local officials and party cadres across China. Amid ongoing deflationary pressures and a looming trade war with the United States, analysts say this year’s meetings, officially called the 'Two Sessions,' will focus on boosting domestic demand and cultivating high-tech innovation. 'In the face of geopolitical uncertainties, especially the potential trade war between the U.S. and China, the Chinese leadership will try to pursue economic reassurance by letting the outside world know that the Chinese economy remains stable,' said Wen-ti Sung, a Taipei-based political scientist for the Australian National University, or ANU. Despite these attempts, Jacob Gunter, lead economic analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Germany, said the NPC is unlikely to introduce policies that will boost consumption 'in sufficient ways' due to the economic challenges the country is facing. What are the Two Sessions? The 'Two Sessions' or 'lianghui' as they are called in Mandarin, are the annual meetings of China’s top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, or CPPCC, and China’s rubber-stamp legislature, the National People’s Congress, or NPC. The meetings typically kick off with the CPPCC meeting on Tuesday and are followed by the NPC gathering on Wednesday. The CPPCC, which has more than 2,000 members, is tasked to provide recommendations on a wide range of issues, including the economy, education, and social welfare. The body typically puts out proposals but doesn’t have the power to make laws. The NPC, with around 3,000 members, is tasked with passing legislation, electing national leaders, and approving government budgets and national development plans. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual meetings used to last around two weeks, but in recent years, the meetings have been shortened. This year, the CPPCC meetings will run from March 4 to March 10 and the NPC meetings from March 5 to March 11. Who will attend the meetings? This year’s two sessions will feature a diverse line-up of participants, from top Chinese leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Chinese Premier Li Qiang, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, to provincial delegates and industry leaders. Unlike previous years, leaders from tech giants, including Tencent chairman Tony Ma and Baidu CEO Robin Li, were missing from the participants’ list. Instead, leaders of emerging tech companies, such as electric vehicle manufacturer XPeng CEO He Xiaopeng and Chinese artificial intelligence chipmaker Cambricon Technologies chairman Chen Tianshi, will participate in the meetings, a sign analysts say of Beijing’s determination to pour more resources into emerging sectors. According to state media, more than 3,000 journalists from Chinese and foreign media outlets are expected to cover the important meetings from Beijing. As China has tightened control over foreign journalists’ visas since 2020, many foreign correspondents, especially those working for American media outlets, can only secure short-term visas to cover the meetings, VOA has learned. Key events during the Two Sessions Chinese Premier Li Qiang will kick off the NPC sessions by delivering the government work report on Wednesday, during which he is expected to reveal China’s economic growth target, government budget including defense spending, and key economic policy directives for 2025. Li’s address is likely to touch on some foreign policy issues but for indicators on U.S.-China relations and Beijing’s thoughts on efforts to end the war in Ukraine, many will be looking to the press conference that Foreign Minister Wang Yi is scheduled to hold on Friday. With a potential U.S.-China trade war looming in the background, analysts think China will set the 2025 economic growth target at 5%, reflecting the Chinese government’s attempt to maintain stability while seeking to facilitate progress. Fang Tsung-yen, an assistant research fellow at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told VOA that since the stimulus measures that China rolled out last September only generated limited effects, it remains to be seen whether Beijing will introduce more fiscal measures to boost domestic demand during the Two Sessions. In addition to key economic measures, the Chinese government is also expected to roll out measures aimed at channeling more state resources into key sectors, such as AI and semiconductors, while enhancing confidence among domestic and foreign investors. In light of the dramatic changes in U.S. foreign policy since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, some experts say China will try to present itself as a 'pro status-quo power' during the annual meetings. 'As the American leadership abdicates its role globally, China might see an opportunity to step up and show it can act more responsibly on global issues,' Dali Yang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Chicago, told VOA by phone. VOA Mandarin’s Chih-wei Chuang contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-to-expect-from-china-annual-political-meetings/7996493.html	2025-03-04T05:54:49-08:00

Pope resting after acute breathing crises forced him to resume noninvasive ventilation	Rome — Pope Francis rested early Tuesday after he suffered further setbacks in his fight against double pneumonia: two new acute respiratory crises that required him to resume using noninvasive mechanical ventilation to breathe. In its early Tuesday update, the Vatican said: 'The pope slept through the night, now rest continues.' Francis suffered the two crises Monday. Doctors extracted 'copious' amounts of mucus that had accumulated in his lungs, the Vatican said in a late update. They performed two bronchoscopies, in which a camera-tipped tube was sent into his airways with a sucker at the tip to suction out fluid. The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was put back on noninvasive mechanical ventilation: a mask that covers his nose and mouth and pumps oxygen into the lungs. Francis remained alert, oriented and cooperated with medical personnel, the Vatican said. The prognosis remained guarded, meaning he was not out of danger. Doctors didn’t say if he remained in stable condition, though they referred to the crises in the past tense, suggesting they were over. The crises were a new setback in what has become a more than two-week battle by the frail pope to overcome a complex respiratory infection. The Vatican said the mucus that had accumulated in Francis' lungs was his body’s reaction to the original pneumonia infection and not a new infection, given laboratory tests don’t indicate any new bacteria. Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episodes were more concerning than the last one on Friday, in which Francis had a coughing fit, inhaled some vomit that needed to be extracted and then was put on the noninvasive mechanical ventilation for a day and then didn’t need it anymore. The use of bronchoscopies reflects a worrying level of mucus and phlegm in the lungs, Coleman said. 'The fact that they had to go in there and remove it manually is concerning, because it means that he is not clearing the secretions on his own,' he said. 'He’s taking little steps forward and then steps back,' said Coleman, who is not involved in Francis’ care. Francis, who is not physically active, uses a wheelchair and is overweight, had been undergoing respiratory physiotherapy to try to improve his lung function. But the accumulation of the secretions in his lungs was a sign that he doesn’t have the muscle tone to cough vigorously enough to expel the fluid. Doctors often use noninvasive ventilation to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Francis has not been intubated during this hospitalization. It’s not clear if he has provided any advance directives about the limits of his care if he declines or loses consciousness. Catholic teaching holds that life must be defended from conception until natural death. It insists that chronically ill patients, including those in vegetative states, must receive 'ordinary' care such as hydration and nutrition, but 'extraordinary' or disproportionate care can be suspended if it is no longer beneficial or is only prolonging a precarious and painful life. Francis articulated that in a 2017 speech to a meeting of the Vatican’s bioethics think tank, the Pontifical Academy for Life. He said there was 'no obligation to have recourse in all circumstances to every possible remedy.' He added: 'It thus makes possible a decision that is morally qualified as withdrawal of ‘overzealous treatment.’' Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who heads the academy which helps articulate the Catholic Church’s position on end-of-life care, said Francis is like any other Catholic and would follow church teaching, if it came to that. 'Today the pope is giving us an extraordinary teaching on fragility,' he told reporters Monday. 'Today the pope, not through words but with his body, is reminding all of us, we elderly people to begin with, that we are all fragile and therefore we need to take care of each other.' Francis’ hospitalization, which hits 18 nights Tuesday, is by no means reaching the papal record that was set during St. John Paul II’s numerous lengthy hospitalizations over a quarter century. The longest single hospitalization occurred in 1981, when John Paul spent 55 days in Gemelli for a minor operation and then to be treated for a serious infection that followed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-resting-after-acute-breathing-crises-forced-him-to-resume-noninvasive-ventilation-/7996365.html	2025-03-04T03:18:35-08:00	
Japan's worst wildfire in half a century spreads	TOKYO — Firefighters were Tuesday battling Japan's worst wildfire in half a century, which has left one dead and forced the evacuation of nearly 4,000 local residents. White smoke billowed from a forested area around the northern city of Ofunato, aerial TV footage showed, five days after the blaze began after record-low rainfall. The fire also follows Japan's hottest summer on record last year, as climate change pushes up temperatures worldwide. As of Tuesday morning, the wildfire had engulfed around 2,600 hectares, the fire and disaster management agency said -- over seven times the area of New York's Central Park. That makes it Japan's largest wildfire since 1975 when 2,700 hectares burnt in Kushiro on northern Hokkaido island. It is estimated to have damaged at least 80 buildings by Sunday, although details were still being assessed, the agency said. Military and fire department helicopters are trying to douse the Ofunato fire, a city official told reporters. 'At the moment, there is no indication that the fire is under control,' the official said. Snow is expected overnight, changing to rain, but the official said he could not say whether it would help extinguish the blaze. 'The poor weather may prevent helicopters from dropping water,' he warned. Around 2,000 firefighters -- most deployed from other parts of the country, including Tokyo -- are working from the air and ground in the area in Iwate region, which was hard-hit by a deadly tsunami in 2011. An evacuation advisory has been issued to around 4,600 people, of whom 3,939 have left their homes to seek shelter, according to the municipality. The number of wildfires in Japan has declined since its 1970s peak, but the country saw about 1,300 in 2023, concentrated in February to April when the air dries and winds pick up. 'No rain' Ofunato had just 2.5 millimeters of rainfall in February -- breaking the previous record-low for the month, of 4.4 millimeters in 1967, and below the usual average of 41 millimeters. Since Friday, 'there has been no rain -- or very little, if any' in Ofunato, a local weather agency official told AFP. Some types of extreme weather have a well-established link with climate change, such as heatwaves or heavy rainfall. Other phenomena like droughts, snowstorms, tropical storms and forest fires can result from a combination of complex factors. Some companies have been affected by the wildfire, such as Taiheiyo Cement, which told AFP its Ofunato plant has suspended operations for several days because part of its premises is in the evacuation advisory zone. Ofunato-based confectionery company Saitoseika warned that 'if our headquarters or plants become a no-go zone, we may need to halt production,' describing the situation as 'tense.' Japanese baseball prodigy Roki Sasaki -- who recently joined the Los Angeles Dodgers in the U.S. -- has offered a $67,000 donation and 500 sets of bedding, Ofunato city's official account posted on X. Sasaki was a high school student there, after losing his father and grandparents in the huge 2011 tsunami.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-worst-wildfire-in-half-a-century-spreads/7996352.html	2025-03-04T02:57:12-08:00	
Refugees injured in clashes with Kenyan police during food ration protests	NAIROBI, Kenya — At least four people sustained gunshot wounds as police clashed with protesters in Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp, in the country's north. Thousands of refugees in the camp, which hosts people fleeing from conflict and drought in neighboring South Sudan, Ethiopia, Burundi and Congo, protested Monday against food rationing due to funding constraints. The World Food Program, which is in charge of food distribution at the refugee camp, said last December the food rations to refugee camps were 'at 45 percent of the minimum food basket due to resource constraints.' The WFP has warned for years that it is facing shortfalls in the contributions from governments it relies on for funding, and on Monday it announced that it is closing its office in South Africa due to U.S. President Donald Trump's cuts in foreign aid. A refugee from neighboring South Sudan, John Garang, held up a roughly 4 liter pot. 'This is the container they are now using to measure beans and oil and the other one for rice. And this is equivalent for one month for your food. Assume you don't have another income, it's only this. Is this enough for you,' he asked. Kenya is currently in the process of transitioning refugees into integrated settlements as opposed to the previous system of refugee camps, which are donor reliant, and has already gazetted Kakuma and Dadaab as municipalities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/refugees-injured-in-clashes-with-kenyan-police-during-food-ration-protests/7996340.html	2025-03-04T02:21:14-08:00	
New Orleans to celebrate Mardi Gras Day with costumes and revelry despite weather concerns	NEW ORLEANS — Thousands of revelers adorned in beads and outlandish costumes will fill the streets of New Orleans as the city celebrates Mardi Gras Day despite anticipated severe storms. The city’s two biggest parades — hosted by social clubs Krewe of Zulu and Krewe of Rex — are set to go on with earlier start times, shorter routes and no marching bands, New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters Monday. The parades will be required to wrap up by 11:30 a.m. local time to avoid diminishing weather. 'Bottom line, they gonna still get the Zulu parade and all the excitement, it’s just a little earlier,' said Darren Mire, a Krewe of Zulu spokesperson. 'We have to err on the side of caution, we have to protect the citizens of New Orleans and the visitors, and this was the best decision possible to get things done.' Thunderstorms and winds up to 100 kph are expected throughout Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. In neighboring Jefferson Parish, officials canceled parades. Kirkpatrick warned parade-goers to not bring umbrellas, tents or 'anything that could fly in the wind and cause mayhem.' Worsening weather Tuesday morning could still be a condition for calling off the city's parades at the last minute, she added. 'I will cancel the parades at that point, no matter what time that is,' Kirkpatrick said. 'I hold that trump card in which I will not hesitate to cancel — I won’t do it lightly, but I will do it.' Two other parades that had been scheduled to roll through the city later on Tuesday with nearly 200 truck floats have been postponed to Sunday, Kirkpatrick said. Other cities along the Gulf Coast, such as Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, hold their own Mardi Gras Day parades. The culmination of the weekslong carnival season, Fat Tuesday festivities of feasting and drinking precede Ash Wednesday, traditionally the start of Lent, a period of fasting in Christian tradition in preparation for Easter Sunday. As a result, this year's Mardi Gras Day falls unusually late in the year. But the outsized culture of street parties, extravagant balls and spirited parades has evolved into a decidedly secular spectacle in the Big Easy. The day kicks off with the North Side Skull and Bone Gang, a drum-playing group which for more than 200 years has gathered before sunrise to awake neighbors in the city's historic Treme neighborhood. Across the city, renowned Black masking Indians, whose spectacular beaded and bejeweled costumes are topped with feathered head dresses, take to the streets to represent a central part of African American culture in the city dating back to the 1800s. One of the most beloved parades, the Krewe of Zulu, typically features hundreds of marching members tossing trinkets to spectators such as beads and highly coveted decorated coconuts. And the Krewe of Rex, a social club led by the honorary king of carnival season, bears the traditional colors of purple, green and gold. The festivities are also marked by enhanced security presence across the city following a devastating Jan. 1 truck attack that killed 14 people. The Department of Homeland Security upgraded Mardi Gras to its highest risk rating, leading to an influx of law enforcement agents. A zigzagging layout of barriers parallels the main parade route to guard against fast-moving vehicles and armored trucks; SWAT teams and helicopters will be present.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-to-celebrate-mardi-gras-day-with-costumes-and-revelry-despite-weather-concerns/7996336.html	2025-03-04T02:13:05-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: 37 Years after Halabja chemical attack, genocide bill remains unpassed	Despite six parliamentary terms, the Kurdistan Parliament has yet to pass a bill recognizing the 1988 chemical attack on Halabja as genocide, hindering efforts to prosecute companies and individuals who collaborated with the former Ba'ath regime. While more than 4,000 people have filed lawsuits, the absence of legal recognition has weakened their cases. Although Iraq's Supreme Criminal Court declared the attack a genocide in 2010, legal efforts in Kurdistan remain stalled. Advocates hope that a long-awaited bill, currently under parliamentary review, will finally be passed to provide justice for victims and their families.

VOA Mandarin: Who has better humanoid robots, US or China?	Chinese tech firms and state media have spotlighted humanoid robots, which have grown in popularity since the Unitree G1 appeared to run, jump, dance and perform martial arts-like movements in a recent demonstration. Both the United States and China are leaders in humanoid robot technology. But industry analysts believe that the United States is superior in AI technology, which is responsible for the robot's 'brain,' while Chinese technology companies have flourished in the hardware manufacturing capabilities of the robot's 'body.'

US reviews Columbia University contracts, grants over antisemitism allegations	WASHINGTON — The administration of President Donald Trump said on Monday it will review Columbia University's federal contracts and grants over allegations of antisemitism, which it says the educational institution has shown inaction in tackling. Rights advocates note rising antisemitism, Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias since U.S. ally Israel's devastating military assault on Gaza began after Palestinian Hamas militants' deadly October 2023 attack. The Justice Department said a month ago it formed a task force to fight antisemitism. The U.S. Departments of Health and Education and the General Services Administration jointly made the review announcement on Monday. 'The Federal Government's Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism is considering Stop Work Orders for $51.4 million in contracts between Columbia University and the Federal Government,' the joint statement said. The agencies said no contracting actions had been taken yet. 'The task force will also conduct a comprehensive review of the more than $5 billion in federal grant commitments to Columbia University.' The agencies did not respond to requests for comment on whether there were similar reviews over allegations of Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias. Columbia had no immediate comment. It previously said it made efforts to tackle antisemitism. College protests Trump has signed an executive order to combat antisemitism and pledged to deport non-citizen college students and others who took part in pro-Palestinian protests. Columbia was at the center of college protests in which demonstrators demanded an end to U.S. support for Israel due to the humanitarian crisis caused by Israel's assault on Gaza. There were allegations of antisemitism and Islamophobia in protests and counter-protests. During last summer's demonstrations around the country, classes were canceled, some university administrators resigned and student protesters were suspended and arrested. While the intensity of protests has decreased in recent months, there were some demonstrations last week in New York after the expulsion of two students at Columbia University-affiliated Barnard College and after New York Governor Kathy Hochul ordered the removal of a Palestinian studies job listing at Hunter College. A third student at Barnard College has since been expelled, this one related to the occupation of the Hamilton Hall building at Columbia last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-reviews-columbia-university-contracts-grants-over-antisemitism-allegations/7996301.html	2025-03-03T23:36:53-08:00	
How a key ingredient in Coca-Cola, M&M's is smuggled from war-torn Sudan	LONDON/DUBAI — Gum arabic, a vital ingredient used in everything from Coca-Cola to M&M's sweets, is increasingly being trafficked from rebel-held areas of war-torn Sudan, traders and industry sources say, complicating Western companies' efforts to insulate their supply chains from the conflict. Sudan produces around 80% of the world's gum arabic, a natural substance harvested from acacia trees that's widely used to mix, stabilize and thicken ingredients in mass-market products including L'Oreal lipsticks and Nestle petfood. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), at war since April 2023 with Sudan's national army, seized control late last year of the main gum-harvesting regions of Kordofan and Darfur in western Sudan. Since then the raw product, which can only be marketed by Sudanese traders in return for a fee to the RSF, is making its way to Sudan's neighbors without proper certification, according to conversations with eight producers and buyers who are directly involved in gum arabic trading or based in Sudan. The gum is also exported through informal border markets, two traders told Reuters. Asked for comment, a RSF representative said that the force had protected the gum arabic trade and only collected small fees, adding that talk of any lawbreaking was propaganda against the paramilitary group. Last month, the RSF signed a charter with allied groups establishing a parallel government in the parts of Sudan it controls. In recent months, traders in countries with lower-gum arabic production than Sudan, such as Chad and Senegal, or which barely exported it before the war, like Egypt and South Sudan, have begun to aggressively offer the commodity at cheap prices and without proof it is conflict-free, two buyers who have been approached by traders told Reuters. While the acacia trees that yield gum arabic grow across the Africa's arid Sahel region - known as the 'gum belt' - Sudan has become by far the world's biggest exporter due to its extensive groves. Herve Canevet, Global Marketing Specialist at Singapore-based supplier of speciality food ingredients Eco-Agri, said it was often difficult to determine where gum supplies are coming from as many traders would not say if their product has been smuggled. 'Today, the gum in Sudan, I would say all of it is smuggled, because there's no real authority in the country,' he said. The Association for International Promotion of Gums (AIPG), an industry lobby, said in a January 27 public statement it 'does not see any evidence of links between gum (arabic) supply chain and the competing (Sudanese) forces.' However, five industry sources said the opaque new trade in gum risked infiltrating the procurement system of global ingredients makers. Companies like Nexira, Alland & Robert, and Ingredion buy a refined version of the amber-colored gum, turn it into emulsifiers and sell it to big consumer goods firms. Contacted by Reuters, Ingredion said it works to ensure that all supply chain transactions are fully legitimate and has diversified sourcing since the start of the war to include other countries such as Cameroon. Nexira told Reuters the civil war prompted it to cut its imports from Sudan and take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of the conflict on its supply chain, including broadening sourcing to ten other countries. Alland & Robert, Nestle and Coca Cola did not comment. M&Ms maker Mars and L'Oreal did not return requests for comment. Cheap gum for sale Mohammed Hussein Sorge, founder of Khartoum-based Unity Arabic Gum, which served global ingredients makers before the war, said he was offered gum arabic in December by traders in Senegal and Chad. He said the Chad-based traders wanted $3,500 per ton for hashab gum, a more expensive variety of gum arabic primarily produced in Sudan, for which he would normally expect to pay more than $5,000 per ton. The sellers could not provide a Sedex certification, which ensures buyers a supplier meets sustainable and ethical standards, Sorge also told Reuters. Sorge did not buy the gum because he feared the low price and lack of documentation was an indication it had been stolen in Sudan or exported via informal RSF-affiliated networks. 'Smugglers manage to smuggle gum arabic through the RSF because the RSF controls all production areas,' Sorge said. Sorge, who fled to Egypt after RSF forces stole his entire gum supply in 2023, shared WhatsApp messages with Reuters showing these gum traders had reached out on five separate occasions, including as recently as Jan. 9. Since October, the RSF banned exports for 12 goods to Egypt, including gum arabic, in retaliation for what it said was Egyptian airstrikes against the militia. Asked for comment, the paramilitary said it banned what it called smuggling to Egypt because it was not benefiting Sudan. A buyer, who declined to be named for safety reasons, recounted how he also was approached by shadowy gum traders. 'I have (acacia) seyal cleaned open quantities ready for shipping,' read one WhatsApp message, reviewed by Reuters and offering a load of seyal gum, a cheaper gum arabic variety. In subsequent WhatsApp messages, the trader proposed to schedule shipping every two months at a negotiable price of $1,950 per metric ton, lower than the $3,000 per ton the buyer said he would expect to pay for this kind of load. In a different WhatsApp conversation with the same buyer, reviewed by Reuters, a different trader said that trucks carrying gum arabic had crossed the Sudanese border into South Sudan and Egypt. In all instances, the gum traders could not provide a Sedex certification, the buyer said, adding that he declined the offers for fear the gum came from RSF-affiliated networks. Changing routes Before the Sudanese civil war, the raw gum would be sorted in Khartoum and then trucked to Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, to be shipped via the Suez Canal around the world. Since late last year, however, RSF-affiliated gum arabic started to appear on sale at two informal markets on the border between the Sudanese province of West Kordofan and South Sudan, according to a buyer based in an RSF-controlled area, who declined to be named due to safety concerns. The buyer, a major trader in the West Kordofan area, said traders collect gum from Sudanese land owners and sell them to South Sudanese traders in these markets for U.S. dollars. All of this happens with RSF protection, which the traders pay for, the buyer added. Abdallah Mohamed, a producer who owns acacia groves in West Kordofan, also told Reuters the RSF takes a fee from the traders for protection. The paramilitary group has diversified its interests into gold, livestock, agriculture and banking. South Sudan Information Minister Michael Makuei, who is also the government's spokesperson, told Reuters transport of gum through South Sudan was not the government's responsibility. Calls and messages to Joseph Moum Majak, the minister of trade and industry for South Sudan, went unanswered. The RSF also takes the product to the Central African Republic through the border town of Um Dafoog, the buyer said, adding that some goes to Chad. A wholesale buyer, based outside Sudan, told Reuters the gum was now being exported through Mombasa in Kenya and South Sudan's capital Juba. Arabic gum of illicit origin has also appeared on sale online. Isam Siddig, a Sudanese gum processor who is now a refugee in Britain, told Reuters his warehouses in Khartoum had been raided by the RSF after he fled in April 2023 with three suitcases of gum in tow. A year later, his gum products appeared on sale, still in his company's branded packaging, in an online Facebook group according to a screenshot shared with Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-a-key-ingredient-in-coca-cola-m-m-s-is-smuggled-from-war-torn-sudan/7996295.html	2025-03-03T23:28:06-08:00	
S Korean lawmaker says N Korean POW wants 'normal life' in Seoul	SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean lawmaker said Tuesday that a North Korean soldier captured by Ukraine wanted to live a 'normal life' in the South, after Seoul vowed to offer citizenship to Pyongyang's troops. In January, Seoul's National Intelligence Service confirmed that the Ukrainian military had captured two of around 10,000 North Korean soldiers they estimate have been sent by Kim Jong Un to fight for Moscow in their war against Kyiv. Lawmaker Yu Yong-weon said that he was able to meet the two soldiers, who remain in Ukrainian custody at a detention facility in an undisclosed location, after submitting a request to Kyiv authorities. 'The moment I faced the two young prisoners, I was overwhelmed with emotions -- compassion, sympathy, and an innate sense of empathy,' said Yu in a press conference. One of the soldiers told him that he wanted to move to South Korea so that he could eventually reunite with his parents, Yu recounted. Yu also said that the soldier asked if he would be able to 'live as he wish with the rights I hope for' if he goes to South Korea and asked if he would be able to 'have a home and start a family there'. Under South Korea's constitution, all Koreans, including those who live in the North, are considered citizens, and officials reaffirmed last month that this would apply to any troops captured in Ukraine. Sending the soldiers back to the North would be 'essentially a death sentence,' Yu said. North Korean troops have been instructed to kill themselves rather than be captured, South Korean intelligence has said, and Yu said the soldiers told him they had witnessed multiple suicides by grenade by their injured comrades. 'Even as prisoners of war, North Korean soldiers are constitutionally recognized as South Korean citizens and must be protected accordingly,' Yu added. In 2019 the South Korean government expelled two North Korean men after investigators said the pair murdered 16 crewmates before taking their fishing boat to South Korean waters. It was the first-ever transfer from the South to the North since the end of the Korean War. However new images were released three years later showing one man desperately resisting the handover.	https://www.voanews.com/a/s-korean-lawmaker-says-n-korean-pow-wants-normal-life-in-seoul/7996293.html	2025-03-03T23:25:15-08:00	
Malaria deaths soar in shadow of Ethiopia conflict	Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — Lema Tefera's voice broke as he described losing four children to malaria in just one month — deaths that could likely have been prevented if not for the conflict in Ethiopia's Oromia region. 'There was no malaria medication and treatment in our village due to the fighting,' the farmer told AFP by phone. Africa accounts for about 95% of the 250 million malaria cases and more than 600,000 deaths across the globe each year, according to the World Health Organization. Experts say the situation is worsening in Ethiopia's most populous region, Oromia, where a conflict has been raging between the government and a rebel group -- the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) -- since 2018, severely disrupting health services. Doctors, experts, and aid workers told AFP fatal cases were surging thanks to the 'perfect storm' of climate change and violence. Subsistence farmers like Lema, a father of seven before the disease took his children, are particularly vulnerable. 'It was the worst situation I have ever experienced,' said Lema, who lives in the small western village of Lalistu Lophi. 'Supplies disrupted' Lema's family make up just four of the roughly 7.3 million malaria cases and 1,157 deaths recorded by the WHO in Ethiopia between January and October last year. The figures have doubled since 2023, and Oromia accounts for almost half the cases and deaths. The sprawling region, which covers more than a third of Ethiopia, has witnessed a collapse of health facilities, said Gemechu Biftu, executive director of the Oromia Physicians Association. 'Programmed supplies of anti-malarial drugs have been disrupted due to the armed conflict,' he said. There is no end to the fighting in sight: the government classifies the OLA a terrorist organization, and peace talks in Tanzania in 2023 failed. Legesse Bulcha, the director of the Nejo General Hospital in West Wollega, one of the worst-hit areas, said malaria cases had surged in the past three years. He said malaria accounted for 70% of the 26,000 patients his small hospital treated in 2023-2024, up from no more than 20% before that. While conflict had disrupted access to medicine, he said a changing climate was also playing a part. Experts warn warming temperatures will create more of the warmer, wetter conditions in which malaria-spreading mosquitos thrive. 'Unlike before, there are still significant numbers of cases during the dry season,' said Legesse. Gemechu agreed, noting tests had shown not only rising mortality rates but that malaria was 'expanding to new areas'. 'Perfect storm' Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Ethiopia coordinator Rachelle Seguin said 2024 saw the country's 'highest numbers of malaria cases seen, probably ever.' 'I think it's a little bit the perfect storm: you have increasing temperatures, you've had conflict in the country for years,' she said. As the next rainy season approaches in June-September, Seguin said she fears the coming year 'could be even worse.' The problem will not be helped by the sudden U.S. aid funding freeze ordered by President Donald Trump. 'The recent USAID funding cut would significantly increase morbidity and mortality not only from malaria but also from other communicable illnesses for which the agency has been providing significant funding,' Nuredin Luke, an Oromia-based doctor, told AFP. The U.S. government had previously provided some 40 % of the annual funding globally for control and research into malaria. It is unclear if this will resume. In his isolated village, thousands of miles from Washington, Lema remains struck down with sorrow. Unable to farm, he has had to rely on relatives to survive. 'I have been completely depressed,' he said. 'I have not been able to recover from the grief.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaria-deaths-soar-in-shadow-of-ethiopia-conflict-/7996289.html	2025-03-03T23:13:20-08:00	
China uses DeepSeek AI for surveillance and information attacks on US	The United States may become the second country after Australia to ban China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence on government devices. U.S. Representatives Josh Gottheimer and Darin LaHood introduced a bipartisan bill proposing the ban. In their letter to 47 U.S. governors and the mayor of Washington, the congressmen warned that DeepSeek could pose security risks to sensitive government data and cybersecurity and Americans’ privacy, NBC News reported on March 3. China denies the allegations. However, concerns highlighted by the U.S. lawmakers and state officials are not without merit, experts say. The Chinese government has reportedly also used AI models like DeepSeek for mass surveillance, including the collection of biometric data and social media listening models that report to China's security services and the military, as well as for information attacks on U.S. and Chinese dissidents abroad. At least three leading Chinese surveillance and security companies — TopSec, QAX and NetEase — announced the integration of DeepSeek to enhance their services. All three companies provide services to the Chinese government, and some made it clear that DeepSeek will improve their cyber censorship and surveillance capabilities. This includes AI-driven biometric data capturing, face recognition and surveillance technologies such as 'smart cities,' the Skynet Project, and the Xueliang Project, which can monitor all aspects of an individual's public life, Wenhao Ma of VOA’s China Division reported. In January, Canadian cybersecurity firm Feroot Security uncovered a code imbedded in DeepSeek’s login processes that shares user information with Chinese state-owned communication company China Mobile, AP reported. The Associated Press described the code as a 'heavily obfuscated computer script that when deciphered shows connections to computer infrastructure owned by China Mobile.' The U.S. banned China Mobile in 2019 following intelligence reports that it serves as the Chinese military’s spy arm. China-based actors have been using ChatGPT along with DeepSeek models to generate phishing email and disinformation attacks on the U.S. 'on behalf of unspecified clients in China,' OpenAI said in its February report. OpenAI identified and blocked a cluster of China-originated accounts involved in malicious activities, such as Qianyue Overseas Public Opinion AI Assistant, reportedly designed to ingest and analyze posts and comments related to Chinese politics and human rights from platforms such as X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram and Reddit. The purpose of the operation was reportedly 'to feed the resulting insights to the Chinese authorities' such as 'Chinese embassies abroad, and to intelligence agents monitoring protests in countries including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom,' OpenAI said. A set of ChatGPT accounts that OpenAI banned in February had been involved in Chinese influence operations focused on generating short comments in English and long-form Spanish-language articles critical of the United States published in local and national media outlets across Latin America and Spain. One of the Chinese companies planting the articles in the Spanish-language outlets was Jilin Yousen Culture Communication Co., a subsidiary of the government-tied Beijing United Publishing House. VOA reviewed nine of the Chinese AI-generated articles published in Spanish-language media between October and November 2024 as identified by OpenAI. Two — in Mexico’s El Universal and Peru’s El Popular — criticized the United States' use of sanctions targeting foreign governments and individuals. The El Universal op-ed described the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil industry for Tehran’s backing of terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah as exposing the U.S.' 'impotence' in dealing with global politics and the 'rapid decline' of its 'moral standing.' Similarly, El Popular painted U.S. sanctions on a Hamas affiliate as 'insane' and an 'attack on the rights of Palestinian people.' An article in Peru’s La Republica presented the U.S. as the biggest beneficiary of the Russian war in Ukraine, replicating the Kremlin’s key narrative. It criticized the U.S. for providing military aid to Kyiv, framing the American support as an escalation of the war. China, however, has been a key provider of military technologies and weapons to Russia, which Moscow uses in daily attacks on Ukrainian civilians. Another China-planted piece in La Republica described U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policy as 'undermining U.S. global leadership position.' Three pieces in Peru’s Wapa, El Popular and El Plural exploited the issues of homelessness, child nutrition and crime in the U.S. — all presented as extremely acute and dangerous. For example, the child nutrition piece claimed that most children in the U.S. 'go hungry on weekends and holidays' due to the government’s neglect of children’s food security. While the topics of these articles vary from human rights and social issues in the U.S. to foreign and domestic politics, they all paint a picture of a dysfunctional state with failing moral values and declining international influence, matching Beijing’s standard narrative.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-uses-deepseek-ai-for-surveillance-and-information-attacks-on-us/7996271.html	2025-03-03T21:46:14-08:00	
Trump urges Zelenskyy to ‘make a deal’ to end conflict	Europe is scrambling to take the lead in planning an end to the Ukraine conflict, and U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday paused all military aid to Ukraine after a contentious Oval Office meeting last week where he castigated Ukraine’s leader.

NGOs seek new sources of aid as traditional donors reduce funding	Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — The U.N.’s special representative on sexual violence in conflict said that when military spending goes up worldwide, it increases conflicts that mainly affect women and children. 'What we are seeing is that sexual violence is plaguing conflict, and is significantly impacting all civilians, but significantly women and girls, Pramila Patten told VOA at the International Humanitarian Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 'We should invest more in prevention. We should invest in addressing the root cause, which is marginalization, poverty, gender inequality,' she said. 'Of course, we have to respond, but I think prevention is where we should invest more.' Many humanitarian groups at the U.N. and Saudi-organized forum held in February said traditional Western donors have reduced or halted funding. In the United States, the Trump administration has moved to cut tens of billions of dollars in foreign aid, though its actions face legal challenges now winding their way through the courts. Leila Pakkala, the director of UNICEF’s supply division, said her agency is seeking $9.9 billion to help more than 109 million vulnerable children and their families. 'This year as we're looking at the humanitarian spectrum, we're looking at increased needs, whether it's in nutrition, whether it's around water and sanitation, access to health, and making sure children don't lose out on immunization,' she said. She said resources are not keeping pace with demand. 'We have increased numbers of wasting severe acute malnutrition in children around the world, whether it's in conflict and fragile context, or whether it's at the onset of rapid response emergencies, natural disasters,' she said. In southern Africa, perennial drought, floods and cyclones affect children and their families, she said. 'The needs outweigh the ability to respond,' Pakkala said. Dereje Wordofa, president of the nonprofit SOS Children's Villages International, said climate change is contributing to a general humanitarian crisis. 'The situation is worsening and particularly in eastern and southern Africa. There are more people who are affected by humanitarian crisis than any time before,' he said. 'The sheer amount of money required to bring services and goods to these affected communities is very, very high. And the international humanitarian funding is not marching to this scale and the magnitude of need.' Some groups are turning to organizations such as the Saudi-based King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief) for funding. Hana Omar, the center's director of partnerships and international relations, said KSReflief is assisting many African countries as conflicts and climate change leave more people in need. 'We remain committed to deliver our aid, to find ways to advocate for the rights of these people and to make sure that we reach those in need. There is still hope people want to solve and to find solutions for all these challenges,' Omar said. This year KSRelief organized the aid forum with the U.N. under the theme: 'Navigating the Future of Humanitarian Response' as it celebrated its 10th anniversary of humanitarian work outside the borders of Saudi Arabia.

US skating community honors colleagues who died in Washington plane crash	The U.S. skating community came together Sunday for a fundraiser and tribute to the victims of a collision between an American Airlines flight and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter on Jan. 29 over the Potomac River in Washington. Sixty-seven people, all the people on both aircraft, died in the crash, including 28 members of the U.S. figure skating community — 11 young figure skaters, four couches and 13 family members — who had been to the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas. One of the most emotional performances Sunday night was delivered by Maxim Naumov, who skated to a favorite song of his parents, Evgenia Shishkov and Vadim Naumov, who died in the crash. The two-hour Legacy on Ice event was hosted by Olympic figure skating champions Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi. They and other veteran skaters, including Scott Hamilton and Nathan Chen, also performed. The event began to take shape a week after the crash. Monumental Sports and Entertainment, organizers of the tribute, said they have so far raised $1.2 million for the victims' families and the first responders. 'We continue to be in awe of and grateful to this community, whose compassion and support was out in full force for the ‘Legacy on Ice’ event,' Monumental chairman Ted Leonsis said in a statement. He said the money raised is set to be divided among the families impacted by the collision, first responders and U.S. Figure Skating. The Associated Press reported that almost 500 first responders and approximately 150 family members of the victims were in the audience. NBC is scheduled to broadcast 'Legacy on Ice' on March 30.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-skating-community-honors-colleagues-who-died-in-washington-plane-crash/7996223.html	2025-03-03T18:50:41-08:00	
VOA Exclusive: State Department guidance distinguishes CCP from Chinese people	State Department — The United States is drawing a clear distinction between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese people, setting the tone that Washington views Beijing’s government — not the general public — as an adversary in strategic competition, according to an internal document obtained by VOA. This approach largely aligns with the State Department’s public messaging in the later years of U.S. President Donald Trump’s first administration. In recent guidance on China-related terminology, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructs U.S. embassies and consular posts to use more specific descriptors and avoid 'Chinese' as an adjective when its use could imply a negative connotation of the Chinese people, culture or language more broadly. This latest directive follows the removal of references to the Beijing government as the 'People’s Republic of China' on the State Department’s website, which now refers to the country simply as 'China' in a fact sheet. The internal document instructs the State Department to use 'CCP' in public speeches or press releases when discussing government actions, recognizing that the CCP holds ultimate authority over political, economic, military and many other decisions in the country. But when describing China’s malign actions, the document advises against using 'Chinese' as an adjective to prevent the perception that the U.S. government attributes those actions to the Chinese people, according to the memo. The U.S. is also advised to avoid using language that reflects the ideology of China’s leader Xi Jinping. Under this directive, Xi should be referred to as 'General Secretary' of the Communist Party, rather than 'President,' reflecting the supremacy of the party over the state — a practice largely in line with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s approach. In the internal guidance, Rubio reaffirmed the emphasis in the State Department’s fact sheet on U.S. policy toward China, which said the U.S. will address its relationship with China under the principles of 'reciprocity and fairness.' Additionally, the State Department should avoid characterizations previously used by former President Joe Biden’s administration, such as 'invest-align-compete' and 'responsibly managing the relationship' between the U.S. and China. In Beijing, Chinese officials have 'strongly deplored and firmly opposed' the changes in the State Department’s factsheet, accusing it of 'peddling the so-called China-U.S. strategic competition.' At a briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said China has 'lodged serious protests with the U.S.' following Rubio’s recent media interviews, which Beijing deemed as 'steeped in the Cold War mentality.' In Washington, analysts say the changes in the State Department’s policy description on its website are not unusual and often occur when a new administration takes office. 'We’re still waiting to see exactly how the [Trump] administration' casts its broader China strategy, said Brian Hart, deputy director of the China Power Project at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. However, during a Monday discussion on China hosted by CSIS, he noted that updates to official websites are common during transitions between administrations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-exclusive-state-department-guidance-distinguishes-ccp-from-chinese-people/7996193.html	2025-03-03T18:10:41-08:00

But when describing China’s malign actions, the document advises against using 'Chinese' as an adjective to prevent the perception that the U.S. government attributes those actions to the Chinese people, according to the memo. The U.S. is also advised to avoid using language that reflects the ideology of China’s leader Xi Jinping. Under this directive, Xi should be referred to as 'General Secretary' of the Communist Party, rather than 'President,' reflecting the supremacy of the party over the state — a practice largely in line with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s approach. In the internal guidance, Rubio reaffirmed the emphasis in the State Department’s fact sheet on U.S. policy toward China, which said the U.S. will address its relationship with China under the principles of 'reciprocity and fairness.' Additionally, the State Department should avoid characterizations previously used by former President Joe Biden’s administration, such as 'invest-align-compete' and 'responsibly managing the relationship' between the U.S. and China. In Beijing, Chinese officials have 'strongly deplored and firmly opposed' the changes in the State Department’s factsheet, accusing it of 'peddling the so-called China-U.S. strategic competition.' At a briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said China has 'lodged serious protests with the U.S.' following Rubio’s recent media interviews, which Beijing deemed as 'steeped in the Cold War mentality.' In Washington, analysts say the changes in the State Department’s policy description on its website are not unusual and often occur when a new administration takes office. 'We’re still waiting to see exactly how the [Trump] administration' casts its broader China strategy, said Brian Hart, deputy director of the China Power Project at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. However, during a Monday discussion on China hosted by CSIS, he noted that updates to official websites are common during transitions between administrations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-exclusive-state-department-separates-ccp-from-chinese-people-in-internal-guidance/7996193.html	2025-03-03T17:52:59-08:00	
Senate confirms education chief McMahon as Trump pushes to close department	WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Monday to confirm former wrestling executive Linda McMahon as the nation's education chief, a role that places her atop a department that President Donald Trump has vilified and vowed to dismantle. McMahon will face the competing tasks of winding down the Education Department while also escalating efforts to achieve Trump's agenda. Already the Republican president has signed sweeping orders to rid America's schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs. At the same time, Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon 'to put herself out of a job.' The Senate voted to confirm McMahon, 51-45. A billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut's state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership. McMahon's supporters see her as a skilled executive who will reform a department that Republicans say has failed to improve American education. Opponents say she's unqualified and fear her budget cuts will be felt by students nationwide. 'Americans believe in public education,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said before the confirmation vote. 'They don't want to see the Department of Education abolished. If the Trump administration follows through on cuts to education, schools will lose billions in funding.' At her confirmation hearing, McMahon distanced herself from Trump's blistering rhetoric. She said the goal is to make the Education Department 'operate more efficiently,' not to defund programs. She acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the department, and she pledged to preserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Yet she suggested some operations could move to other departments, saying Health and Human Services might be better suited to enforce disability rights laws. Weeks before McMahon's confirmation hearing, the White House was considering an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the agency as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely. Some of McMahon's allies pressed the White House to hold the order until after her confirmation to avoid potential backlash. Created by Congress in 1979, the Education Department's primary role is to disburse money to the nation's schools and colleges. It sends billions of dollars a year to K-12 schools and oversees a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio. Trump argues the department has been overtaken by liberals who press their ideology on America's schools. Schools and colleges have been navigating a demand to eliminate diversity programs or risk having their federal funding pulled. The Trump administration gave them a Feb. 28 deadline to comply. The Education Department addressed questions about its guidance in a document released Saturday, saying in part that changing program names that reference 'diversity' or 'equity' alone is not enough if they treat students differently by race. During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to close the department and grant its authority to states. Schools and states already wield significantly greater authority over education than the federal government, which is barred from influencing curriculum. Federal money makes up roughly 14% of public-school budgets. Already, the Trump administration has started overhauling much of the department's work. Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as 'woke' and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation's academic progress, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees. Some of the cuts have halted work that's ordered under federal law. At her hearing, McMahon said the agency will spend money that's directed by Congress, and she played down DOGE's cuts as merely an audit. McMahon is a longtime Trump ally who left WWE in 2009 to launch a political career, running unsuccessfully twice for the U.S. Senate. She has given millions of dollars to Trump's campaigns and served as leader of the Small Business Administration during his first term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-education-chief-mcmahon-as-trump-pushes-to-close-department-/7996197.html	2025-03-03T17:09:43-08:00	
Trump places pause on US aid to Ukraine	President Donald Trump has placed a pause on aid to Ukraine, the White House announced late Monday. 'The President has been clear that he is focused on peace,' a senior administration official told VOA. The official is not being named, as is customary when engaging with reporters. 'We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.' Earlier Monday, Trump said the Ukrainian leader’s assessment that the end of Russia’s war with his country 'is still very, very far away' is 'the worst statement' he could have made and that 'America will not put up with it for much longer!' After Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in a heated exchange in the White House last Friday, they sparred again Monday from a distance about a possible end to the conflict. Zelenskyy offered his opinion that the war was unlikely to end soon as he left London Sunday night after winning wide support from European leaders for continued military assistance for Kyiv’s forces and said he expected the same from the United States, Ukraine’s biggest arms benefactor. 'I think our relationship [with the U.S.] will continue, because it’s more than an occasional relationship,' Zelenskyy said. 'I believe that Ukraine has a strong enough partnership with the United States of America' to keep aid flowing. But Trump balked at Zelenskyy’s conclusion, saying on the Truth Social media platform Monday, 'It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S.' 'Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia,' Trump said, 'What are they thinking?' Zelenskyy later said on X, 'It is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest [as] possible.' 'We are working together with America and our European partners and very much hope for U.S. support on the path to peace,' Zelenskyy said. 'Peace is needed as soon as possible.' Trump has pushed to end the fighting, which has killed or wounded several hundred thousand Russian and Ukrainian fighters, along with Ukrainian civilians, but Zelenskyy has expressed fears that Trump is attempting to settle the conflict on terms more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. Russia currently holds about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory and has been slowly capturing more land in fighting in eastern Ukraine. No peace negotiations have been scheduled. Zelenskyy also said Sunday his country remained ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the U.S., and that he believes he can salvage relations with Trump. The two sides were expected to sign an agreement last week during Zelenskyy’s visit, but the arrangement fell apart after the heated exchanges with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. Zelenskyy said Sunday that Ukraine counts on U.S. aid in its fight against Russia’s three-year-old invasion. 'I think stopping such assistance will only help [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,' Zelenskyy said. 'And because of that, I think that the United States and representatives of the civilized world, leaders of this world, definitely won't help Putin.' Trump cast Zelenskyy as ungrateful during their Friday meeting and had sought the minerals deal to reimburse the United States for the billions of dollars in aid it has provided to Ukraine. Trump has promoted the need to end the war and has held a phone call with Putin in addition to senior U.S. officials meeting with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia to discuss the first stages of a potential peace deal without Ukrainian officials involved in the talks. Trump said Sunday on Truth Social: 'We should spend less time worrying about Putin, and more time worrying about migrant rape gangs, drug lords, murderers, and people from mental institutions entering our Country - So that we don't end up like Europe!' But after seeing Zelenskyy’s comment about peace prospects, Trump quickly pivoted back to assailing the Ukrainian leader. That followed the talks Sunday in London during which British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told 18 allies that with the United States wavering in its support for Ukraine, Europe finds itself 'at a crossroads in history.' The British leader said that with no guarantee of U.S. involvement to act as a backup military support for would-be peacekeeping forces, 'Europe must do the heavy lifting' in securing peace in Ukraine. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, told reporters Monday, 'We welcome the Europeans taking a lead in European security. ... They have to invest in the capability to do that. They've certainly shown a will.' But Waltz said White House officials remain perplexed why the U.S.-Ukraine minerals mining deal fell apart, saying Zelenskyy 'could have been left with an economic guarantee that would have benefited Ukraine, and I think the world, for a generation. So, it's really confounding to us why we had kind of such hostility coming in.' Unlike in Washington, Zelenskyy was warmly embraced at the summit by many of the European heads of state, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and NATO chief Mark Rutte. Zelenskyy supporters rallied outside Starmer’s residence in support of Ukraine. As the leaders gathered Sunday, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned, 'We urgently have to rearm Europe' and 'prepare for the worst' on the continent. Starmer, when he first greeted Zelenskyy on Saturday, unveiled a $2.84 billion loan agreement to support Ukraine's defense capabilities, to be paid back with the profits of immobilized sovereign Russian assets. Starmer said Britain, France and Ukraine have agreed to work on a ceasefire plan to present to the United States. The Kremlin said in remarks aired Sunday that the United States' dramatic shift in Europe foreign policy toward Russia is largely aligned with Moscow's vision. 'The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state television that was recorded last Wednesday. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-places-pause-on-us-aid-to-ukraine-/7994831.html	2025-03-03T17:07:33-08:00	
State Department separates CCP from Chinese people in internal guidance	State Department — The United States is drawing a clear distinction between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese people, setting the tone that Washington views Beijing’s government — not the general public — as an adversary in strategic competition, according to an internal document obtained by VOA. This approach largely aligns with the State Department’s public messaging in the later years of U.S. President Donald Trump’s first administration. In recent guidance on China-related terminology, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructs U.S. embassies and consular posts to use more specific descriptors and avoid 'Chinese' as an adjective when its use could imply a negative connotation of the Chinese people, culture or language more broadly. This latest directive follows the removal of references to the Beijing government as the 'People’s Republic of China' on the State Department’s website, which now refers to the country simply as 'China' in a fact sheet. The internal document instructs the State Department to use 'CCP' in public speeches or press releases when discussing government actions, recognizing that the CCP holds ultimate authority over political, economic, military and many other decisions in the country. But when describing China’s malign actions, the document advises against using 'Chinese' as an adjective to prevent the perception that the U.S. government attributes those actions to the Chinese people, according to the memo. The U.S. is also advised to avoid using language that reflects the ideology of China’s leader Xi Jinping.

King Charles meets with Trudeau amid Trump's annexation comments	London — Britain's King Charles III welcomed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday as the monarch faces criticism in Canada over being silent about U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor. While royal officials did not provide details about the private talks at the monarch’s royal residence Sandringham, the king and Trudeau were expected to discuss Trump’s comments that Canada should become the 51st state. Charles is the head of state in Canada, a member of the Commonwealth group of many former British colonies and territories. Trudeau said Sunday, 'nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation.' Britain’s monarchs must remain politically neutral, but the Canada issue shows how delicate that balancing act can be. 'The Government of Canada should ask the Head of State to underscore Canadian sovereignty,' former Alberta Premier Jason Kenney posted on X. Trudeau flew to London to join an emergency defense summit on Ukraine over the weekend, where British Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined plans to end the war in Ukraine and rallied European counterparts to throw their weight behind the country as U.S. backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy. The king's meeting with the Canadian leader came after Charles met Sunday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to show solidarity with Ukraine after Trump lashed out at Zelenskyy in a heated exchange in the Oval Office. Starmer told lawmakers Monday he held talks with Trudeau over the weekend and was 'able to assure him of our strong support for Canada.' Meanwhile, Charles has invited Trump to come for a state visit. Starmer delivered that invitation to Trump in Washington last week, noting it was an 'unprecedented' honor since Trump already had been given the royal treatment by Queen Elizabeth II during his first term. Starmer insisted to lawmakers Monday that the U.S. and Britain have 'the closest of relationships,' and that it would be 'a huge mistake at a time like this to suggest that any weakening of that link is the way forward for security and defense in Europe.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/king-charles-meets-with-trudeau-amid-trump-s-annexation-comments/7996183.html	2025-03-03T16:46:11-08:00	
Forest fire damages dozens of homes, causes evacuations in Japan	TOKYO — Japan is fighting a forest fire that has damaged dozens of homes and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate in a northeastern coastal city. The fire has burned about 2,100 hectares (5,190 acres) of forest in Ofunato since it started Wednesday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. The agency said at least 84 homes have been damaged, and over 1,200 people evacuated. The fire has subsided in some areas. More than 2,000 troops and firefighters have been deployed from across the country. A man was found dead on a road Thursday, and authorities are examining if the death was linked to the fire, the agency said. The northeastern regions, including Ofunato, have had their driest winter since 1946, when the Japan Meteorological Agency started collecting data.	https://www.voanews.com/a/forest-fire-damages-dozens-of-homes-causes-evacuations-in-japan-/7996166.html	2025-03-03T16:31:25-08:00	
Street vendors supply thirsty revelers at Rio's Carnival, but face pushback as their numbers grow	RIO DE JANEIRO — Sweat streamed down Talita Ferreira Sanches’ face as she pushed a cart loaded with beer and water up the winding, cobblestone streets in Rio de Janeiro last month, calling out to glitter-covered revelers decked out in fishnet tights. The 22-year-old from an area outside Rio had spent the night sleeping on a street in the bohemian neighborhood Santa Teresa, covering herself with just a sheet, so she could arrive in time for the early-morning Carnival party 'Heaven on Earth.' 'Carnival represents a lot of joy and all the money that we make,' said Ferreira Sanches, who has worked as a street vendor for the last four years. She makes around 1,500 reais ($260) a day during Carnival — about the same as the country's monthly minimum wage. 'Every year, we have an objective. Last year we bought a fridge and a television, this year we want to buy a wardrobe and a stove,' she said, pocketing cash with one hand while dishing out ice-cold drinks with the other. Like musicians and stilt walkers, vendors are a fixture at Rio's street parties. Known in Portuguese as 'ambulantes' or 'camelos,' they scour Instagram pages for times and locations, coordinate on WhatsApp groups, then race across parks and up hills, from Rio’s downtown to Copacabana beach, all to place themselves and their carts in the thronging crush of thousands — or hundreds of thousands — of thirsty revelers. An economic lifeline Peddlers provide much-needed party fuel and hydration, and can themselves partake in the buzzing, joyous atmosphere. More than that, though, it's an economic lifeline, allowing them to pay off debts, buy presents for their kids and set them up for the rest of the year. But as opportunity to cash in has grown, more and more vendors have joined the rush — and drawn pushback. There are nearly 500 registered street parties this year, and hundreds more unofficial ones, considerably more than the pre-pandemic era, and they all need cold beer and water. Rio’s City Hall conducted a lottery for 15,000 authorized vendors at this year’s Carnival — 5,000 more than last year, but observers say there are far more vendors than spots. Selling without a permit renders them vulnerable to harassment, seizure of their merchandise and even violence from Rio’s municipal guard, according to the United Street Vendors' Movement — known by its acronym MUCA. The ballooning number of vendors in recent years has created tensions with party organizers, said Pericles Monteiro, the director of Heaven on Earth, which he founded in 2001. Party facilitators and revelers have accused hawkers of blockading the procession by setting up shop in the middle of its path with their heavy carts. 'We couldn’t walk, we felt suffocated,' Monteiro said of Heaven on Earth's procession two years ago. The group didn’t get to the square where the show was supposed to end on time, and had to walk almost in silence until reaching the designated area. When they got there, peddlers had barbecues fired up and vans parked in the street, leaving little room for performers, musicians or revelers. 'We support street vendors. People have to work and they have an important role. We are aware of that. But the way it has been done, the intensity — there really has been a serious problem hindering the party’s development,' Monteiro added. ‘Mess with harmony’ Vendors are aware of the grievances, and the impact on their reputation. This year, the union SindInformal and other groups launched a campaign to promote respect, proper organization and security during Carnival, and recommended buying from vendors surrounding the party rather than in the middle of the mayhem. Fear of repercussions and clashes also prompted MUCA to produce a manifesto this year calling for 'mess with harmony.' The document said criticism and attacks targeting vendors spark backlash against an already marginalized community. 'Vendors are seen as dangerous, as tarnishing the city’s reputation, as causing public disorder,' said Flavia Magalhaes, who researches street sellers at the Paulista University in Sao Paulo. 'But vendors sustain a festive street culture that is very important for the city’s tourism.' They also face dire working conditions, struggling to access toilets, working long hours without stopping for food and struggling to find a legal place to leave their merchandise, according to a 2019 report by MUCA and Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. They often spend hours on public transport each day trekking into the city from the poor periphery. Carnival daycare center During Carnival, being based in the city center is a game-changer, said Maria de Lourdes do Carmo, 50, known as Maria of the Street Vendors. Do Carmo has been a vendor for three decades, often hawking caipirinhas to foreign tourists in Santa Teresa's cobblestone hills; the municipal guard doesn't tend to crackdown up there, she said. She ran for a city council seat in last year’s election to fight for greater respect for her peers but lost. Since last year, Rio state's public prosecutors have been leading discussions on preventing violence against itinerant workers while also trying to tackle the municipality's failure to better organize their activity, for example by providing sanctioned deposits for their goods. And City Hall this year is attending to a long-standing demand, including by vendors' rights group Women for Women Providencia, for childcare services. Authorities will provide a daycare center for vendors’ children during street parties and samba schools’ parades, with food, cultural activities and games, Rio’s department of social assistance said in an email. For Debora Silva Pereira, 42, enduring the long, exhausting days away from her family is worth it, firstly because Carnival buoys her family's income. On a good day, she makes 3,000 reais — what she normally earns in 10 days during the rest of the year, selling women's clothing. But she also enjoys the mixture of work and play. 'We meet people and make friends. The money makes it worth it, but experiences even more so,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/street-vendors-supply-thirsty-revelers-at-rio-s-carnival-but-face-pushback-as-their-numbers-grow-/7996148.html	2025-03-03T16:15:41-08:00	
Trump’s first address to Congress in five years will focus on key foreign, domestic policy issues	U.S. President Donald Trump will address Congress Tuesday night, capping some of the most consequential first weeks of any U.S. presidency. Usually known as the State of the Union in non-inauguration years, the address will provide Trump with a public stage to lay out his vision for the U.S. economy and immigration policy, and allow him to defend recent controversial decisions to cut the federal workforce and confront Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But the most pressing challenge for Trump will be to unite Republican majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives to pass a budget funding the government past a March 14 deadline. Republicans differ on whether to cut popular social safety net programs such Medicaid, which provides health insurance to those with low incomes, to pay down the U.S. debt and pay for an extension of the 2017 tax cuts passed during Trump’s first term. Trump has called for 'one big, beautiful bill' to fund his domestic policy agenda. 'We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver the America First agenda,' Johnson told reporters last week. 'We’re going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it.' Congressional Democrats have criticized the budget for benefiting the wealthy. 'Make no mistake, it will rob seniors, kids and the disabled to pay for the rich to get richer,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said last week. Trump will also likely speak about the rationale behind the U.S. imposing tariffs on other countries. He confirmed that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday. 'They're going to have to have a tariff,' Trump told reporters Monday. 'So, what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.' But one analyst told VOA that was unlikely. 'Probably what's going to happen is most manufacturers are going to just move to other countries where the tariffs are not imposed, or they will just move,' said Shannon Bow O’Brien, associate professor of instruction at the University of Texas at Austin. 'They will ship it [business] to other places, and then ship it to those here to try to avoid tariffs. Or we're going to see other countries making it even cheaper, so then when the tariffs are imposed, the price is going to stay. I don't believe it's going to achieve what he wants, which is to have manufacturing come back to the United States or concede to certain issues,' O’Brien said. Trump’s first weeks in office were also marked by executive orders addressing one of the key issues of his campaign: immigration reform. He is expected to highlight changes to the security of the U.S. southern border with Mexico in his speech Tuesday. He could also address the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk. While domestic issues are traditionally the focus of presidential addresses to Congress, several pressing foreign policy challenges are likely to come up in Trump’s speech. Trump told reporters after his Oval Office confrontation last Friday with Zelenskyy that he does not feel Ukraine has sufficiently acknowledged the United States’ nearly $200 billion contribution to the conflict that began when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Trump is also expected to address the ceasefire in Gaza and his plans for real estate development in the conflict-ridden region. Senator and former CIA analyst Elissa Slotkin will deliver the Democratic response to Trump’s address. Slotkin won the swing state of Michigan by focusing on the economy in her outreach to voters. VOA's Kim Lewis contributed to this story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-first-address-to-congress-in-five-years-will-focus-on-key-foreign-domestic-policy-issues/7996155.html	2025-03-03T16:11:05-08:00	
East Congo rebels abduct at least 130 hospital patients, UN says	GENEVA — M23 rebels launching an offensive in east Congo abducted at least 130 sick and wounded men from two hospitals in the city of Goma last week, the United Nations said Monday. M23 fighters raided CBCA Ndosho Hospital and Heal Africa Hospital during the night of Feb. 28, taking 116 and 15 patients respectively, U.N. Human Rights Office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said in a statement. The abducted men were suspected of being Democratic Republic of Congo soldiers or members of a pro-government militia known as Wazalendo. 'It is deeply distressing that M23 is snatching patients from hospital beds in coordinated raids and holding them incommunicado in undisclosed locations,' Shamdasani said, calling for their immediate release. M23 spokespersons Willy Ngoma and Lawrence Kanyuka Kingston did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Tutsi-led M23 marched into the city of Goma at the end of January and have since made an unprecedented advance into east Congo, seizing territory and gaining access to valuable minerals. Their ongoing advance, which started in late December, is already the gravest escalation a long-running conflict rooted in the spill over into Congo of Rwanda's 1994 genocide and the struggle for control of Congo's vast mineral resources. Congo, U.N. experts and Western powers accuse Rwanda of backing the group. Rwanda denies this and says it is defending itself against ethnic Hutu-led militias bent on slaughtering Tutsis in Congo and threatening Rwanda. About 7,000 people have been killed in east Congo since January and almost half a million people were left without shelter after 90 displacement camps were destroyed in the fighting, according to the government. International sanctions, renewed investigations by the International Criminal Court and Africa-led peace negotiations have failed to halt the advance by the rebels, who have captured east Congo's two major cities, Goma and Bukavu.	https://www.voanews.com/a/east-congo-rebels-abduct-at-least-130-hospital-patients-un-says/7995900.html	2025-03-03T15:30:49-08:00	
Lighter winds help crews fighting wildfires in South and North Carolina	Lighter winds Monday helped crews in South Carolina and North Carolina battle wildfires that caused evacuations and threatened hundreds of homes over the weekend. Hundreds of firefighters from across the state managed to keep the massive blaze in Horry County near Myrtle Beach from destroying any homes despite social media videos of orange skies at night and flames engulfing pine trees just yards away. The fire burned 6.5 square kilometers (2.5 square miles). It was the biggest fire in the area since a 2009 wildfire nearby did $42 million in damage and burned down about 75 homes. The danger wasn't over Monday. Officials in all of South Carolina banned almost all outdoor fires, including burning yard debris and campfires. They told residents to call 911 if they see a neighbor setting a fire. 'You can and will go to jail for starting a fire outdoors in South Carolina. Period,' Gov. Henry McMaster wrote on social media. Burn bans were also in place in western North Carolina. Some residents in Polk County remained evacuated from their homes as fire crews Monday morning set their own blazes to burn possible wildfire fuel to make it easier to contain a 480-acre (190-hectare) fire that was about 30% contained. Polk County is on the fringes of an area badly hit by Hurricane Helene last year. Fallen trees that have not been cleared are increasing the risk of fires across the region. In eastern North Carolina, nearly 80 mostly small wildfires were reported in Robeson County. Emergency officials said 15 structures were damaged, but they did not give specifics on the types of buildings. The North Carolina Forest Service reported more than 200 wildfires across the state Monday, although almost all of them were small and not threatening any structures. Officials across the Carolinas warned of poor air quality because of smoke. A drier-than-normal winter across the Carolinas combined over the weekend with high winds as a cold front without the usual rain that accompanies the weather systems in the South moved through the area to increase the fire danger. The area near Myrtle Beach is one of the most dangerous for wildfires in South Carolina as hundreds of years of decomposing vegetation creates peat, which when it dries out can burn for a long time. Pine trees and other waxy vegetation provide fuel for fires to rapidly spread in dry, windy conditions. Horry County’s population has doubled to 400,000 people over the past 25 years. Many of those newcomers have moved into neighborhoods being rapidly built right next to the oval Carolina Bays where the peat and flammable vegetation all grow together.

Dow drops nearly 650 points on worries tariffs will slow economy	NEW YORK — U.S. stocks tumbled Monday and wiped out even more of their gains since President Donald Trump's election in November, after he said that tariffs announced earlier on Canada and Mexico would take effect within hours. The S&P 500 dropped 1.8% after Trump said there was 'no room left' for negotiations that could lower the tariffs set to begin Tuesday for imports from Canada and Mexico. Trump had already delayed the tariffs once before to allow more time for talks. Trump's announcement dashed hopes on Wall Street that he would choose a less painful path for global trade, and it followed the latest warning signal on the U.S. economy's strength. Monday's loss shaved the S&P 500's gain since Election Day down to just over 1% from a peak of more than 6%. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies from Trump that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 649 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite slumped 2.6%. Monday's slide punctuated a rocky couple of weeks for Wall Street. After the S&P 500 set a record last month following a parade of fatter-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies, the market began diving following weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, including a couple showing U.S. households are getting much more pessimistic about inflation because of the threat of tariffs. The latest such report arrived Monday on U.S. manufacturing. Overall activity is still growing, but not by quite as much as economists had forecast. Perhaps more discouragingly, manufacturers are seeing a contraction in new orders. Prices, meanwhile, rose amid discussions about who will pay for Trump's tariffs. 'Demand eased, production stabilized, and de-staffing continued as panelists' companies experience the first operational shock of the new administration's tariff policy,' said Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing business survey committee. The hope on Wall Street had been that Trump was using the threat of tariffs as a tool for negotiations and that he would ultimately go through with potentially less damaging policies for the global economy and trade. But Trump's going forward with the Mexican and Canadian tariffs hit a market that wasn't certain about what would happen next. The market's recent slump has hit Nvidia and some other formerly high-flying areas of the market particularly hard. They fell even more Monday, with Nvidia down 8.8% and Elon Musk's Tesla down 2.8%. Wall Street's blue Monday even pulled down stocks of companies enmeshed in the cryptocurrency economy, which had risen strongly in the morning. They initially bounced after Trump said over the weekend that his administration was moving forward with a crypto strategic reserve. But MicroStrategy, the company that's now known as Strategy and has been raising money to buy bitcoin, slid to a loss of 1.8%. Coinbase, the crypto trading platform, fell 4.6%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 104.78 points to 5,849.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 649.67 to 43,191.24, and the Nasdaq composite slumped 497.09 to 18,350.19. Across the Pacific in China, manufacturers reported an uptick in orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs and a Chinese state media report said that Beijing was considering ways to retaliate. Trump had imposed a tariff of 10% on imports from China, and that's scheduled to rise to 20% beginning Tuesday. He also ended the 'de minimis' loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs. In Hong Kong, Chinese bubble tea chain Mixue Bingcheng's stock soared 43% following its $444 million debut on the market. The company claims to be the world's largest food retail chain, with more than 45,000 outlets, and its jump came as the Hang Seng index rose 0.3%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dow-drops-nearly-650-points-on-worries-tariffs-will-slow-economy-/7995891.html	2025-03-03T15:00:24-08:00	
Trump says 25% Canada, Mexico tariffs to take effect on Tuesday	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that there was no chance for Mexico or Canada to prevent 25% tariffs from taking effect on Tuesday, sending financial markets reeling on the prospect of new economic barriers in North America. 'They're going to have to have a tariff. So, what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they no tariffs,' Trump said at the White House. He said there was 'no room left' for a deal that would avert the tariffs by curbing fentanyl flows into the United States. Trump also said reciprocal tariffs would take effect on April 2 on countries that impose duties on U.S. products. U.S. stock indexes extended their losses after Trump's comments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.58% for the day, the S&P 500 was down 1.78% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.47%. CEOs and economists say the action, covering more than $900 billion worth of annual U.S. imports from its southern and northern neighbors would deal a serious setback to the highly integrated North American economy. The tariffs are scheduled to take effect at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT) on Tuesday. At that point Canada and Mexico would face tariffs of 25%, with 10% for Canadian energy. Mexican officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters that Ottawa would be ready to respond. 'There's a level of unpredictability and chaos that comes out of the Oval Office, and we will be dealing with it,' she said. Speaking on CNN, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said both countries had made progress on border security but needed to do more to curb fentanyl flows into the U.S. to reduce deaths from the opioid drug. Trump is also expected on Tuesday to raise fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% from 10% currently, unless Beijing ends fentanyl trafficking into the U.S. Lutnick did not mention any potential changes to these duties, which would affect about $439 billion worth of annual imports. Mexico's response plans Mexico, after avoiding the first round of Trump's tariffs by striking a last-minute deal to send thousands of troops to its northern border, has stepped up anti-drug efforts and hinted at new measures on imported Chinese goods. President Claudia Sheinbaum, in a press conference on Monday before Trump made his remarks, said her government was calm as it awaited Trump's decision, but that Mexico but will respond if tariffs are imposed. 'We have a plan B, C, D,' Sheinbaum said, without giving any details. She added that coordination with the U.S. on trade and fentanyl trafficking has been 'very good.' According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 72,776 people died from synthetic opioids in 2023 in the U.S., chiefly from fentanyl. Navarro: Trump unwavering White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday that the inflationary impact from any tariffs would be 'second-order small, so I don't see the president wavering on any of this, because he knows in order to get to a world in which America is strong and prosperous, with real wages going up and [more] factory jobs. This is the path that he's chosen.' Trump on Saturday added another trade action to a cascade of tariff announcements over the past month, opening a national security investigation into imports of lumber and wood products that could result in steep tariffs. Canada, already facing 14.5% U.S. tariffs on softwood lumber, would be hit particularly hard. During the prior week Trump ordered the revival of a tariff probe on countries that levy digital services taxes, proposed fees of up to $1.5 million every time a Chinese-built ship enters a U.S. port, and launched a new tariff investigation into copper imports. These come in addition to his plans to determine higher U.S. 'reciprocal tariffs' to match the tariff rates of other countries and offset their other trade barriers, a move that could hit the European Union hard over the value added taxes charged by EU countries. But Trump's 'tariffs on steroids' agenda may keep inflation higher and could tip the global economy into recession, warned Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Package orders The White House late on Sunday issued technical orders from Trump related to tariffs on Mexico and Canada, declaring that low-value packages from the two countries cannot enter the U.S. duty-free under the 'de minimis' exemption for shipments under $800. The ban will take effect once the Commerce Department determines that adequate screening measures take place, the order said. Trump on Feb. 4 suspended the de minimis exclusion for low-value Chinese packages, but the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency had to pause the suspension because packages were piling up at U.S. airports without a way to screen them. Fentanyl traffickers have exploited the de minimis package exemption to ship fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S., and officials say the packages often enter unscreened.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-25-canada-mexico-tariffs-to-take-effect-on-tuesday-/7995864.html	2025-03-03T14:43:03-08:00	
TikTok’s sponsorship of UK Muslim event sparks criticism	Washington — An event celebrating Muslim Heritage month in the U.K. on March 11, sponsored by TikTok, is being criticized by Uyghur rights activists. The event’s organizer, Muslim Women’s Network UK, sent out an invitation that stated 'The event will bring together interfaith organizations, content creators and parliamentarians to celebrate the cultural contribution of Muslims in the UK.' Exiled Uyghurs concerned about the sponsorship accuse TikTok of restricting content on human rights abuses in China against the mostly Muslim Uyghurs. Uyghur activists express concern 'I do not believe [Muslim Women’s Network UK] supports violence and genocide, but its cooperation with TikTok sends a deeply troubling message,' Nefise Oguz, an Istanbul University student, told VOA in an email. Oguz has used social media — including TikTok — to advocate for relatives detained in China. She accuses TikTok’s parent company, China-based ByteDance, of systematically censoring content about Uyghurs. In China, TikTok operates as Douyin, where content is heavily controlled, she said. Oguz and other activists claim that posts about Islam, Uyghur identity, or criticism of the Chinese Communist Party are routinely blocked on both TikTok and Douyin. Due to these restrictions, Oguz said she also cannot use Douyin’s direct communication function to contact relatives in China. For years, she had been advocating for her uncle, Alim Abdulkerim, who she says was imprisoned for eight years. His family does not know why he is in detention, but Oguz believes it’s because he contacted her while she was in Turkey. Her TikTok videos about his detention attracted hundreds of thousands of views, raising awareness — but also drew censorship. The United Nations Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention released a report in September 2024, that said Abdulkerim’s imprisonment was arbitrary and demanded his release. It further described China’s internment facilities as 'prison-like.' Oguz filmed a vlog about the report at the U.N. office in Istanbul, but TikTok removed it on the same day. She appealed TikTok’s decision, but the platform rejected it. TikTok’s notification said, 'This video violates our community guidelines.' Then in October, Oguz posted a video where she debated Turkish politician Doğu Perinçek — who denied Uyghur rights abuses in China. The video went viral on Instagram, Facebook, and X but was again, removed from TikTok on the same day without explanation or reinstatement. Oguz described this as part of a broader pattern of censorship, saying her reach on the platform significantly declined afterward, limiting her advocacy efforts. TikTok denies censorship allegations Nicholas Smith, from TikTok’s Communications team told VOA, 'It’s inaccurate to suggest that TikTok censors content related to the alleged Uyghur genocide and broader human rights violations in China,' he said. 'If you search for Uyghur content on TikTok, you will find many videos where people freely post and share their views,' he added and referred to the platform’s Community Guidelines and Transparency Center for further details. Human rights accusations The U.S. and U.N. have both condemned China’s treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. In January 2021, the U.S. officially designated China’s actions — mass arbitrary detention, forced labor, forced sterilizations, and cultural and religious repression — as genocide and crimes against humanity. The designation cited a systematic campaign to suppress the predominantly Muslim, Turkic-speaking population. A 2022 U.N. report reached similar conclusions, stating that the scale of arbitrary detentions, torture, sexual violence, and restrictions on religious and cultural practices in Xinjiang may constitute crimes against humanity. China has repeatedly denied the allegations, claiming its policies in Xinjiang aim to counter terrorism, extremism, and separatism. However, a report released last August by the U.S.-based Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) titled, The CCP’s Digital Charm Offensive, suggested TikTok suppresses content, China deems sensitive, such as Uyghurs, Tibet, and Taiwan. The NCRI report highlighted TikTok’s algorithmic behavior, noting that 'content associated with politically sensitive terms like ‘Uyghur’ … showed significantly lower engagement metrics,' when compared to similar content posted on U.S.-based social media platforms, such as YouTube and Instagram. Uyghur scholar calls for ethical sponsorship Rizwangul NurMuhammad, a Uyghur doctoral candidate at the University of Sheffield, urged the Muslim Women’s Network UK to reconsider its sponsorship deal with TikTok, warning that the partnership risks further marginalizing Uyghurs. VOA obtained a letter NurMuhammad sent to Shaista Gohir, the network’s chief executive director, that said TikTok is censoring Uyghur content while operating under a legal framework that aligns with the Chinese government’s interests. 'By focusing solely on amplifying selected voices while excluding those of Uyghurs, the Network risks further marginalizing an already vulnerable community,' she wrote. She urged the network to sever ties, offering to help find alternative funding. 'Millions of Uyghurs have been arbitrarily detained, forcibly disappeared, like my brother Maiwulani, and stripped of their religious identity,' NurMuhammad wrote. 'Many of us in the diaspora, including myself, live in exile with no answers, no closure, only enforced silence by the same Chinese state that controls TikTok.' Muslim Women’s Network UK responds In a statement, Gohir acknowledged the 'pain and hardship' of Uyghurs and the 'systematic erasure of their Islamic identity,' calling it a 'grave human rights issue' deserving global focus. But she defended the TikTok partnership. 'Muslim Heritage Month is designed to celebrate the rich and diverse contributions of Muslims in the UK and to create a space for engagement, empowerment, and visibility.' Gohir said many marginalized Muslims use TikTok as a platform to share their stories, raise awareness about discrimination, and foster connections, suggesting the event could encourage 'greater conversations on freedom of expression,' regarding marginalized Muslim communities around the globe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-s-sponsorship-of-uk-muslim-event-sparks-criticism/7995854.html	2025-03-03T14:13:27-08:00	
Trump, Taiwanese chipmaker announce new $100 billion plan to build five new US factories	WASHINGTON — Chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. announced on Monday plans to make an additional $100 billion investment in the United States and build five additional chips factories in the coming years. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei announced the plan in a meeting at the White House with President Donald Trump. 'We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here,' Trump said. 'It's a matter of national security for us.' TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is a leading supplier to major U.S. hardware manufacturers. The $100 billion outlay, which would boost domestic production and make the United States less reliant on semiconductors made in Asia, is in addition to a major prior investment announcement. TSMC agreed in April to expand its planned U.S. investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona factory by 2030. With his Nov. 5 election victory largely driven by voters' economic concerns, Trump has stepped up efforts to bolster investments in domestic industries to create jobs. The TSMC announcement is the latest in a string of such developments. In February, Apple said it would invest $500 billion in the next four years. Emirati billionaire Hussain Sajwani and SoftBank also have promised multibillion-dollar investments in the U.S. TSMC said on Monday it looks 'forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers.' The U.S. Commerce Department under then President Joe Biden finalized a $6.6 billion government subsidy in November for TSMC's U.S. unit for semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona. Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act legislation in 2022 to provide $52.7 billion in subsidies for American semiconductor production and research. Taiwan's dominant position as a maker of chips used in technology from cellphones and cars to fighter jets has sparked concerns of over-reliance on the island, especially as China ramps up pressure to assert its sovereignty claims. China claims Taiwan as its territory, but the democratically elected government in Taipei rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims. Under Biden, the Commerce Department convinced all five leading-edge semiconductor firms to locate factories in the U.S. as part of the program to address national security risks from imported chips. Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told lawmakers last month that the program was 'an excellent down payment' to rebuild the sector, but he has declined to commit grants that have already been approved by the department, saying he wanted to 'read them and analyze them and understand them.' A TSMC spokesperson said last month the company had received $1.5 billion in CHIPS Act money before the new administration came in as per the milestone terms of its agreement. TSMC last year agreed to produce the world's most advanced 2-nanometer technology at its second Arizona factory expected to begin production in 2028. TSMC also agreed to use its most advanced chip manufacturing technology called 'A16' in Arizona. TSMC has already begun producing advanced 4-nanometer chips for U.S. customers in Arizona. The TSMC award included up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taiwanese-chipmaker-announce-new-100-billion-plan-to-build-five-new-us-factories-/7995845.html	2025-03-03T13:51:16-08:00	
Humanitarians fearful for Gaza as Israel halts aid deliveries	United Nations — The U.N. children’s agency warned Monday that Israel’s decision to stop allowing the entry of all humanitarian aid except water into the Gaza Strip will quickly lead to 'devastating consequences for children and families' who are struggling to survive. 'The aid restrictions announced yesterday will severely compromise lifesaving operations for civilians,' said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. 'It is imperative that the ceasefire — a critical lifeline for children — remains in place, and that aid is allowed to flow freely so we can continue to scale up the humanitarian response.' The first phase of the ceasefire expired Saturday, and Israel and U.S.-designated terror group Hamas have been at odds about what the second phase will look like. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said U.S. Middle East envoy Steven Witcoff had proposed extending the ceasefire until April 20 — which would encompass both the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday. During that period, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest once a deal is reach on a permanent ceasefire. 'I accepted this plan. But so far, Hamas has rejected it,' Netanyahu said in his video message. He then said his government would stop allowing goods and supplies into Gaza, accusing Hamas of stealing them and preventing Palestinians from accessing them. 'It uses these supplies to finance its terror machine, which is aimed directly at Israel and our civilians — and this we cannot accept,' Netanyahu said in a video statement. 'We will take further steps if Hamas continues to hold our hostages. And throughout this, Israel knows that America and President Trump have our back.' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in response to reporters’ questions Monday that his colleagues on that ground have not reported such incidents. 'What we have seen since the ceasefire is a much freer and more direct flow of aid, and we have not seen any of the looting that we had seen prior to the ceasefire,' he said. Dujarric noted that since Sunday, three major crossing points for aid trucks into Gaza have been closed and already the price of flour and vegetables have increased more than a hundred-fold. Aid organizations have criticized Israel’s decision to stop the aid. 'Humanitarian aid is not a privilege — it is a right,' said Angelita Caredda, Norwegian Refugee Council’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. 'People in Gaza are already facing desperate conditions. With food supplies running out, hospitals unable to function, and families struggling to find clean water, any restrictions on aid will push the civilian population beyond collapse.' 'Israel’s decision, to block aid to over two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as Ramadan begins, is a reckless act of collective punishment, explicitly prohibited under international humanitarian law,' British charity Oxfam said in a statement. 'The government of Israel, as [the] occupying power has the responsibility to ensure that humanitarian aid can reach the population in Gaza.' The families of hostages held by Hamas have also expressed concern that the ceasefire is in jeopardy and their loved ones are running out of time. Ilay David, brother of hostage Evyatar David, thanked President Donald Trump for his role in getting dozens of hostages freed since taking office. 'Your powerful demands for all hostages to be released gave us something we have been desperate for — hope. Now, we need you to finish this,' he said in a video statement Sunday. 'President Trump, bring us a better deal, a safer deal. No stages, no phases. One deal to bring everyone home.' Hamas is believed to be holding 59 hostages, of whom 35 are still believed to be alive. During the first phase of the expected three-phase ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that ran from January 19 until Saturday, Israel allowed humanitarians to scale up aid deliveries to Gaza. International hunger experts had warned that without urgent assistance parts of the enclave were on the verge of famine after more than a year of war. The United States, along with Qatar and Egypt, have been the mediators of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Cairo and Doha both protested Israel’s decision to halt aid to Gaza, accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war. On Tuesday, Arab League members will convene an emergency summit in Cairo to discuss the fragile ceasefire and the future of Gaza. Natasha Mozgovaya contributed to this story.

Pope Francis' prognosis is 'guarded' after suffering new breathing crises	The Vatican said Monday that Pope Francis suffered two new episodes of 'acute respiratory insufficiency,' with a prognosis that 'remains guarded.' The pope’s condition is the result of 'a significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and consequent bronchospasm,' the Vatican said in a statement. The Vatican said Francis, 88, underwent two bronchoscopies to remove the mucus and later resumed the use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation. He remains 'alert, oriented and cooperative at all times,' the Vatican added. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church was admitted to Gemelli Hospital in Rome on Feb. 14 with a case of bronchitis that soon worsened to double pneumonia. This hospital stay is the longest during his time as pope. He is prone to lung infections, having had part of a lung removed when he was a young man. Some of the faithful who have journeyed to Rome to see the Vatican and possibly the pope have altered their plans and are now saying prayers for Francis outside the hospital for his full recovery. The pope's illness has also prompted Catholics to gather in Vatican City, his native Argentina and other areas of the world to hold prayer vigils. Francis became pope in 2013 when his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, resigned.

In Myanmar, journalist abused after speaking out about prison conditions	Prison authorities in Myanmar are accused of subjecting a jailed journalist to abuse after he exposed human rights violations in the prison, according to his employer. Sai Zaw Thaike, a photojournalist for the independent news agency Myanmar Now, is imprisoned in Insein Prison, a facility with a dire record of rights abuses. He and the two other prisoners, Thet Hnin Aung and Naing Win, have been subjected to physical and mental abuse every day since January, according to Myanmar Now. The inmates are beaten daily, Myanmar Now reported. The abuse is believed to be in retaliation to Sai Zaw Thaike and the others informing visiting National Human Rights Commission representatives that prison staff were violating the human rights of other prisoners, Myanmar Now reported, citing sources inside the prison. The junta-appointed National Human Rights Commission has a mandate to monitor and protect the rights of Myanmar’s people. A committee of the nonpartisan Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions in 2024, however, recommended suspending the commission from its membership over complaints, including over its independence. Myanmar Now has said that it believes the action against its photojournalist is also punishment for his leaking information to news outlets while detained, and for his reporting about the military before his arrest. Myanmar’s military did not immediately reply to VOA’s request for comment. Sai Zaw Thaike was arrested in May 2023 and later that year sentenced to 20 years in prison for sedition. He is one of dozens of journalists to have been detained since the military seized power in a February 2021 coup. The military, known as the Tatmadaw, has sought to control media through jailings, revoking broadcast licenses and blocking access to internet, watchdogs say. The harsh environment for media resulted in some news outlets closing and many journalists and their operations moving into exile. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, called on Myanmar’s military to halt the abuse. 'Myanmar’s junta must identify and hold to account those responsible for assaulting journalist Sai Zaw Thaike,' CPJ’s senior Southeast Asia representative Shawn Crispin said in a statement. 'This type of abuse is cruel and grotesque,' Crispin said, adding that the military 'must stop jailing and abusing journalists now.' VOA was unable to independently verify the reports of abuse. However, rights groups have long documented torture in Myanmar custody. Former inmates at Insein Prison have reported beatings, burns and electrical shocks being administered. In 2022, a journalist with the independent news outlet Frontier Myanmar said he was beaten and raped by regime soldiers while detained. Myanmar ranks third worst in the world in terms of journalist jailings, according to CPJ, with 35 behind bars for their work as of December. Among them is a contributor to VOA’s Burmese service. The country ranks 171 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media freedom environment.

Growing space cooperation between Pakistan, China presents risks and opportunities, experts say	Islamabad — China is ramping up cooperation with Pakistan in space exploration, but experts say Islamabad must develop its own strengths if it aims to benefit from Beijing. Pakistan’s Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission, or SUPARCO, and China Manned Space Agency, or CMSA, announced Friday they will train Pakistan’s first astronaut for a mission aboard Chinese space station Tiangong. The agreement comes just weeks after the two sides announced China’s Chang’e-8 moon lander mission in 2028 will carry a Pakistani rover. Last year, China put Pakistan into the moon’s orbit taking the first Pakistani lunar satellite ICUBE-Q, aboard its historic Chiang’e 6 mission, designed to retrieve samples from the little explored far side of the moon. Weeks later, Beijing put another Pakistani communication satellite into orbit. Picking Pakistan The latest agreement makes Pakistan the first country with an astronaut to work at Tiangong. Experts say picking Pakistan as the first guest for China’s space station is not surprising as Islamabad hosts the flagship project of China’s global Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. The multibillion-dollar program includes a plethora of investment projects aimed at extending Beijing’s influence, especially in the developing world. 'In this kind of increased polarization of interest in the world, China, both politically and also from the technological point of view, is trying to be the front-runner of, we can say, the Global South,' said Carlo Iorio, director of the Center for Research and Engineering in Space Technology at the Free University of Brussels. 'So, it's quite straightforward to think that one of the possible first candidates to be granted to use the Chinese Space Station could have been Pakistani astronauts or an astronaut,' Iorio told VOA. Last October, China announced a 25-year plan outlining its ambitious vision for space exploration. It includes Beijing’s goals of searching for extraterrestrial life, exploring Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, sending space crews to the moon and building an international lunar research station. 'Pakistan's participation in the China Space Station program reflects the deep-rooted ties between the two countries,' said Lin Xiqiang, director general of CMSA, according to the Pakistani statement. Lin was quoted as saying Pakistan’s inclusion 'will contribute to mutual knowledge-sharing and the broader vision of peaceful space exploration for the benefit of humanity.' Equal footing Collaboration with China opens access to a treasure trove of technical knowledge and expertise for Pakistan as Beijing has managed the world’s first soft landing and roving on the far side of the moon and landed a rover on Mars. 'They have capabilities to indigenously design and develop satellites and launches for all types of applications,' said Amer Gilani, secretary of the Pakistan Human Spaceflight Cooperation at SUPARCO about China’s capabilities. 'Pakistan wants to achieve self-reliance in design and development of satellites for remote sensing, communication, deep space exploration, lunar missions,' Gilani told VOA in written comments. 'With collaboration with China our space ambitions can progress much better.' Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the latest space collaboration as 'a defining moment in the nation’s space journey,' but experts say the nuclear-armed country will benefit from the collaboration only if it becomes an equal partner. 'What I want to see is cooperation on equal footing,' said Yarjan Abdul Samad, assistant professor of aerospace engineering at Khalifa University in UAE. Samad, who is also affiliated with the University of Cambridge, said that while Pakistan may not be able to contribute equally now, it should aim to do so in the near future. 'If you go on these projects and you are just on the receiving end and you get services, what you asked for, then your technological development is very limited,' Samad told VOA. Chinese edge The International Space Station, or ISS, and China’s Tiangong are currently the only two space stations orbiting Earth. Managed by a partnership among 15 countries, the ISS is set to be retired in 2030. Elon Musk, the owner of SpaceX and special advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump, recently called for deorbiting the ISS soon in favor of missions to Mars. As the market for commercial space exploration expands, Iorio said, that leaves China’s Tiangong as the only official government-based space station for further experiments and other activities for years to come. While this makes collaborating with China attractive for developing countries, Samad said Pakistan should consider more than national pride when putting an astronaut into space. Sending a Pakistani into space will only make sense, Samad said, if they will 'assist in carrying out work which is not possible with unmanned vehicles and which is not possible in ground conditions and which is helping us in finding solutions to technological problems.' SUPARCO has said the mission will involve 'cutting-edge scientific experiments in various fields, including biological and medical sciences, aerospace, applied physics, fluid mechanics, space radiation, ecology, material sciences, microgravity studies, and astronomy.' Despite receiving more than $25 billion in Chinese loans and investments for energy and infrastructure projects as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Pakistan is yet to turn its economy around. Experts largely blame governance issues. Iorio warned that Pakistan must strengthen its technology landscape or risk losing some of its brightest. 'Without supporting research in the country, [it] will drain more talent towards foreign nations, including China,' the Brussels-based expert said. For now, Pakistanis have an exciting opportunity ahead of them as SUPARCO searches for the country’s first astronaut. The criteria? 'Pakistan will select astronauts from Pakistani citizens with background suited for astronauts which could be flying, medical fitness, physical fitness, psychological fitness, research/analytical skills, and high qualifications etc.,' Gilani told VOA. 'Hopefully [we] will be able to get good candidates.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/growing-space-cooperation-between-pakistan-china-presents-risks-and-opportunities-experts-say-/7995718.html	2025-03-03T12:07:01-08:00	
Kenya court allows police to hold suspects linked to British man's death	NAIROBI, KENYA — A court in Kenya on Monday allowed police to hold for 21 days two suspects in a murder case involving a British national whose body was discovered days after arriving in the country for a conference. The body of Campbell Scott, 58, was found stuffed in a bag on Feb. 22, just days after he was last seen alive. The two Kenyan men were arrested after an investigation linked them to his death. The bag containing Scott's body was discovered hidden in a shrub in the remote area of Mukuyuni in eastern Kenya, some 110 kilometers (68 miles) from Nairobi. Scott was last seen leaving his hotel with an unidentified man and they took a taxi to a residential area in Nairobi, police said. The taxi driver who dropped them off is in custody and assisting police in the investigation. Kenya's government pathologist Johansen Oduor last week told local media that the autopsy on Scott's body was inconclusive and that further toxicology tests were being conducted.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-court-allows-police-to-hold-suspects-linked-to-british-man-s-death/7995617.html	2025-03-03T11:00:17-08:00	
China hosts political meetings as US tariffs loom	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China kicks off its biggest political meetings of the year this week as additional tariffs from the United States loom and the leadership in Beijing looks to address what Chinese President Xi Jinping has called 'complex and multifaceted' economic challenges. Starting on Tuesday, thousands of Chinese elites and lawmakers will begin gathering in the Chinese capital for the 'Two Sessions,' or 'lianghui,' which will set and discuss a wide range of policy agendas for 2025. A gathering of a broad swath of representatives, from business and academia to those inside the government and the party, called the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, meet on Tuesday. The day after that, China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, or NPC, will begin its annual legislative session. Premier Li Qiang will deliver the highly anticipated government work report at the opening meeting of the NPC, outlining the Chinese government’s economic growth target for 2025 and other key economic policies. This year’s meetings come amid a sluggish economy, weak domestic demand, low investor and consumer confidence, a lingering property sector crisis and a looming trade war with the United States. The additional 10% tariff that the U.S. government has threatened to impose on all Chinese imports is set to take effect on Tuesday. Faced with a slew of domestic and external challenges, analysts say this year’s NPC will be an important occasion for the Chinese leadership to project 'political unity' and demonstrate that 'China is on the right track to greatness under the leadership of Xi Jinping.' 'For Beijing, strong leadership from the Chinese Communist Party and strengthening China’s economic and technological resilience against external shocks are more necessary than ever – and the only way to ensure China's long-term rise,' said Nis Grunberg, an expert of Chinese politics at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, or Merics, in Germany. In an article published in the Chinese Communist Party’s magazine Qiushi on Saturday, President Xi Jinping said some top priorities for economic work, which he characterized as 'complex and multifaceted,' include facilitating an efficient relationship between the market and the government, ensuring a balance between supply and demand, optimizing the allocation of resources and balancing quality and scale in development. As the Chinese economy continues to face 'difficulties and challenges,' some experts say Beijing’s 2025 official growth target will be 'around 5%,' matching the GDP increase in 2024. The 5% target 'reflects a tacit acknowledgement of economic headwinds but signals continuity and stability,' said Lizzi Lee, a fellow on Chinese economy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Since all Chinese products exported to the U.S. could face a 20% tariff starting Tuesday, Lee said the Chinese government will focus on rolling out policies to boost domestic demand and consumption. 'We are likely to see stronger policy efforts to revitalize spending beyond just trade-in subsidies for cars, home appliances and digital products,' she told VOA in a written response. She added that Chinese policymakers are likely to pour resources into live-stream commerce and that the 'silver economy' – goods and services for the elderly – will be areas that Chinese policymakers will likely pour resources into. Additionally, Lee thinks China may also raise the fiscal deficit, set up state-backed investment funds to support strategic industries, and roll out policies to 'push banks to support struggling local economies.' Tech innovation and the private sector In addition to boosting domestic demand and consumption, the Chinese government is looking to expand high-tech manufacturing and drive innovation by boosting private sector sentiment and encouraging leading tech giants to expand both domestic and international operations. During a symposium with leaders from several Chinese tech giants on Feb. 17, Xi 'urged efforts to promote the healthy and high-quality development of the country's private sector.' He also vowed to dismantle obstacles that prevent private companies from 'competing in the market fairly.' Those remarks stood in sharp contrast to a series of crackdowns that the Chinese government has initiated against tech giants such as Alibaba, Tencent and Ant Group since 2020. Some analysts say Beijing may reinforce state-led support for companies working on artificial intelligence or semiconductors, while ensuring these private companies are aligned with the national priorities to help China remain strong in the ongoing competition with the U.S., including in several high-tech sectors. 'The private sector has an important role to play, but always under the guidance of the party,' Antonia Hmaidi, a senior analyst at Merics, said during a webinar on Feb. 27. While 'AI is a fundamental priority for party and state, a comprehensive law is unlikely to emerge at the Two Sessions as the party-state grapples with using AI for development while ensuring its safe use,' she added. Tariffs countermeasures On the foreign policy front, the international community will be closely watching how China decides to counter the tariffs that the U.S. government has vowed to impose on Chinese imports. Lee at ASPI said the Chinese government may double down on supply chain resilience, diversifying export markets and strengthening its domestic tech ecosystem. 'I expect policies that emphasize boosting domestic demand to offset trade risks, increasing fiscal support for industrial upgrading and further deepening economic ties with ASEAN, the Middle East and the Global South,' she told VOA. On Monday, Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times reported that the Chinese government is 'studying and formulating' countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs, including potentially targeting U.S. agriculture and food products with tariff and non-tariff measures. In light of the changes in foreign policy that the U.S. has implemented since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, Wen-ti Sung, a Taipei-based political scientist for the Australian National University, said China will try to 'project an image of continuity and certainty' in terms of foreign policy during the Two Sessions. 'It used to seem like China was the revisionist power in the international system, but as the U.S. changes the rules of the game that it set up, China will try to repackage itself as the pro-status quo power,' he told VOA by phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-hosts-political-meetings-as-u-s-tariffs-loom-/7995505.html	2025-03-03T10:18:36-08:00	
Suspect changes plea in July 4th parade shooting in Chicago suburb	WAUKEGAN, ILLINOIS — An Illinois man pleaded guilty Monday to killing seven people and injuring dozens more when he opened fire on a 2022 Independence Day parade in a Chicago suburb, a stunning development moments before opening arguments in his trial on charges of murder and attempted murder. Appearing in a Lake County circuit courtroom, Robert E. Crimo III, 23, withdrew his earlier not-guilty plea in the Highland Park shooting. Prosecutors initially charged him with 21 counts of first-degree murder — three counts for each person killed — as well as 48 counts of attempted murder. Prosecutors dropped the less serious 48 counts of aggravated battery before the start of the trial with jury selection last week. On Monday, Judge Victoria Rossetti read the charges to Crimo and asked questions to be sure he understood before any open plea was read to the court. He was sitting next to his lawyers wearing a dark suit. 'Is that what you went over with your attorneys?' Rossetti asked. 'Yes,' Crimo replied to the judge. He gave one-word answers, indicating he understood the charges. His mother, Denise Pesina, had a brief outburst at the news and was called up to the judge for a warning. 'We’re going to move forward. You are not a party to this proceeding. If you would like to stay in the courtroom please have a seat and be quiet,' the judge said to her. She was allowed to stay. The judge said with the plea change, there would be no trial or further motions on the case. 'He has knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights and pleaded guilty,' Rossetti said. Lake County prosecutors read the names of all those killed in the shooting and of those injured in the shooting, with the judge stopping to ask questions to make sure Crimo understood. They went over the substantial evidence, including his prints on the gun used in the crime, and statements to police admitting to the mass shooting. Sentencing will come April 23, but Crimo is certain to spend the rest of his life behind bars. Each count of first-degree murder carries a natural life prison sentence. Crimo did not further address the court or ask questions before leaving the courtroom. His defense attorneys declined comment ahead of the trial. Security was very tight for the proceedings at the courthouse in Lake County, with multiple bag checks and observers required to lock up their phones. The crowd at what was supposed to be opening statements included survivors and their family members. Jurors, who were chosen last week, had not even been let into the courtroom yet when the plea change happened. The trial that began Feb. 24 was expected to last about a month with testimony from survivors and police. Prosecutors had submitted thousands of pages of evidence, as well as hours of a videotaped interrogation during which police say Crimo confessed to the shooting. But the 24-year-old had then pleaded not guilty. Dozens of people were wounded in the shooting in the suburb about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Chicago. The wounded ranged in age from their 80s down to an 8-year-old boy who was left partially paralyzed. Witnesses described confusion as the shots began, followed by panic as families fled the downtown parade route, leaving behind lawn chairs and strollers to find safety inside nearby businesses or homes. Authorities said Crimo perched on a roof and fired into crowds assembled for the annual Fourth of July parade in downtown Highland Park. The criminal case proceeded slowly for months, partly due to Crimo’s unpredictable behavior. In June 2024, when he was expected to accept a plea deal and give victims and relatives a chance to address him publicly, Crimo showed up to court in a wheelchair and rejected the deal, surprising even his lawyers. He also fired his public defenders and said he would represent himself. Then he abruptly reversed himself. As potential jurors were questioned last week, he sporadically appeared in court, at times refusing to leave his jail cell. Father charged, tried earlier The trial came almost two years after his father’s case focusing on how Crimo obtained a gun license. In 2019, at age 19, Crimo was only allowed to apply for a gun license with the sponsorship of a parent or guardian. His father agreed, even though a relative had reported to police that his son had a collection of knives and had threatened to 'kill everyone.' His father, Robert Crimo Jr., a onetime mayoral candidate, was charged in connection with how his son obtained a gun license. He pleaded guilty in 2023 to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct and served less than two months in jail. He has attended his son’s hearings, sometimes making eye contact with him during court. He declined to discuss the case in detail ahead of the trial. 'As a parent, I love my son very much,' he said. 'And Bobby loves this country more than anyone would ever know.' Residents in the wealthy Highland Park community of roughly 30,000 set along Lake Michigan have mourned the losses deeply. Some potential jurors were excused because of their connections to the case. The victims killed in the shooting included Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35. Survivors and their families have filed multiple lawsuits, including against the maker of the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting and against authorities they accuse of negligence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-changes-plea-in-july-4th-parade-shooting-in-chicago-suburb/7995455.html	2025-03-03T09:41:26-08:00	
Female bomber's attack on military convoy in southwest Pakistan kills 1	ISLAMABAD — Police in Pakistan reported Monday that a female suicide bomber detonated herself near a military convoy in southwestern Balochistan province, killing at least one security personnel and injuring four others. The bombing in the insurgency-hit Kalat district reportedly targeted a commander of the Frontier Corps paramilitary force, but he was unharmed. A local police officer, Habibullah, confirmed the casualties, telling VOA by telephone that investigators had recovered body parts of the bomber and concluded that the perpetrator was female. No immediate claims of responsibility for the Kalat attack were made. However, previous similar acts of violence in natural resources-rich Balochistan, including those involving female bombers, had been claimed by the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). In Pakistan, suicide bombings by women are rare. The last known female suicide attack happened in 2022 when a bomber targeted a van carrying Chinese teachers to the university campus in Karachi. The driver and three teachers were killed. BLA-led attacks against security forces and settlers from other Pakistani provinces, particularly Punjab, have lately increased in Balochistan, which sits on the country’s border with Afghanistan and Iran. Series of attacks Last month, BLA insurgents ambushed a bus transporting paramilitary forces in Kalat and killed 18 of them. Just days later, a roadside bomb blast killed 11 coal miners in the city while BLA took credit for attacking a military vehicle securing a supply convoy for a mining company operated by China. Pakistani authorities reported that the convoy was passing through Kalat when it came under attack, resulting in injuries to eight security personnel. BLA has justified its attacks on infrastructure projects funded by China, claiming that Beijing is aiding Islamabad in exploiting local resources without sharing the benefits with the impoverished Baloch residents. Pakistan and China deny the allegations, asserting that BLA and other separatist organizations are actively engaged in campaigns aimed at hindering economic development in Balochistan. Monday’s bombing occurred a day after an alliance of ethnic Baloch separatist groups, including BLA, resolved at a joint meeting to escalate their 'war against Pakistan and China' by implementing a 'blockade on all important highways of Balochistan to disrupt the logistical, economic, and military interests' of the Pakistani state. The insurgent alliance shared the information with reporters via email but did not disclose the location or timing of the meeting. BLA is believed to be the largest and most lethal group active in Balochistan, and it has also been designated as a global terrorist organization by the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/female-bomber-s-attack-on-military-convoy-in-southwest-pakistan-kills-1/7995327.html	2025-03-03T08:33:53-08:00	
Namibia lays founding president to rest	Windhoek, Namibia — Thousands of Namibians gathered on the outskirts of the capital Windhoek on Saturday to bid farewell to the country’s founding president, Sam Nujoma, who died last month in a private hospital at the age of 95. Heads of state from southern African countries joined Namibians at the funeral for Nujoma, who led the country to independence from apartheid-era South Africa. As early as six o’clock on Saturday morning, Namibians could be seen making their way, some on foot and others in their vehicles, to the National Shrine, the Heroes Acre, on the outskirts of Windhoek. They came pay their final respects to the man who is credited with bringing independence to the southern African country thirty-five years ago. Sam Nujoma died in a Windhoek hospital on February 8th after being hospitalized for three weeks. Namibia’s current president, Nangolo Mbumba, described Nujoma as a giant who stood firm in the country's 24-year armed struggle for independence from South Africa. 'Although our hearts are laden with grief, we take solace that President Sam Nujoma will now rest amongst his fellow illustrious heroes and heroines,' he said. '[He] has completed his mission with distinction, fulfilling his destiny and leaving behind the most precious gift of freedom and independence for the people of Namibia.' Among the VIPs in attendance Saturday were South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa, and Angola’s President João Lourenco. Former presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique could also be seen in the crowds of mourners who came to pay their last respects to the elder statesman. Nujoma was the first leader of Namibia’s independence movement, the South West Africa People’s Organization, and later served three terms as Namibia’s president. Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana is his niece and a former cabinet minister who served as Namibia’s Attorney General. She is also vice-chairperson of the Sam Nujoma Foundation. 'Nujoma united the people of Namibia who were divided according to the ethnic languages,' she said. 'During the war our people were made to fight against each other and at independence he introduced a policy of national reconciliation to forgive one another as brothers and sisters.' Public servant Chrispin Kapalu was also among the mourners who sang and danced as they braved the burning hot Namibian sun to bid farewell to the leader, whose name is captured in revolutionary struggle songs like 'Sema Uulipeni Elula Ee pandela, eelula epandela ola Namibia.' The lyrics mean 'Sam Nujoma where are you, raise the flag.' 'Growing up we knew about Nujoma, different interpretations but after independence as young people then we could see the reality why our forefathers have to sacrifice their lives,' said Kapalu.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-lays-founding-president-to-rest-/7995310.html	2025-03-03T08:32:39-08:00	
Myanmar's head of military government travels to ally Russia for talks with Putin	BANGKOK — The head of Myanmar's military government arrived in Russia on Monday on an official visit to a major ally of the Southeast Asian nation that has been shunned by much of the West for overthrowing a democratically elected government and subsequent brutal repression. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who landed in Moscow on Monday and was greeted by a military orchestra on the tarmac, will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The general is accompanied by fellow members of the ruling military council and Cabinet, as well as military officials, state television MRTV reported. The report said Min Aung Hlaing will also meet with other top Russian officials and discuss bilateral ties, economic affairs and security with the aim to strengthen strategic cooperation. Russia, along with China, is a major supporter and arms supplier of Myanmar's military government. Russian-made fighter jets are used in attacks on territory under the control of ethnic minority groups, many of which are allies with pro-democracy resistance forces. Russia defends Myanmar's military government in international forums, and the ruling generals generally support Moscow's foreign policy agenda. Western nations have ostracized Myanmar's ruling military and imposed economic and political sanctions against them because of their takeover and violent repression of opposition, which has led to the deaths of thousands of civilians and given rise to an armed conflict widely seen as a civil war. The trip is Min Aung Hlaing's fourth to Russia since his army seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. His one known previous meeting with Putin was on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum held in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok in September 2022. Russia and Myanmar have also held joint military drills and signed a pact on developing nuclear power. Myanmar's military government is planning to allow general laborers to go to Russia for work.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-head-of-military-government-travels-to-ally-russia-for-talks-with-putin/7995215.html	2025-03-03T07:08:05-08:00	
Driver rams car into crowd in western Germany, leaving 1 person dead, others injured	BERLIN — One person was killed and others injured when a car rammed into a crowd Monday in the western German city of Mannheim, police said as they asked the public to stay away from the downtown area and remain in their homes. A suspect is in custody. Police spokesperson Stefan Wilhelm said that a driver drove into a group of people in Paradeplatz, a pedestrianized street in Mannheim, killing one person. Several people were injured, he said, but police can't yet specify how many or how badly. 'We can confirm that one perpetrator was arrested,' he said. 'We can't yet give information on whether there were further perpetrators.' Earlier, Wilhelm said the incident had been reported as 'a life-threatening deployment situation.' Paradeplatz, a major square in the downtown area, lies at the end of a pedestrianized street in Mannheim, which has a population of 326,000 and lies 85 kilometers (53 miles) south of Frankfurt. Images from the scene showed parts of the downtown area were cordoned off, with a heavy police presence and helicopters hovering above. Yellow ambulances were lining up outside the cordon. Mannheim University Hospital says it has prepared everything for a possible mass casualty incident, German news agency dpa reported. The hospital has implemented its disaster and emergency plan to prepare for the care of the injured. Authorities pushed an alert on the Katwarn app telling people in Mannheim to avoid the downtown area due to a big police deployment. Katwarn is used by officials to communicate information about major emergencies such as thunderstorms, militant attacks or fires. Across Germany, lots of people took a long weekend off to celebrate carnival, including Rose Monday, when many cities hold parades. Mannheim's street parade already took place, on Sunday. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser canceled her participation in the carnival street parade in Cologne due to the events in Mannheim. 'The focus is now on saving lives, treating the injured and the initial investigations by the authorities in Mannheim,' an interior ministry spokesperson told dpa. While police would not immediately characterize Monday's incident as an attack, cars have been used as deadly weapons in several acts of violence in recent months. Last month, a 2-year-old girl and her mother died two days after they were injured in a car-ramming attack on a labor union demonstration in Munich. A 24-year-old Afghan man who came to Germany as an asylum-seeker was arrested immediately after the attack, and prosecutors said he appeared to have had an Islamic extremist motive. And last year, six people were killed and more than 200 injured when a car slammed into a Christmas market in eastern Germany city of Magdeburg. The suspect, who was arrested, is a 50-year-old doctor originally from Saudi Arabia who had expressed anti-Muslim views and support for the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative For Germany party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driver-rams-car-into-crowd-in-western-germany-leaving-1-person-dead-and-others-injured/7995160.html	2025-03-03T07:07:31-08:00

Thailand mulls wall at Cambodia border as scam center crackdown widens	Bangkok — Thailand is studying the idea of building a wall on part of its border with Cambodia to prevent illegal crossings, its government said on Monday, as a multi-national effort to dismantle a sprawling network of illicit scam centers mounts. The crackdown is widening against scam centers responsible for using the internet to contact potential victims and carrying out massive financial fraud out of Southeast Asia, especially those on Thailand's porous borders with Myanmar and Cambodia, where hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked by criminal gangs in recent years, according to the United Nations. At the weekend, Thai police received 119 Thai nationals from Cambodian authorities after a raid in the town of Poipet, pulled more than 215 people out from a scam compound. 'If it is done, how will it be done? What results and how will it solve problems? This is a study,' Thai government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub said of the wall proposal, without specifying its length. A spokesperson for Cambodia's government declined to comment on the wall proposal. Its foreign ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thailand and Cambodia share a border of 817 kilometers. The Thai defense ministry has previously proposed a wall to block off a 55 kilometer natural crossing between Thailand's Sa Kaeo province and Poipet, which at present is only protected by razor wire. Telecom fraud centers have been operating for years in Southeast Asia, ensnaring people of multiple countries, as far away as West Africa. They have faced heightened scrutiny after the rescue in January of Chinese actor, Wang Xing, who was lured to Thailand with the promise of a job before being abducted and taken to a scam center in Myanmar. In Myanmar's Myawaddy, more than 7,000 foreigners - mostly from China - are waiting to cross into Thailand, which is coordinating with embassies to try to streamline their repatriations. Hundreds of foreigners pulled out of the compounds are in limbo, in squalid conditions in a militia camp in Myanmar, and are struggling to secure a route home, according to some detainees. A top Thai lawmaker last week said the crackdown is insufficient, estimating 300,000 people have been operating in compounds in Myawaddy alone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-mulls-wall-at-cambodia-border-as-scam-center-crackdown-widens/7994919.html	2025-03-03T02:14:21-08:00	
Japan's Prince Hisahito pledges to fulfil royal duties at maiden press conference	TOKYO — Japanese Prince Hisahito, who could well become emperor one day if the country's succession laws are not changed, told his first press conference on Monday that he would strive to fulfil his royal duties. He is second in line behind his father Crown Prince Akishino, who is Emperor Naruhito's younger brother. Naruhito's daughter, 23-year-old Aiko, is not eligible as Japanese law stipulates that only male members of the royal family can ascend the throne. Hisahito, who turned 18 last year, plans to start studies at the University of Tsukuba, north of Tokyo, next month, specializing in biology. 'Mindful that I'm an adult member of the royal family, I intend to fulfil my duty seriously and carefully, while taking advice from those around me,' said Hisahito. Dressed in a dark suit and a tie, he looked a little tense at first but started to smile as the press conference progressed. Hisahito said he was concerned about climate change and that his hobby was growing vegetables and rice. 'Sometimes tomatoes are bitten by bugs and the rice is eaten by sparrows. But I feel delighted when I've managed to harvest vegetables and rice and eat them with my family,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-prince-hisahito-pledges-to-fulfil-royal-duties-at-maiden-press-conference/7994917.html	2025-03-03T02:03:33-08:00	
Iran's former top diplomat Zarif resigns from VP post	Tehran, Iran — Iran's former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, has resigned as vice president, state media said Monday. 'Zarif's resignation letter was received by President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has not yet responded,' the official IRNA news agency reported, without giving further details. In a Monday post on X, Zarif said he had 'faced the most horrible insults, slander and threats against myself and my family, and I have gone through the most bitter period of my 40 years of service. 'To avoid further pressure on the government, the head of the judiciary recommended that I resign and... I accepted immediately,' he added. Pezeshkian, who took office in July, named Zarif as his vice president for strategic affairs on Aug. 1 but Zarif resigned after less than two weeks, before returning to the post later in the month. Zarif was Iran's top diplomat between 2013 and 2021 in the government of moderate president Hassan Rouhani. He became known on the international stage during lengthy negotiations for the 2015 nuclear accord formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The deal was effectively torpedoed three years later when, during Donald Trump's first term as president, the United States pulled out of the deal and reimposed crippling sanctions on the Islamic republic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-former-top-diplomat-zarif-resigns-from-vp-post/7994901.html	2025-03-03T01:05:11-08:00

Wildlife corridors' are encouraged to support Kenya's recovering animal populations	LEWA, Kenya — As nations mark World Wildlife Day, conservationists in Kenya are warning of shrinking wildlife spaces in the east African country that generates substantial revenue from wildlife tourism. While conservation efforts over the past two decades have led to the recovery of many threatened species, the animals are losing wide swaths of habitat because of threats stemming from climate change and destructive human behavior, activists warn. But they also cite an opportunity in what are known as wildlife corridors — strips of land connecting areas that would otherwise be separated by human activities. By allowing free movement of animals and reducing incidents of human-wildlife conflict, such corridors support the growth of wildlife populations. One conservation group that is trying to create such corridors is Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, which lies about 260 kilometers north of Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. Lewa is owned by a nonprofit that has acquired more land in recent years in a bid to connect Mount Kenya forest preserve to rangelands in northern Kenya. The sanctuary is home to 14% of Kenya's remaining black rhinos, in addition to other mammal species ranging from lions to zebras. An annual wildlife census was underway when the AP visited Lewa, where animal numbers have been going up over the years. The census involved the manual counting of each animal, with both ground rangers and aerial teams participating in the dayslong effort. 'All this is an effort to ensure that we undertake the responsibility of accounting for every species that is found on Lewa, especially the most critically endangered ones and the threatened ones,' said Dominic Maringa, head of conservation and wildlife at Lewa. 'We make sure it’s a full census.' Lewa's elephant population increased from 350 individuals in 2014 to over 450 in 2024, according to figures provided by the conservancy. Similar growth was seen among white and black rhinos, a major draw for visitors. But rising wildlife populations strain ecosystems and need to be matched by stronger efforts to protect habitats and create new corridors, Maringa said. 'As conservationists, you have to be looking at these trends, relate them to climate change, relate them with people and human-wildlife conflict,' he said. 'Maybe you are enjoying seeing a lot of elephants or buffalos. But at the end of the day what does that mean? You have to make sure you think ahead of the population.' Kenyan authorities report wildlife population growth trends across the country. Figures from the wildlife authority show that elephant numbers have grown from around 16,000 in the late 1980s to nearly 37,000 in 2024. Black rhinos have increased from fewer than 400 in the 1990s to over 1,000 today. Critically endangered Grevy’s zebras now number over 2,000, while lions have grown to approximately 2,600. But that success is threatened in some areas by growing human populations: Kenya’s population has grown from 22 million in 1989 to over 55 million in 2025. Kenya Wildlife Service, or KWS, is encouraging conservancies such as Lewa and private landowners to open up wildlife corridors for free animal movement, with translocation efforts also underway to redistribute animals from crowded ecosystems into less populated areas. KWS, in a recent statement, cited the Tsavo-Amboseli ecosystem, an expansive protected area in southern Kenya that hosts key elephant migration routes, as 'increasingly under pressure due to human activities affecting the free movement of wildlife.' Similarly, the wildlife corridor known as Kitengela, which connects Nairobi National Park to the grasslands of southern Kenya, has faced fragmentation due to human settlements and infrastructure development. Beside climate change, rapid urbanization driven by population growth is a major factor in the shrinking of wildlife corridors, according to KWS. There is also the additional problem of wildfires, with Kenya Forest Service reporting over 180 wildfires that have damaged more than 1,358 hectares of vegetation across the country since the beginning of this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wildlife-corridors-are-encouraged-to-support-kenya-s-recovering-animal-populations/7994840.html	2025-03-02T23:17:56-08:00	
Zelenskyy says possible to repair ties with US, sign minerals deal	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday his country remained ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the United States, and that he believes he can salvage relations with U.S. President Donald Trump. Speaking to reporters after a gathering of European leaders in Britain, Zelenskyy said he thinks the United States will also be ready to sign the minerals deal, but may 'need time to analyze some things.' The two sides had been expected to sign an agreement last week during a Zelenskyy visit to the White House, but the arrangement fell apart after acrimonious verbal exchanges during a meeting with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. Zelenskyy said Sunday that Ukraine counts on U.S. aid in its fight against Russia’s three-year-old invasion. 'I think stopping such assistance will only help [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,' Zelenskyy said. 'And because of that, I think that the United States and representatives of the civilized world, leaders of this world, definitely won't help Putin.' Trump cast Zelenskyy as ungrateful during their Friday meeting and has sought the minerals deal as a way to reimburse the United States for the billions of dollars in aid it has provided to Ukraine. Trump has promoted the need to end the war, and has held a phone call with Putin in addition to senior U.S. officials meeting with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia to discuss a potential peace deal without Ukrainian officials involved in the talks. 'We should spend less time worrying about Putin, and more time worrying about migrant rape gangs, drug lords, murderers, and people from mental institutions entering our Country - So that we don't end up like Europe!' Trump posted Sunday on his Truth Social platform. That followed the talks Sunday in London during which British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told 18 allies that with the United States wavering in its support for Ukraine, Europe finds itself 'at a crossroads in history.' 'This is not a moment for more talk — it's time to act. It's time to step up and lead and unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace,' Starmer said. The British leader said that with no guarantee of U.S. involvement to act as a support backup for would-be peacekeeping forces, 'Europe must do the heavy lifting' in securing peace in Ukraine. He said there was a 'coalition of the willing' ready to help defend any truce. Meanwhile, Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, speaking about Zelenskyy, told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show Sunday, 'What was not clear to us was whether he shared our goal of ending this war. It was not clear he was ready to go to peace.' Unlike in Washington, Zelenskyy was warmly embraced at the summit by many of the European heads of state, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and NATO chief Mark Rutte. Zelenskyy supporters rallied outside Starmer’s residence in support of Ukraine. As the leaders gathered Sunday, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned, 'We urgently have to rearm Europe' and 'prepare for the worst' on the continent. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, called for the United States and Europe to 'speak with one voice' in showing Russian President Vladimir Putin 'that the West has no intention of capitulating before his blackmail and aggression.' In addition to attending the security summit, Zelenskyy met with King Charles at his Sandringham estate in England. Starmer, when he first greeted Zelenskyy on Saturday, unveiled a $2.84 billion loan agreement to support Ukraine's defense capabilities, to be paid back with the profits of immobilized sovereign Russian assets. The Kremlin said in remarks aired Sunday that the United States' dramatic shift in Europe foreign policy toward Russia is largely aligned with Moscow's vision. 'The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state television that was recorded last Wednesday. No peace negotiations are scheduled. Trump national security adviser Waltz said that eventually Russia and Ukraine will have to make negotiating concessions to reach a peace deal. 'There will be all kinds of carrots and sticks to get this done,' he said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also stressed the importance of both sides coming to the negotiating table. 'We are trying to end a war,' Rubio said. 'You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians. And that is the point the president has made.' 'I'm not promising you it's possible,' he added. 'I'm not telling you it's 90% likely. I'm saying it's 0% likely if we don't get them to a negotiating table. And the sooner everyone grows up around here and figures out that this is a bad war that's heading in a bad direction with death and destruction and all kinds of danger surrounding it that could spiral into a broader conflict, the sooner people grow up and realize that I think the more progress we're going to be able to make.' Starmer said Britain, France and Ukraine have agreed to work on a ceasefire plan to present to the United States. Some European countries have said they are willing to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine to help enforce a would-be peace agreement but need the U.S. to provide backup military support to confront Russia in the event Putin agrees to a ceasefire and then violates it or launches a new invasion. Trump has rejected sending such U.S. support and said he trusts Putin to honor any settlement of the war that he agrees to. Starmer said he does not trust Putin but does trust Trump. 'Do I believe Donald Trump when he says he wants lasting peace? The answer to that is yes,' he said. Starmer said there are 'intense discussions' to get a security guarantee from the U.S. as one of several components for a lasting peace. 'If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then Putin comes again,' Starmer said. 'That has happened in the past, I think it is a real risk, and that is why we must ensure that if there’s a deal, it is a lasting deal, not a temporary pause.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-says-possible-to-repair-ties-with-us-sign-minerals-deal-/7994831.html	2025-03-02T22:45:48-08:00	
Japan deploys nearly 1,700 firefighters to tackle forest blaze	TOKYO — Nearly 1,700 firefighters are battling Japan's biggest forest fire in three decades, officials said Monday, as some 4,600 residents remain under an evacuation advisory. One person died last week in the blaze in the northern region of Iwate, which follows record low rainfall in the area and last year's hottest summer on record across Japan. The fire near the city of Ofunato has burned through some 2,100 hectares since Thursday, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said Monday. Firefighters from 14 Japanese regions, including units from Tokyo, were now tackling the blaze, with 16 helicopters -- including from the military -- trying to douse the flames. It is estimated to have damaged 84 buildings by Sunday, although details were still being assessed, the agency said. Around 2,000 people have left the area to stay with friends or relatives, while more than 1,200 evacuated to shelters, according to officials. Early morning footage from Ofunato on national broadcaster NHK showed orange flames close to buildings and white smoke billowing into the air. The number of wildfires in Japan has declined since the peak in the 1970s, according to government data. But there were about 1,300 across the country in 2023, concentrated in the February to April period when the air dries and winds pick up. Ofunato saw just 2.5 millimeters of rainfall in February, breaking the previous record low for the month of 4.4 millimeters in 1967 and below the usual average of 41 millimeters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-deploys-nearly-1-700-firefighters-to-tackle-forest-blaze/7994825.html	2025-03-02T22:10:09-08:00	
Francis off mechanical ventilation entirely, signaling he's overcome risks from respiratory crisis	Rome — Pope Francis remained in stable condition and didn’t need any mechanical ventilation Sunday, the Vatican said. It was a sign that he had overcome the possible complications from a respiratory crisis Friday and that his breathing function overall was improving as he recovers from pneumonia. The 88-year-old pope did continue to receive high flow supplemental oxygen after Friday’s coughing episode, which sparked fears of a new lung infection. Doctors in their late Sunday update said Francis remained stable but again referred to the complexity of his overall condition and kept his prognosis at guarded, meaning he wasn’t out of danger. Francis, who has been in the hospital since Feb. 14, rested, prayed in his private chapel and participated in Mass after a morning visit from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra. The content of their talks wasn't known, but even when at the Vatican, Francis meets at least weekly with them. He again skipped his weekly noon blessing to avoid even a brief public appearance from the hospital. Instead, the Vatican distributed a message written by the pope from Gemelli Hospital in which he thanked his doctors for their care and well-wishers for their prayers, and prayed again for peace in Ukraine and elsewhere. 'From here, war appears even more absurd,' Francis said in the message, which he drafted in recent days. Francis said he was living his hospitalization as an experience of profound solidarity with people who are sick and suffering everywhere. 'I feel in my heart the ‘blessing’ that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,' Francis said in the text. 'At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.' Signs point to a recovery Many signs indicated he was improving, especially after a respiratory crisis on Friday afternoon that resulted in him inhaling vomit during a coughing fit and raising the possibility of new infection. Doctors aspirated the vomit and put him on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, a mask that pumps oxygen into the lungs. He used the ventilation on Saturday, alternating it with just supplemental oxygen, and by Sunday no longer needed it. Doctors also reported he had no fever or raised white blood cell levels, which would have indicated his body was fighting a new infection. The doctors had said they needed 24 to 48 hours after Friday's coughing episode to determine if there were any negative impacts on Francis' overall condition. The passage of time and positive reports Sunday suggested he had overcome the episode successfully. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into a complex pneumonia in both lungs. Prayers continued to pour in Francis’ hospitalization has come as the Vatican is marking its Holy Year, drawing pilgrims to Rome from all over. Many have added a pilgrimage destination to their itineraries so they can pray for Francis at the Gemelli hospital, which is around a 20-minute drive from the Vatican, longer in rush hour or on public transport. The Rev. Riccardo Fumagalli had accompanied a group of young people from Milan to Rome for the Jubilee and would have attended Francis' Angelus prayer in St. Peter's Square on Sunday if he had delivered it as usual. Instead, they went to Gemelli. 'It seemed good to us to come here to express our closeness, especially of these teenagers, to be close to the Holy Father to pray for him, to pray for this moment of illness,' he said. Cancer patient Antonino Cacace was also arriving Sunday at Gemelli from Milan for his own treatment, saying he has to undergo surgery in the coming days and was counting on Francis' prayers. 'I am glad the pope is giving me help,' he said. 'I am on the ninth (floor) and he is on the 10th (floor). I hope to meet him and see him,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/francis-off-mechanical-ventilation-entirely-signaling-he-s-overcome-risks-from-respiratory-crisis-/7994816.html	2025-03-02T21:25:07-08:00	
China's factory activity picks up but trade uncertainties weigh	BEIJING — China's factory activity grew at a faster pace in February, driven by stronger supply and demand, including a rebound in export orders, a private-sector survey showed on Monday, partly due to seasonal factors related to the holiday period. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, or PMI, rose to 50.8 in February, from 50.1 the previous month, marking a three-month high and beating analysts' forecasts in a Reuters poll of 50.3. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction. The PMI offers a snapshot of operating conditions in the manufacturing sector. The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI for China released over the weekend, that showed manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in three months. 'The holiday period saw robust consumption momentum, and technological innovations in certain industries added to the positive sentiment, helping sustain the manufacturing market recovery,' said Wang Zhe, economist at Caixin Insight Group. Factory production in China accelerated in February from the previous month, while total new orders increased at the quickest pace in three months. New export orders increased at their fastest pace since April last year. However, manufacturers faced rising input costs, particularly for materials like copper and various chemicals, putting pressure on profit margins. To mitigate these challenges, factory owners focused on cost-cutting. Employment in the sector continued to decline, and output prices remained subdued, reflecting weak pricing power. Despite these pressures, business sentiment improved from January, buoyed by signs of recovering domestic demand and expectations of additional government support for the economy. China's GDP officially grew 5% last year, reaching the government’s target, largely due to extensive government stimulus measures. But the economy has been grappling with challenges including a faltering property market, weakening domestic demand and rising trade tensions. Trump on Thursday said he would slap an extra 10% duty on Chinese goods on March 4, on top of the 10% tariff that he levied on February 4, worsening the trade outlook. Wang Zhe emphasized the importance of timely policy support, saying 'March represents a critical policy window. Supportive measures should address market expectations and societal concerns, focusing on key economic bottlenecks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-factory-activity-picks-up-but-trade-uncertainties-weigh/7994815.html	2025-03-02T21:21:12-08:00

Lithuanian rower plucked from path of tropical cyclone off Australia	Sydney — A Lithuanian rower was rescued from storm-tossed seas off Australia on Monday after paddling into a tropical cyclone while trying to cross the Pacific Ocean alone. An Australian navy vessel plucked long-distance rower Aurimas Mockus from the Coral Sea, where Tropical Cyclone Alfred on Monday was whipping up 100-kilometer (60-mile) per hour winds and seven-meter (20-foot) swells. Mockus first activated his emergency beacon Friday evening, enduring three nights at sea as the looming cyclone hampered rescue efforts. Vice Admiral Justin Jones said Mockus — who has used the attempt to drum up support for Ukraine's war effort — was safely on board and undergoing medical checks. 'The ship is on its way back to Australian shores,' said the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in a statement. Aerial photos taken before the rescue showed his modified rowboat bobbing on white-capped waves in a turbulent, dark ocean. Mockus fell just short of his goal to row 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) across the Pacific Ocean from the United States to Australia. He started the grueling journey in September 2024, according to his website. Tropical Cyclone Alfred is forecast to bring damaging waves and strong winds as it moves toward Australia's eastern coast later this week, the government weather bureau said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuanian-rower-plucked-from-path-of-tropical-cyclone-off-australia/7994762.html	2025-03-02T16:48:20-08:00	
Crews battle wildfires in Carolinas amid dry conditions, gusty winds	Crews battled wildfires in North and South Carolina on Sunday amid dry conditions and gusty winds and evacuations were ordered in some areas. The National Weather Service warned of increased fire danger in the region due to a combination of critically dry fuels and very low relative humidity. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Sunday to support the wildfire response effort, and a statewide burning ban remained in effect. Crews worked to contain a fire in the Carolina Forest area west of the coastal resort city of Myrtle Beach, where residents were ordered to evacuate several neighborhoods, according to Horry County Fire Rescue. The South Carolina Forestry Commission estimated Sunday afternoon that the blaze was burning about 4.9 square kilometers (1.9 square miles) with 0% containment. No structures had succumbed to the blaze and no injuries had been reported as of Sunday morning, officials said. The 410 personnel involved in the effort were expected to remain until the fire was contained, county fire officials said. Evacuations were expected to remain in place Sunday and officials warned residents in the Carolina Forest area to be prepared with go-bags and emergency plans if more evacuations were called in their neighborhoods. In North Carolina, the U.S. Forest Service said fire crews were working to contain multiple wildfires burning on more than 161.87 hectares (400 acres) in four forests across the state Sunday. The largest, about 121.41 hectares (300 acres), was at Uwharrie National Forest, about 80.47 kilometers (50 miles) east of Charlotte. The small southwestern town of Tryon in Polk County, North Carolina, urged some residents to evacuate Saturday as a fire spread rapidly there. On Sunday, officials said those evacuations remained in effect. That fire was burning about 161.87 hectares (400 acres) Sunday afternoon, with 0% containment, according to the Polk County Emergency Management/Fire Marshal's office. The North Carolina Forest Service was conducting water drops and back-burning operations on the ground, and area residents should expect a lot of smoke during those operations, officials said. Officials have not said what caused any of the fires.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-battle-wildfires-in-carolinas-amid-dry-conditions-gusty-winds/7994755.html	2025-03-02T16:31:42-08:00	
Trudeau to talk with King Charles on defending Canada 'sovereignty'	London — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Sunday he would speak with King Charles III about defending Canada's sovereignty, as President Donald Trump repeatedly calls for it to become the 51st U.S. state. Trump's comments have been met with outrage in Canada, with officials firmly rejecting any discussion of it ever becoming a part of the United States. When he meets Monday with King Charles, who is Canada's head of state, Trudeau said he hopes to 'discuss matters of importance to Canada and to Canadians.' 'And I can tell you that nothing is more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation,' said the prime minister, while in London for a summit on Ukraine. Trump has been particularly transfixed on Canadian sovereignty since winning a new term in November. He regularly refers to Canada as the '51st state,' and has demeaned Trudeau by calling him 'governor,' instead of prime minister. Trump has ordered tariffs against the major U.S. trading partner, set to go into effect Tuesday, while saying they could be avoided if Canada were part of the United States. Trudeau last month warned that Trump's persistent talk about absorbing Canada to access its natural resources was 'a real thing.' Some Canadians have wondered aloud why King Charles has not spoken out in defense of Canada. It is custom that the monarch acts only on the advice of the prime minister in matters involving the Commonwealth nation. Last week, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer invited Trump for an unprecedented second state visit to the U.K., which could provide an opportunity for the king to raise the issue of Canadian sovereignty. At the London summit on Ukrainian security Sunday, Trudeau also reiterated Canada's strong and unwavering support for Ukraine and announced new sanctions against Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trudeau-to-talk-with-king-charles-on-defending-canada-sovereignty/7994743.html	2025-03-02T16:01:58-08:00	
Abkhazia's acting leader wins presidential election, state media say	Tbilisi, Georgia — The acting leader of Abkhazia has won a presidential election in the breakaway Georgian region, state media said Sunday, months after his predecessor was driven from office following protests over an investment deal with Russia. Acting President Badra Gunba took almost 55% of the vote in Saturday's election in the Russia-backed territory, ahead of opposition leader Adgur Ardzinba on just under 42%, Abkhazian state news agency Apsnypress reported, citing preliminary results from the electoral commission. Georgia, of which Abkhazia is recognized as being part of by all but a handful of countries, called the election 'another flagrant violation of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.' In footage published by state media, Gunba thanked voters and said he would work to make Abkhazia 'independent, free and prosperous.' Abkhazia has in recent months been plagued by an electricity crisis, with blackouts blamed on low water levels at a key hydroelectric plant and large-scale cryptocurrency mining, which requires large amounts of energy. Gunba, Abkhazia's vice president since 2020, took over as acting leader in November after his ally Aslan Bzhania resigned days after protesters seized government buildings and forced him to scrap an unpopular deal with Russia. It was the third time since 2014 that an Abkhazian leader had been driven from office by mass protests. A lush, Black Sea coastal territory of about 240,000 people, Abkhazia broke away from Georgia after a war in the early 1990s, with the support of Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Gunba on the election win Sunday, Russian media cited the Kremlin as saying. Moscow recognized Abkhazia as independent territory after another war in 2008. Tens of thousands of ethnic Georgians were expelled from the region in successive conflicts. Though the territory is politically and economically dependent on Russia, some Abkhazians have been critical of what they see as Moscow's growing influence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abkhazia-s-acting-leader-wins-presidential-election-state-media-say/7994512.html	2025-03-02T15:48:25-08:00	
Egypt says Gaza reconstruction plan ready, to be presented at Arab summit	Dubai — Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said on Sunday that Egypt's Gaza reconstruction plan, which ensures Palestinians remain in their land, is ready and will be presented at an emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday. Arab states, which were swift to reject President Donald Trump's plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and resettle Palestinians, are scrambling to agree on a diplomatic offensive to counter the idea. Trump's plan, announced on Feb. 4 amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, appeared to back away from long-standing U.S. Middle East policy focused on a two-state solution and sparked anger among Palestinians and Arab nations. Abdelatty said Egypt would seek international backing and funding for the plan and emphasized Europe's crucial role, particularly in the financing of Gaza's reconstruction. 'We will hold intensive talks with major donor countries once the plan is adopted at the upcoming Arab [League] summit,' he said in a press conference with the EU Commissioner for the Mediterranean, Dubravka Suica. Israel on Sunday blocked the entry of aid trucks into Gaza as a standoff over the truce that has halted fighting for the past six weeks escalated. Abdelatty said the use of aid as a weapon of collective punishment could not be permitted. The first phase of the fragile ceasefire agreement expired this weekend. Abdelatty reaffirmed Egypt's commitment to the originally agreed ceasefire that had been scheduled to move into a second phase. 'It will be difficult, but with goodwill and political determination, it can be achieved,' he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said earlier that it had adopted a U.S. proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza for the Ramadan and Passover periods. Abdelatty said after Tuesday's summit, foreign ministers of member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation would hold an urgent meeting in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to present the plans. 'We will ensure that the results of the Arab summit are presented to the world in the best possible way,' he said. The current conflict began when Hamas killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with about half being women and children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/egypt-says-gaza-reconstruction-plan-ready-to-be-presented-at-arab-summit/7994511.html	2025-03-02T15:34:46-08:00	
DR Congo says handover of 20 alleged Hutu rebels was staged	Kinshasa, DRC — The Democratic Republic of Congo's army denied Sunday that 20 fighters linked to the Rwandan genocide had been captured on its territory, calling a video of their handover to Rwanda 'faked.' The statement came after the M23 armed group in eastern DRC said Saturday it had captured fighters from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a militia founded by ethnic Hutus who took part in the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994. Rwanda has long pointed to the alleged presence of the FDLR in eastern DRC. The M23 has seized swathes of the DRC's troubled, mineral-rich east in recent months, including the key provincial capitals of Goma and Bukavu. The M23 released a video showing its forces handing over 20 alleged FDLR fighters to Rwanda at a border post between the two countries. 'This is a faked incident in poor taste orchestrated with the sole aim of discrediting our army,' the Congolese armed forces chiefs of staff said in a statement. 'This is part of the Rwandan strategy to justify the invasion of parts of the DRC's territory,' it added. 'The Rwandan authorities, who specialize in the art of lies and manipulation, took old FDLR detainees, dressed them in new military fatigues, and passed them off as FDLR fighters newly captured in Goma.' The DRC high command also accused the Rwandan army of 'summary executions' of wounded and ill soldiers at a field hospital in Goma, which 'constitutes a war crime and crime against humanity,' it said. The escalating conflict in eastern DRC has raised fears it could spiral into a wider regional war, drawing in Rwanda, Uganda and other countries. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the FDLR, an allegation the DRC rejects. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. Analysts warn that continued instability risks deepening the regional conflict and several peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community, or SADC, have already been killed since the recent rebel offensives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7994507.html	2025-03-02T15:25:50-08:00	
Muslims in Middle East observe Ramadan amid political upheavals, postwar turmoil	Muslims in the Middle East are observing the holy month of Ramadan under exceptional circumstances. Ramadan is seen as a time of religious reflection and worship, charity, and community, as they fast from sunrise until sunset. Families broke their first day of fast with loved ones, as towns and cities lit festive lights and held events for communities to mark the occasion as they have for generations during times of peace and economic stability. However, the impact of war and major political transformations that shook the region are still felt. This is the first Ramadan for many Syrians spent without the Assad dynasty ruling the country in more than half a century. President Bashar al-Assad was ousted in a lightning insurgency in December led by the country’s new Islamist de facto rulers in Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Assad’s downfall brought initial joy and hope among Syrians, but the vast destruction following over a decade of war, economic turmoil that has plunged an estimated 90% of its population into poverty, and uncertainty over whether the country’s security will find stability anytime soon has simmered down that initial optimism. Families in once bustling neighborhoods reduced to rubble broke their fast by the ruins as charities arranged Iftar dinners. The widespread poverty in Syria comes as the new interim government has urged the international community to lift sanctions to allow reconstruction and make the country’s battered economy viable again. It is still a novel sight, as Syrians in Damascus walked through its iconic old city markets at night, only this time without the portraits of Assad on every corner, and with Syria’s new flag draped over store fronts. In the Gaza Strip, it’s the second year Palestinians are marking Ramadan following the war between Israel and the militant Hamas group, a U.S.-designated terror organization. This year, they are hoping that a shaky ceasefire deal holds, as much of the tiny enclave lays in ruins, where most Palestinians rely on food and medical aid to survive due to the widespread destruction. In the southern city of Rafah, where a monthslong Israeli military operation took place since last summer, Palestinians set strings of lights across the ruins of damaged buildings and a table stretching across the road for Iftar during sunset. Elsewhere, a family in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, prepares a modest Iftar dinner over a makeshift stove in their damaged home. It’s a far cry from the larger dinners families hold where they invite relatives and friends to have a meal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/muslims-in-middle-east-observe-ramadan-amid-political-upheavals-postwar-turmoil/7994475.html	2025-03-02T13:43:41-08:00	
Captain America: Brave New World' on top during weak Oscars’ weekend	LOS ANGELES — 'Captain America: Brave New World' kept falling but still hovered above all others at a weak weekend box office. The latest Disney-Marvel offering brought in another $15 million according to studio estimates Sunday, when most of Hollywood's attention was on the Oscars. The Anthony Mackie-led 'Captain America: Brave New World' opened strong at about $120 million on a three-day weekend last month, but plunged to $28.2 million last week in one of the most significant second-week drops for a Marvel movie. It's earned $163.7 since its release. It was slammed by many critics and audiences, failing to bring the Marvel reset some had hoped for. That task now falls to May’s 'Thunderbolts' and July’s 'Fantastic Four: First Steps.' But 'Captain America' will face little competition through March and could remain at No. 1 for a while. The weekend's only significant new release, Focus Features' 'Last Breath,' earned just $7.8 million. The based-on-a-true-story adventure starring Woody Harrelson, Simi Liu and Chris Lemons is about a routine deep-sea diving mission that goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface. It got strong reviews, with Lindsey Bahr of The Associated Press praising the 'white-knuckle experience' and 'pure suspense and anxiety' it brings. At No. 3 was Oz Perkins’ 'The Monkey,' which brought in $6.4 million for a two-week total of $24.6 million. It's among the strongest openings for indie distributor Neon, whose film 'Anora,' and its director Sean Baker could make a major mark at the Oscars later Sunday. 'The Monkey' marks another successful low-budget collaboration between Perkins and Neon, whose 'Longlegs' brought in $126.9 million globally last year. 'Paddington in Peru' was fourth with $4.5 million in its third weekend for a total of $31.4 million. Top 10 movies by domestic box office With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. 1. 'Captain America: Brave New World,' $15 million. 2. 'Last Breath,' $7.8 million. 3. 'The Monkey,' $6.4 million. 4. 'Paddington in Peru,' $4.5 million. 5. 'Dog Man,' $4.2 million. 6.

Cyberattack detected at Polish space agency, minister says	Warsaw — Polish cybersecurity services have detected unauthorized access to the Polish Space Agency's (POLSA) IT infrastructure, Minister for Digitalization Krzysztof Gawkowski said Sunday. 'In connection with the incident, the systems under attack were secured ... Intensive operational activities are also underway to identify who is behind the cyberattack,' Gawkowski wrote on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Warsaw has repeatedly accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize Poland because of its role in supplying military aid to its neighbor Ukraine, allegations Russia has repeatedly dismissed. The agency confirmed to news agency PAP that a cybersecurity incident had occurred. The situation is being analyzed, and in order to secure data, the POLSA network was immediately disconnected from the Internet, it told PAP. Last month, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk accused Russia of planning acts of sabotage worldwide that included 'acts of air terror' against airlines. Tusk made the statement at a news conference in Warsaw on January 15. 'I will not go into details, I can only confirm the validity of fears that Russia was planning acts of air terror, not only against Poland, but against airlines around the world,' Tusk said. The Kremlin has dismissed previous Western claims that Russia sponsored acts of sabotage and attacks in Europe. Western security officials suspect Russian intelligence was behind a plot to put incendiary devices in packages on cargo planes headed to North America, including one that caught fire at a courier hub in Germany and another that ignited in a warehouse in England last year.

Turkish, British officials to discuss post-Assad Syria in Ankara talks	Ankara, Turkey — Turkish and British officials will discuss Syria's future during a meeting in Ankara on Monday, with security, sanctions and economic development on the agenda, a Turkish foreign ministry source said Sunday. NATO-member Turkey was a main backer of rebels who fought Bashar al-Assad for years and it has forged close ties with the new administration in Damascus following Assad's ouster last year. It has promised to help rebuild Syria and offered assistance to train and equip its security forces. Britain said last month it would adapt its Syria sanctions regimes after Assad's fall, but will ensure asset freezes and travel bans imposed on members of the former government remain in place. The Turkish source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Monday's talks would be led by Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Nuh Yilmaz and British junior Foreign Office Minister Hamish Falconer. Yilmaz will emphasize the need for sanctions on Syria to be lifted unconditionally for rebuilding and economic development, the source said. Yilmaz will also stress 'the importance of the international community backing the Syrian administration's steps towards achieving national reconciliation within a central government,' and push 'to stop Israel's actions openly violating and threatening Syria's sovereignty,' the source added. Reuters reported Friday that Israel is lobbying the United States to keep Syria weak and decentralized, including by letting Russia keep its military bases there to counter Turkey's growing influence in Syria, according to sources familiar with the efforts. Turkish Transport and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu said Sunday Turkey had completed an initial phase of repairs and maintenance, including installing new equipment, at Damascus airport as part of Ankara's efforts to help rebuild the transport hub.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-british-officials-to-discuss-post-assad-syria-in-ankara-talks/7994437.html	2025-03-02T12:02:15-08:00

Ugandan army deploys to town in northeast DR Congo	Kampala — The Ugandan army confirmed Sunday it has sent troops to another town in the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo to fight local armed groups, amid fears a raging conflict could spiral into a wider war. 'Our troops have entered Mahagi town, and we are in control,' Uganda's defense and military affairs spokesperson Felix Kulayigye told AFP Sunday. The deployment was requested by the Congolese army following alleged massacres of civilians carried out by a militia known as the Cooperative for the Development of Congo (CODECO), he said, without providing further details. Mahagi is in Ituri province, which borders Uganda, where at least 51 people were killed on February 10 by armed men affiliated with CODECO, according to humanitarian and local sources. CODECO claims it defends the interests of the Lendu community, mainly composed of farmers, against the Hema community, who are mainly herders. Uganda already has thousands of troops in other parts of Ituri under an agreement with the Congolese government. Last month, Uganda announced its troops had 'taken control' of the provincial capital, Bunia. Ituri is just north of the provinces of North and South Kivu, which at the end of January fell under the control of the anti-government M23 armed group, which the DRC says is backed by neighboring Rwanda. A claim that Kigali denies. Analysts fear that Uganda and Rwanda's growing presence in eastern DRC could lead to a repeat of the so-called Second Congo War, which lasted from 1998 to 2003, involving many African countries and resulting in millions of deaths from violence, disease and famine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ugandan-army-deploys-to-town-in-northeast-dr-congo/7994433.html	2025-03-02T11:50:34-08:00

New US tariffs on Canada, Mexico could be eased, commerce chief says	U.S. President Donald Trump is planning to impose new tariffs Tuesday on Canadian and Mexican exports to the United States, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday they may not be as high as the 25% figure Trump was planning. 'That is a fluid situation,' Lutnick told the Fox News show 'Sunday Morning Futures.' 'There are going to be tariffs on Tuesday on Mexico and Canada. Exactly what they are, we're going to leave that for the president and his team to negotiate,' he said. Lutnick's comments were the first indication that the Trump administration may not impose the full 25% tariffs he announced last week on all goods from Mexico and non-energy imports from Canada, contending that the two U.S. neighbors are still not doing enough to curb the flow of illicit drugs into the United States. Lutnick said Mexico and Canada have 'done a reasonable job' securing their borders with the United States, although the deadly drug fentanyl continues to flow into the country. Trump first announced the tariffs a month ago but then delayed their effective date after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced she would send 10,000 troops to Mexico’s northern border with the U.S. to curb the flow of narcotics, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would name a 'fentanyl czar' to deal with the issue. Trump is also adding another 10% tariff on Chinese goods Tuesday, doubling 10% duties he imposed on Feb. 4. Trump has blamed China as the source of fentanyl trafficking into the U.S. In announcing the new tariffs last week, Trump said, 'Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels. A large percentage of these Drugs, much of them in the form of Fentanyl, are made in, and supplied by, China.' He made the comments on his Truth Social platform. Sheinbaum, whose trade-dependent economy sends 80% of its exports to the U.S., said last week Mexico was 'expecting to reach a deal with the United States' before the new levy took effect but that if not, could impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products exported to Mexico. When Trump first announced the hefty U.S. tariff on Canadian imports in early February, Trudeau said it was 'entirely unjustified' and promised to impose a 25% tax starting March 12 on U.S. steel and aluminum products exported to Canada. Canada is the top exporter of both metals to the U.S. Economists say that the tariffs Trump is imposing are likely to boost retail prices for consumers and the cost of materials for businesses. Mexico, Canada and China, in that order, are the three biggest national trading partners with the U.S., although collectively, the 27-nation European Union is larger than all three individually. Trump, at his first Cabinet meeting of his new presidential term last week, said he would 'very soon' announce a 25% tariff on EU exports to the U.S. He contended that the EU was 'formed [in 1993] to screw the United States' economically. With Trump signaling the new tariff on goods sent to the U.S., the EU vowed to respond 'firmly and immediately' to 'unjustified' trade barriers and suggested it would impose its own tariffs on U.S. imports if Trump proceeded with his. Trump said reciprocal tariffs on nations that levy taxes on U.S. exports are still set to take effect on April 2. He has also hinted at putting tariffs on automobile imports, lumber, pharmaceutical products and other goods. Many economists have repeatedly warned that tariffs could lead to higher prices, boosting troublesome inflation in the U.S. Trump has acknowledged there could be short-term pain for Americans but has contended that tariffs would ultimately be beneficial to the U.S. economy, the world’s largest. Trump says the tariffs he is imposing would be an incentive for foreign companies to do more manufacturing in the United States to avoid the tariffs on overseas shipment of their products to the U.S. More immediately, Trump has focused on the flow of drugs into the U.S. 'More than 100,000 people died last year due to the distribution of these dangerous and highly addictive POISONS,' he said in his social media post. 'Millions of people have died over the last two decades,' Trump declared. 'The families of the victims are devastated and, in many instances, virtually destroyed. We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-us-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-could-be-eased-commerce-chief-says/7994422.html	2025-03-02T11:38:12-08:00	
10 gunmen, 1 soldier killed in northern Benin attack	Cotonou, Benin — Clashes in Benin over the last week between armed groups and the military left 10 dead, including one soldier, as the West African country faces an uptick in attacks on army positions. While the country's economic capital Cotonou, in the south, continues to draw in international tourists, Benin's poorer north has for years now seen such attacks, often blamed by the government on jihadi groups seeking to extend their reach from neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger. Overnight Thursday into Friday, the army launched 'an offensive operation' that led to 'the neutralization of nine terrorists,' a source close to the military high command told AFP on Saturday. The operation — which a local source said took place in the commune of Karimama — came after an improvised explosive device left one soldier dead and two others injured in nearby Kantoro. Both communities are near the border with Niger. While the border near Burkina Faso remains the epicenter of such attacks, communities near the Niger border have seen an uptick in violence recently. 'Offensive aerial operations aided by those on the ground resulted in the destruction of an important logistics hub' belonging to unnamed 'terrorists,' an officer told AFP, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Long-running insurgencies in Burkina Faso and Niger have seen Islamic State and Al Qaida-linked groups seize swathes of rural territory, often capitalizing on long-simmering ethnic or local political disputes as well as weak state presence. Attacks in Benin's north have led observers to worry of a spillover of violence in the country. In February, six Beninese soldiers were killed by unidentified gunmen. The army killed 17 assailants in response. The month before, 28 soldiers were killed in an attack claimed by the Al Qaida-linked group to support Islam and Muslims. A diplomatic source told AFP earlier this year that 121 Beninese military personnel had been killed between 2021 and December 2024. In January 2022, Benin deployed nearly 3,000 troops to secure its borders as part of Operation Mirador. The country's authorities also recruited 5,000 additional personnel to reinforce security in the north. On Thursday, the United States and Benin signed a bilateral cooperation agreement 'strengthening collaboration between the Beninese Armed Forces (FAB) and the U.S. Army,' the American Embassy said. Some researchers argue, however, that military-heavy responses in the region have largely failed to solve the underlying political tensions that militant groups have used to justify their campaigns and bring in recruits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-1-soldier-killed-in-northern-benin-attack/7994426.html	2025-03-02T11:32:02-08:00	
8 dead in India avalanche as rescue operation ends	Dehradun, India — Rescuers recovered the eighth and final body from the site of an avalanche in a remote area of northern India, the army said Sunday, marking the end of a marathon operation in sub-zero temperatures. More than 50 workers were submerged under snow and debris after the avalanche hit a construction camp Friday near Mana village on the border with Tibet in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. Authorities had revised down the number of workers on site at the time of the avalanche from 55 to 54 after one worker, previously believed to be buried, was found to have safely made his way home before the avalanche hit. The army used a drone-based detection system to assist in its search operations. Multiple drones and a rescue dog were also employed. Construction worker Anil, who only gave his first name, recalled his rescue hours after being buried by the avalanche. 'It was if God's angels had come to save us,' Anil, who is in his late 20s, told AFP on Sunday by phone from his hospital bed. 'The way we were engulfed in snow, we had no hope of surviving.' Being alive now felt 'like a dream,' he said. Not all made it Working on a project by the Border Roads Organization, the workers were living on site in steel containers considered stronger than tents and capable of withstanding harsh weather. Anil said many workers were fast asleep and a few others were in makeshift toilets when the avalanche struck around 6 a.m. local time Friday. As the ground beneath them shook, the container in which Anil and his colleagues were in began to slide down. 'At first we did not understand what was happening but when we looked out of the window of the containers, we saw piles of snow all around,' he said. 'The roof of the containers was also slowly bending inwards.' Everyone started screaming for help and a few men were lucky to get out of their containers. 'But not all of them made it out and they remained trapped,' he said. Like thunder His colleague Vipan Kumar thought 'this was the end' when he found himself unable to move as he struggled for air under the thick layer of snow. 'I heard a loud roar, like thunder ... before I could react, everything went dark,' he told the Times of India newspaper. At an altitude of more than 3,200 meters (10,500 feet), minimum temperatures in the area were down to minus 12 degrees Celsius (10 degrees Fahrenheit). Dhan Singh Bisht said his son and nephew were alive only because of the prompt action by the relief teams. 'I am grateful to them,' an overwhelmed Bisht told AFP by phone Saturday. Avalanches and landslides are common in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, especially during the winter season. Scientists say climate change is making weather events more severe, while the increased pace of development in the fragile Himalayan regions has also heightened fears about the fallout from deforestation and construction. In 2021, nearly 100 people died in Uttarakhand after a huge glacier chunk fell into a river, triggering flash floods. And devastating monsoon floods and landslides in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of development projects in the state.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-india-avalanche-as-rescue-operation-ends/7994421.html	2025-03-02T11:22:40-08:00	
In address to Congress, Argentine president promises IMF deal, lauds economic wins	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Argentina’s libertarian president, Javier Milei, signaled late Saturday that a new deal with the International Monetary Fund was imminent, as he used his annual address to Congress to project an optimistic picture of his economic overhaul following a divisive first year in office and recent swirl of controversies. In a speech that played to the sentiments of his right-wing base but included little in the way of new policy, Milei promised the crisis-stricken nation that, in the coming days, he would 'ask Congress to support the government in this new agreement with the International Monetary Fund' even as it seemed Argentina had yet to close the deal. Revisiting the economic themes of his 2023 presidential campaign ahead of crucial midterm elections in October, Milei declared: 'We went from talking about hyperinflation to talking about long-term stability.' He cited his standard refrain about the government’s success in dragging down the monthly inflation rate from a peak of 26% in December 2023, when he entered office, to just over 2% in January, and in helping the country claw its way out of a painful recession. 'We have gone from being a global laughingstock ... to being an unexpected protagonist,' Milei said. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who waved a chainsaw gifted by Milei at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week in Washington, has cited the Argentine president’s approach as inspiration for his own rampage through American federal bureaucracy. 'The eyes of the world are now on Argentina after a long time,' he said. 'As is the case of Elon.' On trade policy, Milei announced Argentina would leave the Mercosur bloc of South American nations if needed to clinch a free trade agreement with the United States. It marked Milei's latest effort to align his nation with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration at the expense of Argentina’s previous allies and regional partnerships. 'To take advantage of this historic opportunity, we must be willing to make things more flexible or even, if necessary, to leave Mercosur,' he said. Dangling an IMF deal In his speech, Milei gave no further details about the supposed new financing deal with the Washington-based lender — a program his government has sought for months in order to help lift Argentina's strict capital and currency controls in hopes of reaping the benefits his free-market reforms, which, in 2024, delivered Argentina’s first fiscal surplus in 14 years. Milei said his government would use a cash infusion from the IMF to replenish the central bank’s diminished hard currency reserves, helping prevent a possible run on the peso as Argentina attempts to lift its complex web of capital controls before the year's end. 'This new agreement will give us the tools to pave the way toward a freer and more efficient exchange rate system for all our citizens, to attract greater investments that will translate into lower inflation, greater growth and employment levels,' Milei told Congress. Foreign companies consider the notorious currency controls, which set an official exchange rate and restrict access to dollars in Argentina, to be the greatest impediment to investing in Argentina. The IMF, encouraged by Milei’s progress but wary about the sustainability of his austerity, has been weighing whether to lend more money to troubled Argentina, its largest debtor with a history of defaults that still owes more than $40 billon for its most recent program that ended in December. The fund did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Facing a hostile Congress While Milei's speech couched his successes as wins for the Argentine people, a boycott by members of Argentina’s left-leaning opposition Peronist party, Unión por la Patria, left the typically packed legislative chamber half-empty. The Peronist bloc controls 46% of seats in the Senate and 39% in the lower house — compared with just 10% and 15% respectively for Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party. That Milei’s political opponents remain hostile is no surprise, experts say, as the president pushes at the generally understood limits of executive power to steer around congress. The irascible former rocker and TV personality has brought a softer tone to his negotiations with lawmakers in recent months, borrowing some votes from the former center-right government of Mauricio Macri to ensure the passage of some key initiatives. But Milei has largely relied on decrees and other executive powers to deregulate industries, dissolve ministries, lay off over 40,000 public employees, eliminate public works projects, slash inflation adjustments for pensions and wages and curb the powers of trade unions, among other changes. 'He showed that he can govern the country without congress,' said Sebastián Menescaldi, an economist with the Buenos Aires consultancy firm EcoGo. Last week, Milei inflamed the political opposition by announcing he would bypass the country’s Senate to appoint two Supreme Court justice nominees by decree — one of whom has triggered backlash over accusations of money laundering and illicit enrichment. The appointments were widely criticized as an overreach of executive authority that would ensure favorable rulings on his sweeping reforms whose constitutionality has been questioned in federal courts. As tensions rise between the government and lawmakers, midterm elections in October 2025 will prove crucial. A good result in the ballot would allow Milei 'to make all the changes he wants and not have to make any concessions,' said Menescaldi, warning, 'That could mean he becomes more authoritarian.' Steering clear of scandal In recent weeks, the far-right economist has confronted the biggest crisis in his 14-month-old administration after promoting an unknown cryptocurrency token that shot up after his endorsement and rapidly cratered, prompting dozens of criminal complaints and calls for his impeachment. Federal prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible fraud and abuse of authority. Milei made no mention of the crypto scandal during his speech Saturday, which lasted more than an hour.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-address-to-congress-argentine-president-milei-promises-imf-deal-and-lauds-economic-wins-/7994399.html	2025-03-02T10:44:36-08:00	
Russia-Ukraine war remains deeply unsettled	The state of Russia’s three-year war against Ukraine remained deeply unsettled Sunday, with the U.S. saying it does not know whether peace is possible while European leaders met in London to voice their ongoing support for Kyiv’s forces. The new developments came two days after Friday’s explosive Washington meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that devolved into an intense confrontation as the U.S. leader ordered his counterpart to leave the White House and a prospective U.S.-Ukraine rare earth minerals deal was left unsigned. 'We need a very radical reset,' Lord Peter Mandelson, the British ambassador to the United States, told ABC’s 'This Week' show. No peace negotiations are scheduled. Mandelson’s assessment came as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer convened a group of more than a dozen European leaders, alongside Zelenskyy, to pledge their continuing arms support for Ukraine’s fighters even as the U.S. wavers. Starmer, as he sat next to Zelenskyy and in front of the flags of Ukraine and European nations, said it was 'a once-in-a-generation moment for the security of Europe and we all need to step up.' 'I hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes, everyone around this table,' Starmer told the Ukraine leader. 'We need to agree what steps come out of this meeting to deliver peace through strength for the benefit of all.' But Trump told Zelenskyy on Friday he was only welcome to return to the White House 'when he is ready for Peace.' Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, speaking about Zelenskyy, told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show, 'What was not clear to us was whether he shared our goal of ending this war. It was not clear he was ready to go to peace.' Waltz said that eventually Russia and Ukraine will have to make negotiating concessions to reach a peace deal. 'There will be all kinds of carrots and sticks to get this done,' he said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also stressed the importance of both sides coming to the negotiating table. 'We are trying to end a war,' Rubio said. 'You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians. And that is the point the president has made. And we have to do whatever we can to try to bring them to the table to see if it's even possible.' 'I'm not promising you it's possible,' he added. 'I'm not telling you it's 90% likely. I'm saying it's 0% likely if we don't get them to a negotiating table. And the sooner everyone grows up around here and figures out that this is a bad war that's heading in a bad direction with death and destruction and all kinds of danger surrounding it that could spiral into a broader conflict, the sooner people grow up and realize that I think the more progress we're going to be able to make.' Starmer said Britain, France and Ukraine have agreed to work on a ceasefire plan to present to the United States. Some European countries have said they are willing to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine to help enforce a would-be peace agreement but need the U.S. to provide backup military support to confront Russia in the event President Vladimir Putin agrees to a ceasefire and then violates it or launches a new invasion. Trump has rejected sending such U.S. support and said he trusts Putin to honor any settlement of the war that he agrees to. Starmer’s summit has been overshadowed by the extraordinary Friday’s Oval office meeting that turned into a heated exchange, as Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance unleashed on Zelenskyy, accusing him of being ungrateful for the U.S. war support. Zelenskyy has on numerous occasions thanked the United States, its chief wartime benefactor. He did so again on social media after the Friday meeting. In advance of the discussions with his European counterparts, Starmer said he is focused on trying to re-engage with Trump, Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, rather than 'ramp up the rhetoric.' 'We’ve now agreed that the United Kingdom, along with France and possibly one or two others, will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and then we’ll discuss that plan with the United States,' Starmer told the BBC. Starmer and Macron have both spoken to Trump since Friday. Starmer said he does not trust Putin but does trust Trump. 'Do I believe Donald Trump when he says he wants lasting peace? The answer to that is yes,' he said. Starmer said there are 'intense discussions' to get a security guarantee from the U.S. as one of several components for a lasting peace. 'If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then Putin comes again,' Starmer said. 'That has happened in the past, I think it is a real risk, and that is why we must ensure that if there’s a deal, it is a lasting deal, not a temporary pause.'

Taliban refute Trump’s claim of Chinese control over Afghan base as ‘emotional’	Islamabad — Taliban officials have denied President Donald Trump’s recent assertions that China holds control over a crucial former U.S.-operated military base in Afghanistan. The sprawling Bagram Air Base in question, situated about 44 kilometers north of the national capital of Kabul, served as the central command for the 20-year U.S.-led military campaign in the country until all U.S. and NATO troops withdrew in August 2021 and Taliban insurgents reclaimed power 'They should refrain from making emotional statements based on unsubstantiated information,' Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told their official broadcaster when asked for a response to Trump’s claims that China currently controls the air base. 'Bagram is controlled by the Islamic Emirate [Taliban regime], not China. Chinese troops are not present here, nor do we have any such pact with any country,' Mujahid said in the interview broadcast on Saturday night. 'We request that Trump's team [of advisors] explain to him and correct his information about Afghanistan.' Trump negotiated the troop withdrawal deal with the Taliban insurgency in February 2020 during his previous term in office, but it was executed under President Joe Biden. Trump claimed during his election campaign speeches that Bagram was under the control of China’s People’s Liberation Army, and he reiterated it before his first Cabinet meeting last Wednesday, saying Biden should have kept control of the former U.S. base. Beijing has increased cooperation with Taliban-run Afghanistan since the U.S. troop exit but vehemently denied any military presence in the country. 'We were going to get out, but we were going to keep Bagram, not because of Afghanistan but because of China, because it’s exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles,' Trump stated in his Wednesday remarks. 'And you know who’s occupying it right now? China. Biden gave it up,' he said. The U.S. president criticized the previous administration for what he described as the 'badly handled' military withdrawal, saying the departing troops left behind billions of dollars' worth of equipment. Trump stated that the Taliban were selling U.S.-made gear, making Afghanistan 'one of the biggest' sellers of military equipment in the world. 'Can you believe it? They’re selling 777,000 rifles, 70,000 armor-plated …trucks and vehicles — 70,000 … This is 70,000 vehicles we had there, and we left it for them. I think we should get it back,' the president said. Trump pledged to reclaim U.S. military equipment from the Taliban if Washington were to allocate 'billions of dollars' in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. 'And if we’re doing that, I think they should give our equipment back. And I told Pete to study that,' the president said, pointing to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sitting beside him. Mujahid responded to Trump’s claims on Saturday, stating that the military equipment had been provided to the U.S.-backed former government in Kabul and now belongs to the Taliban as 'spoils of war.' Mujahid added that the Taliban use the weapons to defend Afghanistan and will be utilized to counter any intervention aimed at taking them back. Mujahid stated that if the United States insists on reclaiming military equipment, Kabul will rightfully expect substantial war reparations for the consequences Afghans have endured over the past two decades of conflict. A U.S. Department of Defense report found that Washington provided $18.6 billion of equipment to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces from 2005 to 2021. About $7 billion worth of hardware remained in Afghanistan during the troop exit, including aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment, and other materials. John Sopko, the former U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, dismissed the idea of retrieving American military equipment as 'pointless.' He spoke at a security dialogue regarding the ongoing Afghan political and social crisis, stating that a significant amount of U.S. weaponry had been provided to former Afghan national defense forces, but much of it has either been destroyed or is now in disrepair. 'The cost of retrieving this equipment would exceed its actual value,' Sopko told the two-day event, organized by the independent Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies in Spain.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-refute-trump-s-claim-of-chinese-control-over-afghan-base-as-emotional-/7994356.html	2025-03-02T09:32:12-08:00	
Oscars take the stage on Sunday with best picture up for grabs	LOS ANGELES — The Academy Awards, the highest honors in the film business, take place on Sunday with no clear frontrunner among 'Anora,' 'The Brutalist,' 'Conclave' and other movies contending for the prestigious best picture prize. Timothee Chalamet and Demi Moore are vying for their first Oscars at the red-carpet ceremony in Hollywood. The show will air live on Walt Disney's ABC network starting at 4 p.m. Pacific time (0000 GMT on Monday). Comedian and host Conan O'Brien said he planned to mix jokes, celebrations of filmmakers and serious moments including tributes to Los Angeles as it recovers from January's wildfires. He likely will address U.S. politics but not dwell on it, he said. 'Good jokes are really important, but there's also more than that,' O'Brien told reporters last week as he prepared for his first Oscars hosting gig. 'We're trying to go for different tones, different textures.' This year's Oscars race has featured twists and turns, and no movie has dominated the precursor film awards. That will keep the drama going until the end of Sunday's show. Any of three films could score best picture, according to Oscars pundits. One is 'Anora,' the story of a sex worker with a shot at a Cinderella story. The other two are 'The Brutalist,' about a Jewish immigrant and architect chasing the American dream, and 'Conclave,' which imagines the secret proceedings for choosing a pope. Others in the best picture field include blockbuster musical 'Wicked,' a prequel to 'The Wizard of Oz,' and 'A Complete Unknown,' the Bob Dylan biopic starring Chalamet. Netflix musical 'Emilia Perez' heads into the ceremony with the most nominations. But its chances of victory dwindled when offensive social media posts surfaced from star Karla Sofia Gascon. The actress, the first openly transgender person nominated for an acting Oscar, disappeared from the awards circuit but is expected to attend Sunday's ceremony. Her co-star, Zoe Saldana, is the favorite to win the supporting actress trophy for playing a fixer who helps a Mexican drug lord (Gascon) transition to a woman and start a new life. Winners of the gold Oscar statuettes are chosen by the roughly 11,000 actors, producers, directors and film craftspeople who make up the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Behind the glitz, Hollywood is fighting a battle to keep its place at the center of the global film business. None of the 10 best picture contenders were filmed in Los Angeles, home to most major film companies for more than a century. Supporting actor nominee Kieran Culkin is the favorite for his role as a man who travels with his cousin to Poland to study family history in 'A Real Pain.' Best actor could go to either Chalamet or 'The Brutalist' star Adrien Brody, according to awards experts. Brody became the youngest best actor winner when he landed the prize at age 29 for 'The Pianist' in 2002. Chalamet is nine months younger than Brody was at the time. Best actress is widely expected to go to Moore for 'The Substance,' though one pundit said the category could produce an upset win for Brazil's Fernanda Torres of 'I'm Still Here.' The academy has increased its international membership, which could favor Torres, said Ian Sandwell, movies editor at Digital Spy. 'She could well be a surprise and the only one to take it away from Demi on the night,' Sandwell said. Producers scrapped the annual tradition of having musicians perform each of the nominated original songs, saying they wanted to focus instead on the songwriters. They do promise many musical moments, including a performance by 'Wicked' stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo and a tribute to music producer Quincy Jones, who died in November. Also, expect some previously unannounced guests. 'We absolutely love the element of surprise,' executive producer Raj Kapoor said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oscars-take-the-stage-on-sunday-with-best-picture-up-for-grabs/7994247.html	2025-03-02T07:33:08-08:00	
Iran's parliament ousts economy minister over economic mismanagement	DUBAI — Iran's parliament voted on Sunday to remove the country's Economy Minister Abdolnaser Hemmati from office over mismanagement of the economy and a plunging national currency, state media reported. The parliament has ousted Hemmati in a no-confidence vote almost eight months after President Masoud Pezeshkian appointed his Cabinet. Over the eight-month period, Iran’s currency has lost close to half of its value against the U.S. dollar, according to unofficial websites, such as alanchand.com. The Iranian rial now trades at 927,000 to the U.S. dollar, against 595,500 in August of last year. Parliamentarians opposing Hemmati argued that he had failed to prevent price increases in basic goods such as medicine, food and housing while being unable to control the foreign exchange market, state media said. Hemmati had prioritized ending U.S. sanctions on Iran and removing the country from the Financial Action Task Force’s blacklist, state media said. This was opposed by MPs who believe Tehran should focus on 'neutralizing' sanctions. Hemmati's supporters said it was not the right time to remove the economy minister as Iran remained under U.S. sanctions and replacing him would cause further instability, according to state media. The economy is the top challenge for Iran's ruling clerics, who fear a revival of protests by lower and middle-income communities angry at growing poverty that have erupted since 2017. U.S. President Donald Trump has reinstated his 'maximum pressure' campaign aiming to cut Iran's oil exports to zero. In the vote, 182 parliament members backed the no-confidence motion on Hemmati, while 89 voted against the measure, according to state media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-parliament-ousts-economy-minister-over-economic-mismanagement-/7994152.html	2025-03-02T04:26:57-08:00	
US aircraft carrier arrives in South Korea, days after North test-fired missiles	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A U.S. aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea on Sunday in a show of force, days after North Korea test-launched cruise missiles to demonstrate its counterattack capabilities. The arrival of the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group at the South Korean port of Busan was meant to display a solid U.S-South Korean military alliance in the face of persistent North Korean threats, and boost interoperability of the allies' combined assets, the South Korean navy said in a statement. It said it was the first U.S. aircraft carrier to travel to South Korea since June. The deployment of the carrier is expected to infuriate North Korea, which views temporary deployments of such powerful U.S. military assets as major security threats. North Korea has responded to some of the past deployments of U.S. aircraft carriers, long-range bombers and nuclear-powered submarines with missile tests. Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Donald Trump has said he will reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again to revive diplomacy. North Korea hasn't directly responded to Trump's overture but alleged U.S.-led hostilities against North Korea have intensified since Trump's inauguration. North Korea said Friday it test-fired strategic cruise missiles earlier last week to inform its adversaries of its military's counterattack capability and the readiness of its nuclear operations. After watching the launches, the North's fourth missile testing event this year, Kim ordered his military to be fully ready to use its nuclear weapons. Experts say Kim won't likely accept Trump's overture anytime soon as he is now focusing on his support of Russia's war against Ukraine with provision of weapons and troops. They say Kim could consider resuming diplomacy with Trump when he thinks he cannot maintain his country's current booming cooperation with Russia. Kim and Trump met three times from 2018 to 2019 during Trump's first term to discuss the future of North Korea's nuclear program. Their high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aircraft-carrier-arrives-in-south-korea-days-after-north-test-fired-missiles-/7994087.html	2025-03-02T00:52:31-08:00	
Pope Francis stable in hospital, had peaceful night, Vatican says	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is in a stable condition as he fights double pneumonia in hospital for the 17th day, and is resting having had a peaceful night, the Vatican said on Sunday. The Vatican said on Saturday evening that the 88-year-old pontiff's condition had stabilized, following an 'isolated' breathing crisis a day earlier. 'The night was peaceful, the pope is still resting,' said a one-line note from the Vatican on Sunday morning that did not provide more details. A full medical update on the pope's condition is expected Sunday evening. Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 with severe respiratory problems that swiftly degenerated into double pneumonia - a serious infection in both lungs that can inflame and scar them, making it difficult to breathe. The pope suffered a constriction of his respiratory airways on Friday, akin to an asthma attack. However, in a more upbeat tone on Saturday, the Vatican said the pope did not have a fever and did not show signs of an increased white blood cell count, adding that his blood flow and circulation remained stable. An elevated white blood cell count often indicates the presence of an active infection or inflammation. 'The Holy Father's clinical condition remained stable,' the Vatican said on Saturday, adding that the prognosis was still guarded, meaning he was not yet out of danger. The Vatican added on Saturday that for a second day running the pope required noninvasive, mechanical ventilation, alternating between this and 'long periods of high-flow oxygen therapy.' Francis has experienced several bouts of ill health over the last two years and is prone to lung infections because he had pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed. The pope has not been seen in public since entering hospital, his longest absence from view since his papacy started in March 2013, and his doctors have not said how long his treatment might last. Francis will not lead his usual Sunday prayer with pilgrims for the third week running. The text of the prayer will be published rather than read out by the pontiff.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7994084.html	2025-03-02T00:31:47-08:00	
Uganda reports second Ebola death, a 4-year-old, WHO says	KAMPALA, UGANDA — A second Ebola patient, a 4-year-old child, has died in Uganda, the World Health Organization said, citing the country’s health ministry. The fatality brings the number of confirmed cases in Uganda to 10. The East African country declared an outbreak of the highly infectious and often fatal hemorrhagic disease in January after the death of a male nurse at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in the capital of Kampala. The WHO's Uganda office posted late on Saturday on X that the ministry had reported 'an additional positive case in Mulago hospital of a 4 1/2-year-old child, who tragically passed away' on Tuesday. Mulago is the country's sole national referral hospital for Ebola cases. The ministry said on Feb. 18 that all eight Ebola patients under care had been discharged but that at least 265 contacts remained under strict quarantine in Kampala and two other cities. Ebola symptoms include fever, headache and muscle pains. The virus is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-reports-second-ebola-death-a-4-year-old-who-says/7994079.html	2025-03-01T23:56:37-08:00	
Uruguay's new leftist president takes office	MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY — Yamandu Orsi, a telegenic left-leaning former mayor and history teacher, took office as Uruguay's new president on Saturday, at the helm of a government that has pledged to strengthen the social safety net while reversing years of economic stagnation. The inauguration of Orsi, 57, marks the return of Uruguay’s Broad Front — a center-left mix of moderates, communists and hardline trade unionists — after a five-year interruption by the country’s outgoing conservative president, Luis Lacalle Pou. Cheers erupted as Orsi recited the oath of office before Congress on Saturday in Uruguay’s capital of Montevideo. Outside the chamber, in the city's main square, thousands of Uruguayans watching his swearing-in on giant screens shouted in support. A civilized race The ceremony came three months after Orsi's presidential victory in a remarkably civilized election race between two moderates, praised as an antidote to the polarization gripping the region. In his speech, he took a dig at growing disillusionment with democratic norms across Latin America, which has resulted in a shift to the right, from neighboring Argentina to El Salvador. 'We all know well that we have to treasure our democratic construction in times where exclusionary logic and expressions of distrust in traditional politics proliferate,' Orsi said in his inaugural address before a gathering of domestic and foreign leaders at the legislative palace in Montevideo. He declared: 'Let us always be adversaries, but never enemies. And let us distance ourselves as far as possible from cynicism.' The night before the ceremony, Orsi dined in Montevideo with his like-minded regional counterparts, including Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Colombia's Gustavo Petro and Chile's Gabriel Boric. The friendly scene cemented Orsi as the latest in the region's swath of allied left-wing leaders — many of whom have struggled in recent years to combat rising inequality and stalling growth. Many Uruguayans saw Orsi as the nostalgia candidate, recalling the Broad Front's 15-year rule between 2005 and 2020. During that time, the coalition presided over a historic cycle of economic growth that reduced poverty and cemented the country's pro-business reputation. The coalition also launched pioneering social reforms that won Uruguay international acclaim, including the legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and recreational marijuana. Problems emerge But in 2020, emerging problems like creeping inequality and surging crime ushered in Lacalle Pou’s center-right government on promises of reforming the bloated state. Last year, public frustration over the persistence of those problems helped bring Lacalle Pou’s tenure to an end, as an anti-incumbent wave swept across the globe. A cautious campaigner, Orsi — the former mayor of Canelones, an oceanfront district known for its cattle ranches and high-tech — vowed to implement 'safe change' for Uruguay’s 3.5 million people. Now he faces a difficult balancing act — between satisfying the demands of his more radical leftist constituents, which have called for unwinding some of the previous government's cost-cutting measures, while boosting competitiveness to spur much-needed economic development. 'The country needs to recover a path of growth that generates not only a greater quantity but also quality of work,' he said. 'That allows a floor of salary dignity and, with it, a better distribution of income.' With a fractious coalition, experts say many of Orsi's positions will become clear only after he takes office and is forced to make hard policy choices. A ‘watch-and-see attitude’ 'The business community is taking a watch-and-see attitude until it’s clear whether Orsi is in charge or whether his more aggressive leftist base is in charge,' said Uruguayan economist Arturo C. Porzecanski, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. 'If Orsi doesn’t come out on top and measures that set the clock back get passed, then that will dim the economic outlook for the coming years.' Keeping a tight budget will make it difficult to meet expectations of the unionists that promoted a controversial referendum to increase pensions and reverse the former government’s decision to raise the legal retirement age from 60 to 65. Orsi acknowledged the challenge in his speech, saying: 'A lot of dialogue, an outstretched hand and the ability to understand the different sensitivities expressed by our community will be necessary.' Last fall, Uruguayans shot down the proposed pension overhaul. Many praised the vote's outcome as a rare, level-headed rejection of budget-busting populism that has long beset the region. But union leaders — and their supporters, like Orsi’s Communist labor minister — have continued to press their demands, challenging Uruguay's investor-friendly reputation. 'The diagnosis is concerning when it comes to workers and their commitment to resolving disputes,' Labor Minister Juan Castillo said last week, as powerful trade unions called a mass strike and multinational Japanese auto-part maker Yazaki shut down operations in Uruguay, citing high labor and production costs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uruguay-s-new-leftist-president-takes-office/7994077.html	2025-03-01T23:49:23-08:00	
European leaders look to boost support for Ukraine at London summit	LONDON — More than a dozen European leaders gather in London on Sunday for crisis talks, looking to boost security cooperation and support for Ukraine after an astonishing blowout between Kyiv and Washington. Ukraine's allies have been underscoring their steadfast commitment to counter growing concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump is about to sell Kyiv short in negotiations with Russia. The day after he was kicked out of the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was warmly welcomed to Downing Street on Saturday. He twice embraced the British prime minister in front of cameras and secured a loan to strengthen defenses depleted by more than three years of fending off Russia's invasion. 'I thank the people and government of the United Kingdom for their tremendous support from the very beginning of this war,' Zelenskyy said. 'We are happy to have such strategic partners and to share the same vision of what a secure future should look like for all.' He is due to meet King Charles III on Sunday before joining a cohort of European allies at a security summit. The meeting brings together leaders from around continental Europe, including France, Germany, Denmark and Italy as well as Turkey, NATO and the European Union. 'Now is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security, and secure our collective future,' U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. Downing Street said Sunday's summit would again stress the need for a 'strong lasting deal that delivers a permanent peace' and discuss 'next steps on planning for strong security guarantees.' With fears growing over whether the United States will continue to support NATO, the gathering in the U.K. will also address the need for Europe to increase defense cooperation. 'Very welcome' As Zelenskyy's convoy swept into London on Saturday, a crowd of supporters cheered. 'You're very, very welcome here in Downing Street,' Starmer told Zelenskyy before their 75-minute closed-door talks. The pair discussed Ukraine's position and how to end the war 'with a lasting and just peace ... that will not allow Russia to use the ceasefire to rearm and attack again,' according to a statement released by Zelenskyy's office. They also unveiled a $2.84 billion loan agreement to support Ukraine's defense capabilities, to be paid back with the profits of immobilized sovereign Russian assets. 'The funds will be directed toward weapons production in Ukraine,' Zelenskyy said. 'This is true justice -- the one who started the war must be the one to pay.' While in London he said he was 'happy' to 'have such strategic partners and to share the same vision of what a secure future should look like for all.' Just hours earlier, Zelenskyy was being shouted down at the White House. As cameras rolled in the Oval Office, Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance angrily accused Zelenskyy of not being 'thankful' and refusing to accept their proposed truce terms. Trump also accused him of ingratitude and gambling with the potential of World War III. Zelenskyy meanwhile insisted there should be 'no compromises' with Putin as the parties negotiate to end the war. 'Strategic partners' Trump has alarmed Kyiv and European allies with his abrupt pivoting of Washington's yearslong support for Ukraine. The recently inaugurated Republican has cast himself as a mediator between Putin and Zelenskyy, and has sidelined Kyiv and Europe while pursuing rapprochement with Putin. In the Oval Office, Trump said that he had 'spoken on numerous occasions' to Putin -- more than has been publicly reported. Last week, after meeting with Starmer in Washington, Trump said there had been 'a lot of progress' toward a deal to end the conflict in Ukraine and that negotiations were at a crucial stage. Though he refused to apologize after the White House clash, Zelenskyy indicated that he was still open to signing a deal on Ukraine's mineral wealth that is coveted by Trump, insisting that 'despite the tough dialogue' Ukraine and the United States 'remain strategic partners.' 'But we need to be honest and direct with each other to truly understand our shared goals,' the Ukrainian leader wrote on X. Russia's former president, Dmitry Medvedev, meanwhile called Zelenskyy an 'insolent pig' who had received 'a proper slap down in the Oval Office.' Moscow branded Zelenskyy's Washington trip as a 'complete failure' while Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock accused Trump of 'switching ... the roles of victim and aggressor' in the conflict. 'Yesterday evening underlined that a new age of infamy has begun,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-leaders-look-to-boost-support-for-ukraine-at-london-summit/7994073.html	2025-03-01T23:39:43-08:00	
Bernd das Brot,' a depressed German loaf of bread, has spent 25 years as a TV cult classic	berlin — Forget SpongeBob SquarePants, Sesame Street and the sourdough starter craze — a depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children's television program that accidentally became equally popular with adults. A cult classic in Germany, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread) is a puppet renowned for his deep, gloomy voice, his perpetual pessimism and his signature expression, 'Mist!' (Think 'Crap!' in English.) Played and voiced by puppeteer Jorg Teichgraeber, Bernd is a television presenter who wants nothing to do with TV and can't wait to go home to stare at the wallpaper. This year, his friends — a sheep and a flower bush — are urging him to become a bread influencer. Born as a sketch on the back of a napkin in a pizzeria, Bernd was drawn by Tommy Krappweis, who modeled it after co-creator Norman Coster's face. The duo had been asked to come up with mascots for KiKA, a German children's public television channel. Comic artist Georg Graf von Westphalen designed Bernd as a pullman loaf — white bread typically sliced for sandwiches — with short arms and a permanent scowl. Bernd channels German stereotypes with his grumpy disposition, penchant for complaining, and dry sense of humor and irony. Bernd's first episode aired on KiKA in 2000 alongside his more optimistic pals, Chili the Sheep and Briegel the Bush. A reluctant popularity Because KiKA is a children's channel, there was typically dead air from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. On Jan. 1, 2003, the network put Bernd's short episodes into the night loop for the first time. The move brought an adult audience into Bernd's world, often those sitting at home and smoking pot, or returning after a long night of partying. The night loop cemented his popularity as a German cult classic. In 2004, Bernd won the Adolf Grimme Prize, the German television equivalent of an Emmy. The jury said he represents 'the right to be in a bad mood.' 'Bernd shows you that you are less vulnerable with humor and self-irony. And perhaps the most important point is: It's totally OK if you don't feel well sometimes. That's completely fine,' Krappweis said in a KiKA Q&A about Bernd's anniversary. Bernd's broken heart Bernd is depressed for a multitude of reasons, including his failed attempt to be the mascot for a bakery's advertising campaign (that's how he ended up as a TV presenter, as a last resort). But it's in Episode 85 that we finally learn about Bernd's broken heart. 'A long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so incredibly charming and funny,' Bernd tells Chili and Briegel. But unfortunately it was in vain. 'She only had eyes for this run-of-the-mill multigrain bread with its 10 types of grain. It was so depressing.' The kidnapping Despite Bernd's best efforts — one of his catchphrases is 'I would like to leave this show' — the episodes have never become stale. He sings, he dances, he's been to space. He's the star of merchandise, a video game and headlines like 'Give Us Our Daily Bernd.' He was even kidnapped. In 2009, his 2-meter-tall statue was stolen from his traditional place outside the town hall in Erfurt, where KiKA is based. A claim of responsibility surfaced on YouTube, by sympathizers of a group of demonstrators who were protesting a company that had produced cremation ovens for the Nazis' Auschwitz extermination camp. The demonstrators, however, denied involvement in Bernd's kidnapping, and the video was removed from the internet. Bernd was held hostage for nearly two weeks before being discovered unharmed in an abandoned barracks. KiKA is honoring Bernd's 25th anniversary, despite his complaints. New episodes, an update to his hit song, and online activities for kids and adults alike will be featured. The celebrations are at hand, as Bernd's birthday is Feb. 29. The latest series will premiere in September as Bernd, Chili and Briegel launch the social media channel 'Better with Bernd' in their efforts to make him into a bread influencer. The trio will present inventions to make school, and life, easier for viewers, but naturally their concoctions backfire. Bernd instead becomes a defluencer — and an involuntary trendsetter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bernd-das-brot-a-depressed-german-loaf-of-bread-has-spent-25-years-as-a-tv-cult-classic/7993402.html	2025-03-01T23:26:34-08:00	
Ghana's first female world boxing champion smashes barriers	ACCRA, GHANA — When Abigail Kwartekaa Quartey decided as a teenager to become a professional boxer – an unusual choice for a young woman in a working-class neighborhood of Ghana's capital of Accra – her family begged her to stop training. Boxing is the pride of Jamestown, which is based around the fishing industry and also known for being home to many boxing stars. But like most sports in Ghana, boxing has often been seen as for men only, and women are discouraged from taking part. But Quartey persisted. And last year, at age 27, she became Ghana's first female world boxing champion and the first woman to travel the world as a member of the West African nation's national team. 'My aunts and siblings didn't like it when I started boxing. They would come here to beg my coach not to let me become a boxer,' she said at the Jamestown neighborhood's Black Panthers Gym where Quartey has been training since her teenage years. But when last November Quartey defeated British boxer Sangeeta Birdi in Jamestown's main boxing area, winning the WIBF World Super Bantamweight title, crowds of friends and supporters from the neighborhood celebrated wildly, seemingly forgetting about the prejudice against female boxers. Triumph after challenges Ghanaian media pronounced her win 'history,' but Quartey is quick to point out that she is by no means the first female boxer in Ghana. 'There were women in boxing before I ventured into boxing,' she said. But they weren't allowed to travel outside the country, she added. Quartey's long road to this spectacular victory highlights the many challenges that female athletes in African countries face in their careers. Quartey grew up in Jamestown and, as a teenager, sold rice with her aunt to help the family make ends meet. The only people who supported her boxing dream were her brother, a fellow boxer, and her coach. In 2017, she stopped boxing and started selling lottery tickets to earn money. It took a lot of convincing from her coach to get her back into the ring in 2021. She could not afford a manager, and feared she would not make it without one. In Ghana, she said, 'female boxers do not receive much support and it is difficult to keep training.' 'Big deal' for everyone Sarah Lotus Asare, a boxing coach and the project lead for the Girls Box Tournament, said Quartey's world title meant a lot for all boxers in Ghana. 'Even for the male boxers, when they fight with non-Africans, it's very difficult for them to win, because they have a lot more facilities and equipment than we do,' she said. Quartey's title is 'a big deal for her, the gym, the community, Ghana, Africa and the world at large,' said her coach, Ebenezer 'Coach Killer' Adjei, as he watched her train during an afternoon session at the Black Panthers Gym. Inspiring others But for Quartey, what counts the most is the impact on young women from her neighborhood. She wants more women to become professional athletes. 'I am a world title holder and that confirms that what a man can do, a woman can also do,' she said.

Cuba's cigar fair showcases humidors as the new object of desire	HAVANA — Cuba's legendary cigars, hand-rolled from the finest tobacco leaves, have long captivated connoisseurs, and now a growing number of enthusiasts recognize the vital importance of humidors, those meticulously crafted boxes that help preserve their quality and longevity. More than mere containers, humidors, some true works of art in wood, regulate humidity and temperature, and can cost thousands of dollars. 'Other countries produce humidors, but we create them with passion, just like in the old days,' said Adrián Morán Lipis, of Humidores Clave, one of several workshops showing off their creations at Cuba's annual cigar trade fair that ran through Friday in Havana. Humidor prices range from $200 for basic 25-cigar models to thousands for exclusive pieces. Humidores Clave, for example, showcased a carved black and white humidor valued at $2,000. Last year's festival gala featured a humidor auction — with their respective cigars — that raised a staggering $19.3 million, highlighting the high value placed on these luxury items. Some of the humidors on display at this year's fair resembled iconic buildings, adorned with Cuban flags, intricate train designs, or striking abstract patterns. One particularly eye-catching humidor emulated a shark's fin, soaring over a meter in height. Innovation was also evident, with features like remote-controlled trunks and hidden compartments. Considered as some of the world's finest, Cuban cigars have solidified their position in the premium tobacco market. Habanos S.A., a joint venture between Cubatabaco and Altadis, holds the global monopoly on Cuban cigar sales. In 2024, their sales surged to $827 million, a 16% increase over the previous year, with China, Spain, Switzerland and Great Britain as key markets. The company also hosts the annual Habanos Festival, a key event for collectors, aficionados and distributors worldwide. Attendees tour plantations, participate in seminars and high-stakes auctions, and witness the latest in humidor craftsmanship. 'A humidor is more than a box; it's a special shelter for tobacco,' said José Ernesto Aguilera, a master craftsman whose pieces have been featured in numerous festival auctions. 'Tobacco is a prince, and we build the castle it deserves.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cuba-s-cigar-fair-showcases-humidors-as-the-new-object-of-desire/7991211.html	2025-03-01T23:25:30-08:00	
Morocco urges people to not buy sheep for Eid al-Adha celebrations	OULAD SLAMA, MOROCCO — Sheep come running when Larbi El Ghazouani pours alfalfa and straw into their troughs twice a day. The 55-year-old farmer had counted on selling the bulk of his 130 sheep to Moroccans preparing for early June's Eid Al-Adha holiday, but now his hopes are unraveling and he expects to lose around half of his investment. That's because, in a surprising break from tradition, King Mohammed VI on Wednesday urged Moroccans to forgo buying sheep to be sacrificed during this year's holiday amid record inflation and climate change. A seven-year drought has decimated the country's livestock, causing sheep prices to surge beyond the reach of working class families. 'Performing it (the sacrifice) in these difficult circumstances will cause real harm to large segments of our people, especially those with limited income,' the king, who is also Morocco's highest religious authority, wrote in letter read on state-run Al Aoula television. Drought has driven some of his neighbors to stop breeding livestock, so he said he understood the circumstances that led to the king's decision. He still plans to breed more ewes to be sold before next year's holiday. But for breeders like him, the cancelling of Eid festivities will deal a heavy blow. It costs El Ghazouani roughly 1,500 Moroccan dirhams ($150) to feed a sheep for one year on a diet of straw, alfalfa and fava beans — a 50% spike from only three years ago. Now he and other breeders are preparing to wait. It will be another year of buying feed before they can sell them. 'There's a difference between the years before the drought and what we're suffering today,' he said, tending to sheep on his farm outside the city of Kenitra. 'I wasted money on fodder and made an effort with these sheep.' Eid al-Adha, which takes place this year in early June, is an annual 'feast of sacrifice' in which Muslims slaughter livestock to honor a passage of the Quran in which the prophet Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God, who intervened and replaced the child with a sheep. It's a major holiday from Senegal to Indonesia, with traditions so embedded that families have been known to take out loans to buy sheep. The prices have become so exorbitant that 55% of families surveyed by the Moroccan NGO Moroccan Center for Citizenship last year said they struggled to cover the costs of purchasing sheep and the utensils needed to prepare them. More than 7% of respondents said they either took out loans or borrowed money from acquaintances to buy the sacrificial sheep. The sheep price spikes are driven by increasingly sparse pastures, which offer less grazing room and raise the costs of feed for herders and farmers. Morocco's agricultural minister told reporters earlier this month that rainfall this season was currently 53% below the last 30 years' annual average and sheep and cattle herds had shrunk 38% since 2016, the last time Morocco conducted a livestock census. The price of preferred domestic sheep can often exceed monthly household earnings in Morocco, where the monthly minimum wage remains 3,000 Moroccan dirhams ($302). The country has in recent years subsidized and imported livestock, including from Romania, Spain and Australia, from which it plans to import 100,000 sheep this year. To keep prices steady, Morocco this year removed import duties and VAT on livestock and red meat. It's the first time in 29 years that Morocco has asked citizens to forgo holiday feasting and reflects that food prices remain a struggle for many despite Morocco's transformation from a largely agrarian nation to a mixed economy whose cities have some of the Middle East and Africa's most modern infrastructure. King Hassan II issued similar decrees three times throughout his reign, during wartime, drought and when the IMF mandated Morocco end food subsidies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/morocco-urges-people-to-not-buy-sheep-for-eid-al-adha-celebrations/7993381.html	2025-03-01T23:25:01-08:00	
Coca-Cola's appeal to Palestinians fizzles amid war	SALFIT, WEST BANK — Order a Coke to wash down some hummus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank these days and chances are the waiter will shake his head disapprovingly — or worse, mutter 'shame, shame' in Arabic — before suggesting the popular local alternative: a can of Chat Cola. Chat Cola — its red tin and sweeping white script bearing a remarkable resemblance to the iconic American soft drink's logo — has seen its products explode in popularity across the occupied West Bank in the past year as Palestinian consumers, angry at America's steadfast support for Israel in its war against Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, in Gaza, protest with their pocketbooks. 'No one wants to be caught drinking Coke,' said Mad Asaad, 21, a worker at the bakery-cafe chain Croissant House in the West Bank city of Ramallah, which stopped selling Coke after the war erupted. 'Everyone drinks Chat now. It's sending a message.' Since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered Israel's devastating military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian-led boycott movement against companies perceived as supportive of Israel gained momentum across the Middle East, where the usual American corporate targets like McDonald's, KFC and Starbucks saw sales slide last year. Here in the West Bank, the boycott has shuttered two KFC branches in Ramallah. But the most noticeable expression of consumer outrage has been the sudden ubiquity of Chat Cola as shopkeepers relegate Coke cans to the bottom shelf — or pull them altogether. 'When people started to boycott, they became aware that Chat existed,' Fahed Arar, general manager of Chat Cola, told The Associated Press from the giant red-painted factory, nestled in the hilly West Bank town of Salfit. 'I'm proud to have created a product that matches that of a global company.' With the 'buy local' movement burgeoning during the war, Chat Cola said its sales in the West Bank surged more than 40% last year, compared to 2023. While the companies said they had no available statistics on their command of the local market due to the difficulties of data collection in wartime, anecdotal evidence suggests Chat Cola is clawing at some of Coca-Cola's market share. 'Chat used to be a specialty product, but from what we've seen, it dominates the market,' said Abdulqader Azeez Hassan, 25, the owner of a supermarket in Salfit that boasts fridges full of the fizzy drinks. But workers at Coca-Cola's franchise in the West Bank, the National Beverage Company, are all Palestinian, and a boycott affects them, too, said its general manager, Imad Hindi. He declined to elaborate on the business impact of the boycott, suggesting it can't be untangled from the effects of the West Bank's economic free-fall and intensified Israeli security controls that have multiplied shipping times and costs for Palestinian companies during the war. The Coca-Cola Company did not respond to a request for comment. Whether or not the movement brings lasting consequences, it does reflect an upsurge of political consciousness, said Salah Hussein, head of the Ramallah Chamber of Commerce. 'It's the first time we've ever seen a boycott to this extent,' Hussein said, noting how institutions like the prominent Birzeit University near Ramallah canceled their Coke orders. 'After Oct. 7, everything changed. And after Trump, everything will continue to change.' U.S. President Donald Trump's call for the mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which he rephrased last week as a recommendation, has further inflamed anti-American sentiment around the region. With orders pouring in not only from Lebanon and Yemen but also the United States and Europe, the company has its sights set on the international market, said PR manager Ahmad Hammad. Hired to help Chat Cola cash in on combustible emotions created by the war, Hammad has rebranded what began in 2019 as a niche mom-and-pop operation. 'We had to take advantage of the opportunity,' he said of the company's new 'Palestinian taste' logo and national flag-hued merchandise. In its scramble to satisfy demand, Chat Cola is opening a second production site in neighboring Jordan. It rolled out new candy-colored flavors, like blueberry, strawberry and green apple. At the steamy plant in Salfit, recent college graduates in lab coats said that they took pains to produce a carbonated beverage that could sell on its taste, not just a customer's sense of solidarity with the Palestinians. 'Quality has been a problem with local Palestinian products before,' said Hanna al-Ahmad, 32, the head of quality control for Chat Cola, shouting to be heard over the whir of machines squirting caramel-colored elixir into scores of small cans that then whizzed down assembly lines. 'If it's not good quality, the boycott won't stick.' Chat Cola worked with chemists in France to produce the flavor, which is almost indistinguishable from Coke's — just like its packaging. That's the case for several flavors: Squint at Chat's lemon-lime soda and you might mistake it for a can of Sprite. In 2020, the Ramallah-based National Beverage Company sued Chat Cola for copyright infringement in Palestinian court, contending that Chat had imitated Coke's designs for multiple drinks. The court ultimately sided with Chat Cola, determining there were enough subtle differences in the can designs that it didn't violate copyright law. In the Salfit warehouse, drivers loaded 'family size' packages of soda into trucks bound not only for the West Bank but also for Tel Aviv, Haifa and other cities in Israel. Staffers said that Chat soda sales in Israel's predominantly Arab cities jumped 25% last year. To broaden its appeal in Israel, Chat Cola secured kosher certification after a Jewish rabbi's thorough inspection of the facility. Still, critics of the Palestinians-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS, say that its main objective — to isolate Israel economically for its occupation of Palestinian lands — only exacerbates the conflict. 'BDS and similar actions drive communities apart, they don't help to bring people together,' said Vlad Khaykin, the executive vice president of social impact and partnerships in North America for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization. 'The kind of rhetoric being embraced by the BDS movement to justify the boycott of Israel is really quite dangerous.' While Chat Cola goes out of its way to avoid buying from Israel — sourcing ingredients and materials from France, Italy and Kuwait — it can't avoid the circumstances of Israeli occupation, in which Israel dominates the Palestinian economy, controls borders, imports and more. Deliveries of raw materials to Chat Cola's West Bank factory get hit with a 35% import tax — half of which Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinians. The general manager, Arar, said his company's success depends far more on Israeli bureaucratic goodwill than nationalist fervor. For nearly a month last fall, Israeli authorities detained Chat's aluminum shipments from Jordan at the Allenby Bridge Crossing, forcing part of the factory to shut down and costing the company tens of thousands of dollars. Among the local buyers left in the lurch was Croissant House in Ramallah, where, on a recent afternoon, at least one thirsty customer, confronting a nearly empty refrigerator, slipped to the supermarket next-door for a can of Coke. 'It's very frustrating,' said Asaad, the worker. 'We want to be self-sufficient. But we're not.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/coca-cola-s-appeal-to-palestinians-fizzles-amid-war/7991182.html	2025-03-01T23:24:34-08:00	
Israel to stop entry of all aid and supplies into Gaza Strip	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — Israel said Sunday it is stopping the entry of all goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip. The prime minister's office did not elaborate on the decision but warned of 'additional consequences' if Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, does not accept what Israel says is a U.S. proposal for an extension of the ceasefire. It was not immediately clear if the supply of aid has been completely halted. The first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance, expired on Saturday. The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout and a lasting ceasefire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-to-stop-entry-of-all-aid-and-supplies-into-gaza-strip/7994072.html	2025-03-01T23:22:57-08:00	
Rubio expedites delivery of $4 billion in military aid to Israel	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday he had signed a declaration to expedite delivery of about $4 billion in military assistance to Israel. The Trump administration, which took office on Jan. 20, has approved nearly $12 billion in major foreign military sales to Israel, Rubio said in a statement, adding that it 'will continue to use all available tools to fulfill America’s long-standing commitment to Israel’s security, including means to counter security threats.' Rubio said he had used emergency authority to expedite the delivery of military assistance to Israel, which is now in a fragile ceasefire in its war with Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Hamas started the war with its terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, an attack which left 1,200 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostages. The Israeli military offensive has, since then, killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, more than half of whom have been women and children. The Pentagon said on Friday that the State Department had approved the potential sale of nearly $3 billion worth of bombs, demolition kits and other weaponry to Israel. The administration notified Congress of those prospective weapons sales on an emergency basis, sidestepping a long-standing practice of giving the chairs and ranking members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees the opportunity to review the sale and ask for more information before making a formal notification to Congress. Friday's announcements marked the second time in recent weeks that President Donald Trump's administration has declared an emergency to quickly approve weapons sales to Israel. The Biden administration also used emergency authority to approve the sale of arms to Israel without congressional review. On Monday, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era order requiring it to report potential violations of international law involving U.S.-supplied weapons by allies, including Israel. It has also eliminated most U.S. humanitarian foreign aid. The Jan. 19 Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement halted 15 months of fighting and paved the way for talks on ending the war, while leading to the release of 33 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-expedites-delivery-of-4-billion-in-military-aid-to-israel-/7994060.html	2025-03-01T19:19:35-08:00	
Trump signs order designating English official US language	President Donald Trump signed on Saturday an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States. The order allows government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in language other than English. It rescinds a mandate from former President Bill Clinton that required the government and organizations that received federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers. 'Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society,' according to the order. 'In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream,' the order also states. 'Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society.' More than 30 states have passed laws designating English as their official language, according to U.S. English, a group that advocates for making English the official language in the United States. For decades, lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation to designate English as the official language of the U.S., but those efforts have not succeeded. Within hours of Trump's inauguration last month, the new administration took down the Spanish language version of the official White House website. The White House said at the time it was committed to bringing the Spanish language version of the website back online. As of Saturday, it was still not restored. The White House did not immediately respond to a message about whether that would happen. Trump shut down the Spanish version of the website during his first term. It was restored when President Joe Biden was inaugurated in 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-designating-english-official-us-language/7994047.html	2025-03-01T18:02:49-08:00	
Singer Charli XCX wins top prizes at BRIT Awards	LONDON — Singer Charli XCX, whose album Brat inspired a cultural phenomenon last summer, was the big winner at the BRIT Awards, Britain's pop music honors, in London on Saturday, picking up five prizes. Brat, which inspired fans to film themselves dancing to its tracks and whose lime green cover look was adopted by U.S. presidential hopeful Kamala Harris' campaign on social media after the singer referenced her in a post, won the coveted album of the year category. Charli XCX, who had led nominations, was also named artist of the year and best dance act. Her single Guess, featuring Billie Eilish, won song of the year, beating tracks including the Beatles' Now and Then. The 32-year-old pop star won her first BRIT, songwriter of the year, earlier this week. 'I've always felt like an outsider in the industry but particularly in the British music industry and so it feels really nice to be recognized on this album,' she said as she received the album of the year award. 'I would just like to share this with all artists who have ever felt that they need to compromise to be recognized and to have their moment in the sun because I think I'm living proof that maybe it takes a long time, but ... you don't need to compromise your vision.' Jazz quintet Ezra Collective was named group of the year. 'This moment right here is because of the great youth clubs and great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music,' drummer Femi Koleoso said in one of several of the night's acceptance speeches that called for more support for young musicians and grassroots venues. U.S. singer Chappell Roan won international artist of the year while her track Good Luck, Babe! won international song of the year. Espresso singer Sabrina Carpenter was named as the first international recipient of the global success award, which recognizes artists with 'phenomenal global sales,' following in the footsteps of One Direction, Adele, Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith. The ceremony also featured a tribute dedicated to late One Direction singer Liam Payne, who died in October after falling from a third-floor hotel room balcony in Buenos Aires, shocking fans of the boy band, one of the most popular of all time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singer-charli-xcx-wins-top-prizes-at-brit-awards/7994043.html	2025-03-01T17:39:01-08:00	
Trump orders probe into US lumber imports	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered a new trade investigation that could heap more tariffs on imported lumber, adding to existing duties on Canadian softwood lumber and 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods set to take effect next week. In his third new tariff probe in a week, Trump signed a memo ordering Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to initiate a national security investigation into U.S. lumber imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Trump also used the trade law to impose tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports. The probe covers derivative products made from lumber, which could include items such as kitchen cabinets that in some cases are made of U.S. lumber that had been exported, a White House official said. The official said the investigation would be expedited by the Commerce Department but gave no specific timeline. Trump also ordered new steps to increase the domestic supply of lumber by streamlining the permitting process for harvesting lumber from public lands and improving the salvage of fallen trees from forests and waterways, the official said. A White House fact sheet said the order calls for new or updated agency guidance to facilitate increased timber production, including quicker approvals for forestry projects under the Endangered Species Act. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the lumber import probe would counteract the actions of big lumber exporters including Canada, Germany and Brazil, which he said were 'dumping lumber into our markets at the expense of both our economic prosperity and national security.' The White House official said that increasing reliance on imported lumber represents a possible national security risk partly because the U.S. military consumes significant quantities of lumber for its construction activities and because increasing dependence on imports for a commodity with ample domestic supplies is a danger to the U.S. economy. The official did not provide details on a proposed tariff rate under the Section 232 lumber probe, but Trump earlier this month told reporters that he was thinking about imposing a 25% tariff rate on lumber and forest products. The official said any tariffs resulting from the probe would be added to the existing 14.5% combined anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on Canadian softwood lumber. These duties were the result of a long-running U.S.-Canada trade dispute over Canada's low stumpage fees on public lands, which Washington argues is an unfair subsidy. Most U.S. lumber is harvested from private land at market-determined rates. Home builders have long criticized the tariffs as raising lumber prices and contributing to home price inflation. The official said the new lumber duties also would stack on top of Trump's threatened 25% general U.S. tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods that are scheduled to take effect on Tuesday unless Trump is persuaded by the two countries' efforts to secure their borders and halt fentanyl trafficking. The new tariff probe follows Trump's order on Tuesday for a new Section 232 into copper imports, aimed at rebuilding U.S. production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware and the power grid. On Feb. 21, Trump ordered U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to revive investigations aimed at imposing tariffs on imports from countries that levy digital services taxes on U.S. technology companies. Canada would again be in the firing line for such penalties, along with France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Austria, India and Turkey.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-new-tariff-probe-into-us-lumber-imports-/7994040.html	2025-03-01T17:20:42-08:00	
Israel backs US plan for temporary ceasefire in Gaza; Hamas rejects it	CAIRO — Israel will adopt the proposal by President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza during the Ramadan and Passover periods, the prime minister's office said early Sunday, hours after the first phase of the previously agreed ceasefire was set to expire. On the first day of Witkoff's proposal, half of the hostages held in Gaza, both alive and dead, will be released, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said, adding that the remaining hostages will be released after a permanent ceasefire was agreed. Witkoff made the proposal to extend the current ceasefire after realizing more time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire, Netanyahu's office said. Hazem Qassem, a spokesperson for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, said earlier Saturday the group rejected extending the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, but did not explicitly mention Witkoff's plan. Netanyahu's office said Israel would immediately conduct negotiations on Witkoff's plan if Hamas agreed to it. 'According to the agreement, Israel can return to fighting after the 42nd day if it feels that the negotiations are ineffective,' Netanyahu's office also said, accusing Hamas of violating the deal. Both sides have been trading accusations of violating the deal. Two Palestinian officials familiar with the negotiations told Reuters that Israel refused to enter the second phase of the agreement or start negotiations about it. Instead, Israel requested an extension of the first phase, conditioned on the handover of a number of hostages and bodies for each week of extension. Hamas, however, rejected the request and insisted on adhering to the agreement, entering the second phase, and obliging Israel to what was agreed upon. On Saturday, Hamas' armed wing posted a video showing Israeli hostages still in its custody in Gaza and stressed that the remaining hostages can only be freed through the phased ceasefire agreement that began on Jan. 19. The ceasefire agreement halted 15 months of fighting, allowing the exchange of 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. It was meant to lead to subsequent talks to build on the ceasefire deal. Talks about the ceasefire have been ongoing, most recently in Cairo, but have not led to an agreement. The war started when Hamas launched a cross-border terror attack on Israeli communities that killed about 1,200 people and took about 251 hostages, according to Israel. The Israeli retaliatory offensive has killed at least 48,000 people, Palestinian health authorities say, leaving hundreds of thousands of people in makeshift shelters and dependent on aid trucks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-backs-us-plan-for-temporary-ceasefire-in-gaza-hamas-rejects-it/7994037.html	2025-03-01T17:12:37-08:00	
Syrians begin first Ramadan without Assad family rule in decades	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Some restaurants and coffee shops in Syria were closed during the day Saturday while others opened as usual as observant Muslims began fasting during the holy month of Ramadan, the first since the fall of Assad family rule in the war-torn country. Syria's interim Ministry of Religious Endowments reportedly called for all restaurants, coffee shops and street food stands to be closed during the day. And it and that people must not eat or drink in public or face punishment. Those who violate the rule could get up to three months in jail. However, it did not appear that any official order had been issued by the government to that effect. Associated Press journalists who toured Damascus on Saturday said some coffee shops were open but had their windows closed so that people couldn't see who was inside. Insurgents led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, overthrew President Bashar al-Assad's secular government in early December ending the 54-year Assad family dynasty. Since then, Syria's new Islamist government under former insurgent leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, has been in control, and many fear that the country could turn into an Islamic state, although al-Sharaa has so far promised to respect religious minorities. Under Assad's rule during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when observant Muslims abstain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset, people were allowed to eat in public. This year, many people are abstaining from eating in public fearing reprisals. 'Ramadan this year comes with a new flavor. This is the Ramadan of victory and liberation,' said interim Minister of Religious Affairs Hussam Haj-Hussein in a televised statement. Most countries, including Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Kuwait, began observing Ramadan on Saturday, while a few other countries, such as Malaysia and Japan, as well as some Shiite Muslims, will begin the fast on Sunday. In many parts of the Middle East, the holy month this year is bittersweet. Lebanese this year mark Ramadan after the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that went into effect in late November. In the Gaza Strip, a fragile ceasefire deal, which has paused more than 15 months of war between Israel and U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hamas, nears the end of its first phase, and many Palestinians ate their first iftar in the middle of the rubble where their houses used to be. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar; the month cycles through the seasons. The start of the month traditionally depends on the sighting of the crescent moon. The actual start date may vary among Muslim communities because of declarations by multiple Islamic authorities around the globe on whether the crescent has been sighted or different methodologies used to determine the start of the month. The meal that breaks the daily fast is known as iftar and usually family members and friends gather at sunset to share it. Muslims eat a predawn meal, called 'suhoor,' to hydrate and nurture their bodies ahead of the daily fast. The holy month is also a time when Islamic and charitable organizations frequently provide meals for those unable to afford their own. In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, Bashar al Mashhadani, imam of the Sheikh Abdulqadir al Gailani Mosque in Baghdad said the mosque was preparing to serve 1,000 free meals per day to people coming to break their fast. Ramadan is followed by the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr, one of Islam's most important feasts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrians-begin-first-ramadan-without-assad-family-rule-in-decades-/7993866.html	2025-03-01T15:55:26-08:00

Former Governor Andrew Cuomo announces run for New York City mayor	NEW YORK — Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday that he is running for mayor of New York City, relaunching his political career following a yearslong exile over sexual harassment accusations. In a 17-minute video announcing his campaign, Cuomo pitched himself as an accomplished moderate who could save a city that felt threatening and 'out of control,' and who could navigate the delicate balance between working with Republican President Donald Trump and fighting him when necessary. 'I am not saying this is going to be easy. It won't be easy, but I know we can turn the city around and I believe I can help and that is why I announce my candidacy today for mayor of New York City today,' he said. The Democrat is expected to mount a formidable campaign, despite the scandal that forced his resignation from New York’s governor's office in 2021. He takes on a large field of primary opponents with low name recognition plus an incumbent, Mayor Eric Adams. Cuomo enters the race with fundraising prowess, a record of accomplishments over his three terms as governor, and potential support among many of the same moderate voters who helped propel Adams to office. Yet it is unclear whether voters are willing to give Cuomo another chance following his remarkable downfall 3½ years ago, when he went from being hailed for his leadership during the onslaught of COVID-19 to being castigated for his behavior with women and questioned about his response to the pandemic. Adams, asked for comment by a Politico reporter after Cuomo's announcement, welcomed the former governor to the race. 'Come one, come all. Everybody should put their position forward. I have a great record to run on. We look forward to the campaign,' he said. Adams is also seeking reelection but is facing a tempest over the criminal case against him, and the U.S. Justice Department's extraordinary effort to end the case over the objection of the prosecutors who brought the charges. An indictment said Adams accepted luxury travel perks and illegal campaign contributions from people who wanted to buy his influence, including a Turkish official and other foreign nationals. After Trump took office, a top Justice Department official ordered prosecutors to dismiss the charges so Adams could focus on assisting the president's immigration agenda, while leaving open the possibly that the case could reemerge after the mayoral election. That dynamic led critics to claim that Adams had struck a deal to help with Trump's immigration crackdown in exchange for legal salvation. Cuomo started in politics working for his father, former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, and later rose to become U.S. housing secretary under President Bill Clinton and New York attorney general before being elected governor in 2010. His national star power was highest during the coronavirus pandemic, when his televised daily briefings attracted admirers nationwide who saw him as a steady hand of leadership at a chaotic time. Women, though, began coming forward in late 2020 and early 2021, accusing Cuomo of misconduct. He faced a potential impeachment before he stepped down.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-governor-andrew-cuomo-announces-run-for-new-york-city-mayor-/7993855.html	2025-03-01T15:16:41-08:00	
Israel's military prepares to defend Druze community near Damascus	JERUSALEM — Israel's defense ministry said Saturday the military has been instructed to prepare to defend a Druze settlement in the suburbs of Damascus, asserting that the minority it has vowed to protect was 'under attack' by Syrian forces. The statement, citing an order from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, follows an Israeli warning last weekend that the forces of neighboring Syria's new government and the insurgent group that led last year's ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad should not enter the area south of Damascus. Saturday's statement indicates that Israeli forces could push farther into Syria as its new authorities try to consolidate control after more than a decade of civil war. Israeli forces recently set up posts in a buffer zone and on strategic Mount Hermon nearby. There have been no major clashes between Israeli troops and Syria's new forces. 'We will not allow the terrorist regime of radical Islam in Syria to harm the Druze. If the regime harms the Druze, it will be harmed by us,' the statement said. There was no immediate response from Syria's government. The Druze are a religious minority who live in southern Syria and in Israel's Golan Heights, where they navigate their historically Syrian identity while living under Israeli rule. Israel's statement followed the outbreak of unrest Friday in the Druze settlement of Jaramana, when a member of the security forces entered and started shooting in the air, leading to an exchange of fire with local gunmen that left him dead. On Saturday, gunmen came from the Damascus suburb of Mleiha to Jaramana, where they clashed with Druze gunmen. That left one Druze fighter dead and nine other people wounded, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor. The Israeli warning last Sunday to Syrian forces and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main former rebel group, made clear that Israeli forces would stay in parts of southern Syria for an indefinite period. 'We demand the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Sweida from the forces of the new regime,' that earlier statement said. 'Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.' After the fall of Assad in December, Israel seized the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory. The zone was set up under a 1974 ceasefire agreement. Syria's new authorities and U.N. officials have called for Israel to withdraw. Meanwhile, Netanyahu's government has been under pressure to protect Israelis living near border areas in the north as it tries to return residents of the north to their homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-military-prepares-to-defend-druze-community-near-damascus-/7993854.html	2025-03-01T15:13:13-08:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy gets warm welcome from UK's Starmer	LONDON — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday gave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a warm welcome in London, a day after the Ukrainian leader's clash with U.S. President Donald Trump. The two countries also unveiled a $2.84 billion loan agreement to support Ukraine's defense capabilities, to be paid back with the profits of immobilized sovereign Russian assets. Supporters cheered as Zelenskyy's convoy swept onto Downing Street, where he was embraced by Starmer and posed for photographs before heading inside the U.K. leader's home. 'You're very, very welcome here in Downing Street,' Starmer told Zelenskyy. 'And as you've heard from the cheers street outside, you have full backing across the United Kingdom, and we stand with you with Ukraine for as long as it may take,' he added. 'I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom, for such big support from the very beginning of this war,' responded Zelenskyy, who is due to meet King Charles III on Sunday. The pair met behind closed doors for around 75 minutes and embraced again as Starmer escorted Zelenskyy to his car. Earlier Saturday Zelenskyy had stressed that Trump's support was still crucial for Ukraine despite their row the previous day. The clash was a further shock to Kyiv's European allies, still adjusting to Washington's new stance on the war. On Friday, Trump berated Zelenskyy for not being ready for peace with Russia, triggering alarm across Europe. 'Yesterday evening underlined that a new age of infamy has begun,' said Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Starmer were among several other European leaders who reiterated their support for Kyiv after the row. In an interview with the BBC, NATO chief Mark Rutte said that he had told Zelenskyy he had to 'find a way' to restore his relationship with Trump. Russian politicians were delighted, however. Russia's former President Dmitry Medvedev called Zelenskyy an 'insolent pig' who had received 'a proper slap down in the Oval Office.' Although Zelenskyy left the White House without having signed the deal on Kyiv's rare minerals, he insisted he was still ready to sign it as 'the first step toward security guarantees.' 'It's crucial for us to have President Trump's support. He wants to end the war, but no one wants peace more than we do,' Zelenskyy said in a post on social media platform X. On Sunday, Zelenskyy will attend emergency talks with Kyiv's European backers, also attended by Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump stunned many in Europe when he reached out to Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek a deal on Ukraine, which Moscow invaded three years ago. The president's sudden shift on Ukraine, sidelining Kyiv and Europe while pursuing rapprochement with Putin, has rattled the transatlantic NATO alliance. Those concerns were only exacerbated Friday by the heated talks in the White House Friday. Trump has alarmed Kyiv and European allies with his change in U.S. policy, casting himself as a mediator between Putin and Zelenskyy and refusing to condemn the Russian invasion. He said in the Oval Office that he had 'spoken on numerous occasions' to Putin — more than has been publicly reported. With fears growing over whether the United States will continue to support NATO, Sunday's gathering in the U.K. will also address the need for Europe to increase defense cooperation. French President Emmanuel Macron has said he is ready to 'open the discussion' on a possible future European nuclear deterrent. 'We have a shield, they don't,' he said in an interview with French newspapers appearing Sunday. 'And they can no longer depend on the American nuclear deterrent.' Germany's likely next leader, Friedrich Merz, also stressed the need for the continent to move quickly to 'achieve independence' from the United States on defense matters. But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban — the closest ally of Trump and the Kremlin in the European Union — vowed to oppose any EU-wide agreement on the conflict. 'I am convinced that the European Union — following the example of the United States — should enter into direct discussions with Russia on a ceasefire and a sustainable peace in Ukraine,' Orban wrote in a letter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-zelenskyy-gets-warm-welcome-from-uk-s-starmer/7993845.html	2025-03-01T14:46:30-08:00	
Judge blocks Trump order threatening funding for transgender youth care	SEATTLE — President Donald Trump's plan to pull federal funding from institutions that provide gender-affirming care for transgender youth will remain blocked on a long-term basis under a federal judge's ruling in Seattle late Friday. U.S. District Court Judge Lauren King previously granted a two-week restraining order after the Democratic attorneys general of Washington, Oregon and Minnesota sued the Trump administration — Colorado has since joined the case. King's temporary order expired Friday, and she held arguments that day before issuing a preliminary injunction blocking most of Trump's plan pending a final decision on the merits of the case. The judge found the states lacked standing on one point: the order's protections against female genital mutilation. Female genital mutilation is already illegal in the four states that are part of the lawsuit, and the judge said the record 'is bereft of any evidence' that the plaintiffs plan to perform such procedures. Washington Attorney General Nick Brown praised the ruling. An email message was sent to the White House seeking comment. Two of Trump's executive orders are at issue in the case. One, 'Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism,' calls for stripping federal money from programs that 'promote gender ideology.' The other, 'Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,' calls for the federal government to cut off research and educational grants for institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, that provide gender-affirming care to people under age 19. Several hospitals around the country ceased providing care, including puberty blockers and hormone treatments, following the order. Medicaid programs in some states cover gender-affirming care, and Trump's 'Protecting Children' order suggests that practice could end. It also raises the prospect that medical professionals could be criminally charged for providing gender-affirming care under a law that bans medically unnecessary genital mutilation of underage females — a notion that the states suing Trump call repugnant and legally unsupportable. Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth — a condition called gender dysphoria — are far more likely to suffer from severe depression and to kill themselves if they do not receive treatment, which can include evaluation by a team of medical professionals; a social transition, such as changing a hairstyle or pronouns; and eventually puberty blockers or hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors. In her ruling Friday, the judge said the order was not limited to children or to irreversible treatments and that it doesn't target medical interventions performed on cisgender children. 'In fact, its inadequate 'means-end fit' would prevent federally funded medical providers from providing necessary medical treatments to transgender youth that are completely unrelated to gender identity,' she wrote. 'For example, a cisgender teen could obtain puberty blockers from such a provider as a component of cancer treatment, but a transgender teen with the same cancer care plan could not.' In his arguments Friday, Washington Assistant Attorney General William McGinty stressed the urgency of the issue. 'There are going to be young people who are going to take their lives if they can no longer receive this care,' he said. King, the judge in Seattle, grilled Justice Department attorney Vinita Andrapalliyal in court about the meaning and effect of Trump's executive orders. The judge continued to press, saying she was 'looking for a legitimate government interest' that would justify Trump's orders. The four Democratic attorneys general suing in Seattle argued that the orders violate equal rights protections, the separation of powers and the states' right to regulate issues not delegated to the federal government. The Trump administration disputed those claims in court filings. 'The President's authority to direct subordinate agencies to implement his agenda, subject to those agencies' own statutory authorities, is well established,' Justice Department attorneys wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-blocks-trump-order-threatening-funding-for-transgender-youth-care-/7993843.html	2025-03-01T14:25:38-08:00	
ACLU sues to block migrant transfers to Guantanamo	WASHINGTON — A U.S. civil rights group sued Saturday to block the Trump administration from potentially transferring 10 migrants from the U.S. to a naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detailing harsh conditions and suicide attempts among migrants held there. The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit in federal court in Washington, said the transfers violate U.S. immigration law by moving the detainees outside of the country and aim to stoke fear without a legitimate rationale. The 10 detainees in the lawsuit are men from Venezuela, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan with final deportation orders, including some who have been threatened with transfer to Guantanamo, the ACLU said. The men, currently held in Texas, Arizona and Virginia, are not gang members or high-risk criminals, the ACLU said. President Donald Trump has vowed to deport record numbers of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. As part of the efforts to expand deportations, the administration in early February began sending migrants to a detention camp on the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, best known for holding foreign terrorism suspects. Cuban and Haitian migrants intercepted at sea have been held at a migrant facility on the base in previous decades. However, the Trump administration effort was the first to transfer migrants there from the U.S., according to the ACLU. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said they are sending 'the worst of the worst' to Guantanamo, but about a third of the initial group of 177 Venezuelans had no criminal record, according to the department. The ACLU lawsuit alleges that migrants detained at Guantanamo have been held in windowless rooms for at least 23 hours a day, been subjected to invasive strip searches, and are unable to contact family members. The suit said that guards 'engage in verbal and physical abuse,' including strapping detainees to a chair, withholding water, threatening to shoot detainees, and fracturing one person's hand. 'These degrading conditions and extreme isolation have led to several suicide attempts,' the complaint said. A federal judge blocked the possible transfer of several Venezuelan migrants to Guantanamo in mid-February but the men — also represented by the ACLU — were then deported to Venezuela. In a separate lawsuit filed Friday, immigrant rights organizations and others sued to block Trump's moves to end former President Joe Biden's immigration parole programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of people with U.S. sponsors or fleeing danger to enter legally. The lawsuit, filed in a Massachusetts federal court, argues the administration failed to follow proper regulatory steps when it abruptly ended programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Ukrainians with U.S. sponsors, as well as a program for Afghans who fled the Taliban takeover.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aclu-sues-to-block-migrant-transfers-to-guantanamo-/7993844.html	2025-03-01T14:21:33-08:00	
PKK declares ceasefire with Turkey after 40 years of armed struggle	ISTANBUL — Outlawed Kurdish militants Saturday declared a ceasefire with Turkey following a landmark call by jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan asking the group to disband and end more than four decades of armed struggle. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who backed the peace process initiated by a close nationalist ally, warned that Turkey would pursue the anti-PKK fight unless the group kept their pledge to disband. 'In order to pave the way for the implementation of (Ocalan's) call for peace and democratic society, we are declaring a ceasefire effective from today,' the PKK executive committee said, quoted by the pro-PKK ANF news agency. It was the first reaction from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) after Ocalan this week called for the dissolution of the group and asked it to lay down its arms. 'We agree with the content of the call as it is and we say that we will follow and implement it,' said the committee, which is based in northern Iraq. 'None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked,' it added. The PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. It has waged an insurgency since 1984. The group's original aim was to carve out a homeland for Kurds, who make up about 20% of Turkey's 85 million people. Recently however, the group has called for more autonomy and cultural and linguistic rights, rather than independence. Since Ocalan was jailed in 1999 there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives. After several meetings with Ocalan at his island prison, the pro-Kurdish DEM party relayed his appeal Thursday for PKK to lay down its weapons and convene a congress to announce the organization's dissolution. The PKK said Saturday it was ready to convene a congress but 'for this to happen, a suitable secure environment must be created' and Ocalan 'must personally direct and lead it for the success of the congress.' The group also said Ocalan's prison conditions must be eased. He 'must be able to live and work in physical freedom and be able to establish unhindered relationships with anyone he wants,' said the group. Hours after the PKK declared a ceasefire, Erdogan warned: 'If the promises given are not kept ... we will continue our ongoing operations.' He was speaking from Istanbul at a meal to break the Ramadan fast. There was nothing, he said, 'that would disturb the sacred spirits of our martyrs' killed by the PKK. Turkey would be the winner, he insisted. 'We always keep our iron fist ready in case the hand we extend is left hanging in the air or bitten,' he added, in what appeared to be a warning to the PKK. Erdogan described Ocalan's appeal Friday as 'a historic opportunity.' Analysts say establishing a truce with the PKK would help both Turkey and Syria, where strongman Bashar al-Assad was ousted late last year. 'A peace deal with the PKK is likely to make it easier to reunify and establish a more stable Syria,' Anthony Skinner, director of research at Marlow Global, told AFP. 'This is a key objective for the Turkish government, which has had to contend with the ongoing threat of cross-border mass migration and terrorism,' he said. Turkey's army, which has troops deployed in northern Syria, regularly attacks areas controlled by Syrian Kurdish forces that it considers terrorists linked to the PKK. Analyst Bayram Balci, a Turkish foreign policy expert at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, said the PKK understood the regional context had changed. Syria's Kurdish fighters 'no longer have the support of Assad, they may no longer have the strong support of the Americans,' he said. 'The threat of Daesh still exists, but it is not as strong as before. And then there is also a kind of fatigue,' he added, referring to the Islamic State terror group. Iraq has welcomed Ocalan's call as 'a positive and important step towards achieving stability in the region.' The PKK's presence in Iraq has been a recurrent source of tension between Baghdad and Ankara. The group holds positions in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, where Turkey also maintains military bases and often carries out ground and air operations against Kurdish militants. After the last round of peace talks collapsed in 2015, no further contact was made with the PKK until October when hard-line nationalist MHP leader Devlet Bahceli offered a surprise peace gesture if Ocalan rejected violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pkk-declares-ceasefire-with-turkey-after-40-years-of-armed-struggle-/7993837.html	2025-03-01T14:09:40-08:00	
Serbian students demand 'better future' in anti-corruption rally	NIS, SERBIA — Tens of thousands of people in Serbia gathered Saturday for a huge student-led rally that vowed to turn the troubled, populist-run Balkan country into a free nation of justice and rule of law, with many proclaiming 'We deserve better.' University students in the Balkan country that has been ruled firmly by a right-wing, pro-Russia government for over a decade have been holding nationwide protests since the fatal train station canopy collapse in November that killed 15 people, and which critics blame on government corruption. The almost daily protests regularly draw tens of thousands of people and have rattled President Aleksandar Vucic's firm grip on power. 'We want the (state) institutions that work in the interest of all of us and not to our damage,' the students said in a statement. 'We want a system that values knowledge and work, and not obedience and silence.' Protesters from across the country gathered in Nis, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Belgrade, for Saturday's festival-style rally that was expected to last for 18 hours. 'We rally because we know we deserve better,' the statement said. The event in Nis, during which a decree was symbolically passed, was 'a wakeup call to move from apathy to action, from silence to a noisy struggle for a better future ... our pledge never to give up!' The decree proclaimed the 'values for which we fight as a pledge for the future' to build a state 'in which justice and freedom will be stronger than any individual.' Vucic, who has described the protests as a Western-orchestrated attempt to oust him from power, Saturday dismissed the protest, declaring that 'support is falling' and that he thinks 'nothing special' of it. With their determination, energy and creativity, the students have garnered widespread support among the citizens who largely have been disillusioned with mainstream politicians and have lost hope of changes. Serbia is formally on the path toward European Union membership, but Vucic and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have been accused of stifling democratic freedoms and fueling rampant corruption since coming to power. 'This is the place to be' Residents in Nis staged a noisy welcome for the students Friday evening as they marched into the city after walking for several days in groups from various directions. These student marches have become a rallying force in Serbia's rural areas, which are traditionally pro-government. Everywhere students showed up people greeted them with food and refreshments, while many cried and kissed them. 'This is the place to be today. There is no place on earth where I belong more than here,' said pensioner Marjan Zivanovic, who came from Belgrade. 'Here is love, here is joy, here is everything. Here is the future.' Milan Bogicevic, a high school teacher from Novi Sad, said he is aware that 'this is no 100 meters race, this is a marathon.' There was no giving up, he added. Previously similar rallies were held in Novi Sad and in the central city of Kragujevac. The Nis rally marks four months since the concrete canopy at the central train station in the northern city of Novi Sad collapsed on Nov. 1. The crowd went silent for 15 minutes at 11:52 a.m. to honor the 15 victims of the Novi Sad disaster at the exact same time the canopy crashed on the people below. The station building had been renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure work with Chinese state companies. Many in Serbia believe the work on the building was sloppy and disregarded construction safety rules because of widespread corruption.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-students-demand-better-future-in-anti-corruption-rally-/7993826.html	2025-03-01T13:48:01-08:00	
Tens of thousands protest government before Romania's election	BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Romania's capital Saturday in the latest antigovernment demonstration by far-right groups after a top court canceled a presidential election in the European Union country last year. Protesters converged in front of the government building in Bucharest, waving Romania's tricolor flag and chanting slogans such as 'Down with the Government' and 'Thieves.' Many expressed support for Calin Georgescu, who emerged as the front-runner in December's canceled election, and demanded they be resumed from the second round. George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, which organized the protest, told supporters Saturday: 'We are united, we are strong. We are here because our vote was stolen. Because democracy was trampled on.' Simion told reporters that the protest aimed to 'restore democracy and free elections' and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu. 'We do not trust that the upcoming elections will be free and fair,' he said. A no-confidence vote on Friday, which was backed by AUR and two other far-right opposition parties, failed to unseat Ciolacu's pro-Western coalition government, which was formed after a Dec. 1 parliamentary election. Election rerun scheduled for May 4 Romania has seen recurring protests after the Constitutional Court made the unprecedented move to annul the election two days ahead of the Dec. 8 runoff following Georgescu's surprise first-round win. The far-right populist had polled in single digits and declared zero campaign spending. Allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference quickly emerged. Moscow has denied it meddled in Romania's election. On Wednesday, Romanian prosecutors launched a criminal investigation against Georgescu, accusing him of supporting fascist groups, 'incitement to actions against the constitutional order,' and false declarations regarding electoral campaign financing and asset disclosures. Prosecutors have placed him under judicial control, according to his lawyers. Georgescu, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, attended Saturday's protest where he told supporters that 'the system has maliciously tried to divide us' and that 'old and new cronies tried to block my candidacy.' The first round of the rerun of the election is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate gets more than 50% of ballots, a runoff will follow on May 18. It isn't yet clear whether Georgescu will be able to participate in the new election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-protest-government-before-romania-s-election/7993825.html	2025-03-01T13:22:15-08:00	
US, Guyana denounce Venezuelan naval incursion	GEORGETOWN, GUYANA — The United States on Saturday denounced what it said were Venezuelan naval vessels 'threatening' an ExxonMobil unit in maritime territory claimed by Guyana. The statement came hours after Guyana President Irfaan Ali said a Venezuelan patrol boat had entered 'exclusive' Guyanese waters around 7 a.m. local time. Guyana had 'put its international partners on alert,' he said on Facebook. The U.S. warned against any further encroachment. 'Venezuelan naval vessels threatening ExxonMobil's floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit is unacceptable and a clear violation of Guyana's internationally recognized maritime territory,' said the statement from the U.S. Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. 'Further provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime,' it added. Guyana and Venezuela have seen heightened tensions over control of the disputed Essequibo territory, a sprawling region rich in natural resources. Tensions flared in 2015 when petroleum giant ExxonMobil discovered deposits that gave Guyana, a country of just 800,000 people and with a tiny military, the largest crude oil reserves in the world. Ali, whose country is closely allied to the U.S., said on Facebook that the floating production vessels were 'operating legally within Guyana's exclusive economic zone.' Venezuela's armed forces have not commented. Soldiers wounded Tensions were fanned on Feb. 17 when Guyana said six of its soldiers were wounded when a supply transport was ambushed, allegedly by members of a Venezuelan criminal gang. That happened on the anniversary of the signing of a 1966 agreement between Venezuela and Britain, reached before Guyanese independence, that called for a negotiated solution to the territorial dispute. But Guyana has insisted that an 1899 ruling had fixed the disputed border in its favor. Last December, Britain sent the patrol ship HMS Trent on a port visit to Guyana capital Georgetown, a gesture deemed a 'provocation and threat by the United Kingdom' by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela then launched a major military exercise in the border region, including more than 5,600 soldiers, fighter jets and patrol boats. Ali and Maduro met in December in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and agreed to avoid any use of force.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-guyana-denounce-venezuelan-naval-incursion-/7993807.html	2025-03-01T12:53:19-08:00	
David Johansen, singer from New York Dolls punk band, dies at 75	NEW YORK — David Johansen, the last surviving member of the glam and protopunk band the New York Dolls who later performed as his campy, pompadoured alter ego, Buster Poindexter, has died. He was 75. Johansen died Friday at his home in New York City, according to Rolling Stone, citing a family spokesperson. It was revealed in early 2025 that he had stage 4 cancer and a brain tumor. The New York Dolls were forerunners of punk and the band's style — teased hair, women's clothes and lots of makeup — inspired the glam movement that took up residence in heavy metal a decade later in bands like Faster Pussycat and Motley Crue. 'When you're an artist, the main thing you want to do is inspire people, so if you succeed in doing that, it's pretty gratifying,' Johansen told The Knoxville News-Sentinel in 2011. Rolling Stone once called the Dolls 'the mutant children of the hydrogen age' and Vogue called them the 'darlings of downtown style, tarted-up toughs in boas and heels.' 'The New York Dolls were more than musicians; they were a phenomenon. They drew on old rock 'n' roll, big-city blues, show tunes, the Rolling Stones and girl groups, and that was just for starters,' Bill Bentley wrote in 'Smithsonian Rock and Roll: Live and Unseen.' The band never found commercial success and was torn by internal strife and drug addictions, breaking up after two albums by the middle of the decade. In 2004, former Smiths frontman and Dolls admirer Morrissey convinced Johansen and other surviving members to regroup for the Meltdown Festival in England, leading to three more studio albums. In the 1980s, Johansen assumed the persona of Buster Poindexter, a pompadour-styled lounge lizard who had a hit with the kitschy party single 'Hot, Hot, Hot' in 1987. He also appeared in such movies as 'Candy Mountain,' 'Let It Ride,' 'Married to the Mob' and had a memorable turn as the Ghost of Christmas Past in Bill Murray-led hit 'Scrooged.' Johansen was in 2023 the subject of Martin Scorsese and David Tedeschi's documentary 'Personality Crisis: One Night Only,' which mixed footage of his two-night stand at the Cafe Carlyle in January 2020 with flashbacks through his wildly varied career and intimate interviews. 'I used to think about my voice like: 'What's it gonna sound like? What's it going to be when I do this song?' And I'd get myself into a knot about it,' Johansen told The Associated Press in 2023. 'At some point in my life, I decided: 'Just sing the (expletive) song. With whatever you got.' To me, I go on stage and whatever mood I'm in, I just claw my way out of it, essentially.' David Roger Johansen was born to a large, working-class Catholic family on Staten Island, his father an insurance salesman. He filled notebooks with poems and lyrics as a young man and liked a lot of different music — R&B, Cuban, Janis Joplin and Otis Redding. The Dolls — the final original lineup included guitarists Sylvain Sylvain and Johnny Thunders, bassist Arthur Kane and drummer Jerry Nolan — rubbed shoulders with Lou Reed and Andy Warhol in the Lower East Side of Manhattan the early 1970s. They took their name from a toy hospital in Manhattan and were expected to take over the throne vacated by the Velvet Underground in the early 1970s. But neither of their first two albums — 1973's 'New York Dolls,' produced by Todd Rundgren, nor 'Too Much Too Soon' a year later produced by Shadow Morton — charted. 'They're definitely a band to keep both eyes and ears on,' read the review of their debut album in Rolling Stone, complimentary of their 'strange combination of high pop-star drag and ruthless street arrogance.' Their songs included 'Personality Crisis' ('You got it while it was hot/But now frustration and heartache is what you got'), 'Looking for a Kiss' (I need a fix and a kiss') and a 'Frankenstein' (Is it a crime/For you to fall in love with Frankenstein?') Their glammed look was meant to embrace fans with a nonjudgmental, noncategorical space. 'I just wanted to be very welcoming,' Johansen said in the documentary, ''cause the way this society is, it was set up very strict — straight, gay, vegetarian, whatever... I just kind of wanted to kind of like bring those walls down, have a party kind of thing.' Rolling Stone magazine, reviewing their second album, called them 'the best hard-rock band in America right now' and called the wiry, gravelly-voiced Johansen a 'talented showman, with an amazing ability to bring characters to life as a lyricist.' Decades later, the Dolls' influence would be cherished. Rolling Stone would list their self-titled debut album at Number 301 of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, writing 'it's hard to imagine the Ramones or the Replacements or a thousand other trash-junky bands without them.' The Dolls, representing rock at its most debauched, were divisive. In 1973, they won the Creem magazine poll categories as the year's best and worst new group. They were nominated several times for The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame but never got in. By the end of their first run, the Dolls were being managed by legendary promoter Malcolm McLaren, who would later introduce the Sex Pistols to the Dolls' music. Culture critic Greil Marcus in 'Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century' writes the Dolls played him some of their music and he couldn't believe how bad they were. After the first demise of the Dolls, Johansen started his own group, the David Johansen band, before reinventing himself yet again in the 1980s as Buster Poindexter. He is survived by his wife, Mara Hennessey, and a stepdaughter, Leah Hennessey.	https://www.voanews.com/a/david-johansen-singer-from-new-york-dolls-punk-band-dies-at-75/7993796.html	2025-03-01T11:57:12-08:00	
US to deploy more troops to southern border	The United States will deploy nearly 3,000 additional troops to its border with Mexico, bringing the total number of active-duty personnel there to around 9,000, U.S. Northern Command, or NORTHCOM, said Saturday. Border security is a key priority for President Donald Trump, who declared a national emergency at the U.S. frontier with Mexico on his first day in office. 'Approximately 2,400 soldiers from elements of the 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), 4th Infantry Division' will be sent to the border, along with 'approximately 500 soldiers from the 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade,' NORTHCOM said in a statement. 'Tasks carried out by 2nd SBCT will include detection and monitoring; administrative support; transportation support; warehousing and logistic support; vehicle maintenance; and engineering support. Personnel will not conduct or be involved in interdiction or deportation operations,' it said. Troops from the aviation unit will 'assist in the movement of personnel, equipment, and supplies; and provide aerial medical evacuation capabilities,' NORTHCOM said. 'These deployments will bring additional agility and capability to further efforts to stop the flow of illegal migrancy and drugs at the southern border,' its commander, General Gregory Guillot, said. The Trump administration has launched what it cast as a major effort to combat illegal migration that has included immigration raids, arrests and deportations, including via the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Trump unveiled a surprise plan last month to hold up to 30,000 migrants at the base — a facility notorious for abuses against terror suspects detained after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — and U.S. forces have detained dozens of people there in recent weeks, many of whom have since been deported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-deploy-more-troops-to-southern-border/7993778.html	2025-03-01T11:04:35-08:00	
US says it killed military leader of Syrian Al-Qaida affiliate	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army said Saturday it had killed a top military leader of Hurras al-Din, a Syrian branch of Al-Qaida that announced its dissolution in January. The U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, said in a statement that its forces on Feb. 23 'conducted a precision airstrike in Northwest Syria, targeting and killing Muhammed Yusuf Ziya Talay, the senior military leader of the terrorist organization Hurras al-Din.' 'As we have said in the past, we will continue to relentlessly pursue these terrorists in order to defend our homeland, and U.S., allied, and partner personnel in the region,' said General Michael Erik Kurilla, CENTCOM commander. Since Hurras al-Din announced in late January that it was dissolving itself, U.S. airstrikes have killed several of the group's leaders, according to CENTCOM. On Feb. 22, it said a 'precision airstrike' had killed Wasim Tahsin Bayraqdar, a leader of the group, which the U.S. classifies as a terrorist organization. American forces are in Syria as part of an international coalition created in 2014 to fight the jihadis of the Islamic State group. After a rebel alliance led by radical Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham toppled President Bashar al-Assad and took power in Damascus on Dec. 8, Hurras al-Din said it no longer needed to exist. The group, including foreign jihadis, was based in mountainous northwestern Syria.

VOA Uzbek: Activists say no Central Asian countries are ‘free’	Freedom House, like other human rights organizations, considers Central Asia to be a region far from democracy. According to the report, none of the Central Asian republics allow political competition; there is no opposition, and therefore, elections are unfair and undemocratic; parliaments and courts are not independent; presidents are autocratic. Regional analysts are concerned about that and human rights in Central Asia.

37 dead in Bolivia after 2 buses collide, police say	LA PAZ, BOLIVIA — Two passenger buses collided Saturday on a highway in southern Bolivia, leaving at least 37 dead, including two children, and some 30 people injured, police said. 'So far we have 37 confirmed deaths,' Colonel Wilson Flores told AFP about the crash near the city of Uyuni in the department of Potosi. The accident, the country's most serious so far this year, occurred on a narrow two-way road early Saturday. One of the buses was heading to the city of Oruro, the scene this weekend of the Oruro Carnival, one of the largest festivals in Latin America. It attracts tens of thousands of people. It is still unclear what caused the accident, but police said that one of the buses had veered into the opposite lane. 'There has been a fatal accident, and it has left us' with 'confirmed fatalities already,' Osmar Salvatierra, an official of the municipality of Uyuni, told local media. Police were at the scene to clarify the circumstances of the crash and said they will provide an official report. Officials also said one of the drivers, who survived the accident in grave condition, had 'alcohol breath,' so a blood test was performed. Bolivia's winding mountain roads are notoriously deadly. Road accidents kill an average of 1,400 people every year in the country of about 12 million inhabitants, according to government data. Some information in this report is from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-bolivia-after-2-buses-collide-police-say/7993744.html	2025-03-01T10:06:39-08:00	
2 lunar landings in a week for NASA's private moon fleet	WASHINGTON — More than 50 years passed between the last Apollo mission and the United States' return to the lunar surface, when the first private lander touched down last February 2024. Now, starting Sunday, two more missions are set to follow within a single week, marking a bold push by NASA and its industry partners to make moon landings a routine part of space exploration. First up is Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost Mission 1, nicknamed 'Ghost Riders in the Sky.' After launching in January on a 45-day journey, it is targeting touchdown near Mons Latreille, a volcanic feature in Mare Crisium on the moon's northeastern near side, at 3:34 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Along the way, it captured stunning footage of the moon, coming as close as 100 kilometers above the surface. The golden lander, about the size of a hippopotamus, carries 10 instruments, including one to analyze lunar soil, another to test radiation-tolerant computing and a GPS-based navigation system. Designed to operate for a full lunar day (14 Earth days), Blue Ghost is expected to capture high-definition imagery of a total eclipse on March 14, when Earth blocks the Sun from the Moon's horizon. On March 16, it will record a lunar sunset, offering insights into how dust levitates above the surface under solar influence — creating the mysterious lunar horizon glow first documented by Apollo astronaut Eugene Cernan. Hopping drone Blue Ghost's arrival will be followed on March 6 by Intuitive Machines' IM-2 mission, featuring its lander, Athena. Last year, Intuitive Machines made history as the first private company to achieve a soft landing on the moon, although the moment was tempered by a mishap. Coming down too fast, one of the lander's feet caught on the lunar surface, tipping it over and causing it to rest sideways — limiting its ability to generate solar power and cutting the mission short. This time, the company says it has made key improvements to the hexagonal-shaped lander, which has a taller, slimmer profile than Blue Ghost and is around the height of an adult giraffe. Athena launched Wednesday aboard a SpaceX rocket, taking a more direct route toward Mons Mouton — the southernmost lunar landing site ever attempted. It carries an ambitious set of payloads, including a unique hopping drone designed to explore the moon's underground passages carved by ancient lava flows, a drill capable of digging 3 feet beneath the surface in search of ice and three rovers. The largest, about the size of a beagle, will connect to the lander and hopper using a Nokia cellular network in a first-of-its-kind demonstration. But 'Grace,' the hopping drone — named after computing pioneer Grace Hopper — could well steal the show if it succeeds in showing it can navigate the moon's treacherous terrain in ways no rover can. NASA's private moon fleet Landing on the moon presents unique challenges due to the absence of an atmosphere, making parachutes ineffective. Instead, spacecraft must rely on precisely controlled thruster burns to slow their descent while navigating hazardous terrain. Until Intuitive Machines' first successful mission, only five national space agencies had accomplished this feat: the Soviet Union, the United States, China, India and Japan, in that order. Now, the United States is working to make private lunar missions routine through NASA's $2.6 billion Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, a public-private initiative designed to deliver hardware to the surface at a fraction of traditional mission costs. These missions come at a pivotal moment for NASA amid speculation that it may scale back or even cancel its Artemis lunar program in favor of prioritizing Mars exploration — a key goal of President Donald Trump and his close advisor, SpaceX founder Elon Musk.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lunar-landings-in-a-week-for-nasa-s-private-moon-fleet/7993730.html	2025-03-01T09:49:10-08:00	
Trump set to undergo annual physical exam	Donald Trump, who at 78 is on course to become the oldest president in American history, will undergo an annual physical exam in coming weeks, a White House statement said Saturday. 'President Donald J. Trump will complete his routine annual physical exam next month at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,' said the announcement, dated March 1. 'The date of his physical exam will be released publicly in the next few weeks,' said the statement, signed by his physician, Sean Barbabella, a career military doctor who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump has appeared vigorous for his age, but his earlier physical exams at times raised questions about the specifics of his health data and about the transparency of results. While Trump does not drink alcohol or smoke, he is known to enjoy fast food and steaks, and his main source of exercise appears to be golfing. A physical during his first term in 2018 suggested the president should aim to lose 10 to 15 pounds but was generally in 'excellent health.' His doctor said that there were no signs of 'any cognitive issues,' and that with a healthier diet, he could 'live to be 200 years old.' A year later, an exam found the 6-foot-3 Trump weighed 243 pounds, up 7 pounds since shortly before taking office, making him technically obese. It said he was taking medication to treat high cholesterol. During Trump's presidential campaign in 2015, his doctor, Harold Bornstein, released a letter saying the candidate's blood pressure was 'astonishingly excellent' and that if elected, 'Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.' Bornstein later told CNN that Trump himself 'dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-set-to-undergo-annual-physical-exam/7993713.html	2025-03-01T09:27:50-08:00	
Pope has coffee, rests after setback in recovery	ROME — Pope Francis had coffee and was reading newspapers Saturday after an alarming setback in his two-week recovery from double pneumonia: Doctors had to put him on noninvasive mechanical ventilation following a coughing fit in which he inhaled vomit that needed to then be extracted. Doctors said it would take a day or two to evaluate how and if the Friday afternoon episode affected Francis’ overall clinical condition. His prognosis remained guarded, meaning he wasn’t out of danger. In its morning update Saturday, the Vatican said the 88-year-old pope didn't have any further respiratory crises overnight: 'The night has passed quietly, the pope is resting.' He had coffee in the morning for breakfast, suggesting that he was not dependent on a ventilation mask to breathe and was still eating on his own. In the late Friday update, the Vatican said Francis suffered an 'isolated crisis of bronchial spasm,' a coughing fit in which Francis inhaled vomit, which resulted in a 'sudden worsening of the respiratory picture.' Doctors aspirated the vomit and placed Francis on noninvasive mechanical ventilation. The pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the maneuvers to help him recover. He responded well, with a good level of oxygen exchange, and he was continuing to wear a mask to receive supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said. The episode, which occurred in the early afternoon, marked a setback in what had been two successive days of increasingly upbeat reports from doctors treating Francis at Rome’s Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs. Doctors say episode is ‘concerning’ The Vatican said the episode was different from the prolonged respiratory crisis on Feb. 22 that was said to have caused Francis discomfort. Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the isolated episode Friday as relayed by the Vatican was nevertheless alarming and underscored Francis’ fragility and that his condition 'can turn very quickly.' 'I think this is extremely concerning, given the fact that the pope has been in the hospital now for over two weeks, and now he’s continuing to have these respiratory events and now had this aspiration event that is requiring even higher levels of support,' he told The Associated Press. 'So given his age and his fragile state and his previous lung resection, this is very concerning,' said Coleman, who is not involved in Francis’ care. Dr. William Feldman, a pulmonary specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said it was a good sign that the pope remained alert and oriented during the episode, but he concurred that it marked 'a worrying turn.' 'Often we will use noninvasive ventilation as a way of trying to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation,' Feldman said. Types of noninvasive ventilation include a BiPAP machine, which helps people breathe by pushing air into their lungs. Doctors will often try such a machine for a while to see if the patient’s blood gas levels improve so they can eventually go back to using oxygen alone. Friday's statement said Francis showed a 'good response' to the gas exchange using the ventilation. Doctors did not resume referring to Francis being in 'critical condition,' which has been absent from their statements for three days now. But they say he isn’t out of danger, given the complexity of his case. Prayers continue to pour in Francis’ hospitalization has come as the Vatican is marking its Holy Year, which is drawing pilgrims to Rome from all over. They are walking through the Holy Door at St. Peter's Basilica and making pilgrimages to the hilltop Umbrian town of Assisi to pray at the home of Francis' namesake, St. Francis. 'Every day we’re praying for the pope,' said the Rev. Jacinto Bento, a priest visiting Assisi on Saturday with a group of 30 Jubilee pilgrims from the Azores Islands. 'We’re very sad for his situation.' Veronica Abraham, a catechist and Argentine native, came to Assisi on Saturday with her two children and other kids from her parish on Lake Garda and said the group had prayed for the pope at every church they'd visited. 'I’m sure that he’s hearing our prayers, that he feels our closeness,' she said. Serena Barbon, visiting Assisi from Treviso on Saturday with her husband and three children, said she hoped that if Francis doesn't make it, the next pope will be just like him. 'He’s been very charismatic, and we pray for him and that any new pope might also be someone who puts the poor in the center. Because we’re all a bit poor,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-has-coffee-rests-after-setback-in-recovery/7993656.html	2025-03-01T08:17:40-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: As Trump’s talks with Zelenskyy disintegrate, will China benefit?	The public spat Friday between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, at the White House has triggered European solidarity for Ukraine. Barring Hungary, major European powers led by Germany and France have thrown their weight behind Kyiv, calling it the victim of Russian aggression, while promising sustained support to the war-torn country. Experts say rising tensions in the transatlantic relationship would benefit one country – the People’s Republic of China. They argue that recent developments provide Beijing with an opportunity to make inroads in Europe.

PKK declares ceasefire with Turkey after 40 years of armed struggle	Outlawed Kurdish militants declared a ceasefire Saturday with Turkey following a landmark call by jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan asking the group to disband and end more than four decades of armed struggle. It was the first reaction from the Kurdistan Workers' Party after Ocalan this week called for the dissolution of the group and asked it to lay down arms. 'In order to pave the way for the implementation of leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society, we are declaring a ceasefire effective today,' the PKK executive committee said, referring to Ocalan and quoted by the pro-PKK ANF news agency. 'We agree with the content of the call as it is, and we say that we will follow and implement it,' the committee, based in northern Iraq, said. 'None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked,' it said. The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984 with the aim of carving out a homeland for Kurds, who account for around 20% of Turkey's 85 million people. But more recently, the group has called for more autonomy and cultural and linguistic rights rather than independence. Since Ocalan was jailed in 1999, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives. After several meetings with Ocalan at his island prison, the pro-Kurdish DEM party on Thursday relayed his appeal for the PKK to lay down its weapons and convene a congress to announce the organization's dissolution. The PKK said on Saturday it was ready to convene a congress as Ocalan wanted, but 'for this to happen, a suitable secure environment must be created' and Ocalan 'must personally direct and lead it for the success of the congress.' 'More stable Syria' The group also said Ocalan's prison conditions must be eased, adding he 'must be able to live and work in physical freedom and be able to establish unhindered relationships with anyone he wants.' Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz said 'a new phase' began toward achieving the goal of a 'terror-free Turkey,' without making any mention of the PKK statement. 'The dissolution of the terrorist organization without any bargain means a new environment and a new period in terms of development and democracy, as well as security,' he wrote on X. Analysts say establishing a truce with the PKK would be beneficial for Turkey and Syria, where strongman Bashar al-Assad was ousted late last year after a long and bloody civil war. 'A peace deal with the PKK is likely to make it easier to reunify and establish a more stable Syria,' Anthony Skinner, director of research at Marlow Global, told AFP. 'This is a key objective for the Turkish government, which has had to contend with the ongoing threat of cross-border mass migration and terrorism,' he said. The Turkish army, which has troops deployed in northern Syria, regularly carries out strikes on areas controlled by Syrian Kurdish forces it deems 'terrorists' linked to the PKK. Bayram Balci, an analyst at the Sciences Po Paris University, said the PKK was well aware that the regional context has changed. Syria's Kurdish fighters 'no longer have the support of Assad; they may no longer have the strong support of the Americans,' he said. 'The threat of Daesh still exists, but it is not as strong as before. And then there is also a kind of fatigue,' he added, referring to the Islamic State group. 'Historic opportunity' After the last round of peace talks collapsed in 2015, no further contact was made with the PKK until October, when a hardline nationalist ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered a surprise peace gesture if Ocalan rejected violence. Erdogan on Friday said Ocalan's appeal was a 'historic opportunity,' adding Turkey would 'keep a close watch' to make sure the talks to end the insurgency were 'brought to a successful conclusion.' While Erdogan backed the rapprochement, his government cranked up pressure on the opposition, arresting hundreds of politicians, activists and journalists. Iraq has welcomed Ocalan's call, saying it was 'a positive and important step toward achieving stability in the region.' The PKK's presence in Iraq has been a recurrent source of tension between Baghdad and Ankara. The group holds positions in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, where Turkey also maintains military bases and often carries out ground and air operations against Kurdish militants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pkk-declares-ceasefire-with-turkey-after-40-years-of-armed-struggle/7993621.html	2025-03-01T07:36:24-08:00	
Phase one of Israel-Hamas truce set to expire	GAZA CITY — The first phase of the Israel-Hamas truce is due to expire on Saturday, and negotiations on the next stage to secure a permanent ceasefire so far have been inconclusive. The ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19 after more than 15 months of war sparked by the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists, the deadliest in the country's history. Over several weeks, Hamas freed 25 living hostages and returned the bodies of eight others to Israel in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The fragile truce was brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt after months of grueling negotiations. The second phase should begin on Sunday and would secure the release of dozens of hostages still in Gaza. On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was scheduled to hold a ministerial meeting with security officials, according to Israeli media, after he sent a delegation to Egypt for discussions on phase two of the truce. On Thursday, Egypt's State Information Service said: 'The relevant parties have begun intensive talks to discuss the next phases of the truce agreement, amid ongoing efforts to ensure the implementation of the previously agreed understandings.' It also said Israeli, Qatari and U.S. delegations were in Cairo for the talks. By early Saturday, there was no sign of consensus, or of a presence of a Hamas delegation in the Egyptian capital. Max Rodenbeck, of the International Crisis Group think tank, said the second phase cannot be expected to start on Saturday. 'But I think the ceasefire probably won't collapse also,' he said. The preferred Israeli scenario is to free more hostages under an extension of the first phase, rather than a second phase, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said. Hamas, for its part, has pushed hard for phase two to begin after it suffered staggering losses in the devastating war. In a statement, it said that it 'affirms its full commitment to implementing all the provisions of the agreement in all its stages and details.' The group also called for global pressure on Israel 'to immediately enter the second phase of the agreement without any delay.' Ceasefire 'must hold' Of the 251 hostages seized during the Hamas terrorist attack, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday that the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal 'must hold,' with just hours to go before the initial phase expires. 'The coming days are critical. The parties must spare no effort to avoid a breakdown of this deal,' Guterres said in New York. The truce enabled greater aid flows into the territory, where more than 69% of buildings were damaged or destroyed, almost the entire population was displaced, and widespread hunger occurred because of the war, according to the United Nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/phase-one-of-israel-hamas-truce-set-to-expire/7993510.html	2025-03-01T04:48:33-08:00	
Russia says it seized two new villages in eastern Ukraine	MOSCOW — Moscow on Saturday said it seized two more villages in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv officials said Russian strikes killed one person and wounded 19. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces captured Sudne and Burlatske in the south of the eastern Donetsk region. They lie near the town of Velyka Novossilka, which was seized by the Russian army at the end of January. The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 154 drones overnight, of which 103 were downed and 51 disappeared from the radar without causing damage or casualties. Ukrainian regional authorities reported one death and several injuries. In the southern Odesa region, one person died and three were injured, according to Ukrainian prosecutors. Twelve people were wounded in the northeastern Kharkiv region and two others in the southern Kherson region, local authorities said. Two people were wounded in the rail and mining hub of Pokrovsk, where Russian forces are gaining ground, threatening this key logistical hub for Ukrainian troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-it-seized-two-new-villages-in-eastern-ukraine/7993479.html	2025-03-01T03:07:58-08:00	
Anti-corruption purges raise serious questions about China’s military readiness	NEW DELHI — China is in the midst of a sweeping anti-corruption campaign that has seen a growing number of high-ranking military officials removed from their posts. The campaign has been so expansive that when China hosts the Two Sessions next week – Beijing's biggest political event of the year – more than a dozen military officials will not be able to attend. In late February, just days before the Two Sessions begin on March 4, authorities in China announced that Tan Ruisong, former chairman of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or AVIC, was the latest target of the government’s anti-corruption campaign. AVIC is a major defense contractor and aircraft manufacturer that is on Fortune’s Global 500 list. The anti-graft watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), said Tan took huge bribes and 'lived off the military sector.' There has been no public response from Tan or AVIC. Analysts say the purges are part of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s efforts to ensure personal loyalty towards himself within the rank and file of the People’s Liberation Army, or PLA, and less about corruption. More than 14 senior officials have been punished in the past two years. There have been several reports that China’s Defense Minister Dong Jun, a naval officer, may have been put under investigation, although the Foreign Ministry previously denied that was the case late last year. Analysts say they will be watching closely to see if Dong attends the Two Sessions meetings next week. China’s leader has also fired General Li Yuchao, the head of the PLA’s Rocket Force unit — which is responsible for the country’s rocket and missile systems — as well as his deputy. Those sacked are part of the ongoing second wave of disciplinary actions that have included four generals, eight lieutenant generals and two major generals. At least three more aerospace defense executives have been expelled from China's top political advisory body. In his remarks to senior military leaders last June, Xi was clear about the intention of the crackdown. 'We must uphold the party’s absolute leadership over the military,' he said, adding that 'the gun barrel must always be grasped by people who are loyal and reliable to the party.' Xi’s remarks echoed a phrase that Communist Party’s founder Mao Zedong coined, 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' Some see the ongoing anti-corruption campaign as a sign of political struggle within the party. 'Purges are likely a manifestation of growing challenges against Xi by other party leaders. Those military leaders suspected to be less loyal to Xi are likely to be subjected to pre-emptive removal,' Yoichiro Sato, a professor at the College of Asia Pacific Studies in Japan’s Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, told VOA. 'Corruption in the military is nothing new. Corruption charges are a tool of Xi for going after potential challengers to his rule,' he said. The anti-corruption drive is also causing a good amount of political confusion because the targets include those regarded to be close to Xi. They included Miao Hua, who held one of China’s most powerful positions as a member of the Central Military Commission and was head of its Political Work Department. Two consecutive ministers of defense, Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu, also were removed and punished in 2023. Li was removed while in office, and Wei after he had stepped down. Wei served as China’s Defense Minister from March 2018 to March 2023. Before that, he was the commander of the PLA Rocket Force. Miao’s suspension showed that the drive had expanded to the Political Work Department, which acts as the Communist Party’s eyes and ears within the military force. Previously, the anti-corruption campaign concentrated on military departments involved in defense procurement like the Rocket Force unit and the Equipment Development Department, which are regarded as hotbeds of corruption. Analysts say the purges may further strengthen Xi’s position, but they may have negative implications for China as well. They would not just affect the military’s morale but could also hamper its ability to fulfil the party’s plans to take over Taiwan. 'If Xi cannot be sure that the PLA would be able to prevail in the case of a conflict, he is less likely to take on the risks that an operation against Taiwan or in the South China Sea, for example, would entail,' said Helena Legarda, lead analyst at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute of China Studies. 'In the short run, and at least while this second anti-corruption drive takes place, Beijing’s appetite for initiating an open conflict might be reduced.' Rocket Force hit hard Xi has himself raised questions about the PLA’s ability to accomplish essential functions of a modern mission command and accused it of suffering from 'peace disease,' said Roy Kamphausen, senior fellow for Chinese security at the Washington-based National Bureau of Asian Research. 'The decade-long campaign against corruption in the PLA has had a negative impact on morale and thus ability to accomplish its missions, despite technological advances,' Kamphausen told VOA. 'All of this suggests that whatever inclination Xi might have to take Taiwan by force is reduced,' he said. The Rocket Force – which would play a critical role in a potential Taiwan conflict – has been hit hard by anti-corruption purges, Mohan Malik, a non-resident fellow at the Washington-based Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, told VOA. 'Morale and capability suffer when leaders skim off the top or push subpar gear. This suggests the PLA may be less effective than it appears on paper, even as China fields advanced missiles, stealth fighters, and an expanding navy,' he said. Xi cannot permit dissenting generals to continue in crucial positions because of the evolving international situation and the potential for a future global conflict, said Evan Ellis, a Latin America research professor at the U.S. Army War College. 'Xi is conscious that he will have to call on the PLA in a global war with the U.S. in the not distant future. It is vital that he eliminate any risk of dissent or challenge to his political authority on the military,' Ellis told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anti-corruption-purges-raise-serious-questions-about-china-s-military-readiness-/7993475.html	2025-03-01T02:57:00-08:00	
Thailand to repatriate thousands more Myanmar scam center workers	BANGKOK — Thailand said Friday it had agreed with Myanmar and China to repatriate thousands of alleged scam center workers stranded in camps at the Thai-Myanmar border, part of a crackdown on transnational crime. Some 5,000 Chinese nationals will be sent home at a rate of 1,000 a week, starting next week, Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura told reporters. The announcement came after a meeting in Bangkok between Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa, Chinese Assistant Minister for Public Security Liu Zhongyi and Myanmar's deputy home affairs minister Aung Kyaw Kyaw. Cyberscam operations, which have thrived in Myanmar's lawless border areas for several years, lure foreign workers with promises of high-paying jobs but hold them hostage and force them into committing online fraud. Under pressure from key ally Beijing, Myanmar has cracked down on some of the compounds, freeing around 7,000 workers from more than two dozen countries. The freed workers are now languishing in sometimes squalid conditions in holding camps near the Thai border while officials organize their repatriation. Last week some 600 Chinese nationals were returned from Myanmar through Thailand -- and escorted off the plane in handcuffs by police on landing. Many workers say they were trafficked or tricked into taking the work and suffer beatings and abuse, but the government in China has so far treated them as criminal suspects. The remaining 2,000 foreign nationals, including Africans, would go through usual Thai screening processes before being handed to their respective embassies for possible repatriation. The United Nations estimates that as many as 120,000 people -- many of them Chinese men -- may be working in Myanmar scam centers against their will.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-repatriate-thousands-more-myanmar-scam-center-workers-/7993470.html	2025-03-01T02:27:52-08:00

Are egg producers inflating prices during bird flu outbreak to boost profits?	omaha, nebraska — Egg producers blame the bird flu outbreak for driving prices to record highs, but critics believe giant companies are taking advantage of their market dominance to profit handsomely at the expense of budget-conscious egg buyers. Advocacy groups, Democratic lawmakers and a Federal Trade Commission member are calling for a government investigation after egg prices spiked to a record average of $4.95 per dozen this month. The Trump administration did unveil a plan this week to combat bird flu, but how much that might ease egg prices — a key driver of inflation — remains to be seen. 'Donald Trump promised to lower food prices on 'Day One,' but with egg prices skyrocketing out of control, he fired the workers charged with containing bird flu. Working families need relief now,' Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement. What's behind the record egg prices? The industry blames bird flu, as do most experts. More than 166 million birds have been slaughtered to try to contain the virus. Some 30 million egg layers have been wiped out just since January, significantly disrupting egg supplies. The Department of Agriculture's long-standing policy has been to kill entire flocks anytime the virus is found on a farm. As a result, the number of egg layers has dropped nationwide by about 12% from before the outbreak to 292 million birds, according to a Feb. 1 USDA estimate, but another 11 million egg layers have been killed since then, so it's likely worse. When prices spiked to $4.82 two years ago and prompted initial calls for price gouging probes, the flock was above 300 million. 'This has nothing to do with anything other than bird flu. And I think to suggest anything else is a misreading of the facts and the reality,' American Egg Board President Emily Metz said. 'Our farmers are in the fight of their lives, period, full stop. And they're doing everything they can to keep these birds safe,' Metz said. 'This is a supply challenge. Due to bird flu. Nothing else.' Farm Action suspects monopolistic behavior. The group that lobbies on behalf of smaller farmers, consumers and rural communities notes that egg production is down only about 4% from last year and 7.57 billion table eggs were produced last month, yet some consumers are still finding egg shelves empty at their local grocery stores. 'Dominant egg corporations are blaming avian flu for the price hikes that we're seeing. But while the egg supply has fallen only slightly, these companies profits have soared,' said Angela Huffman, Farm Action's president. The Justice Department acknowledged receiving the group's letter calling for an investigation but declined to comment on it. The fact that a jury ruled in 2023 that major egg producers used various means to limit the domestic supply of eggs to increase the price of products during the 2000s only adds to the doubts about their motives now. What do the numbers show? Retail egg prices had generally remained below $2 per dozen for years before this outbreak began. Prices have more than doubled since then, boosting profits for egg producers even as they deal with soaring costs. Most of the dominant producers are privately held companies and don't release their results. But the biggest, Cal-Maine Foods, which supplies about 20% of the nation's eggs, is public, and its profits increased dramatically. Cal-Maine reported a $219 million profit in the most recent quarter when its eggs sold for an average of $2.74 per dozen, up from just $1.2 million in the quarter just before this outbreak began in early 2022 when its eggs were selling for $1.37 per dozen. Sherman Miller, Cal-Maine's president and CEO, said in reporting the numbers that higher market prices 'have continued to rise this fiscal year as supply levels of shell eggs have been restricted due to recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza.' But he said Cal-Maine also sold significantly more eggs — 330 million dozen, up from 288 million the year before — in the quarter because demand is so strong and Cal-Maine has made a number of acquisitions. Cal-Maine also suffered few outbreaks on its farms, outside of a couple facilities in Kansas and Texas. The Mississippi-based company didn't respond to calls from The Associated Press. What about production costs? Economists and analysts say the record egg prices aren't a sure sign of something nefarious, and short-term profits might only last until farms get hit. Once a flock is slaughtered, it can take as long as a year to clean a farm and raise new birds to egg-laying age. The USDA pays farmers for every bird killed, but it doesn't cover all the costs for farmers as they go without income. 'The consumer, I think, will probably feel like they're getting the rough end of the stick. But I guarantee you, the farmers that are having to depopulate the barns, they're having a rougher time,' CoBank analyst Brian Earnest said. Inflation in the costs of feed, fuel and labor have contributed to rising egg prices, and farmers have been investing in biosecurity measures to help keep the virus away. So production costs also appear to be at an all-time high, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' producer price index. 'This isn't a case where they're taking the price up to gouge the market. It is the price is going up through auction at wholesale. And they're benefiting from higher prices because supplies are tight,' University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/are-egg-producers-inflating-prices-during-bird-flu-outbreak-to-boost-profits-/7993385.html	2025-02-28T22:58:36-08:00

Gene Hackman likely died Feb. 17, last day of activity on pacemaker, official says	Academy Award-winning actor Gene Hackman likely died on Feb. 17, the last day there was any activity on his pacemaker, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday. 'According to the pathologist,' Mendoza said, 'that is a very good assumption that was his last day of life,' nine days before investigators found his body. The bodies of Hackman, 95, and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, 64, a classical pianist, were found, along with the dead body of one of their three dogs, Wednesday in their home in the southwestern U.S. state of New Mexico. The initial findings of autopsies on the couple revealed that Hackman and his wife both tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning and 'no external trauma' was reported to either of them. Mendoza said, 'There were no apparent signs of foul play.' However, the couple’s 'manner and cause of death has not been determined,' according to the sheriff. 'The official results of the autopsy and toxicology reports are pending.' Investigators have retrieved an assortment of prescription and over-the-counter medications, in addition to cellphones and records from medical diagnostics testing from the house. 'I'm pretty confident there is no foul play,' Mendoza said Friday on The Today Show. He said the autopsy results 'will steer us in the right direction' in determining what happened to Hackman and his wife. Without the autopsy, the sheriff said, it is difficult to determine how long the couple had been dead. A search warrant affidavit issued Thursday said the circumstances surrounding the couple's deaths were 'suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.' Mendoza told The Today Show that several doors around the house were unlocked and one door in the rear of the house was open. Earlier reports said the front door was open. Hackman's body was found near the rear of the house, while his wife's body was found in a bathroom. The dead dog's body was found in a dog crate, not far from Arakawa's body. The couple had three German shepherds. The other two dogs were found alive and healthy at the property. The search warrant affidavit also revealed that police called the Santa Fe Fire Department and the New Mexico Gas Company to Hackman's residence, but no toxic fumes or leaky pipes were found on the grounds. Storied career Hackman had a lengthy career on stage and screen, including appearing in Broadway shows, on television and in more than 80 films. He won an Oscar for best actor for his role in the 1971 film The French Connection and a best supporting Oscar for the 1992 film Unforgiven. Hackman's resume featured three other Oscar nominations, including his breakout role in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 as well as I Never Sang for My Father in 1970 and Mississippi Burning in 1988. His work crossed genres as he appeared in action movies, thrillers and off-beat comedies. In addition to his award-nominated works, he was also known for roles in films such as The Poseidon Adventure, Young Frankenstein, Superman, Hoosiers, The Birdcage, and The Royal Tenenbaums. His last film was Welcome to Mooseport in 2004. His loss was immediately felt throughout the entertainment community as fellow artists praised him on social media. Director Francis Ford Coppola and actor Morgan Freeman were among those who posted their remembrances of the actor. 'The loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and celebration,' Coppola posted on Instagram. 'Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity. I mourn his loss and celebrate his existence and contribution.' Hackman starred in Coppola's 1974 film The Conversation. Freeman posted on Instagram: 'One of the personal highlights of my career was bringing the French Film Gardé a Vue (Under Suspicion) to life with the incredibly gifted Gene Hackman. And of course... Unforgiven. Rest in peace, my friend.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gene-hackman-likely-died-feb-17-last-day-of-activity-on-pacemaker-official-says/7993422.html	2025-02-28T20:27:03-08:00	
Concern grows in Washington, Seoul about China's disinformation campaign	WASHINGTON — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in the closing statements of his impeachment trial this week said that a Chinese-backed disinformation campaign is threatening South Korea's democracy. The United States has acknowledged Beijing's global disinformation campaign amid growing concerns in Seoul and Washington about China's alleged interference in South Korean politics and elections. 'It's well known that the Chinese Communist Party deploys vast information manipulation campaigns around the world,' a State Department spokesperson said in a statement emailed Wednesday to VOA's Korean Service. 'Fake news, propaganda and disinformation are tools frequently employed as a part of Beijing's diplomacy,' the statement said, using a long-standing practice of anonymity. The comments were made in response to remarks by China's ambassador to Seoul, Dai Bing, who criticized South Korean conservative groups for speaking out about what they view as Beijing's interference in South Korean politics and elections. On Tuesday, Dai told journalists gathered at the Chinese Embassy in Seoul that the groups' 'strong disruptive influence could significantly impact the development of China-South Korea relations.' Dai continued, 'We remain committed to noninterference in South Korea's internal affairs, but we will also take appropriate measures depending on the severity of the situation.' Anti-Chinese sentiment has been growing in South Korea, along with opposition to the impeachment of Yoon, who is now waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on his brief martial law decree in December. Yoon, facing separate charges for insurrection associated with his martial law decree, was impeached by the opposition-controlled National Assembly on Dec. 14, for what they saw as taking an extreme measure designed for times of war. Alleged election interference Thousands of protesters took to the streets in support of arguments made at weekslong court hearings by Yoon's attorneys, who alleged that China and North Korea interfered in South Korean politics and elections to undermine national security. The court wrapped up its impeachment hearings on Tuesday after Yoon made his final statement defending his decree. Yoon said foreign entities have been collaborating with anti-state forces in South Korea in undermining the system of liberal democracy, threatening its national security and driving the country into a state of emergency. 'They have driven the country into the state of conflict and chaos through fake news, manipulation of public opinion and propaganda,' Yoon said. The court's impeachment ruling is expected in mid-March. If the court rules to impeach Yoon, an election will be held within 60 days to select a new president. The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), Lee Jae-myung, known for his pro-China views, is considered a strong candidate. 'China has been actively interfering in South Korea's politics for decades, and recent evidence suggests that Beijing has even been helping the South's leftists rig elections,' said Gordon Chang, senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute and the author of Plan Red: China's Project to Destroy America. Dai's remarks suggest that 'China's communists think no one should ever complain about their brazen meddling,' Chang told VOA on Thursday. Chang and others raised concerns about China's interference in South Korean politics and elections at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, held last week in Washington. At a forum held Friday at CPAC, Fred Fleitz, vice chair of the America First Policy Institute's Center for American Security, said, 'South Korea plays a crucial role in promoting security in the Asia Pacific, and it is a key strategic ally of the United States.' 'That obviously gives strong motivations to China and North Korea to undermine South Korea, to create domestic instability, knowing that it will advance their interests and undermine American and global security,' he continued. 'So this election fraud issue is part of a much bigger security challenge,' Fleitz added. Disinformation campaign China has been accused of attempting to interfere in elections in other democratic countries, including the U.S. and Australia. It is also accused of operating campaigns to influence politics and alter public opinion through media in European countries, including the U.K. and Germany. 'There is certainly Chinese influence to shape [South] Korean public opinion in a direction that would favor PRC interests,' said Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation Chair at the Brookings Institution's Center for Asia Policy Studies, using China's official name, the People's Republic of China. 'This includes support for South Korean candidates who might adopt a more conciliatory approach to China. But I have not seen direct evidence of how China has been directly involved in election interference. If the allegations of Chinese interference are true, those allegations would be troubling and a violation of South Korean sovereignty,' Yeo told VOA on Thursday. Robert Rapson, who served as charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said, 'I don't think there will be any concern on the part of the Trump administration about a transition to a new ROK government should the Constitutional Court uphold Mr. Yoon's impeachment by the National Assembly.' South Korea's official name is the Republic of Korea. He said the U.S. 'can effectively and reliably conduct our two nations' pressing business, regardless of whether that government is led by the DP or PPP' [the ruling People's Power Party].

US plans emergency Israel arms deals worth nearly $3 billion	washington — The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of nearly $3 billion worth of bombs, demolition kits and other weaponry to Israel, the Pentagon said in statements Friday. Congress was notified of the prospective weapons sales Friday afternoon on an emergency basis. That process sidesteps a long-standing practice of giving the chairs and ranking members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees the opportunity to review the sale and ask for more information before making a formal notification to Congress. The sales included 35,529 general-purpose bomb bodies for 2,000-pound bombs and 4,000 bunker-busting 2,000-pound bombs made by General Dynamics. While the Pentagon said deliveries would begin in 2026, it also said 'there is a possibility that a portion of this procurement will come from U.S. stock,' which could mean immediate delivery of some of the weapons. A second package, valued at $675 million, consisted of five thousand 1,000-pound bombs and corresponding kits to help guide the 'dumb' bombs. It's estimated that this package would be delivered in 2028. A third notification listed $295 million worth of Caterpillar D9 bulldozers. Friday's announcements marked the second time this month that the Trump administration has declared an emergency to quickly approve weapons sales to Israel. The Biden administration also utilized emergency authorities to approve arms sales to Israel without congressional review. On Monday, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era order that required it to report potential violations of international law involving U.S.-supplied weapons by allies, including Israel. It has eliminated most U.S. humanitarian foreign aid. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas last month halted 15 months of fighting and paved the way for talks on ending the war, while also leading to the release of 44 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel. However, Israel and Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, casting doubt over the second phase of the deal meant to include releases of additional hostages and prisoners as well as steps toward a permanent end to the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-plans-emergency-israel-arms-deals-worth-nearly-3-billion/7993398.html	2025-02-28T18:41:38-08:00	
Illinois jury convicts man of murdering Palestinian American boy	An Illinois jury on Friday found a man guilty of murder and hate crime charges for an October 2023 stabbing that killed a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy and severely wounded his mother, according to court documents. Joseph Czuba, 73, faces life in prison when he is sentenced in May for a murder that prosecutors said was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred. It took place just days after Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, carried out an Oct. 7, 2023, attack inside Israel. The murder of the boy, Wadee Alfayoumi, and the attack on his mother, Hanan Shaheen, constituted one of the earliest and worst hate crime incidents targeting Muslims in the U.S. after the Hamas attack on Israel. Rights advocates have noted rising Islamophobia and antisemitism in the U.S. since that attack. Czuba, who was the landlord for Shaheen and her son, stabbed the boy 26 times with a military-style knife with an 18-centimeter (7-inch) serrated blade, authorities said. Shaheen suffered multiple stab wounds in the attack, which occurred in Plainfield Township, about 64 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Chicago. During the trial this week, Shaheen testified that Czuba told her 'you, as a Muslim, must die,' according to local media reports. Michael Fitzgerald, prosecutor at the Will County State's Attorney's Office, presented a 911 call recording in the trial. 'The landlord is killing me and my baby,' Shaheen is heard saying on the audio, according to CBS Chicago. Other U.S. incidents raising alarm about anti-Arab bias include the attempted drowning of a 3-year-old Palestinian American girl in Texas and the stabbing of a Palestinian American man in Texas. A few incidents raising alarm about antisemitism include threats of violence against Jews at Cornell University that led to a conviction and sentencing, and an unsuccessful plot to attack a New York Jewish center.	https://www.voanews.com/a/illinois-jury-convicts-man-of-murdering-palestinian-american-boy/7993389.html	2025-02-28T18:30:32-08:00	
Measles cases rise to 146 in outbreak that led to first US measles death in 10 years	DALLAS, TEXAS — The number of people with measles in Texas increased to 146 in an outbreak that led this week to the death of an unvaccinated school-aged child, health officials said Friday. The number of cases — Texas' largest in nearly 30 years — increased by 22 since Tuesday. The Texas Department of State Health Services said cases span over nine counties in Texas and 20 patients have been hospitalized. The child who died Tuesday night in the outbreak is the first U.S. death from the highly contagious but preventable respiratory disease since 2015, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation's top health official and a vaccine critic, said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of the Health and Human Services was watching cases but dismissed the outbreak as 'not unusual.' But on Friday afternoon, Kennedy said in a post on X that his heart went out to families impacted by the outbreak, and he recognized 'the serious impact of this outbreak on families, children, and healthcare workers.' Kennedy also said his agency will continue to fund Texas' immunization program and that ending the outbreak is a 'top priority' for him and his team. The virus has largely spread through rural, oil rig-dotted West Texas, with cases concentrated in a 'close-knit, undervaccinated' Mennonite community, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton has said. Gaines County has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% skipping a required dose last school year. Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. Anton has said the number of unvaccinated kids in Gaines County is likely significantly higher because homeschooled children's data would not be reported. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks. The U.S. had considered measles eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that sickened more than 60. Eastern New Mexico has nine cases of measles, but the state health department said there is no connection to the outbreak in West Texas. At a news conference Friday in Austin, officials urged people to get vaccinated if they are not already. 'We're here to say quite simply: Measles can kill, ignorance can kill and vaccine denial definitely kills,' said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat.	https://www.voanews.com/a/measles-cases-rise-to-146-in-outbreak-that-led-to-first-us-measles-death-in-10-years/7993364.html	2025-02-28T18:10:19-08:00	
Uyghur linguist's presentation dropped at UNESCO summit, igniting fears of Beijing's sway	WASHINGTON — A United Nations-hosted language technology conference has come under scrutiny after organizers abruptly canceled a scheduled presentation by Abduweli Ayup, a prominent Uyghur linguist and human rights advocate. The cancellation, communicated just hours before Ayup’s Feb. 25 talk, has prompted speculation about external pressures, with Ayup and others suggesting China’s influence may have been a factor. Ayup was invited to deliver a 10-minute talk and serve as a panelist and chair/rapporteur at the conference, hosted by the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) at its headquarters in Paris. 'We are pleased to invite you to deliver a talk at the 2nd International Conference on Language Technologies for All (LT4ALL 2025),' the organizer stated in an email Ayup shared with VOA. 'I saw my participation [as] a rare chance on the Uyghur language’s plight — an issue I’ve fought to preserve against Beijing’s relentless suppression,' Ayup told VOA. He said his talk was canceled under pressure from China. 'I see the reason as very simple. It’s because of my critique of China’s systematic erasure of Uyghur language and culture and questioning the Chinese representatives about the Uyghur language ban in education,' Ayup told VOA. A linguistics graduate of the University of Kansas, Ayup returned to China in 2011 to launch Uyghur-language schools in defiance of Mandarin-only mandates. Arrested in 2013 on 'illegal fundraising' charges, he said he endured 15 months of torture before fleeing to Turkey in 2015 and resettling in Norway by 2019. There, he founded Uyghur Hjelp to document China’s cultural crackdown — a work recognized with the 2024 Language Rights Defenders Award. His siblings remain detained in Xinjiang. Beijing’s 'bilingual education' policy in the Uyghur region of Xinjiang in northwest China was enacted in the early 2000s and promised dual-language instruction but was later criticized as a tool of assimilation. By 2017, schools began to ban Uyghur language instruction at schools, a pattern researchers and advocates criticize as linguistic genocide. Late on Feb. 24, Ayup received an email from the LT4ALL Organizing Committee stating, 'We regret to inform you that we only received notice this evening that we were unable to secure approval to include your presentation in tomorrow’s program.' The email sent by the summit organizers and later shared with VOA by Ayup continued, 'Unfortunately, we were informed at the last minute, and this decision is beyond our control.' No further details were provided regarding who denied approval or why. Speaking to Voice of America (VOA), Ayup suggested the cancellation was linked to his criticism of China’s language policies during the summit, which Ayup attended even though he could not deliver his presentation. Earlier that day, he had directly questioned Chinese presenters — including a representative of iFlytek, a tech firm linked to Uyghur surveillance — about Beijing’s restrictions on minority languages. The iFlytek representative who attended the summit did not respond to VOA’s inquiry regarding Ayup’s claim about why his presentation was canceled by the time of this report's publication. iFlytek, a China-based company specializing in voice recognition, has supplied Xinjiang police with voiceprint systems since at least 2016 and partnered with security agencies to build a national database used in the region’s mass surveillance, according to Human Rights Watch. The U.S. sanctioned iFlytek in 2019 for its role in 'high-technology surveillance' aiding China’s repression of Uyghurs, which includes detaining over 1 million since 2017, per U.N. estimates. Ayup told VOA he asked Chinese representatives why China banned Uyghur language from education — a policy enacted first in parts of Xinjiang about 2017 — but received no answer. Following the session, Ayup recounted being confronted by a few Chinese delegates, who questioned why he spoke in English rather than Mandarin and asked about his family’s whereabouts. When he revealed that his brother and sister were detained in Chinese internment camps — possibly now in prisons — the delegates dismissed his claims, labeling his relatives 'terrorists.' 'I believe my encounters with the Chinese representatives have contributed to the exclusion of my presentation from the conference program,' Ayup said. UNESCO’s response UNESCO confirmed the cancellation, attributing it to 'chaotic' planning. In an email response to VOA, a UNESCO official stated that the cancellation only applied to a 'scientific poster' presentation scheduled for a midday break on Feb. 25, not his broader participation in the event. 'UNESCO regrets that no space was available on Tuesday to accommodate Mr. Ayup’s scientific poster. However, this was possible the following day,' the UNESCO official wrote, adding, '[T]his logistical setback did not prevent him from participating in the Conference as such and from raising the issue of the Uyghur language.' UNESCO noted that Ayup spoke freely during roundtables and was given the floor whenever he requested it. The organization attributed the issue to 'chaotic' planning by academic co-organizers, who extended invitations without full coordination. Ayup disputes that account, arguing that UNESCO, under pressure from China — a member of the U.N. Security Council — may have sought to limit his platform. Other prominent human rights activists echoed those concerns on the social media platform X. Former World Uyghur Congress President Dolkun Isa denounced the 'last-minute cancellation of linguist Abduweli Ayup’s presentation on the Uyghur language without any explanation,' calling it 'seemingly influenced by Chinese interests. Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch, also weighed in, pointing to iFlytek’s presence at the conference. 'UNESCO abruptly cancelled his presentation but allowed a Chinese voice recognition/surveillance company iFlytek + Hunan state TV to whitewash China's erasure of minority languages,' she wrote. Ayup’s ordeal didn’t end with cancellation. He told VOA an unidentified Chinese man shadowed him, filming him during breaks — a claim backed by an attendee’s video, later shared with VOA. Ayup told VOA he’s not the first to face restrictions at a U.N.-related event, stating, 'There are precedents.' He pointed to Tove Skutnabb-Kangas, an expert at the 2019 U.N. Forum on Minority Issues in Geneva, who claimed her speech on 'linguistic and cultural genocide' naming Uyghurs and China was censored by organizers fearing state backlash. 'Freedom of speech denied at the U.N.!' she wrote, later sharing her original text online after it was altered. Ayup sees this as part of a pattern limiting discussion of Uyghur repression at U.N. forums.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uyghur-linguist-s-presentation-dropped-at-unesco-summit-igniting-fears-of-beijing-s-sway-/7993363.html	2025-02-28T17:53:42-08:00	
WHO says water contamination suspected in Congo village hit by illness	BASANKUSU, Democratic Republic of Congo — Authorities investigating the deaths of at least 60 people in northwestern Democratic Republic of Congo suspect the water source in one of the areas may have been contaminated, the World Health Organization said Friday. But the agency said it's too early for a definitive conclusion. Doctors are investigating more than 1,000 illnesses that have emerged since late January in five villages in Congo's Equateur province, where high rates of malaria have complicated efforts to diagnose the cases and where officials have said they've been unable so far to confirm the main cause. WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said during an online briefing Friday that for one of the villages there is 'a very strong level of suspicion ... related to the poisoning of a water source.' Ryan did not clarify whether he was referring to contamination by accident, negligence or deliberate action. He also did not identify the village where the poisoning was suspected. 'We will not stop investigating until we are sure that the true cause or the absolute cause of what is occurring here is fully investigated,' Ryan said. Illnesses were first detected in late January in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours. Twelve cases and eight deaths in total have been recorded in Boloko, with no new cases recorded since January, officials say, adding that nearly half of deaths there occurred within hours of the onset of symptoms. The village of Bomate in Basankusu health zone, around 200 kilometers from Boloko, has been hit the most: 98% of the cases and 86% of deaths have been recorded there, health officials say. WHO said on Thursday that hundreds of the patients have tested positive for malaria, which is common in the region. In addition to common malaria symptoms such as fever and body aches, patients have also shown symptoms such as chills, sweating, stiff neck, runny or bleeding nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhea. The health crisis has caused fear among residents, some of whom have said they fled the villages to avoid falling sick. Experts say that access to the sick has been hindered by the remote locations of the affected villages and that several people died before medical teams were able to reach them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-says-water-contamination-suspected-in-congo-village-hit-by-illness-/7993380.html	2025-02-28T17:46:29-08:00	
European leaders stand by Ukraine after heated exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy	European leaders across much of the continent vowed to stand by Ukraine after a White House meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy turned into a heated exchange Friday, with Trump calling Zelenskyy 'disrespectful.' European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it has become clear that 'the free world needs a new leader.' 'Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine,' Kallas wrote on the social media platform X. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on X, 'Ukraine can rely on Germany — and on Europe,' while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on social media, 'Ukraine, Spain stands with you.' 'Dear @ZelenskyyUa, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone,' wrote Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on X. French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters in Portugal, 'Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people.' Other European leaders, including from Finland, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Norway, also took to social media to voice support for Ukraine. Not all European leaders backed Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has long been critical of EU military aid to Kyiv, posted on X, 'President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr. President!' The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy came as the two countries were seeking a deal that would allow the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare mineral rights. The discussion took a combative tone about 40 minutes into the meeting when Zelenskyy raised Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea. U.S. Vice President JD Vance immediately criticized Zelenskyy, accusing him of engaging in a 'propaganda tour.' Both Vance and Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of not being thankful for the assistance his country has received from Washington. After the meeting abruptly ended, the White House confirmed that the mineral deal was not signed. US response In the U.S., many Republicans in Congress expressed support for Trump's actions. Senator Lindsey Graham, who has previously supported military aid to Ukraine, said, 'What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful and I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again.' House Republican leader Steve Scalise, who has also previously supported military aid to Ukraine, wrote on X, 'President Trump is fighting for PEACE around the world and is putting America First as our best negotiator — he's the only one to get Russia to the table to consider a serious and lasting peace agreement with Ukraine.' Republican Representative Andy Biggs wrote on X, 'Dictator Zelensky had the audacity to disrespect President @realDonaldTrump and VP @JDVance during what should have been a friendly meeting, and @POTUS rightfully showed him the door. This is the leadership America has craved for four years.' Democratic leaders in Congress argued that Trump's actions would only benefit Russia. 'Trump and Vance are doing [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's dirty work. Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote in a statement, 'Today's White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator. The United States must not reward Russian aggression and continue to appease Putin.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-leaders-stand-by-ukraine-after-heated-exchange-between-trump-zelenskyy-/7993337.html	2025-02-28T16:49:25-08:00	
Iowa removes gender identity protections from state's civil rights code	DES MOINES, Iowa — Iowa became the first U.S. state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code on Friday when Governor Kim Reynolds signed into law a bill that opponents say will expose transgender people and other Iowans to discrimination in all aspects of daily life. The new law, which goes into effect July 1, follows several years of action from Reynolds and Iowa Republicans to restrict transgender students' use of such spaces as bathrooms and locker rooms, and their participation on sports teams, in an effort to protect people assigned female at birth. Republicans say those policies cannot co-exist with a civil rights code that includes gender identity protections. The law passed quickly after being introduced last week. It also creates explicit legal definitions of female and male based on their reproductive organs at birth, rejecting the idea that a person can transition to another gender. Reynolds proposed a similar bill last year, but it didn't make it to a vote of the full House or Senate. Reynolds posted a video on social media explaining her signature on the bill and acknowledging that it was a 'sensitive issue for some.' 'It's common sense to acknowledge the obvious biological differences between men and women. In fact, it's necessary to secure genuine equal protection for women and girls,' she said, adding that the previous civil rights code 'blurred the biological line between the sexes.' President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to formalize a definition of the two sexes at the federal level, leading several Republican-led legislatures to push for laws defining male and female. Trump posted in support of the Iowa bill on his Truth Social platform Thursday after it got final approval from the Iowa House and Senate. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in the House and Senate in voting against the bill. Iowa state Representative Aime Wichtendahl was the final Democrat to speak before the vote, wiping away tears as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: 'I transitioned to save my life.' 'The purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,' Wichtendahl said. 'The sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.' Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading 'Trans rights are human rights' and chanting slogans including 'No hate in our state!' There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. The few protesters who lingered for final passage of the bill were emotional. Not all states include gender identity in their civil rights codes, but Iowa is now the first in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank. Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state's Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers. The House Republican moving the bill Thursday, Representative Steven Holt, said that if the Legislature can add protections, it can remove them. As of July 1, Iowa's civil rights law will protect against discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status. Iowa's Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity. Advocacy groups promise to defend transgender rights, which may lead them to court. Keenan Crow, director of policy and advocacy for LGBTQ+ advocacy group One Iowa, said the organization is still analyzing the text of the bill and that its vagueness makes it 'hard to determine where the enforcement is going to come from.' 'We will pursue any legal options available to us,' Crow said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iowa-removes-gender-identity-protections-from-state-s-civil-rights-code/7993352.html	2025-02-28T16:44:48-08:00	
US tariff hike on vehicle imports could impact Nigeria's auto market	ABUJA, NIGERIA — For longtime automotive importer David Tope, Nigeria's auto market has become increasingly difficult. He used to import up to five vehicles per week from the United States and Canada. But since 2023, import costs have surged dramatically, driven by currency depreciation and increased duties. By early 2025, Tope paused his import business. 'It's not just the country that's the thing, but our inflation rate is so high on duties and the naira devaluation — so it's affecting importing from any country at all,' said Tope. 'It's not just for the car to be cheap, but also for our custom duties to be reconsidered so that the normal man can at least survive this business of car dealership.' While Tope mulls his next move, the U.S. announced an impending 25% tariff on vehicle imports, starting in April. Though the policy targets cars entering the U.S., the decision could impact Nigeria's auto market, which depends on American used car exports. 'U.S. is the main market of importation that we do, so if inflation rate of 25% is being put on their cars, it's going to affect Nigeria market,' Tope said. 'If the cars are being produced in U.S., it is going to be cheaper for us. But if the cars are being imported to U.S, then exported to us, the inflation rate will be unbearable for car dealers like me.' Importers aren't the only ones affected. Vehicle prices in Nigeria have jumped nearly 400% over the past two years, putting car ownership out of reach for many consumers. Nigerians such as Emmanuel Aaron and Akintunde Akinmolaye worry the U.S. tariff will exacerbate price woes. 'Honestly, the cost has gone so, so high that my interest in buying cars has to be suspended,' Aaron said. 'We know that U.S. cars are built with quality, care and comfort compared to other places,' said Akinmolaye, 'but in terms of cost now, cost may make one jettison all those preferences.' Economist Hauwa Mustapha believes a 25% U.S. tariff could reshape Nigeria's auto market. If the U.S. prioritizes local vehicle production, fewer used cars could be available for export, pushing up prices in Nigeria. Beyond affordability, she said the import business itself is at risk. Thousands of Nigerians depend on vehicle imports for their livelihoods — from importers to mechanics, parts dealers and transport workers. Currently, Nigeria produces about 14,000 vehicles annually, a small fraction of what its market demands. Experts say strengthening local manufacturing is the only long-term solution. Mustapha said more needs to be done to revive and strengthen the country's steel industry. Shoring up Nigeria's supportive infrastructure, she said, 'will enable more production of some of these already locally assembled vehicles.' For now, Nigerian importers like Tope are in wait-and-see mode.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-tariff-hike-on-vehicle-imports-could-impact-nigeria-s-auto-market-/7993129.html	2025-02-28T16:32:09-08:00	
UN chief urges US to reverse ‘severe’ aid cuts to humanitarian programs	NEW YORK — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday that Washington has notified many U.N. agencies and humanitarian and development organizations this week of 'severe' funding cuts, which he said will be 'devastating' for the world’s most vulnerable people, and he urged the Trump administration to reconsider them. 'Going through with these cuts will make the world less healthy, less safe and less prosperous,' Guterres told reporters at the United Nations. 'The reduction of America’s humanitarian role and influence will run counter to American interests globally.' He urged the United States, as well as other countries that have recently announced reductions in humanitarian and development aid, to reverse their decisions after more careful reviews of the programs. 'In the meantime, every United Nations agency stands ready to provide the necessary information and justification for its projects,' Guterres added. 'And we look forward to working with the United States in this regard.' The U.N. chief did not give a dollar figure of how much the U.N. and its agencies will lose and would not take reporters’ questions. But the United States is the largest single donor in terms of humanitarian funding to the United Nations humanitarian appeal. In 2024, it provided $14 billion, just over 40% of the total contributions. By contrast, Germany, the second-largest contributor, provided $2.7 billion, or about 8% of global funding. The Trump administration, through its Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has slashed $60 billion in overseas assistance as part of its effort to massively cut government costs. That included shuttering the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and reversing decades of U.S. foreign policy that viewed the soft power of humanitarian aid as being in America’s national interest. That has left scores of international aid agencies scrambling to try to keep their programs going. The secretary-general said U.N. staff in the field are also taking urgent steps to protect as much of their lifesaving work as possible. Guterres gave some examples of where U.S. cuts would affect — or already have affected — provision of critical services. 'In Afghanistan, more than 9 million people will miss out on health and protection services, with hundreds of mobile health teams and other services suspended,' he said. In South Sudan, he said, funding has run out for programs to support people who have fled the war in neighboring Sudan. And in Ukraine, cash-based humanitarian assistance has been suspended in key regions. 'Our absolute priority remains clear,' Guterres said. 'We will do everything we can to provide lifesaving aid to those in urgent need. And we will continue our efforts to diversify the pool of generous donors who support our work.' Questioned later by reporters, Guterres’ spokesperson said the agencies had been informed by letter of the cuts, most coming from USAID’s acting deputy administrator, Peter Marocco. Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that U.N. officials 'at a fairly senior level' had tried to talk with U.S. officials about the cuts. 'But I can’t say we’ve detected much interest in engaging on this issue,' he said. Dujarric listed some of the agencies that have received termination letters, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which received 27 letters; the International Office for Migration (IOM), which had 22 of 25 USAID programs terminated; and the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which had about 50 projects terminated. 'Their office in Mexico, which deals among other things with the flow of fentanyl, may have to close,' Dujarric said of UNODC. 'It will impact their programs in Central America and the Darien Gap focusing on fighting human trafficking.' UNAIDS, which provides lifesaving HIV treatment around the world, said Friday that it received a letter from Washington on Thursday terminating its agreement with UNAIDS 'with immediate effect.' This follows the decision in late January by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to continue funding UNAIDS while the U.S. foreign assistance review was ongoing and other international assistance was paused. 'This is a serious development which impacts the entire HIV response, including in the continuity of lifesaving HIV services for people living with and affected by HIV, civil society and our partners,' UNAIDS said in a statement. Since 2003, through its PEPFAR program, the United States has helped save more than 26 million lives by investing in critical HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programs in 55 countries. Rubio has said that going forward, all foreign aid must make America safer, stronger and more prosperous. A State Department spokesperson said Thursday that so far more than 9,100 foreign assistance-related grants worth over $15.9 billion have been reviewed. More than 4,100 grants worth nearly $4.4 billion have been identified for elimination as part of 'the America First agenda' — a 28% reduction in total grant value. 'USAID evaluated 6,200 multiyear awards with $58.2 billion in value remaining,' the spokesperson added. 'At the conclusion of a process led by USAID leadership, including tranches personally reviewed by Secretary Rubio, nearly 5,800 awards with $54 billion in value remaining were identified for elimination as part of the America First agenda — a 92% reduction.' State Department Correspondent Nike Ching contributed to this report.

White House media access stirs debate	WASHINGTON — Who gets access to cover the White House and what their role is have been the subject of debate over the past few weeks. The two main issues are a lawsuit filed by The Associated Press to contest the White House's restrictions on its reporters, and the White House's announcement that it is taking control of the pool system that provides close-up coverage of the president. Here's a breakdown on the cases. White House to pick press pool In a departure from decadeslong precedent, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that the White House will decide which reporters make up the press pool. 'Legacy outlets who have participated in the press pool for decades will still be allowed to join — fear not,' Leavitt said during a press briefing. 'We will also be offering the privilege to well-deserving outlets who have never been allowed to share in this awesome responsibility.' The press pool is a rotating group of journalists from print, TV and radio who cover the president up close each day for the broader press corps. VOA is among the outlets that provides pool coverage. The White House Correspondents' Association, or WHCA, has coordinated the press pool since the 1950s. The association's nearly 800 members represent nearly 300 news organizations. Not all members of the association are part of the presidential pool – only those that can devote the time and resources needed to accompany the president on trips. The WHCA described the decision to change the system as an affront to press freedom. 'This move tears at the independence of a free press in the United States,' WHCA president Eugene Daniels said in a statement. 'In a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps.' Some media outlets that are part of the pool and rely on its coverage have said the change could hamper the spread of reliable information. AP restrictions A judge this week described the White House's ban on The AP as 'problematic' but declined to immediately order the White House to restore the news agency's access. The nonprofit news agency has been blocked from some White House events, as well as the Oval Office and Air Force One, over its editorial decision to retain the 'Gulf of Mexico' name to refer to the body of water that Trump renamed the Gulf of America via an executive order. After Trump issued his 'Gulf of America' executive order, the news agency said it would continue referring to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico while acknowledging the name Trump had picked in an effort to avoid confusing its international audiences. Many news outlets have followed The AP's lead, but others, including VOA, Fox and Axios, have changed their style to reflect the executive order. VOA, like many other media outlets, also subscribes to The AP's news and video services. Jane Kirtley, a media ethics and law professor at the University of Minnesota, said it could be considered unethical for news outlets to comply with such orders from a president. 'I think there is an argument that the ethical thing to do for a news organization is to resist that,' Kirtley told VOA. 'In order to maintain their independence, they sometimes need to fight back against overreaching by the government.' In a lawsuit filed Feb. 21, The AP said the ban violates its First Amendment free speech rights and its Fifth Amendment procedural rights, because it had no chance to appeal the decision internally. Trump has stood by the ban, saying, 'We're gonna keep them [The AP] out until such time as they agree that it's the Gulf of America.' At the Monday court hearing, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden said The AP had not yet demonstrated that it had suffered irreparable harm. The White House celebrated McFadden's ruling. 'As we have said from the beginning, asking the president of the United States questions in the Oval Office and aboard Air Force One is a privilege granted to journalists, not a legal right,' it said in a statement. Still, McFadden said the White House's restriction on AP was problematic. 'It seems pretty clearly viewpoint discrimination,' he said. Viewpoint discrimination is when the government retaliates against individuals or news outlets over specific viewpoints. The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that such discrimination constitutes a First Amendment violation because it prevents a level playing field for all opinions. After the Monday hearing, AP spokesperson Lauren Easton said in a statement that the news agency looked forward to the next hearing 'where we will continue to stand for the right of the press and the public to speak freely without government retaliation.' In its statement after the Monday hearing, the White House said, 'We stand by our decision to hold the Fake News accountable for their lies.' The next hearing in The AP's lawsuit is set for March 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/debate-over-white-house-media-access/7993114.html	2025-02-28T16:20:21-08:00	
China's backdoor to US markets may be closing soon	washington — President Donald Trump's 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, scheduled to kick in Tuesday, will affect not only those two countries but also will have direct implications on Chinese companies. The Hofusan Industrial Park is a complex about 20 km north of Monterrey, Mexico, and a 2.5-hour drive to the U.S. border city of Laredo, Texas. The industrial park, set up specifically for Chinese companies, describes itself as 'an ideal logistics hub for the North American market' on its website. The site also promotes itself as 'an alternative' to exporting Chinese products to America' and lists 'to avoid trade barriers' as reasons for Chinese capital to be invested in the Mexico-based industrial park. At a Thursday news conference, Trump repeated his reasons for imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, which also goes into effect Tuesday. 'The drugs come in through Mexico. A lot of them, not all, but a lot come from China, and that's why we did that,' Trump said. The tariffs are not aimed solely at drugs, according to Evan Ellis, research professor of Latin American studies and a China expert at the U.S. Army War College. He told VOA that Trump 'also is sending the message that his administration will not allow Chinese companies to use Mexico as a pass-through, for tariff-free access to the U.S. market, by reinventing themselves as Mexican companies, however attractive such investment may be in the short term to Mexico.' The 25% tariff on Mexican imports will 'significantly' affect these Chinese businesses, said Christopher Tang, business and supply chain professor at the University of California-Los Angeles. 'These tariffs can erode their competitive advantage and profit margins. The tariffs effectively close the U.S. market door for these companies unless they find alternative strategies to mitigate the impact,' Tang said. Chinese companies that operate within the Hofusan Industrial Park did not respond to VOA's requests for comment. Tang expects Chinese companies in Mexico to either refocus on Latin American markets, if they stay in Mexico, or move their operations to the U.S. or Asia to avoid the steep tariff. Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said, 'Chinese companies located in Canada or Mexico will obviously be targets of the United States. Therefore, I think Chinese companies need to look for other locations, and possible destinations include Australia, Japan, Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, Brazil.' Mexico: cost-effective alternative Tariffs imposed during Trump's first term, maintained and expanded during Joe Biden's presidency, plus higher transportation costs in recent years, prompted many Chinese companies to look for an alternate, more cost-effective way of entering the U.S. market. Mexico became their first choice for building factories, and the Hofusan Industrial Park tailored for Chinese enterprises broke ground in 2017. Some companies import products or components from China to produce in Mexico and export to the United States. Others have been manufacturing and assembling their products in Mexico, putting on the 'Made in Mexico' label, and sending the products to the United States with no tariff. Currently there are about 40 companies in the industrial park, including engineering equipment manufacturer Lingong Heavy Machinery, electric car manufacturer BYD, home appliance manufacturer Hisense, solar panel manufacturer Trina Solar and Man Wah Furniture. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), implemented in July 2020, allows Mexican-made products that meet certain rules of origin to enter the U.S. tariff free. The agreement is up for review and renewal in July 2026. If it is not renewed or if there are even more tariffs imposed on Mexican imports, 'the incentives for Chinese investment going to Mexico will largely go away, and thus Mexico will not reap the continued benefits of the current rush by Chinese companies to invest in Mexico to take advantage of nearshoring anyway,' said Ellis. Chinese reshoring Xeneta, an Oslo-based company that analyzes air and ocean freight markets, said in a study last year that China's trade with Mexico was 'the fastest growing trade route on the planet.' Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico has also increased significantly over the past five years. The automotive industry has long been a major driver of Chinese direct investment in Mexico, accounting for about a third of Mexican investment since the mid-2010s. But in the past few years, it has become the main driver of investment. According to an analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group, in 2023, Chinese companies invested $2.72 billion in the automotive sector, accounting for 72% of China's investment in Mexico that year. This trend continued until the first half of 2024, with automotive industry investment accounting for three-quarters of China's total investment in Mexico. Backdoor concern Mexico's rapidly growing trade relationship with China has aroused concerns in the United States that Chinese companies are using the 'backdoor' of USMCA to continue to import goods into the U.S. Nick Vyas, a global supply chain expert at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, told VOA that Chinese companies setting up factories in Mexico have become a pressing issue in bilateral trade negotiations between the United States and Mexico. 'Chinese direct or indirect investment in Mexico has now become a question,' he said. 'When we say 'Made in Mexico,' is it really made in Mexico or is it assembled in Mexico?' 'Traceability and trade compliance will be the focus of the next generation of trade issues,' said Vyas, who believes that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is likely to sacrifice the interests of these Chinese companies if necessary. Ellis said, 'It is likely that there will be an escalation in the trade war that will further damage the already fragile PRC [People’s Republic of China] economy and Chinese companies, if the PRC government responds with tariffs of its own.' But a trade war is also worrying U.S. businesses and consumers, said Tang. 'Cost goes up, price goes up, and availability/choices will go down,' he said. '[The] U.S. needs time to rebuild its industrial ecosystem that has been hollowed out since the 1980s. Pushing so many tariffs all at once without securing the production capabilities and capacity is very risky.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-backdoor-to-us-markets-may-be-closing-soon-/7993320.html	2025-02-28T16:03:22-08:00

Investigation into deaths of Gene Hackman, wife continues in New Mexico	Authorities are continuing their investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Academy Award-winning actor Gene Hackman, 95, and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, 64, a classical pianist. The couple were found dead, along with one of their dogs, Wednesday in their home in the southwestern U.S. state of New Mexico. Investigators have retrieved an assortment of prescription and over-the-counter medications, in addition to cellphones and records from medical diagnostics testing from the house. 'I'm pretty confident there is no foul play,' Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday on The Today Show. He said the autopsy results 'will steer us in the right direction' in determining what happened to Hackman and his wife. Without the autopsy, the sheriff said, it is difficult to determine how long the couple had been dead. A search warrant affidavit issued Thursday said the circumstances surrounding the couple's deaths were 'suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.' Mendoza told The Today Show that several doors around the house were unlocked and one door in the rear of the house was open. Earlier reports said the front door was open. Hackman's body was found near the rear of the house, while his wife's body was found in a bathroom. The dead dog's body was found in a dog crate, not far from Arakawa's body. The couple had three German shepherds. The other two dogs were found alive and healthy at the property. The search warrant affidavit also revealed that police called the Santa Fe Fire Department and the New Mexico Gas Company to Hackman's residence, but no toxic fumes or leaky pipes were found on the grounds. Storied career Hackman had a lengthy career on stage and screen, including appearing in Broadway shows, on television and in more than 80 films. He won an Oscar for best actor for his role in the 1971 film The French Connection and a best supporting Oscar for the 1992 film Unforgiven. Hackman's resume featured three other Oscar nominations, including his breakout role in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 as well as I Never Sang for My Father in 1970 and Mississippi Burning in 1988. His work crossed genres as he appeared in action movies, thrillers and off-beat comedies. In addition to his award-nominated works, he was also known for roles in films such as The Poseidon Adventure, Young Frankenstein, Superman, Hoosiers, The Birdcage, and The Royal Tenenbaums. His last film was Welcome to Mooseport in 2004. His loss was immediately felt throughout the entertainment community as fellow artists praised him on social media. Director Francis Ford Coppola and actor Morgan Freeman were among those who posted their remembrances of the actor. 'The loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and celebration,' Coppola posted on Instagram. 'Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity. I mourn his loss and celebrate his existence and contribution.' Hackman starred in Coppola's 1974 film The Conversation. Freeman posted on Instagram: 'One of the personal highlights of my career was bringing the French Film Gardé a Vue (Under Suspicion) to life with the incredibly gifted Gene Hackman. And of course... Unforgiven. Rest in peace, my friend.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/investigation-into-deaths-of-gene-hackman-wife-continues-in-new-mexico/7993040.html	2025-02-28T13:58:07-08:00	
Russia and China's relationship may not be as strong as it seems, report says	WASHINGTON — On the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed Beijing's 'no limits' partnership with Moscow in a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Chinese state media. 'China-Russia relations have strong internal driving force and unique strategic value,' Xi said, according to the official readout from state media. He also called Russia a 'true friend' and a 'good neighbor.' The sentiment is not new. Moscow and Beijing have long touted the strength and long-term nature of their relationship. But according to a new report from Filter Labs, a U.S.-based political research and analysis company, Russia and China's relationship may be weaker than they want the rest of the world to believe. 'Their partnership is vulnerable,' Filter Labs founder Jonathan Teubner told VOA. 'This 'no limits' partnership is much more complicated.' 'Infused with doubt' While the governments and state-run media from both countries work to project the image of a strong partnership, their relationship may be underpinned by more tension, mistrust and competing interests than previously thought, according to an extensive analysis of news media and social media posts by Filter Labs. 'The axis is infused with doubt, ripe for disruption,' the report said. Teubner added, 'The monolith theory of the China-Russia relationship isn't necessarily the way it has to be.' But not all experts agree that the Russia-China relationship is fragile. 'The China-Russia relationship continues to deepen and widen, and occasional disagreements are dwarfed by the scale and momentum of their strategic cooperation,' Robert Blackwill and Richard Fontaine wrote in a 2024 Council on Foreign Relations report. From the Chinese perspective, according to the Filter Labs report, there are doubts over the true resilience of Russia's economy, whether Russia's military is as strong as it says it is, and what Russia's true intentions are in the long term. Meanwhile, says Filter Labs, Russian doubts pertain to quality concerns about Chinese goods, how militarily committed China actually is to Russia, and whether Chinese investment in Russia is really that substantial. Chinese state media is generally positive about the state of the Russian economy and often criticizes Western sanctions. However, Chinese netizens are increasingly worried about the impact that secondary sanctions could have on China. The United States has threatened to use secondary sanctions against Chinese businesses viewed as engaging with Russia, pushing some Chinese netizens to weigh the value of China's relationship with Russia against its ability to trade with the United States. Once those sanctions are enforced on China, Teubner predicts, it will lead to changes in the Russia-China relationship. 'The sanctions on Russia actually have a pretty important countering Chinese effect, too,' said Teubner, who thinks the sanctions are the biggest source of friction between Beijing and Moscow. Quality concerns Meanwhile, the most common doubt among Russians about China pertains to quality concerns about Chinese goods, according to the report. In Russia, Chinese goods have a reputation for being affordable but of poor quality. 'We see more persistent complaints about Chinese goods,' Teubner said. 'That's paired with Russian anxiety over pairing itself so deeply to China,' Teubner added. 'That comes through very strongly in Russian anxieties toward being subordinated to the Chinese economy.' One consequence of Russia's war in Ukraine has been that it has pushed Russia and China closer together, prompting some governments to default to treating the autocratic duo as a bloc, according to Teubner. 'It will increasingly be that way unless we do something to keep them apart,' Teubner said. The report recommends that the United States and its allies and partners take advantage of the fault lines to drive a wedge between Russia and China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-and-china-s-relationship-may-not-be-as-strong-as-it-seems-report-says-/7992996.html	2025-02-28T13:54:29-08:00	
Pope Francis has new medical setback	Pope Francis had a setback Friday during his stay at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital, where he has been for the last two weeks. The Vatican said an 'isolated breathing incident' caused the 88-year-old pontiff to inhale his own vomit, which required noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Francis was conscious during the episode and was able to cooperate and participate in the maneuvers needed for his recovery. The Vatican said the pope remained 'alert and well-oriented.' The news of Friday’s complication followed three days of reports of improvement in Francis’ medical condition. The Vatican also announced Friday that Francis would not lead the Ash Wednesday service next week that marks the beginning of the Lenten season leading to Easter Sunday. A senior Vatican official will stand in for the pope. Doctors said Thursday that Francis' 'prognosis remains guarded,' suggesting that they did not think he was out of danger. Francis spent Thursday morning in respiratory therapy. Later, he prayed in the chapel of his private suite at Gemelli Hospital, where he also received the Eucharist. After that, the pope attended to Vatican work responsibilities. Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, was admitted to Gemelli Feb. 14 with a case of bronchitis that soon worsened to double pneumonia. This hospital stay is his longest during his time as pope. He is prone to lung infections, having had part of a lung removed when he was a young man. Some of the faithful who have journeyed to Rome to see the Vatican and possibly the pope have altered their plans and are now saying prayers for Francis outside the hospital for his full recovery. Lili Iparea Fernandez, from La Cruz, Mexico, traveled to Rome with other pilgrims from Mexico, hoping to participate in Francis' general audience this week. When that was canceled, she decided to pray for him outside the hospital instead. 'We firmly believe that the pope will recover because he is a very strong man,' she said Thursday. 'So, I invite everyone to believe firmly, with certainty, with confidence, with hope, that the pope is going to be well.' The pope's illness has prompted Catholics to gather in Vatican City, his native Argentina and other areas of the world to hold prayer vigils. Francis became pope in 2013 when his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, resigned. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-has-new-medical-setback/7993031.html	2025-02-28T13:51:45-08:00

Chinese companies expand overseas as domestic economy stalls	WASHINGTON — On a recent cold day in February, Virginia resident Raymond Fong sat outside the Tysons Corner mall for nearly two hours on a stool he brought from home to wait in line for a taste of milk tea from a new China-based beverage business. China’s popular fruit and milk tea chain, Heytea, is one of a number of Chinese businesses that are looking for better economic opportunities abroad amid a slowing economy at home. While U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs are creating more uncertainties for Chinese businesses at home, a growing number of companies from China are expanding in the U.S. Heytea made its debut in the Washington metropolitan area on Valentine’s Day, marking the opening of the company’s 27th store in the United States. Heytea has opened nearly 80 stories outside China. Fong visited the store just days after it opened. 'There were so many people in line that the mall was full, and we had to line up outside,' Fong told VOA’s Mandarin Service. Since opening in 2012, Heytea has mostly focused on serving China’s domestic market. But in 2023, the company made a rapid shift to expand its reach overseas to countries including the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Malaysia and South Korea. Other popular Chinese food and beverage brands have also made inroads into international markets. Research company Rhodium Group reported a rebounding of overall Chinese investments abroad since the pandemic. Outbound investments by Chinese companies bottomed out at $47 billion in 2020 but then increased to $67 billion in 2022 and $103 billion in 2023, according to the Rhodium Group. While food and beverage brands are just a small slice of these investments, these brands are what consumers see. 'Some people call 2023 'the first year of going overseas' [for restaurants and beverage businesses]. I think there are several reasons. One is that the domestic market is no longer viable,' said a Beijing-based macroeconomic researcher who requested anonymity for fear of harassment from Chinese police. The researcher added that the businesses 'are all listed in Hong Kong and have raised funds. Hong Kong is an open market. They are listed there, raised money, and then they will not invest back to mainland China, so they want to test the waters in the United States.' Success in Vietnam As early as 2018, Mixue Ice City, a popular ice cream and tea chain founded in Henan province, China, began opening stores in Vietnam and then began picking up that expansion over the past few years with shops opening in South Korea, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore. The company now has over 7,000 stores in 11 countries, with more than 1,000 of those stores located in Vietnam. Founded in Sichuan province, China, in 1994, hot pot chain Haidilao has restaurants in numerous countries and went public on the U.S. Nasdaq stock market in May 2024. Eric Wong, a New York-based investor, said Chinese food companies' decisions to expand overseas were made out of necessity, given the current state of China’s economy. 'Their profit margins within China are falling. The domestic market is very competitive, so they want to develop overseas,' Wong told VOA. But operating overseas includes challenges, especially for businesses that have been accustomed to operating within China and using local supply chains. 'Take Haidilao as an example. They can succeed in China because they own the entire industrial chain. It hasn’t established this same advantage overseas, so it is more difficult to do business,' Wong said. Still, Chinese companies can make high profits from international storefronts, despite the difficulties of taking the business abroad, the Beijing-based researcher said. 'Although the cost of opening a store in Europe and the United States is very high, it is still profitable. Because the cost is high, the threshold is high, and the profit margin is high. Of course, their market is not that big because the main market is Chinese,' the researcher said. Food and beverage companies are just one part of a larger picture of Chinese producers seeking profits abroad. Expansionary efforts from brick-and-mortar companies such as Pop Mart and Miniso, which produce collectible toys and figurines, and online retailer Temu, display a cross-industry trend of desires to develop in Western markets. Consumers within America have embraced the products and services from the three companies, with around 18% of American households having shopped on Temu, according to Earnest Analytics. Despite their current successes, the future of these already complex operations with U.S. markets, given new tariffs levied on Chinese goods, is uncertain, said Wong. According to Wong, the proportion of business conducted within the U.S. is already 'getting smaller and smaller' as these companies look toward other markets without strict tariff policies.

Trump to sign order designating English as official US language	U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Friday designating English as the official language of the United States, according to the White House. The order will allow government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in languages other than English, according to a fact sheet about the impending order. It was not immediately clear when on Friday that Trump planned to sign the order. The executive order will rescind a mandate from former President Bill Clinton that required the government and organizations that received federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers. Designating English as the national language 'promotes unity, establishes efficiency in government operations and creates a pathway for civic engagement,' according to the White House. More than 30 states have already passed laws designating English as their official language, according to U.S. English, a group that advocates for making English the official language in the United States. For decades, lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation to designate English as the official language of the U.S., but those efforts have not succeeded. Within hours of Trump's inauguration last month, the new administration took down the Spanish language version of the official White House website. Hispanic advocacy groups and others expressed confusion and frustration at the change. The White House said at the time it was committed to bringing the Spanish language version of the website back online. As of Friday, it was still not restored. The White House did not immediately respond to a message about whether that would happen. Trump shut down the Spanish version of the website during his first term. It was restored when President Joe Biden was inaugurated. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the order Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-sign-order-designating-english-as-official-us-language/7992760.html	2025-02-28T10:45:46-08:00

Talks resume in Cairo on second phase of Gaza ceasefire	Egypt’s state information service reports that talks have begun on the second phase of the ceasefire between Israel and U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas in Cairo, just one day before the first phase of the truce is set to expire. In a statement on its website, the information service said delegations from Israel and Qatar arrived in Cairo late Thursday and began 'intensive discussions on the subsequent phases of the truce agreement.' Qatar, along with the United States and Egypt are moderating the talks. The statement went on to say, 'mediators are also exploring ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza as part of broader efforts to alleviate civilian suffering and support regional stability.' Ahead of the talks, Israel Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters in Jerusalem the Israeli delegation will see whether there was common ground to negotiate an extension to the truce. Reuters news service, citing two government officials, reports Israel is seeking to extend the first phase of the truce, a move Hamas does not support. The second phase of the talks are meant to negotiate an end to the war, including the return of all remaining hostages in Gaza who are alive, and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the territory. Return of remaining deceased hostages would happen in the third phase. Israel has said there are 59 remaining hostages – 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. It is unclear what would happen beyond Saturday if the first phase of the ceasefire expires with no agreement. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres told reporters Friday that the ceasefire and release deal must hold. 'Each moment the ceasefire holds means more people reached and more lives saved,' Guterres told reporters. He added that next Tuesday he will be in Cairo to join the Extraordinary Summit of the League of Arab States to discuss the reconstruction of Gaza. Meanwhile, in its weekly update on Friday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, reported the ongoing Israeli Defense Forces operation in the northern West Bank has left 'tens of thousands' of people internally displaced in Jenin and Tulkarm. The report said humanitarian aid groups have mobilized to scale up assistance to families in need,' amid an increasingly challenging operating environment.' OCHA also said that from Feb. 18-24, Israeli forces killed five Palestinians, and injured 39 others across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The agency said attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian communities in the West Bank over the past week left at least 10 Palestinians injured, widespread damage to property and the displacement of at least 17 families.

Cyclone Garance hits island of Reunion; police report 3 deaths	PARIS — French police said at least three people were killed when a tropical storm packing fierce winds and torrential rains thumped the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion on Friday. Residents were ordered to stay at home as Tropical Cyclone Garance brought heavy rain and winds exceeding 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph), causing floods, power cuts and damage to buildings. France’s national police force confirmed three fatalities but said it had no details about the circumstances. Authorities said 847 people sought refuge in emergency shelters and 54 were evacuated due to the risk of flooding or landslides. About 182,000 people were without power and 171,000 lost access to drinking water, the authorities said. Officials said strong winds ripped off roofs, doors, and windows of many buildings. Tarpaulins were being sent to the hardest-hit areas to provide shelter in the eastern part of the island. Authorities lifted the purple cyclone warning, the highest level, Friday morning, allowing rescue services to begin operations. However, the island remained under a red warning, with residents requested to stay indoors as heavy rain and strong winds were expected to persist throughout the day. National weather agency Meteo France said winds reaching 214 kilometers per hour (133 mph) were recorded at the island’s main airport. Reunion island is located about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) to the southeast of the French territory of Mayotte, an island group off Africa, which was hit in December by the worst cyclone in nearly a century, with widespread devastation left in its wake. Local authorities have confirmed 40 deaths from Cyclone Chido’s landfall and 41 people missing or believed to have been buried, but fear more may be dead.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyclone-garance-hits-island-of-reunion-police-report-3-deaths-/7992633.html	2025-02-28T09:03:48-08:00	
Southern Africa pushes for better energy access	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Southern Africa energy experts and political leaders pledged to improve access to energy at a summit in Botswana this week. The commitments come as most countries in the region still rely on coal, a major contributor to global warming. More than 500 participants from 16 Southern African Development Community, or SADC, member states, as well as other African countries, participated in the energy gathering. Moses Ntlamelle, a senior SADC programs officer, said pursuing a more inclusive transition to cleaner energy was one of the resolutions that regional representatives adopted at the summit. 'The region is recommended to expedite just energy transition and explore the development of a regional renewable energy market,' he said. 'This is to ensure that nobody is left behind. ... Inasmuch as we are going for cleaner energy, we must ensure that this energy transition is just to everybody.' Botswanan President Duma Boko spoke about the need to end energy poverty. 'Countries across the SADC region face challenges related to energy poverty,' Boko said. 'This constrains our economies, leaving millions of people, especially in rural areas, without access to critical services like health, education, communication, among others. A clarion call for an energy-secure region is, therefore, urgent in order to drive industrialization and integration of our economies.' Most Southern Africa countries rely on coal for energy. Boko called on the region to cut its dependence on fossil fuels and speed up the transition to green energy. 'We should incentivize renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects and initiatives, enforce environmental protections and establish clear roadmaps for a just and equitable energy transition, which is relevant to the realities of our countries and region,' he said. 'As a region, let us set tangible targets not only to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels but also to increase the use of renewables.' Yunus Alokore, a technical expert at the intergovernmental organization East Africa Center for Renewable Energy and Efficiency, told VOA that if Africa wants to accelerate its transition to sustainable energy, several key elements are needed. 'There has to be policies in place and regulatory framework,' Alokore said. 'What this does is that it creates transparent, long-term, consistent target, which is something that investors and development partners need.' Alokore said access to finance is also key.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southern-africa-pushes-for-better-energy-access/7991707.html	2025-02-28T07:54:06-08:00	
As Yoon remakes South Korea’s right, lonely conservative pushes back	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Conservative South Korean lawmaker Kim Sang-wook has received so many threats since December that his children no longer tell classmates who their father is. Already sidelined in the ruling party, many colleagues want Kim expelled altogether. In his home district of Ulsan, he finds himself shunned by former friends and allies. Welcome to the life of a conservative politician who has chosen to break ranks with the People Power Party, or PPP, which has swung sharply to the right as it rallies around impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. Once a low-profile figure, the 45-year-old first-term lawmaker has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of Yoon, whose short-lived martial law declaration in early December triggered South Korea’s worst political crisis in decades. At times, Kim has quite literally stood alone. Ahead of Yoon’s impeachment, he staged a one-man protest on the top steps of the National Assembly, holding a giant placard imploring fellow conservatives to abandon the president. Hours later, the impeachment motion passed with the support of just 11 other conservatives, out of a total of 108. If fully implemented, Yoon’s decree would have outlawed all political activity and required journalists to report to martial law command – measures not seen since South Korea emerged from a military dictatorship in the 1980s. That hasn’t prevented the overwhelming majority of the PPP from defending Yoon — a trend Kim blames on 'extreme partisan logic' that has come to define both sides of the country’s politics. 'It’s like everything is justified by the belief that ‘we’ are right and ‘they’ are wrong,' Kim told VOA in an interview at his National Assembly office. 'Is that conservatism? I don’t think so.' Kim’s defiance highlights a broader reckoning within the PPP. As the Constitutional Court decides Yoon’s fate, the party must decide whether to uphold his populist legacy or choose a different path. Fighting back Few would deny that Yoon’s more combative approach has galvanized the conservative base, as indicated by the size and intensity of street protests. Throughout the frigid Seoul winter, large crowds, including many young people, have rallied in Yoon’s defense. His arrest for alleged insurrection, which carries a possible death penalty, only added to their outrage. That anger deepened when the opposition, using its legislative supermajority, ousted acting President Han Duck-soo less than two weeks after impeaching Yoon, reinforcing conservative concerns about political overreach. The result was a scene unthinkable just months ago — Koreans packing streets in support of a leader who, however briefly, had just attempted to restore military rule. 'The whole situation just naturally evolved in a way that Yoon Suk Yeol became the symbol of this movement of freedom and liberal democracy, vis-a-vis communism, socialism, and tyranny,' said Lee Jung-hoon, a conservative legal scholar and dean at Seoul’s Yonsei University. Lee served in the administration of the country’s last conservative president, Park Geun-hye, who was removed from office in 2017 and jailed on corruption-related charges. In Lee’s view, Park was too passive in challenging her impeachment, which may have contributed to her downfall. By contrast, former prosecutor Yoon has vowed to 'fight to the end,' further energizing his supporters, Lee said. Yoon has defended his martial law decree as a tough but necessary response to an opposition he says crippled his administration with budget cuts and repeated impeachments of senior leaders. At his final impeachment hearing this week, Yoon argued the decree was never meant to be enforced as written — insisting that if he had intended to follow through, he would have deployed more troops and used greater force. Yoon has also defended martial law as necessary to investigate what he claims is election fraud. Those comments helped bring once-fringe allegations into the conservative mainstream, where many now openly question the integrity of South Korea’s electoral system. Some have gone further, attacking the credibility of judges they see as left-leaning, with a small group of conservative protesters even ransacking a court that had issued an arrest warrant for Yoon. Underlying fears Some of the hardening behind Yoon stems from deep distrust of opposition leader Lee Jae-myung. Lee is seen as the likely successor if Yoon is removed from office. Conservatives view Lee as too soft on China and likely to pursue what they see as futile engagement with North Korea. Others fear he is seeking the presidency to shield himself from legal battles, as he faces five separate trials on corruption and other charges. Hahm Sung-deuk, a professor of political science at Kyonggi University outside Seoul, said many conservatives are also eager to prevent a repeat of Park’s impeachment, which fractured the party and paved the way for a left-leaning president to take power. 'Conservatives have a painful memory. They feel that if they let this situation get out of hand, they might not regain power for not just five years, but maybe 10, 15, or even 20 years,' Hahm told VOA. That anxiety may help explain the fierce backlash against lawmakers like Kim, the renegade conservative who has been accused of betraying conservative values after breaking with Yoon. But Hahm insists the party’s divide isn’t about ideology but is about loyalty. 'This is not a policy debate,' he said. 'It’s centered around whether … you support or oppose Yoon Suk Yeol.' If Yoon is impeached, some fear that protests will once again turn violent. But in Yoon's absence, party moderates may likely prevail, said Hahm, who is well-connected among elite conservatives. 'Deep down, both the far-right and moderates know that Yoon Suk Yeol made mistakes,' said Hahm, who believes the party will eventually unite around a steadier candidate to block Lee from taking power. Uncertain future As he withstands attacks from fellow conservatives, Kim is less confident about the party’s future. Once a rising figure in local conservative politics, he now acknowledges he may not win reelection. But even if his stance costs him his political career, Kim says he will keep making decisions based on his principles, convinced this is what conservatism should be about. 'I have no regrets,' he said of voting to impeach Yoon. 'I believe this was the best decision I have made in my entire life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-yoon-remakes-south-korea-s-right-a-lonely-conservative-pushes-back/7991595.html	2025-02-28T07:29:10-08:00	
Perspectives, challenges of Ukraine’s next election	WASHINGTON — The issue of Ukraine’s next presidential election has emerged as a possible element in the peace deal between Russia and Ukraine that the United States is negotiating. Ukrainian leaders and elections experts argue, however, that holding elections anytime soon would endanger lives and Ukraine’s sovereignty. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected in April 2019, and the next presidential election was scheduled for March or April 2024. However, martial law has been in effect since Russia invaded the country in February 2022, and Ukrainian law prohibits presidential elections when martial law is in effect. U.S. President Donald Trump has lambasted Zelenskyy for not holding a presidential election. In a Feb. 19 post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said of Zelenskyy, 'He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden ‘like a fiddle.’ A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.' Some members of the U.S. Congress and conservative commentators echoed Trump’s demand that Ukraine hold elections to prove its democratic credentials. 'Zelenskyy should hold elections. They are basically under martial law. That’s not good when you claim to be defending democracy. They need to practice it,' Republican Senator Josh Hawley told VOA. Republican Representative Victoria Spartz told VOA that Ukraine should hold 'transparent elections, and that not doing so allows Russia to say, ‘You have an illegitimate president signing these contracts and deals.’' Russia has questioned the legitimacy of Ukraine’s president and government since 2014, well before Zelenskyy was elected to office. During his televised question-and-answer event on Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested he couldn’t negotiate with Zelenskyy until his legitimacy is confirmed through elections. 'If someone goes to the elections, gains legitimacy there, we will talk with anyone, including Zelenskyy,' he said. Zelenskyy said during a Feb. 23 press conference that he would step down as president if it meant 'peace for Ukraine' but pushed back on the calls for holding elections. 'How can we call an election in which half of the country’s population won’t be able to vote?' he said. 'How can we vote when today, [Ukraine was] attacked with 267 drones?' His major political rivals, former President Petro Poroshenko, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, have also rejected the call for holding elections. According to a February poll, 63% of Ukrainians also reject it. Many challenges Ukrainian election experts say there are many challenges to holding free and fair elections under wartime conditions. It would violate international principles of electoral law, according to Yevhenii Radchenko, a former deputy chair of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine. 'Elections must be universal, equal and free. During active hostilities, it is unrealistic to guarantee the safety of any of the participants, and due to massive Russian strikes, a significant part of the electoral infrastructure has been destroyed,' she said. Radchenko, who joined Ukraine’s armed forces, texted VOA from the trenches at the Donetsk front. On Feb. 27, OPORA, a leading Ukrainian nongovernmental organization involved in public oversight and advocacy in the field of elections, issued a statement signed by several other Ukrainian NGOs titled, 'Statement of Ukrainian Non-Governmental Organizations on the Impossibility of Holding Democratic Elections without the Sustainable Peace.' ‘Armed forces or elections’ After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Ukrainian parliament, as required by the country’s constitution, introduced martial law, which prohibits elections. OPORA chairperson Olga Aivazovska said the purpose of martial law is to preserve the state and mobilize society for defense. 'We have to choose either the armed forces or elections,' she told VOA. Aivazovska noted that Ukraine held elections between 2014 and 2022, when the conflict with Russia was ongoing in eastern Ukraine, but before Russia launched air raids on Ukrainian territory. 'Even if a ceasefire is established, there are no guarantees that Russia would not violate it as it did many times between 2014 and 2022,' she said. 'It can carry out a massive shelling of the Ukrainian territory on election day. It can organize terrorist attacks at the polling stations, killing voters, election workers and observers, or at the minimum, disrupt the process.' Aivazovska said it would be easy to contest an election as illegitimate if only 5% to 10% of the population votes. 'If Ukraine begins the election process without a guarantee of its completion, it means that we are simply giving this tool away to Russia for abuse and manipulation,' she said. Radchenko said that about 14 million citizens — out of a population of 41 million — would not be able to vote, given that the war has dislocated millions of Ukrainians, and nearly a million Ukrainian men and women are serving in the armed forces. According to Aivazovska, it is also unclear how people in areas occupied by Russia, 'where people are subjected to torture, kidnapping and other crimes,' will be able to cast their vote freely, even after lifting martial law. Most of the 7 million Ukrainian citizens who fled the war abroad will also not be able to vote, unless their host countries heavily invest in organizing the process. 'In 2004, the record number of Ukrainians living abroad voted at the polling stations in Ukrainian embassies and consulates — 103,000 citizens worldwide. There are simply no resources available to organize voting for 7 million people,' Aivazovska said. Let Ukraine decide Most of the members of the U.S. Congress interviewed by VOA said Ukraine should be free to decide when to hold its elections. Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick said the United States and other democracies will encourage Ukraine to hold elections when it can do it safely and fairly, but not when 'Ukrainians are still under invasion by an evil communist dictatorship.' Democratic Representative Eugene Vindman, who was born in Kyiv in 1975, told VOA, 'When 20% of the territory is occupied, when millions of Ukrainians are out of the country, it’s hard to imagine democratic elections representing the majority of the people being held.' Vindman expressed confidence that Ukrainian society will hold elections as soon as it achieves a stable peace. Republican Senator Kevin Cramer said the example of the United States holding elections during World War II is inapplicable because the U.S. didn’t have to fight on its territory. Vindman noted that European countries also suspended elections for the duration of that war. Democratic Representative Seth Magaziner suggested that a strong statement from Trump supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia’s invasion would make it easier for Ukrainians to 'develop a timeline for elections.' Republican Representative Don Bacon pointed out that Russia is in no position to demand elections from Ukraine. 'They haven’t had free elections in 25 years. Putin’s murdered all his rivals. They've been thrown off the buildings. They’ve been poisoned. They’ve been killed in GULAGs,' he told VOA in an email. Katya Andrusz, spokesperson for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told VOA that at the request of Ukrainian authorities, her office has begun work to ensure that when all the prerequisites are in place, Ukraine can hold elections 'in line with international standards and the commitments Ukraine has made as an OSCE country for holding democratic elections.' 'ODIHR is working with Ukraine in many areas, and we very much appreciate and respect the country’s democratic strength amidst all the ongoing challenges,' she said.

India, EU, pledge to push free trade agreement, elevate strategic ties	New Delhi — India and the European Union agreed to wrap up a free trade deal by the end of this year, the two sides announced Friday following talks in the Indian capital between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen. While negotiations between India and the EU have dragged on for years, analysts say there is a greater urgency to conclude a pact as the threat of tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump prompts many countries to ramp up efforts to increase access to markets outside the U.S. Von der Leyen came to New Delhi along with leaders of EU countries. Following talks with the Indian prime minister, she called India a 'like-minded friend' and said that 'we have tasked our teams to build on this momentum' to finalize a free trade pact. Both sides also discussed elevating their defense and security partnership. Modi said they had prepared a 'blueprint for collaboration' in areas such as trade, technology, investment and security. Before her meeting with Modi, von der Leyen said the EU and India 'have the potential to be one of the defining partnerships of this century' and it was time to take their strategic partnership to 'the next level.' A flux in geopolitics is pushing countries to diversify partnerships, analysts say. 'For India, which is scrambling to navigate the turbulence unleashed by Trump, Europe emerges as a valuable partner,' political analyst C. Raja Mohan wrote in The Indian Express newspaper. 'While neither can afford to disengage from the U.S., both India and Europe must do more to strengthen their ties in response to Trump’s unpredictable policies.' A free trade agreement between the EU and India 'would be the largest deal of this kind anywhere in the world,' von der Leyen said. 'It is time to be pragmatic and ambitious and to realign our priorities for today’s realities.' Trump has said he will impose a 25 percent tariff on imports from the European Union. His plans for reciprocal tariffs also will hit Indian exports to the U.S. The EU is India’s largest trading partner in goods — bilateral trade was more than $130 billion in 2023-24. Negotiations between India and the EU began years ago but were stalled for eight years before resuming in 2021. The main sticking points have been New Delhi's reluctance to lower tariffs on key European imports to India, such as cars, whiskey and wine, while the EU has been reluctant to concede New Delhi’s demand to ease visa curbs on Indian professionals. India also wants greater access to the EU for cheaper drugs and chemicals. India, the world’s fifth largest economy with a large middle class, is seen as an attractive market but has high protectionist barriers. Earlier this week, India and the UK also resumed trade talks during a visit by British business and trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds to New Delhi. India’s commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, said both countries aim to double bilateral trade in a decade. Reynolds said that securing a trade deal was a 'top priority' for his government. Trade analysts say there is a 'sense of urgency' to seal trade pacts. 'It seems there is a real intent on part of India and other partner countries to do something this time. The timing is important – President Trump’s threat of tariffs can cause trade disruptions. So, I think countries want to conclude deals before the global mood changes from being relatively open to more protectionist,' according to trade analyst Biswajit Dhar in New Delhi. While India has made slow progress in clinching free trade pacts in the past, it is now stepping up efforts to conclude deals amid fears that potential shifts in global trade could pose a challenge to meeting Prime Minister Modi's goal of growing exports to $1 trillion by 2030. 'The trade uncertainties being unleashed by Trump’s tariffs will push the Indian government to look at the levels of protection in the country more closely. It can’t afford that any longer,' said Dhar. 'Every major country is interested in the large Indian market but complains about high tariffs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-eu-pledge-to-push-free-trade-agreement-elevate-strategic-ties-/7991547.html	2025-02-28T07:16:50-08:00

Suicide bombing at Pakistan religious seminary kills senior cleric, others	ISLAMABAD — Police in northwestern Pakistan said Friday a suicide bomber detonated himself during afternoon prayers at the Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Haqqania, with several thousand students, is among South Asia's largest and most respected Islamic seminaries. The top leaders of Afghanistan’s Taliban also studied at the madrasa, in the town of Akora Khattak. Seminary head Maulana Hamidul Haq was among at least four worshippers killed in the incident, which injured more than 20 others. The provincial police chief, Zulfiqar Hameed, confirmed the casualties, saying an investigation into the bombing was underway. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned what he called 'a cowardly and heinous act of terrorism,' according to a statement issued by his office. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but suspicions fell on a regional Islamic State group affiliate, the Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K. The group, which the United Nations says is based in neighboring Afghanistan, has taken credit for other madrasa attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. IS-K has routinely carried out high-profile attacks against leaders and clerics affiliated with the Taliban government in Kabul, killing dozens of them in recent months. A U.N. Security Council assessment this month described IS-K as 'the greatest extra-regional terrorist threat.' The report said that in addition to attacks on Taliban authorities and Afghan religious minorities, IS-K supporters conducted strikes as far away as Europe, and it 'was actively seeking to recruit from among Central Asian states' bordering Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suicide-bombing-at-pakistan-religious-seminary-kills-senior-cleric-others-/7991399.html	2025-02-28T04:45:13-08:00	
Hundreds of thousands protest across Greece over deadly train crash	ATHENS — Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in cities and towns across Greece on Friday to demand justice on the second anniversary of the country's deadliest-ever train crash, and striking workers grounded flights and halted sea and train transport. Fifty-seven people were killed when a passenger train filled with students collided with a freight train on February 28, 2023, near the Tempi gorge in central Greece. Two years later, the safety gaps that caused the crash have not been filled, an inquiry found on Thursday. A separate judicial investigation remains unfinished, and no one has been convicted in the accident. Mass demonstrations were planned in dozens of cities across the country. All international and domestic flights were grounded as air traffic controllers joined seafarers, train drivers, doctors, lawyers and teachers in a 24-hour general strike to pay tribute to the victims of the crash. Businesses were shut and theatres cancelled performances. By early morning, tens of thousands had gathered in Syntagma Square in the center of Athens, watched by police in riot gear. A sign read: 'Government of murderers.' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' center-right government, which won re-election after the crash in 2023, has faced repeated criticism by relatives of the victims for failing to initiate a parliamentary inquiry into political responsibility. The government denies wrongdoing and says it is up to the judiciary to investigate the accident. Friday's protests reflected mounting anger over the disaster in Greece, where mistrust of government is common following a 2009-2018 debt crisis in which millions lost out on wages and pensions, and public services suffered from underfunding. 'The government hasn't done anything to get justice,' said Christos Main, 57, a musician at the Athens rally. 'This wasn't an accident, it was murder,' he said. Another protester, who gave her name as Evi, said she was there to mourn the dead, 'but also because the government has tried to cover things up.' The names of those killed were spray-painted in red on the ground in front of the parliament building. In the suburbs of Athens, groups of all ages made their way downtown with placards reading 'I have no oxygen,' a slogan of the protests echoing a woman's last words in a call to emergency services. Many pupils went to class dressed in black, a symbol of mourning. Others held up black balloons. Major issue for Greeks In a Facebook post on Friday, Mitsotakis said his government would work to modernize the railway network and make it safer. 'That night, we saw the ugliest face of the country in the national mirror,' he wrote of the night of the crash. 'Fatal human errors met with chronic state inadequacies.' Opposition parties have accused the government of covering up evidence and urged it to step down. Next week, parliament is expected to debate whether to set up a committee to investigate possible political responsibility in the disaster. In a survey carried out this week by Pulse pollsters, 82% of Greeks asked said the train disaster was 'one of the most' or 'the most' important issue in the country and 66% said they were dissatisfied with the investigations into the accident. In Athens, students chanted 'Text me when you get there,' — the final message many of the victims' relatives sent them. 'We're here because we're parents... tomorrow it might be our children,' said Litsa, a 45-year-old nurse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-thousands-protest-across-greece-over-deadly-train-crash-/7991353.html	2025-02-28T03:51:30-08:00

Nepal's Kathmandu rattled by strong quake	KATHMANDU, NEPAL — A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck north of Nepal's Kathmandu on Friday, according to the National Earthquake Monitoring and Research Centre. The earthquake struck around Bhairab Kunda in the Sindhupalchok District in Nepal, close to the Himalayan mountain range that runs along the border with Tibet. The German Research Center for Geosciences placed the magnitude of the earthquake at 5.6, and the depth at 10 kilometers while the U.S. Geological Survey pegged it at magnitude 5.5. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the earthquake. Pasang Nurpu Sherpa, chairman of the Bhote Koshi rural municipality, where the epicenter is located, told Reuters, 'I have no information of any damage so far. The earthquake has triggered a landslide at Dugunagadi Bhir across the river. There are no houses around the site of the landslide.' Kiran Thapa, district governor of Sindhupalchok, said, 'One inmate of the district jail broke his hand while trying to run after the quake and he is now undergoing treatment at a hospital. One police post building developed minor cracks at Kodari.' 'It shook us from our sleep strongly,' Ganesh Nepali, a senior official of Sindhupalchok district, told Reuters. 'We rushed out of our home. People have now returned home. We have not received any report of damage or injuries so far.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nepal-s-kathmandu-rattled-by-strong-quake/7991265.html	2025-02-28T00:18:44-08:00	
Progressive Conservative party wins Ontario election, CBC reports	TORONTO — Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party swept to victory and clinched a rare third consecutive majority, according to a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation projection, following a campaign dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump. PC Party leader Doug Ford called an election more than a year early, arguing he needed a stronger mandate to fight Trump's threatened tariffs. Ford, 60, already had a majority government in the provincial legislature. Trump has threatened 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Ontario, a manufacturing powerhouse, would be especially affected. Ford's rivals struggled to focus voter attention on scandals facing the Progressive Conservative leader and challenges facing the province. Canada's most populous province is struggling to provide its more than 14 million residents with adequate healthcare. About 2.5 million Ontarians lack a primary care provider, up from 1.8 million in 2020. Ford came under fire for suggesting the reason emergency departments are full is people are going there with sore throats and scraped knees. His opponents argue people may not be able to get care anywhere else. Ontario, like other parts of Canada, is in the midst of a housing affordability crisis and has lagged in meeting its housing goals. 'I'm very grateful to the people of Ontario, and we're going to make sure we protect the people of Ontario and protect their families and their jobs and businesses, and I'll fight tooth and nail against Donald Trump, promise you that,' Doug Ford said in a brief interview with CTV news, ahead of his victory speech. The province, home to about 35% of Canada's 40 million people, is one of the world's largest sub-sovereign borrowers. Trump has said he could use economic force to make Canada the 51st state. Canadian politicians, including Ford and his opponents, left-leaning New Democratic Party leader Marit Stiles and centrist Liberal leader Bonnie Crombie, have been vocal in their opposition to both tariffs and Canada's annexation. The U.S. president is dominating Canadian politics at provincial and national levels. A federal election is also expected this year. Ford took to sporting a 'Canada is not for sale' hat and made two trips to Washington, D.C., during the election campaign to make his case against U.S. tariffs. He came under fire for traveling there during an election period when governments are in caretaker mode and generally expected to refrain from policy-making. Calling the election was Ford's bet on winning another majority government, said Laura Stephenson, a Western University politics professor. It is unusual for Ontario to hold a winter election, and on election day much of the province was still digging out from recent snowstorms. According to Elections Ontario, just after 10 p.m. ET the voter turnout was at 42.62%. Turnout hit a record low, at 44%, in the province's last election in 2022. 'It's disappointing,' said John Beebe, director of the Democratic Engagement Exchange at Toronto Metropolitan University. 'We had record-low vote turnout last time and if we have even lower voter turnout this time that's not a good sign for the health of our democracy.' Ontario's election results could bear lessons for Canada federally, said University of Toronto politics professor Semra Sevi -- and that could bode well for federal Liberals. These results 'show how external factors' like Trump's tariffs' can significantly shape the political climate and voter priorities,' Sevi wrote in an email. 'Moreover, the recent resurgence of the federal Liberals after a period of decline suggests that political dynamics can shift rapidly due to changes in leadership and external events. While it may have initially seemed like (Conservative leader Pierre) Poilievre was set to win the federal election with a landslide, this outcome suggests that things could still change quickly,' she wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/progressive-conservative-party-wins-ontario-election-cbc-reports/7991261.html	2025-02-28T00:07:27-08:00	
Russian chess grandmaster Boris Spassky dies at 88	MOSCOW — Soviet chess grandmaster Boris Spassky, who was famously defeated at the height of the Cold War, has died at 88, the Russian Chess Federation announced Thursday. 'The tenth world champion Boris Spassky has died at 88,' the Russian Chess Federation said in a statement on its website, calling this a 'great loss for the country.' The statement did not say when exactly he died or from what cause. Spassky is best remembered for his duel with American Bobby Fischer in 1972, which was emblematic of the confrontation between East and West. The iconic Cold War duel has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and films. Most notably it inspired the Walter Tevis novel The Queen's Gambit, which was adapted into the acclaimed Netflix series in 2020. Spassky became world champion in 1969 and held the title until he played the match that would define his career, facing the eccentric American prodigy. With the Soviet Union having dominated the game for years, Spassky faced a must-win situation and initially took the lead. But the American roared back to win, ending an unbroken streak of Soviet world champions since 1948. Although the loss was a slap in the face for Moscow, Spassky admitted decades later it was a relief to be rid of a 'colossal responsibility.' Born in 1937 in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, Spassky showed prodigious talent early, becoming junior world champion and the youngest grandmaster in history at the time at 18.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-chess-grandmaster-boris-spassky-dies-at-88/7991255.html	2025-02-27T23:41:45-08:00

Trump, Zelenskyy set to meet at White House	WASHINGTON — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump and sign a critical minerals deal Friday as Kyiv works to regain U.S. support to fight off the Russian invasion. The minerals agreement negotiated in recent days would open up Ukraine's vast mineral wealth to the United States but does not include American security guarantees, a disappointment for Ukraine. It gives Washington the right to recoup some of the billions of dollars in costs of the U.S. weaponry supplied to Kyiv through a reconstruction investment fund tied to the sale of Ukraine's rare earth minerals. A Center for Strategic and International Studies report last year found that about two-thirds of the money Congress appropriated for Ukraine was spent in the United States. Ukraine hopes the agreement will spur Trump to support Kyiv's efforts to recapture territory seized by Russia. The deal also could win support from Republicans in Congress for a new round of aid to the war-torn country. Trump has engaged in a long-distance feud with Zelenskyy in recent weeks, criticizing his handling of the war, calling him a dictator and urging him to agree to the minerals deal. But during a joint news conference with visiting British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday, Trump said: 'Did I say that? I can't believe I said that.' Trump also noted he was looking forward to meeting Zelenskyy and praised the Ukrainian military for its bravery. 'We're working very hard to get that war brought to an end. I think we've made a lot of progress, and I think it's moving along pretty rapidly,' Trump said. 'It'll either be fairly soon or it won't be at all,' he added, without elaboration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-zelenskyy-set-to-meet-at-white-house/7991244.html	2025-02-27T22:36:04-08:00	
At UN talks, nations agree to invest in plan to protect nature	ROME — Nations cheered a last gasp deal reached Thursday to map out funding to protect nature, breaking a deadlock at United Nations talks seen as a test for international cooperation in the face of geopolitical tensions. Rich and developing countries worked out a delicate compromise on raising and delivering the billions of dollars needed to protect species, overcoming stark divisions that had scuttled their previous meeting in Cali, Colombia, last year. Delegates stood and clapped in an emotionally charged final meeting that saw key decisions adopted in the final minutes of the last day of rebooted negotiations at the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in Rome. COP16 President Susana Muhamad of Colombia hailed the fact that countries worked together for a breakthrough, enabling progress 'in this very fragmented and conflicted world,' she said. 'This is something very beautiful because it's around protecting life that we have come together, and there cannot be anything higher than that,' she said. The decision comes more than two years after a landmark deal to halt the destruction of nature this decade and protect the ecosystems and wildlife that humans rely on for food, climate regulation, and economic prosperity. One million species are threatened with extinction, while unsustainable farming and consumption destroy forests, deplete soils and spread plastic pollution to even the most remote areas of the planet. The agreement on Thursday is seen as crucial to giving impetus to the 2022 deal, which saw countries agree to protect 30% of the world's land and seas. Talks were also seen as a bellwether for international cooperation. The meeting comes as countries face a range of challenges, from trade disputes and debt worries to the slashing of overseas aid. Washington, which has not signed up to the U.N.'s Convention on Biological Diversity, sent no representatives to the meeting. 'Our efforts show that multilateralism can present hope at a time of geopolitical uncertainty,' said Steven Guilbeault, Canada's minister of environment and climate change. Ousseynou Kasse of Senegal, speaking on behalf of the Africa Group, also threw support behind global cooperation. 'We believe that this is the way that can save the world, and we must continue down this path,' he said. Countries must be 'accountable to our children, to the generations to come,' he added. The failure to finalize an agreement in Cali was the first in a string of disappointing outcomes at environmental summits last year. A climate finance deal at COP29 in Azerbaijan in November was slammed by developing countries, while separate negotiations about desertification and plastic pollution stalled in December. Countries have already agreed to a goal to deliver $200 billion a year in finance for nature by 2030, including $30 billion a year from wealthier countries to poorer ones. The total for 2022 was about $15 billion, according to the OECD. The main debate in Cali and later Rome was over developing countries' calls for the creation of a specific biodiversity fund, which has seen pushback from the EU and other wealthy nations, who have argued against multiple funds. The agreement reached in Rome leaves it to the 2028 COP to decide whether to set up a specific new fund under the U.N. biodiversity process, or to name a potentially reformed existing fund to play that role. One achievement in Cali was the creation of a new fund to share profits from digitally sequenced genetic data from plants and animals with the communities they come from. The fund, officially launched on Tuesday, is designed for large firms to contribute a portion of their income from developing things like medicine and cosmetics using this data. Delegates in Cali also approved the creation of a permanent body to represent the interests of Indigenous people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-talks-nations-agree-to-invest-in-plan-to-protect-nature-/7991178.html	2025-02-27T19:28:27-08:00	
Migrant arrests at US-Mexico border near record low in February	WASHINGTON — The number of migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in February is on pace to be at or near a record monthly low, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson and two other sources told Reuters. The U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to have arrested around 8,500 migrants at the border in February as the end of the month nears, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. Two other sources said the monthly total would be at or near a record low. President Donald Trump, a Republican, took an array of actions to deter illegal immigration after returning to the White House on January 20, saying a crackdown was needed after high levels of migration under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Trump's moves included implementing a sweeping ban on asylum at the border and surging military troops to assist border security. The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over the ban earlier this month, arguing it violated U.S. asylum law and international treaties. The Trump administration also struck new agreements with Mexico and Central American countries to accept U.S. deportees from other nations and has sent some migrants to a camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. U.S. Border Patrol's monthly enforcement statistics go back to 2000. The lowest monthly total on record is currently April 2017, when the agency arrested 11,127 at the start of Trump's first term. While the number of border arrests similarly dipped at the start of Trump's 2017-21 presidency, they rebounded in the months and years that followed. The February projection would be a steep drop from the 141,000 migrant arrests in February 2024 and down from 29,000 in January, according to U.S. government figures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrant-arrests-at-us-mexico-border-near-record-low-in-february-/7991188.html	2025-02-27T19:27:59-08:00	
Trump hosts British PM for Ukraine-focused talks	U.S. President Donald Trump hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer Thursday at the White House, where the two laid out their visions for the end of Ukraine's brutal three-year war.

British PM Starmer seeks to project unity with Trump despite differences on Ukraine	white house — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he and President Donald Trump discussed achieving an agreement to end the war between Ukraine and Russia that would involve Kyiv and be backed by European peacekeeping forces. Following meetings Thursday at the White House, Starmer said the plan would 'reach a peace that is tough and fair, that Ukraine will help shape, that's backed by strength to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin coming back for more.' Any agreement cannot lead to a peace 'that rewards the aggressor,' Starmer underscored, mirroring remarks that French President Emmanuel Macron delivered at his White House meeting with Trump on Monday that 'the aggressor is Russia.' 'We agreed history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,' Starmer said, speaking alongside Trump during their joint news conference. Starmer vowed to work closely with other European leaders and said the United Kingdom was ready to deploy peacekeeping troops together with its allies, 'because that is the only way that peace will last.' Trump, however, was noncommittal on providing any security guarantees, including on a proposed U.S. 'backstop' to support European peacekeepers to enforce a potential truce — a condition Starmer required. 'I don't like to talk about peacekeeping until we have a deal,' Trump said during the news conference. 'I like to get things done. I don't want to give it the bad luck sign.' Trump signaled that the U.S. backstop could be given in the form of the deal he is trying to secure with Kyiv that would allow American access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals and recoup funds given by former President Joe Biden's administration to support the country's war efforts. 'It's a backstop, you could say. I don't think anybody's going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers,' the president told reporters at the Oval Office earlier Thursday. During the news conference, Trump defended his decision to directly negotiate with Russia without the involvement of Kyiv or European allies as 'common sense,' saying, 'If you want peace, you have to talk to both sides.' Trump said that talks with Moscow were 'very well advanced' but cautioned that there was only a narrow window to secure a deal. He expressed confidence that Putin would 'keep his word' and not launch further aggression on Ukraine should a peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv be reached. 'I've known him for a long time now,' he said. 'We had to go through the Russian hoax together,' he added, in an apparent reference to the U.S. government investigation that examined whether Trump's 2016 presidential campaign illegally coordinated with Russia to sway the outcome of the U.S. election. Trump's outreach to Putin is a drastic reversal of Biden's policies, which sought to diplomatically and financially isolate Russia and insisted on 'nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,' regarding peace negotiations. Trump was asked whether he would apologize to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom he had called a 'dictator.' While not saying whether he would apologize, Trump said, 'I have a lot of respect for him [Zelenskyy].' Zelenskyy is set to visit the White House on Friday. Ukraine peacekeeping Differences remain among European allies on any future deployment of peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. The U.K. supports a French-led proposal, while other nations, including Poland, have ruled it out. Putin rejects any suggestions of a peacekeeping troop deployment to Ukraine. He said Thursday that 'Western elites' were trying to disrupt the newly established dialogue between Moscow and Washington. Pushed to clarify Trump's position on sending peacekeepers, a senior administration official speaking on background to reporters Thursday said there were 'concerns' about putting troops on the ground at a 'post-Minsk I level of conflict, even post-Minsk II.' The official was referring to the 2014 and 2015 agreements aimed at ending fighting between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, neither of which was sustained. The official said there would be less concern about sending troops if the conflict were 'dialed down to a functional ceasefire,' as the U.S. wants. The type of force deployed will depend on the political settlement to end the war, the official said — a 'trade-off' that Trump and Starmer will focus on. Starmer needs to reinforce that Europeans must be part of any peace discussions, said Gesine Weber, a fellow on the German Marshall Fund's Geostrategy team. 'It would be very odd to have a situation where you have the burden shift to Europeans, but not the strategic responsibility and the strategic reflections,' she told VOA. Unified front It was a challenging visit for Starmer as he sought to balance the U.K.'s interests and those of its European allies while engaging with an unpredictable U.S. administration. 'The most important thing is: Do these guys get along? Do they have a common vision?' Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said about Trump and Starmer. That, he told VOA, could signal the emergence of a Western strategy to end the war with NATO's support. 'If that's the case, then we're in a good position to try to promote a negotiation between Russia and Ukraine,' O'Hanlon added. Seeking to project a unified front with Trump, Starmer highlighted that the two sides would work together on an economic deal focused on artificial intelligence. During the joint news conference and earlier in the Oval Office, Starmer underscored a state visit invitation by King Charles to Trump, the second such invitation following Trump's 2019 trip to London, as 'historic' and 'unprecedented.' He dismissed a reporter's question on whether the king expressed any concerns about Trump's plans to annex Canada, a British Commonwealth country. 'I think you're trying to find a divide between us that doesn't exist,' he said. Starmer is keen to secure favorable terms amid potential U.S. tariffs that could impact British exports as the U.S. hits European countries with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump told reporters that Starmer had 'earned whatever they [the British government] pay him' in working to convince him against implementing punitive trade measures. Boosting defense Trump, who wants NATO members to boost defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, also reiterated his stance that Europe should 'step up.' In 2023, the U.S. spent 3.4% of its GDP on defense, according to U.S. government data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In what appeared to be a move to satisfy Trump, Starmer announced on Tuesday an unexpected increase in the U.K. defense budget to 2.5% of the nation's GDP by 2027, then to 2.6% the following year. The increase will be funded by cutting Britain's already depleted foreign aid budget to just 0.3% of the country's GDP. Starmer aims to further boost defense spending to 3% in the next Parliament, which will begin in 2029 at the latest after the next general election.

Possible Kurdish-Turkish peace could be bad news for Islamic State	WASHINGTON — There is hope in Washington that the decision by the leader of a Turkey-based, U.S.-designated terror group to ask its factions to lay down their arms could ease tensions with Ankara and facilitate efforts to counter remnants of the Islamic State terror group. Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), on Thursday issued a statement calling on his followers to end their decadeslong fight for an independent Kurdish state and to instead pursue peace, a decision that could reverberate across the Middle East. 'It's a significant development,' said White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes in a statement to VOA. 'We believe it will help bring peace to this troubled region,' Hughes said, adding, 'We hope that it will help assuage our Turkish allies about U.S. counter-ISIS partners in northeast Syria.' For years, the alliance between the United States and Turkey has been strained by Washington's decision to back the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, in northeastern Syria in order to fight the Islamic State, also known as IS or ISIS. The U.S. has viewed the SDF as a willing and capable partner. But officials in Ankara have long maintained that the SDF is led by fighters with the People's Protection Units (YPG), a Syrian-based offshoot of the PKK. The SDF on Thursday echoed Washington's optimism, though its top military commander said his fighters would not give up their arms. 'Just to make it clear, this is only for the PKK. It is nothing related to us here in Syria,' said General Mazloum Abdi, speaking to reporters in Washington from his base in northeastern Syria via video. 'When the peace flowers between Turkey and PKK, that will have its own positive consequences on us,' Abdi added, speaking through a translator. 'That means there is not any reason, and there is not any excuse, to keep attacking these regions on the pretext of PKK.' Turkish attacks against the SDF, whether launched directly by the Turkish military or by Turkish-backed forces in Syria, have repeatedly raised the ire of the U.S. In one incident in 2022, a Turkish airstrike targeting Syrian Kurdish fighters hit within 300 meters of U.S. forces located north of the Syrian city of Hasakah, prompting the Pentagon to call for an immediate de-escalation. And as recently as this past December, Kurdish officials in northeastern Syria warned that the actions of Turkey and Turkish-aligned militias threatened security at more than two dozen SDF-run prisons, holding an estimated 10,000 captured IS fighters. 'We [are] doing our best ... securing these prisons, which is not [an] easy task at all due to the constant attacks against us in the region,' the SDF's Abdi said Thursday, in response to a question from VOA. Some of those attacks have come from Turkish-aligned militias. But others have come from what the SDF says is a reinvigorated IS. 'ISIS has taken advantage of the security gap' created by the collapse of the regime of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad this past December, Abdi said. 'We see ISIS become more visible. We see them more active recently ... showing more lethal capabilities.' Abdi said the terror group is making good use of weapons caches it seized after they were abandoned by forces loyal to Assad. IS is also getting bolder, he said, sending terror fighters from their hideouts in Syria's Badia desert into surrounding cities. The warnings parallel findings from a recent report by the United Nations' Sanctions Monitoring Team, which cautioned that IS exploited the military campaign by the Syrian insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led to the Assad regime's demise. The report, based on intelligence from U.N. member states, said IS controls about 1,500 to 3,000 fighters across Syria and Iraq, and that the group's leadership remains intent on retaking and holding territory in Syria. For those reasons and others, the SDF's Abdi said it was critical for the U.S. to maintain its military presence in Syria, estimated to include 2,000 troops, despite media reports that Washington is considering a withdrawal. 'In the case of having a withdrawal, that will lead to chaos,' Abdi said. 'There is already security vacuum' he added, calling a continued U.S. military presence 'essential for the sake of preserving stability and security.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/possible-kurdish-turkish-peace-could-be-bad-news-for-islamic-state-/7991152.html	2025-02-27T18:22:42-08:00	
North Korea's Kim orders nuclear readiness after missile test, KCNA says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a test-launch of strategic cruise missiles and ordered full readiness to use nuclear attack capability to ensure the most effective defense for the country, state media announced Friday. The test was designed to warn 'enemies, who are seriously violating the security environment of the (country) and fostering and escalating the confrontation environment' and to demonstrate 'readiness of its various nuke operation means,' KCNA news agency said. 'What is guaranteed by powerful striking ability is the most perfect deterrence and defense capacity,' KCNA quoted Kim as saying. The missile launch was conducted on Wednesday over the sea off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, it said. South Korea's military said on Friday it had detected signs of missile launch preparations on Wednesday and tracked several cruise missiles after they were launched around 8 a.m. local time (2300 GMT Tuesday) over the sea. North Korea has pursued the development of strategic cruise missiles over several years, intended to deliver nuclear warheads. That type of missile tends to bring less alarm and condemnation from the international community than ballistic missiles because they are not formally banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions. The Security Council has banned the North from ballistic missile and nuclear weapons development and imposed a number of sanctions for violations. The report of the missile test came in the same week that Kim made back-to-back visits to military schools, driving home the message of loyalty and the importance of ideological and tactical training of young military officers. Kim did not mention any country by name when he spoke of warning the enemies but has kept up harsh rhetoric against the United States and South Korea despite comments by U.S. President Donald Trump that he would be reaching out to him. Trump and Kim held unprecedented summit meetings during the U.S. president's first term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-orders-nuclear-readiness-after-missile-test-kcna-says/7991171.html	2025-02-27T18:08:14-08:00	
Judge finds mass firings of federal probationary workers likely unlawful	SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday found that the mass firings of probationary federal employees were likely unlawful, granting some temporary relief to a coalition of labor unions and organizations that has sued to stop the Trump administration's massive trimming of the federal workforce. U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including the Department of Defense. 'OPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe,' to hire or fire any employees but its own, he said. Alsup handed down the order on a temporary restraining order sought by labor unions and nonprofits in a lawsuit filed by the coalition last week. The complaint filed by five labor unions and five nonprofit organizations is one of multiple lawsuits pushing back on the administration's efforts to vastly shrink the federal workforce, which Trump has called bloated and sloppy. Thousands of probationary employees have been fired, and his administration is now aiming at career officials with civil service protection. The plaintiffs say the Office of Personnel Management had no authority to terminate the jobs of probationary workers who generally have less than a year on the job. They also say the firings were predicated on a lie of poor performance by the workers. Lawyers for the government say the Office of Personnel Management did not direct the firings, but asked agencies to review and determine whether employees on probation were fit for continued employment. They also say that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired. There are an estimated 200,000 probationary workers across federal agencies. Unions have recently struck out with two other federal judges in similar lawsuits attempting to stop the Trump administration's goal of vastly reducing the federal workforce. Alsup, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, has presided over many high-profile cases and is known for his blunt talk. He oversaw the criminal probation of Pacific Gas & Electric and has called the nation's largest utility a 'continuing menace to California.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-finds-mass-firings-of-federal-probationary-workers-likely-unlawful/7991159.html	2025-02-27T17:48:54-08:00	
Vatican reports Pope Francis' condition is continuing to improve	Pope Francis is continuing to improve from a bout of double pneumonia, the Vatican said Thursday evening. The 88-year-old pontiff had progressed from using a nasal tube for supplemental oxygen to alternating the tube with a mask that allowed for a more comfortable flow, according to a detailed update. Doctors on Thursday still said Francis' 'prognosis remains guarded,' suggesting that they did not think he was out of danger. Francis spent Thursday morning in respiratory therapy. Later, he prayed in the chapel of his private suite in Rome's Gemelli Hospital, where he also received the Eucharist. After that, the pope attended to Vatican work responsibilities. Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, was admitted to Gemelli Hospital on Feb. 14 with a case of bronchitis that soon worsened to double pneumonia. This hospital stay is his longest during his time as pope. He is prone to lung infections, having had part of a lung removed when he was a young man. It is not yet clear how his illness will affect his participation in the Lenten season, which begins on March 5 on Ash Wednesday and leads up to Holy Week and then Easter, on which according to Christian tradition Jesus was resurrected in Jerusalem. Some of the faithful who have journeyed to Rome to see the Vatican and possibly the pope have altered their plans and are now saying prayers for Francis outside Gemelli Hospital for his full recovery. Lili Iparea Fernandez, from La Cruz, Mexico, traveled to Rome with other pilgrims from Mexico, hoping to participate in Francis' general audience this week. When that was canceled, she decided to pray for him outside the hospital instead. 'We firmly believe that the pope will recover because he is a very strong man,' she said Thursday. 'So I invite everyone to believe firmly, with certainty, with confidence, with hope that the pope is going to be well.' The pope's illness has prompted Catholics to gather in Vatican City, his native Argentina and other areas of the world to hold prayer vigils. Francis has been pope since 2013 when his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, resigned. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-reports-pope-francis-condition-is-continuing-to-improve-/7991160.html	2025-02-27T17:48:02-08:00	
US Navy at a 'crossroads,' Trump's Navy secretary nominee warns	pentagon — The Trump administration's nominee for secretary of the Navy says the military service branch is at a 'crossroads' and must course correct to expand and improve its maritime capabilities. 'Extended deployments, inadequate maintenance, huge cost overruns, delayed shipbuilding, failed audits, subpar housing and, sadly, record-high suicide rates are systemic failures that have gone unaddressed for far too long. And frankly, this is unacceptable,' John Phelan told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday. While Phelan has not served in the military or in government, committee Chairman Senator Roger Wicker said Trump turned to an 'experienced businessperson' to solve the Navy's massive industrial problems, especially in shipbuilding. 'If we threw a zillion dollars at the Department of the Navy today, we couldn't build the ships because we don't have the industrial base. We've got to fix that,' Wicker said. China's military, according to Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, is on pace to have more than 400 ships in its navy this year and will likely have about 120 more ships than the United States by 2030. The U.S. currently has about 300 ships. 'Every shipbuilding delay, every maintenance backlog and every inefficiency is an opening for our adversaries to challenge our dominance. We cannot allow that to happen,' said Phelan. He said that if confirmed he would incentivize industry while learning from 'yesterday's fights' to develop a force for the future. Phelan also said the Ships for America Act, a bipartisan bill that aims to establish national oversight and support for the U.S. shipbuilding industry, would help industry better 'telegraph demand' for ships. The Navy typically receives about 30% of the defense budget. Republicans and Democrats in Thursday's hearing criticized what they saw as financial mismanagement in the Navy and in the defense industry, a concern that Phelan said he would investigate while developing plans to tackle shortfalls in the Navy's military acquisitions. 'When I've looked at all these different weapons programs, it seems like the next missile costs more than the first missile, so you have no economies of scale,' Phelan told lawmakers. 'That is a prescription for bankruptcy.' Independent Senator Angus King said the U.S. was falling behind its adversaries in technological developments such as hypersonics and directed energy. Hypersonic weapons can travel at more than five times the speed of sound and can maneuver to avoid detection and countermeasures. Directed-energy weapons cause damage with highly focused energy, not solid projectiles. Examples include lasers and particle beams. Following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, Houthi rebels in Yemen launched dozens of drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The U.S. Navy used missiles valued at hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars apiece to destroy the drones. 'Directed energy is about 50 cents a shot, once you have the device there,' King said. Hamas and Hezbollah are U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-navy-at-a-crossroads-trump-s-navy-secretary-nominee-warns-/7991137.html	2025-02-27T17:34:54-08:00	
Harsh flu season has health officials worried about brain complications in children	WASHINGTON — This year's harsh flu season — the most intense in 15 years — has federal health officials trying to understand if it sparked an increase in a rare but life-threatening brain complication in children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 19,000 people have died from the flu so far this winter, including 86 children. On Thursday, the CDC reported at least nine of those children experienced brain complications, and it has asked state health departments to help investigate if there are more such cases. There is some good news: The CDC also reported that this year's flu shots do a pretty good job preventing hospitalization from the flu — among the 45% of Americans who got vaccinated. But it comes a day after the Trump administration canceled a meeting of experts who are supposed to help choose the recipe for next winter's flu vaccine. Still, it's not too late to get vaccinated this year: 'If you haven't gotten your flu shot yet, get it because we're still seeing high flu circulation in most of the country,' said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Flu shot effectiveness varies from year to year. While not great at blocking infections, the vaccine's main role 'is to keep you out of the hospital and to keep you alive,' said Vanderbilt University vaccine expert Dr. William Schaffner. Preliminary CDC data released Thursday found that children who got this year's vaccine were between 64% and 78% less likely to be hospitalized than their unvaccinated counterparts, and adults were 41% to 55% less likely to be hospitalized. Earlier this month, state health departments and hospitals warned doctors to watch for child flu patients with seizures, hallucinations or other signs of 'influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis' — and a more severe subtype called 'acute necrotizing encephalopathy.' Encephalitis is brain inflammation. On Thursday, the CDC released an analysis of 1,840 child flu deaths since 2010, finding 166 with those neurologic complications. Most were unvaccinated children. But the agency concluded it's unclear if this year's nine deaths with those complications — four of whom had the worse subtype — mark an uptick. There's no regular tracking of those neurologic complications, making it hard to find the answers. In California, Dr. Keith Van Haren of Stanford Medicine Children's Health said earlier this month that he'd learned of about 15 flu-related cases of that severe subtype from doctors around the country and 'we are aware of more cases that may also meet the criteria.' He did not say how many died. O'Leary, with the pediatricians' academy, said parents should remember this complication is rare — the advice remains to seek medical advice anytime a child with flu has unusual or concerning symptoms, such as labored breathing. Doctors see more neurologic complications during severe flu seasons — they may be linked to particular influenza strains — and survivors can have ongoing seizures or other lingering problems, he said. Meanwhile, vaccine makers are gearing up for the monthslong process of brewing next winter's flu shots. A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee was supposed to meet on March 13 to help choose which flu strains to include but with that meeting's cancellation, it's unclear if the government will decide on its own. 'The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,' Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harsh-flu-season-has-health-officials-worried-about-brain-complications-in-children-/7991146.html	2025-02-27T17:32:48-08:00	
Fort Knox: Is gold there?	WASHINGTON — 'Is the gold there?' As the decades-old question about the legendary Fort Knox makes headlines again, U.S. President Donald Trump is on the hunt for answers. 'We're actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold. Tons of gold,' Trump said Monday. His demand for an audit is echoing widely, with public figures like his cost-cutting czar Elon Musk and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky joining the chorus in recent weeks. 'Who is confirming that gold wasn’t stolen from Fort Knox?' Musk posted on X on Feb. 17. 'Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not. That gold is owned by the American public! We want to know if it’s still there.' The allegation is not new. Yet despite Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s assurance about the gold’s presence and annual audits, suspicion lingers, leading to continued speculation about the state of the treasure at Fort Knox. Here is what you need to know about Fort Knox and the latest debate about its gold deposits. What is Fort Knox? The United States Bullion Depository, often called Fort Knox, is an ultra-secure vault at a World War I-era military installation 56 kilometers (35 miles) south of Kentucky’s largest city, Louisville. Named after Henry Knox, America's first secretary of war, Camp Knox was established in 1918 before becoming a permanent military base, rebranded as Fort Knox in the 1930s. The depository was constructed in 1936 to store the government’s expanding gold reserves that backed the U.S. currency. In 1937, Fort Knox received its first gold shipment via the U.S. Mail, and by 1941 held a staggering 649.6 million ounces of gold — four times its current holdings. But Fort Knox wasn’t just about gold. During World War II, it safeguarded America's founding documents — the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights — and valuable items of other governments, such as a copy of the Magna Carta, England’s 13th-century charter of liberties. How much gold is there today? According to the U.S. Mint, the depository today houses 147.3 million ounces of gold, or 5,000 tons. That’s half of the U.S. Treasury’s reserves, with the remainder stored in other secure facilities around the country. A standard gold bar kept at Fort Knox weighs about 12.4 kilograms (27.5 pounds). The gold’s book value was set in the 1970s at $42.22 per ounce. At today’s prices, it is worth $428 billion, according to mining.com. What is known about the vault's security? Fort Knox’s legendary security inspired the phrase 'secure as Fort Knox.' Built with 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural steel, the depository building is a formidable fortress. Inside, the two-story vault has 21-inch-thick, concrete-reinforced steel walls. The vault door — blast-, drill- and torch-proof — weighs more than 20 tons and requires 14 turns to open. No single person knows the procedure to open it, former Mint Director Philip Diehl wrote in a 2023 CoinWeek article. Guarded by the United States Mint Police and the large military force at Fort Knox, the facility is nearly impenetrable. Razor wire and minefields add extra layers of protection, according to Diehl. Have visitors been allowed inside? The U.S. Mint calls the depository a 'classified facility,' with a strict 'no visitors, no exceptions' policy. Even former presidents have been barred from visiting. But in 1974, it did make an exception, opening the vaults to a group of journalists and members of Congress. The historic visit, captured on camera and later broadcast on television, came in response to rumors that large amounts of the gold had mysteriously vanished. Four decades later, former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin led a delegation of Kentucky politicians to view the vaults in 2017. 'Glad gold is safe!' Mnuchin tweeted after the visit. Prior to these rare visits, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the only outsider to enter the vaults, according to the Mint. Now, pressure is mounting for a new public audit. Conservative radio host Glenn Beck wrote to Trump recently, asking to bring a camera crew to Fort Knox 'to document and verify the presence of America’s gold reserves.' While few doubt the gold’s presence, some industry experts believe opening the vault doors to the public could end the controversy. 'A full, independent audit — potentially even a livestreamed verification — would dispel doubts and reinforce trust in U.S. financial institutions,' mining.com wrote in a commentary.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fort-knox-is-gold-there-/7991126.html	2025-02-27T16:57:13-08:00	
USAGM announces Kari Lake as special adviser	The U.S. Agency for Global Media on Thursday announced that journalist-turned-politician Kari Lake will join the agency as a special adviser. A journalist for 30 years, Lake was named by President Donald Trump in December as the person he would like to have lead Voice of America (VOA). Lake’s selection for that role has been slowed while Trump’s pick to head the USAGM — conservative political activist and writer L. Brent Bozell III — awaits his Senate confirmation hearing. The agency is also waiting for a new bipartisan board to be installed, which will work alongside the CEO on issues including appointing or dismissing network heads. Roman Napoli announced Lake’s arrival in an email to the staff. Napoli is carrying out the duties of USAGM chief executive; the previous head, Amanda Bennett, resigned. Lake 'brings a wealth of experience in broadcast journalism, having spent more than two decades as an anchor and reporter in major media markets,' Napoli wrote. In highlighting her accomplishments, Napoli said Lake had interviewed leaders, including two U.S. presidents, and had been awarded two Emmys for international reporting. 'As Senior Advisor of the Trump Administration, Kari will help USAGM implement the policies and strategies needed to streamline the agency, its networks, and its grantees,' the email said. USAGM oversees several entities dedicated to reporting news and combating censorship that have a combined weekly audience reach of more than 420 million. Those organizations include VOA, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, and the nonprofits Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Open Technology Fund and Frontline Media Fund. As well as overseeing the independent networks, USAGM has a stated mission to 'inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.' In his email to the staff, Napoli said Lake’s experience 'will be invaluable as we continue our mission to clearly and effectively present the policies of the Trump Administration around the world.' USAGM’s public affairs department did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment. An editorial firewall prevents USAGM from involvement in the journalistic output of the entities it oversees. The media outlets under USAGM have been combating disinformation and propaganda since VOA’s first broadcasts in Nazi Germany during World War II. It has also attracted criticism for alleged bias, coverage, mismanagement and security lapses including vetting of staff. Lake referenced some of the criticism directed at USAGM in her remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week. Lake told the audience that as VOA director she will focus the news agency on producing 'accurate and honest reporting.' 'VOA has been telling America's story to the world for 83 years this Monday. Sometimes the coverage has been incredible and sometimes it's been pitiful,' Lake said. 'We are fighting an information war, and there's no better weapon than the truth, and I believe VOA could be that weapon.' Among those who have called for the network to be cut is Trump special adviser Elon Musk. 'We won't become Trump TV,' she said, 'but it sure as hell will not be ‘TDS TV.’ You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, '60 Minutes,' The Washington Post and The New York Times.' As well as a background in journalism, Lake has more recently been a politician. She left her job at an Arizona news station over what she has said she felt was disinformation about the pandemic. She ran unsuccessfully for governor of Arizona and challenged her loss in lawsuits. A run for senator was also unsuccessful.	https://www.voanews.com/a/usagm-announces-kari-lake-as-special-adviser-/7990843.html	2025-02-27T16:28:26-08:00

Trump to hit Canada, Mexico, China with new tariffs	U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he would impose 25% tariffs on imported goods from Canada and Mexico next week as he originally planned, contending the two neighboring countries are still not doing enough to curb the flow of drugs into the United States. In addition, Trump said on his Truth Social media platform that he also was hitting China with another 10% levy next Tuesday on its exports to the U.S., on top of the 10% tariff he imposed earlier this month. China quickly matched the first Trump tariff with one of its own on U.S. exports. 'Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,' Trump said. 'A large percentage of these Drugs, much of them in the form of Fentanyl, are made in, and supplied by, China.' Trump first announced the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the U.S.’s closest allies and trading partners, earlier this month. But he delayed imposition of the tariffs until March 4 after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would send 10,000 troops to her country’s northern border to help the U.S. control drug trafficking. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would name a 'fentanyl czar' to deal with the issue. Sheinbaum, whose trade-dependent economy sends 80% of its exports to the U.S., said earlier this week, 'We're expecting to reach a deal with the United States,' but that if a deal is not reached, Mexico could impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-made products. When Trump first announced the hefty U.S. tariff on Canadian imports, Trudeau said it was 'entirely unjustified' and promised to impose a 25% tax starting March 12 on U.S. steel and aluminum products exported to Canada. Canada is the top exporter of both metals to the U.S. Economists say the tariffs Trump is imposing are likely to boost retail prices for consumers and the cost of materials for businesses. Mexico, Canada and China, in that order, are the three biggest national trading partners with the U.S., although collectively, the 27-nation European Union is larger than all three. Trump, at the first Cabinet meeting of his new presidential term on Wednesday, said he would 'very soon' announce a 25% tariff on EU exports to the U.S. With Trump signaling the new tariff on goods sent to the U.S., the EU vowed to respond 'firmly and immediately' to 'unjustified' trade barriers and suggested it would impose its own tariffs on U.S. imports if Trump proceeded with his. Trump, in his Truth Social announcement, said reciprocal tariffs on nations that levy taxes on U.S. exports were still set to take effect on April 2. He has also hinted at putting tariffs on automobile imports, lumber, pharmaceutical products and other goods. Many economists have repeatedly warned that tariffs could lead to higher prices, boosting troublesome inflation in the U.S. Trump has acknowledged there could be short-term pain for Americans but he has contended that tariffs would ultimately be beneficial to the U.S. economy, the world’s largest. Trump says the tariffs he is imposing would be an incentive for foreign companies to do more manufacturing in the United States to avoid the tariffs on overseas shipment of their products to the U.S. More immediately, Trump is focused on the flow of drugs into the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-hit-canada-mexico-china-with-new-tariffs/7990774.html	2025-02-27T14:12:33-08:00

Despite restrictions, Afghan women provide health care	ISLAMABAD — Sana Safi, a young a doctor in Afghanistan, takes pride in her work, for she is among a shrinking group of female health experts in a country where women are banned from pursuing education or working in most sectors. 'I am making a real difference in the lives of my patients, especially women who have limited access to health care,' the doctor told VOA on the phone from Nangarhar province. But she also is afraid of drawing attention to herself for fear of reprisal and asked to be called Sana Safi to avoid revealing her real identity. Many female doctors have left Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. New women may not be entering the health sector any time soon, as the hardline de facto authorities banned medical education for women last December, leaving many final year students without a formal degree. The edict was one in a long line of restrictions the Taliban's reclusive spiritual leader, Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, has placed on women, using extremely strict interpretation of Islamic teachings that he claims are divine commands. The United Nations has called Taliban's treatment of women 'gender apartheid.' Health is one of the few sectors in which Afghan women are allowed to work. Safi works in obstetrics and gynecology, one of the few specializations that women can practice. Safi said she sees up to 40 women patients daily. 'What makes me sad about my work is the lack of resources, the restrictions on female health care workers, and the fact that many women are unable to get the medical attention they need due to cultural and political barriers,' the doctor said. Barriers that women face in accessing health care vary according to local culture across the war-torn, mountainous country. 'Patients in restricted [conservative] provinces are not allowed to come to the health facility without a mahram [male guardian],' a health sector researcher told VOA by phone from Kabul. She asked that we call her Amina to protect her identity as her work requires cross-country travel to collect data. 'We have had these reports from the health facility level that the female who did not have the mahram with herself at the moment of delivery of the baby, she died because of this issue,' the researcher said. She said such restrictions are applied stringently in government-run health facilities in conservative towns but are largely ignored in private clinics, especially in urban centers like Kabul and Jalalabad. A World Health Organization donor appeal issued last month said 14.5 million people, or 33 percent of Afghans, live in areas where primary health care cannot be accessed within a one-hour walk. Since a majority of Afghans in the poverty-stricken country rely on state-run hospitals and health centers that provide care at little to no cost, women from poor households are forced to comply with the requirement of having a male guardian – who can even be a minor. Amina, who travels with her husband for her research, told VOA that many female health workers also must bring a male family member to work with them in conservative parts of the country. Taliban workers from the Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, commonly called PVPV, routinely visit health centers to ensure compliance. 'They are regularly checking each health facility to see that each female health worker brought their mahram with herself or not,' said Amina. The researcher said that the requirement that a male family member must accompany a woman outside the house, though, existed in conservative parts of the country under the U.S.-backed regimes, as well, because of cultural norms. The checks under Taliban are thorough. 'They check the attendance sheet and ask who is a particular doctor's mahram,' the researcher said. The restrictions come at a financial cost to families, while men who could work sit idle as chaperones. From pharmacies to hospitals, Taliban have put men in charge. However, performing duties amid restrictions on the mixing of sexes is a challenge for them, too. Pharmacy workers in areas under strict Taliban control are discouraged from giving medicine to women without mahram, and hospital chiefs are punished for holding meetings with female staff, according to Amina's research. A hospital head in Badakhshan province spent two weeks behind bars after a meeting with female employees, Amina said. Staff in private hospitals don't face similar restrictions. 'In emergency situations or when no other doctor is available, I may also assist male patients, if necessary,' said Safi. She told VOA she does not take a male guardian with her and that her employer provides transportation. Amina said she believes Taliban are willing to look the other way because private hospitals pay taxes, contributing to the treasury. Despite the Taliban's ban on women's education, a few medical institutions also continue to train women in Kabul. However, the fields are limited to midwifery and dentistry. Both Safi and Amina worry that the limits on what female medical students can study will leave female patients with little help. 'It breaks my heart to see patients suffer simply because there aren't enough medicines, equipment, or female doctors available,' Safi said. Public health facilities across Afghanistan operate mostly with support from United Nattions agencies and other international aid organizations. Amina said the Taliban-run health ministry pays attention to research reports and donor feedback. She pointed to the authorities' support for vaccination programs. Still, there is no sign the de facto authorities will lift restrictions on women's education or access to work in health care despite international calls and dissent from within Taliban circles. Cultural norms coupled with official restrictions mean some of the most vulnerable cannot receive the care they need. 'I hope for a future where health care is accessible to all,' Safi said. 'And female doctors can work freely without fear or restrictions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-restrictions-afghan-women-provide-health-care-/7990705.html	2025-02-27T13:46:45-08:00	
Mexico sends 29 prisoners to US as officials meet with Trump team	MEXICO CITY — Mexico has sent drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985, to the United States with 28 prisoners requested by the U.S. government, a Mexican government official and other sources confirmed Thursday. It comes as top Mexican officials are in Washington trying to head off the Trump administration's threat of imposing 25% tariffs on all Mexican imports next week. The official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case, confirmed Caro Quintero's removal. Another person familiar with Mexico's actions also confirmed the removal on the condition of anonymity because they were unable to discuss sensitive diplomatic negotiations. Mexico's Attorney General's Office said in a statement that the 29 prisoners sent to the U.S. Thursday faced charges related to drug trafficking and other crimes. Also among the list were two leaders of the Los Zetas cartel, Mexicans Miguel Trevino Morales and his brother Omar Trevino Morales, known as Z-40 and Z-42, the official confirmed. The removal of the drug lords from Mexico coincided with a visit to Washington by Mexico's Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente and other top economic and military officials. The meeting was the latest in ongoing negotiations with the U.S. over trade and security relations, which have radically shifted since U.S. President Donald Trump took office. The bilateral talks come just days before the March 4 deadline set by Trump to apply broad 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, which economists say would thrust the Mexican economy into recession. In exchange for delaying tariffs, Trump had insisted that Mexico crack down on the U.S.-Mexico border, cartels and fentanyl production, despite significant dips in migration and overdoses over the past year. The removals may indicate that negotiations are moving along as the tariff deadline approaches. Caro Quintero had walked free in 2013 after 28 years in prison when a court overturned his 40-year sentence for the 1985 kidnapping and killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena. The brutal murder marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico relations. Caro Quintero, the former leader of the Guadalajara cartel, had since returned to drug trafficking and unleashed bloody turf battles in the northern Mexico border state of Sonora until he was arrested by Mexican forces in 2022. The removal of the Trevino Morales brothers also marks the end of a long process that began after the capture in 2013 of Miguel Trevino Morales and two years later of his brother, Omar. The process wound on for so many years that then-Mexico's Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero described the lags as 'truly shameful.' The Trevino Morales family, who have been accused by American authorities of running the violent northeastern Cartel from prison, have charges pending in the U.S. for participation in a criminal organization, drug trafficking, firearms offenses and money laundering.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-sends-29-prisoners-to-us-as-officials-meet-with-trump-team-/7990748.html	2025-02-27T13:44:44-08:00	
North Korea appears to have sent more troops to Russia, Seoul says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's spy agency said Thursday that North Korea appears to have sent additional troops to Russia after its soldiers deployed on the Russian-Ukraine fronts suffered heavy casualties. The National Intelligence Service said in a brief statement it was trying to determine how many more troops North Korea has deployed to Russia. The NIS also assessed that North Korean troops were redeployed at fronts in Russia's Kursk region in the first week of February, following a reported temporary withdrawal from the area. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an address on Feb. 7, confirmed a new Ukrainian offensive in Kursk and said North Korean troops were fighting alongside Russian forces there. North Korea has been supplying a vast number of conventional weapons to Russia, and last fall it sent 10,000 to 12,000 troops to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukraine intelligence officials. North Korean soldiers are highly disciplined and well trained, but observers say they've become easy targets for drone and artillery attacks on Russian-Ukraine battlefields because of their lack of combat experience and unfamiliarity with the terrain. In January, the NIS said about 300 North Korean soldiers had died and 2,700 had been injured. Zelenskyy earlier put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, although U.S. estimates were lower at around 1,200. Earlier Thursday, South Korea's JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported that an additional 1,000 to 3,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk between January and February. South Korea, the United States and their partners worry that Russia could reward North Korea by transferring high-tech weapons technologies that can sharply enhance its nuclear weapons program. North Korea is expected to receive economic and other assistance from Russia, as well. During talks in Saudi Arabia last week, Russia and the U.S. agreed to start working toward ending the war and improving their diplomatic and economic ties. Ukrainian officials weren't present at the talks. That marked an extraordinary shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump and a clear departure from U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its war in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-appears-to-have-sent-more-troops-to-russia-seoul-says/7990731.html	2025-02-27T13:34:15-08:00	
US still opposes ‘forced, coercive’ changes to Taiwan’s status, Rubio says	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday reaffirmed Washington’s opposition to attempts to alter Taiwan’s status through force or coercion. The pledge comes amid growing concerns about the military threat China poses to the democratically ruled island and worries that Taiwan may be sidelined as Washington looks to make deals with Beijing. In an interview with Fox News, Rubio said the best way to prevent a conflict in the Taiwan Strait is to have a strong U.S. 'military capability,' adding that the United States needs to be 'present' in the Indo-Pacific to deal with China. 'We have a longstanding position on Taiwan that we’re not going to abandon, and that is: We are against any forced, compelled, coercive change in the status of Taiwan,' Rubio said. At the White House on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump sidestepped a question about whether he would ensure that 'China will never take Taiwan by force' during his presidency. He indicated that he does not want to see a war in the Taiwan Strait under his watch. 'I never comment on that. I don’t comment on anything because I don't want to ever put myself in that position,' Trump said during a Cabinet meeting, adding 'I have a great relationship with [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping].' Some Washington diplomats told VOA that Rubio’s remarks on Wednesday are in line with the Feb. 7 U.S.-Japan joint statement in which Trump and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. During their first official meeting at the White House, the leaders declared in a statement that their countries 'opposed any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion.' US urges allies to boost defense The potential end of the war in Ukraine is one factor that could have an impact on Taiwan and the U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific region, although not all analysts agree. 'I don’t believe that an end to the war in Ukraine would fundamentally shift U.S. strategic focus toward Asia on its own, since U.S. policymakers would have to remain concerned about a resumption of fighting or new Russian attacks against NATO allies,' Zack Cooper, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA. Others contend the Trump administration has made it clear that NATO countries are responsible for increasing their defense spending. In this view, the end of the conflict in Ukraine would allow the U.S. to redirect its resources toward countering China. James Fanell, a retired U.S. Navy captain and former director of intelligence and information operations for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, said, 'One key area will be in naval shipbuilding and restoring the size and capabilities of the U.S. Navy in the Indo-Pacific, which has essentially not grown while the PLA [Chinese] Navy now is both the largest and one of the most lethal navies on the planet. 'It will also be a strong reminder to our allies in the Indo-Pacific that they, too, will have to increase their own defense spending,' Fanell said. ‘Today’s Ukraine ... tomorrow’s Taiwan’ Former U.S. military officials who have recently visited Taiwan reported that the island is 'definitely concerned about what’s happening with Ukraine.' 'The idea that one might be abandoned causes them to be petrified and concerned,' retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, currently a defense analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said during a recent FDD webinar. He said that while Taiwanese think tankers, journalists and businesspeople are extremely worried, government officials are refraining from making public statements. Taiwan has shown solidarity with Ukraine amid Russia’s aggression. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party has supported U.S. efforts to assist Kyiv, including the provision of defense equipment to Ukraine. DPP leaders have said, 'Today’s Ukraine could be tomorrow’s Taiwan,' drawing parallels between the situations and highlighting the risks posed by the unchecked aggression of authoritarian governments. China’s ruling Chinese Communist Party claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has never ruled out bringing the self-ruled democracy under its control, even by force. Earlier this week, on the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Beijing and Moscow reaffirmed their 'no-limits' partnership. Critics, including Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Kuomintang, or KMT, have been skeptical about the DPP’s strategy of allying with and relying on the U.S. to resist China. Reassuring Indo-Pacific nations At a diplomatic event late Wednesday, senior U.S. officials provided reassurance to their allies in the Indo-Pacific. Washington’s 'America First' policy does not mean 'America alone' in foreign affairs; the United States continues to engage with its allies in the Indo-Pacific region, said Sean O’Neill, a senior official from the State Department’s Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. He added that the U.S. remains committed to the security and sovereignty of nations in the Indo-Pacific. Andrew Byers, deputy assistant secretary of defense, said that the U.S., 'through robust dialogue and collaboration,' can address shared priorities to ensure a 'free, open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.' He said the Trump administration will continue to work 'in lockstep with' allies to achieve it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-still-opposes-forced-coercive-changes-to-taiwan-s-status-rubio-says/7990671.html	2025-02-27T12:52:42-08:00

Global splinters evident at G20 finance ministers meeting	JOHANNESBURG — The Group of 20 major economies has been instrumental in coordinating the response to crises like the COVID pandemic. But top officials from the U.S. and several other member states skipped the G20 finance ministers’ meeting in South Africa this week, raising questions about the group's continued relevance in a splintered global environment. The two-day meeting in Cape Town ended without a communique, with current G20 leader South Africa saying there was not sufficient consensus to issue one. In his opening remarks at the event, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa referred to the fractured geopolitical climate and stressed the importance of international cooperation. 'At this time of global uncertainty and escalating tension, it is now more important than ever that the members of the G20 should work together,' Ramaphosa said. 'The erosion of multilateralism presents a threat to global growth and stability.' He said the G20 finance ministers meeting had to address major issues like climate change financing, ensuring debt sustainability for developing countries, and Africa's need to process its own critical minerals for inclusive growth. But it appeared the world’s largest economies were not able to find common ground on a number of issues. South African Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana noted this wasn’t the first time. 'The issue of the communique and the absence of it is not something new,' Godongwana said. 'To my knowledge, I mean, since the Russia-Ukraine war, it has been difficult to find a joint communique. Now, new differences have emerged on a number of other topics.' Climate adaptation funding was one of the areas where there was a 'difference of opinion,' he said. The finance ministers meeting was beset with similar problems faced by last week's G20 foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg, which laid bare the discord in current geopolitics. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent skipped the event amid a spat with host country South Africa, and after the U.S. criticized the themes around climate change and 'solidarity, equality and sustainability.' The finance chiefs of other large economies, including Japan, India and China also sat it out. However, all of them, including the U.S., sent representation at various levels. Still, the absence of some top officials underscores global divisions sparked by Russia’s attack on Ukraine and the 'America First' administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, said Professor Alex van den Heever of the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. 'I think that this has caused a sort of a general review of how people see global issues,' van den Heever said, 'with people becoming a lot more insular and not really looking at sort of global social solidarity in any way, shape or form – largely looking to look after their own situation.' However, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves, who was in Cape Town for the meeting, added to Ramaphosa’s call for unity, posting on social media platform X, 'Productive and successful collaboration with our international partners is front of mind, now more than ever.' Asked about the issue of tariffs, Godongwana said there had been, 'general agreement against protectionism' at the G20 meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7990649.html	2025-02-27T12:17:31-08:00	
At least 11 dead in DRC after blasts at M23 rally, rebels say	BUKAVU, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — At least 11 people were killed and scores injured Thursday when explosions in the eastern Congo city of Bukavu struck a rally held by leaders of the M23 rebel group, which took control of the city earlier this month. Rebel leaders blamed the bombing on the Democratic Republic of Congo's government and said attackers were among those killed in the blasts, with conflicting reports among rebels and local officials about the number of attackers and victims. Congo’s president blamed the attack on unspecified 'foreign' forces. 'The attack caused 11 deaths and verifications are underway. The author of the attack is among the victims,' said Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance, or AFC, which includes the M23. 'There are 65 injured, six of whom are seriously injured and are currently being treated in the operating room.' He told reporters that 'following today’s unfortunate incident, we are obliged to react.' Leaders of the M23 rebel group, including Nangaa, were meeting residents when the explosions occurred in the central part of Bukavu. Video and photos shared on social media showed a crowd fleeing the mass rally in Bukavu and bloodied bodies on the ground. M23 accused the Congolese authorities of orchestrating the attack. 'We are accusing and condemning vigorously the criminal regime of Kinshasa, which … just implemented its plan of exterminating civilian populations,' AFC said in a statement. 'This attack caused several deaths, including a few terrorists from Kinshasa and some injured. Two of them were immediately apprehended by our services. 'This cowardly and barbaric act will not be without consequences,' it said. ‘Change and development’ President Felix Tshisekedi called the attack 'a heinous terrorist act that was perpetrated by a foreign army illegally present on Congolese soil.' The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, over 1,600 kilometers away. Jean Samy, deputy president of the civil society Forces Vives of South Kivu, told The Associated Press that the attack was 'a sabotage.' 'Until now, we do not know where these grenades came from,' he said by phone. 'We have already recorded more than 13 deaths and serious injuries who will have to have their hands and legs amputated. The perpetrators of this act are still unknown.' Nangaa was among leaders leaving the podium when two blasts rocked the scene, according to a journalist present at the rally. Nangaa had earlier told the rally that M23 was bringing 'change and development' to their city. Three-week offensive Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have swept through the region seizing key cities and killing some 3,000 people in the most significant escalation of conflict in over a decade. In a lightning three-week offensive, the M23 took control of eastern Congo’s main city, Goma, and seized the second-largest city, Bukavu.

Sorrow, frustration as US condemns deportation of Uyghurs to China	Washington — For Sweden-based independent Uyghur researcher Nyrola Elima, Feb. 27, 2025, stands as a day of deep sorrow. After years of relentless work to help resettle more than 40 Uyghurs held in Thailand’s immigration facilities since 2014, her efforts came to a devastating close Thursday when all of them were loaded onto buses and put on a flight to the city of Kashgar in China’s northwest region of Xinjiang, home to 12 million Uyghurs. 'I don’t want to speak right now,' Elima said in a trembling voice message to VOA. 'I’ve talked to them so much over the past two-and-a-half years. Now, I feel like someone who’s lost loved ones and somehow survived. This pain – it’s more than I can bear.' Just two weeks ago, Elima testified before a judge in Thailand on behalf of the 43 Uyghur men detained in a Thai prison. A glimmer of hope emerged for them when the court set a March 27 date to hear from the Thai Immigration Bureau on why the Uyghurs were detained for nearly 11 years. The Thai government’s decision to deport the Uyghurs before that hearing has sent shockwaves through communities of Uyghurs overseas and rights advocates. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the deportation and said in a statement, 'we are alarmed by this action,' and added, 'We call on Chinese authorities to provide full access to verify the well-being of the returned Uyghurs on a regular basis. The Thai government must insist and fully verify continuously that Chinese authorities protect the Uyghurs’ human rights.' ‘Complex factors’ 'On February 27th, 40 Chinese nationals who had illegally entered Thailand were repatriated to Xinjiang, China on a chartered flight of China Civil Aviation Company [Southern Airlines],' posted the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok on Facebook. The embassy’s post continued, 'a concrete measure between China and Thailand in collaboratively tackling immigration crimes and protecting the rights and interest of Chinese nationals in accordance with the two countries' laws and international protocols,' blaming the group’s decade-long detention on 'complex factors in international relations.' Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai defended the move Thursday, telling reporters that successive Thai governments had sought third-country resettlement, informing the U.S. and EU of stalled efforts. 'This is a beautiful, nice ending for them, for their families. And Thailand is no longer burdened,' he declared. 'Thailand should even get praises for handling this issue decisively for the best interest of humanity and them [the Uyghurs]. It is a cause for happiness as they are free from detention and reunite with their parents, brothers and sisters and children and wives.' At a Thursday press conference, Thai officials showcased photos and videos of a few Uyghurs reuniting with their families when they arrived in China. Elima, responded to the images with a post on X, saying, 'So far, only these 3 men and their families have been used as propaganda material. I don’t believe all 40 men's families were summoned to Kashgar – some have relatives who are deceased or imprisoned,' the post said. 'The whereabouts of the remaining 37 individuals and their families remain unknown,' casting doubt on the legitimacy of the reunion. Julie Millsap, a U.S.-based activist who has urged Washington to intervene, posted on X, '...can't explain how painful it is to watch them be used for propaganda, knowing how terrified they must be. Our brave men. Brave enough to seek a new life. How we’ve let you down.' Until this week, 48 Uyghurs were detained in Thailand and languished in legal limbo despite their pleas for asylum. They were among more than 350 men, women, and children intercepted by Thai police in 2014 after being smuggled from China’s Yunnan province by human traffickers. A year later, Bangkok and Ankara agreed to resettle more than 170 Uyghurs – mostly women and children – in Turkey. Yet weeks later, Thailand deported 109 mostly male asylum seekers to China. In interviews with VOA, one resettled Uyghur who wished to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions to his family in China, described the escape from Xinjiang’s tightening repression. 'We had to put our lives in harm’s way,' citing China’s refusal to issue passports as a reason of their flight without documents in 2013 and 2014. Their stories echo findings from the U.N. Human Rights Office and groups like Amnesty International, which estimates that since 2017, more than one million people – mostly Uyghurs – have been confined in Xinjiang’s internment camps. China has described these facilities as 'Vocational and Skills Training Centers' to counter extremism, but a 2022 U.N. report cited 'credible' evidence of torture, forced labor, and inhumane conditions, based on survivor accounts – allegations Beijing has repeatedly rejected as fabrications. Since 2014, of the 53 remaining Uyghur detainees in Thailand, five received prison sentences for attempting to escape. Five others, including two minors, died in custody. Chinese state media reported Thursday that forty Uyghurs were just deported to China, leaving the whereabouts of eight Uyghurs detained in Thailand unknown. 'Even when other countries offered resettlement, Thailand refused to release them,' Elima told VOA. 'They applied for UNHCR [U.N. refugee agency] protection, but UNHCR has no access to them. They are barred from seeing their families, lawyers, [and] UNHCR. They are not even allowed to be bailed,' which VOA confirmed with UNHCR. 'This is a clear violation of the principle of non-refoulement and the Royal Thai Government’s obligations under international law,' said UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Ruvendrini Menikdiwela. Non-refoulement, a cornerstone of international law, bars returning people to persecution—a duty Thailand holds under the U.N. Convention Against Torture, despite not signing the 1951 Refugee Convention. Sophie Richardson, former China director at Human Rights Watch, blasted the U.N.’s response on X as 'inexcusably weak or non-existent,' arguing it enabled 'China and Thailand govts’ blatant violations of human rights law.'

Pakistan's opposition alliance demands elections, political prisoners' release	ISLAMABAD — An alliance of opposition parties in Pakistan called for new national elections Thursday, accusing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government of suppressing political rivals, curtailing dissent and violating human rights. The Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan, or the Movement to Safeguard the Constitution, concluded a two-day conference in Islamabad by demanding the release of all political prisoners and rejecting the outcome of parliamentary elections held last year. 'The results of the rigged February 8, 2024, elections bear direct responsibility for the country's prevailing political, economic, and social crisis,' the declaration stated. It asserted that Pakistan’s parliament lacked 'moral, political, or legal standing' because it stemmed from a manipulated vote, and 'the only way to resolve the current political crisis is through free, fair, and transparent elections.' Sharif’s government, believed to be backed by the powerful military, rejects opposition allegations, claiming they are aimed at hindering efforts it is making to reform and stabilize the economy. Leaders from imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, journalists and civil society representatives were also among the attendees of Thursday’s conference. The conference occurred a day after U.S. Republican Representative Joe Wilson announced on X that he was 'nearly finished drafting' a bill seeking 'to restore democracy in Pakistan.' US concerns Wilson wrote that his proposed bill 'mandates a 30-day determination of sanctions' on Pakistan’s military chief, General Asim Munir, and 'reviews all generals & gov[ernment] officials & their families for sanctions.' He did not provide further details. On Tuesday, Wilson and Republican Representative August Pfluger wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, urging him to engage with 'the military regime of Pakistan to free Imran Khan.' VOA contacted the spokesperson for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry for a response to U.S. lawmakers’ claims but did not receive an immediate reply. Michael Kugelman, who directs the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, cautioned that Wilson’s proposed bill could be troubling for Pakistan. 'It’s a really big deal if it’s passed. It’s one thing to condemn the assaults on democracy in Pakistan, but it’s a whole new ballgame to threaten sanctions,' Kugelman told VOA in written comments. 'Of course, Congressional action does not represent U.S. policy, but the leadership in Pakistan would not want to see the broader mood on Pakistan in Washington reflected in this way,' he said. Khan's removal from power Khan has repeatedly accused Munir of being behind his prosecutions and crackdown on his political party. The 72-year-old former prime minister was removed from power in April 2022 after failing to secure a vote of confidence from parliament, a move widely viewed as an attempt by the powerful military to silence a popular politician. His ouster plunged the South Asian nation of more than 240 million people into ongoing political turmoil, undermining Sharif’s attempts to attract foreign and domestic investment to overcome economic woes. In August 2023, the former cricket star-turned-deposed prime minister was convicted on contested graft charges and jailed. Khan remains embroiled in dozens of other lawsuits that he rejects as politically motivated and alleges the military is behind them to keep him from returning to power. Khan accuses the Pakistani military of manipulating last year’s elections to prevent his party from winning the vote and enabling Sharif to form a coalition government, charges the military and Sharif reject. Authorities have also carried out a crackdown on the jailed leader’s party, rounding up hundreds of his workers and leaders, including women, with many of them remaining in custody for nearly two years without being formally charged.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-opposition-alliance-demands-elections-political-prisoners-release/7990414.html	2025-02-27T10:24:59-08:00	
Israel's army admits failures in staving off Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — An investigation by the Israeli military has determined that U.S.-designated terror group Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group's intentions and underestimated its capabilities. The findings, released Thursday, could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the attack. Many Israelis believe the failures of Oct. 7 extend beyond the military and blame Netanyahu for a failed policy of deterrence and containment in the years leading up to the attack. That approach included allowing Qatar to send suitcases of cash into Gaza and sidelining Hamas' rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The prime minister has not taken responsibility, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire. Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry. The military's main findings were that the region's most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas' intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday. The military's findings are in line with past conclusions reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings. 'Oct. 7 was a complete failure,' said one military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found. The military also misjudged its capabilities. Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the official said. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes. Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official said. The official said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas switched their phones over to Israeli SIM cards. The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack. The Israeli military official said intelligence shows that Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had begun planning it as early as 2017. With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border. From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military's command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas marauded through border communities and a music festival with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official said. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure. It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants. According to the first official, the report blamed the military for being overconfident in its knowledge and not showing enough doubt in its core concepts and beliefs. It did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, but is likely to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals. Some high-ranking officers have already resigned, including the former head of military intelligence and Israel's top general, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who steps down next week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-army-admits-failures-in-staving-off-oct-7-2023-hamas-attack/7990394.html	2025-02-27T10:04:30-08:00	
As US tariffs expand, Chinese firms' workarounds come into focus	WASHINGTON — As U.S. President Donald Trump moves forward with an expanding net of tariffs, including an additional 10% for Chinese imports starting next week, industry insiders and experts say closing existing loopholes and workarounds that companies use to avoid trade taxes is also key. One practice that so far has helped companies from China — and others — to avoid being hit with tariffs is transshipment, or the transfer of goods to a second country, where the 'Made in China' label is switched for another. Berwick Offray, a ribbon manufacturer in the northeastern state of Pennsylvania, has first-hand experience with the practice. Founded in 1945, the company prides itself on its pledge to keep its products 'Made in the USA' and its position as one of the largest manufacturers of ribbons in the world. Earlier this month, the company sued a U.S. importer, TriMar Ribbon, for allegedly buying ribbons produced in China that were shipped to the United States through India to illegally avoid being subject to tariffs. Ribbons made in China are cheaper and sold at below market value prices in the United States. 'The current allegations allege that TriMar imported ribbons from China into the United States through transshipment in India, and did not declare the correct country of origin upon entry,' said a notice issued from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, when the agency agreed to investigate the case. Daniel Pickard, an expert on international trade and an attorney at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, which represents Berwick Offray, said there have been numerous cases of transshipment, especially when it comes to products from China. 'We have assisted several clients in submitting allegations to CBP against importers of products that have been transshipped from China through third countries such as Thailand, India and Canada,' Pickard told VOA. 'Our clients typically are the U.S. manufacturers of those products that are competing against the Chinese imports that are engaged in evasion of duties.' According to CBP data, there are currently 221 investigations of Chinese-made products suspected of transshipment tariff evasion. Tariffs and loopholes In early February, the Trump administration rolled out 10% blanket tariffs on all Chinese goods. On March 4, Chinese imports will face an additional 10% tariff. While Trump has worked to reduce potential workarounds, including his executive order on reciprocal tariffs on trading partners, U.S. lawmakers have introduced measures to close the loopholes that would allow Chinese products to evade the president’s increased fees. Republican Senator Rick Scott introduced the Stopping Adversarial Tariff Evasion Act on Jan. 31, aiming to strengthen enforcement mechanisms to ensure foreign manufacturers comply with customs and duties. The legislation builds on efforts from Congresswoman Ashley Hinson, who introduced a bill in December intended to hold China accountable for tariff evasion by establishing a task force and reporting mechanisms to deal with instances of financial crime. Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the second Trump presidency will foster even more efforts to monitor tariff evasion and inspect products for compliance. 'While it is increasingly difficult to determine where a product is really made these days, given increasing globalization and widespread production under global supply chain, increased scrutiny can help with identifying bypass attempts,' Menon said. 'If bypass attempts are suspected, rightly or wrongly, then the country as a whole may be penalized with new tariffs,' he said. Pickard said he expects more investigations will be launched by the new administration. He also looks forward to more efforts to counter discriminatory practices affecting U.S. companies. 'We anticipate CBP will increase its enforcement efforts as to the widespread customs fraud involving Chinese products,' he said. Many stakeholders in the industry, Pickard said, are hoping to see these issues met with criminal prosecutions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-us-tariffs-expand-chinese-firms-workarounds-come-into-focus/7990360.html	2025-02-27T09:42:55-08:00	
Experts: Europe could not replace US as guarantor of Ukraine's security	Friedrich Merz, who is set to become Germany’s chancellor after his Christian Democratic Union party won the country’s Feb. 23 parliamentary elections, has said that Europe may have to establish an 'independent' defense capability because the U.S. has become 'largely indifferent' to Europe’s fate. A top priority of any new European defense mechanism would be protecting Ukraine, now in its fourth year of trying to fight off the Russian invasion. The country has survived thus far in large part because of a heavy flow of U.S. military aid provided by then-president Joe Biden. New President Donald Trump has said he wants to end the war and recoup Washington’s costs, going so far as to demand Ukraine give the U.S. access to the country’s mineral wealth in return for the tens of billions of dollars the U.S. has spent on Ukraine’s defense. Voice of America’s Russian Service asked experts to assess the ability of European countries to help Ukraine to withstand, both militarily and economically, the Russian invasion, and to rebuild its destroyed infrastructure. Andriy Zolotarev, director of the Third Sector Analytical Center, a Kyiv-based think tank, told VOA that U.S. military aid is uniquely important to Ukraine’s defense. 'In particular, the U.S. has huge stockpiles of weapons, they are a supplier of critically important intelligence information,' he said. 'All the European countries taken together do not have satellite groupings like the United States. In addition, the U.S. has extremely important and truly irreplaceable types of weapons for Ukraine — Patriot [missile defense] systems, ATACMS [long-range guided missiles], HIMARS [multiple launch rocket systems], as well as spare parts for armored vehicles and artillery systems, and much more. This cannot be discounted in any way.' According to Zolotarev, while Europe produces advanced weapons and other military equipment, the European Union together with Great Britain can only partially compensate for what Ukraine would lose if the U.S. stopped providing assistance. 'Their efforts can soften the negative effect, but will not avoid unpleasant consequences,' he said. 'This will simply delay the inevitable end. Europe is currently far from being in the best economic and military shape.' Mark Feigin, a self-exiled Russian human rights activist and former lawyer, noted in an interview with VOA that while Europe includes two countries with nuclear arsenals, Great Britain and France, and is collectively far richer than Russia, the continent’s military potential is hampered by the fact that it is not 'a single entity.' 'The strength of the United States is that it makes this or that decision in a centralized manner, which is then consistently implemented,' he said. 'Europe's potential is dispersed ... In addition, the political situation in the EU countries is very volatile. ... All this keeps the Europeans from effectively using their obvious advantages [in the confrontation with Russia].' Rebuilding Ukraine Experts believe that Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction will ultimately be financed by private European investment. According to some estimates, that may carry a $500 billion to $2 trillion price tag. However, the longer the war continues, the more difficult the financing of Ukraine's reconstruction becomes. But the main question remains — who will pay for it? 'Well, ideally, it should be Russian money,' said economist Alexey Bayer. 'It should be either some reparations or some taxes, like on Russian exports, on the export of oil and gas and other minerals.' However, Bayer told VOA it is 'unlikely' that any Russian government, 'even a post-Putin one, will agree to voluntarily pay reparations to Ukraine.' While Russian assets frozen in Western banks — including tens of billions of dollars in foreign currency and gold reserves held by Russia’s central bank — could be used to rebuild Ukraine, that would require their complete expropriation. Many experts say neither the U.S. government nor European governments would take such a step, despite the heated discussion of this option in the press. 'It’s one thing to freeze assets; it’s another thing to confiscate assets,' said Alexander Cooley, a professor of political science at Barnard College. 'This is the legal struggle at the moment that’s happening in the U.S. and across EU and Western countries, and this is being constantly litigated, and it is uncertain territory. … I think you will find the Trump administration less favorable to seizing Russian assets, especially as it is moving to settle the conflict, and one of the primary Russian asks is the unfreezing of their assets and the removal of most of the sanctions,' he said. Cliff Kupchan, chairperson of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk consultancy, agreed that Europe is unlikely to support seizing frozen Russian assets. 'I think the Europeans are going to remain averse to the idea of breaking international norms on reserves and fear that Russia will then, as I think they would, seize Western governmental assets and Western private assets,' he said. And while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and various Western officials and experts have called for a 'Marshall Plan' to rebuild Ukraine — a reference to the massive U.S. aid program to rebuild Western Europe after World War II — Kupchan said a U.S. initiative on that scale for Ukraine’s reconstruction is unlikely. 'Right now, the U.S. is not only not interested, but it’s actively opposed to the idea. Trump thinks that Ukraine is yet another example of Europe free-riding on American money.' Still, Kupchan said European investment for reconstruction eventually will flow into Ukraine, especially if there is a ceasefire that ultimately holds and there are Western peacekeeping forces to ensure it. 'I don’t think it will be that slow,' he said in reference to Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction. 'As fast as it would be if there were a Marshall Plan? No. Stagnant? Also no.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-europe-could-not-replace-us-as-guarantor-of-ukraine-security/7990323.html	2025-02-27T09:07:39-08:00	
Katy Perry, Gayle King to join Blue Origin spaceflight	CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA — Katy Perry and Gayle King are headed to space with Jeff Bezos’ fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, and three other women. Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin, announced the all-female celebrity crew on Thursday. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, picked the crew who will join her on a 10-minute spaceflight from west Texas, the company said. They will blast off sometime this spring aboard a New Shepard rocket. No launch date was given. Blue Origin has flown tourists on short hops to space since 2021. Some passengers have gotten free rides, while others have paid a hefty sum to experience weightlessness. It was not immediately known who’s footing the bill for this upcoming flight. Sanchez invited singer Perry and TV journalist King, as well as former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, research scientist Amanda Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn. This will be Blue Origin’s 11th human spaceflight.

UN rights chief warns of 'mass deaths from famine' in Sudan	GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief warned of the risk of a further escalation of the war in Sudan on Thursday and said there was a growing risk of deaths from starvation on a wide scale. Volker Türk's warning came a day after the U.N. World Food Program has temporarily stopped distributing food aid in a famine-struck camp for displaced people in Sudan's North Darfur amid escalating violence. 'Sudan is a powder keg, on the verge of a further explosion into chaos, and at increasing risk of atrocity crimes and mass deaths from famine,' he told the Human Rights Council in Geneva. 'The danger of escalation has never been higher.' War erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, triggering the world's largest displacement and hunger crisis. Already, famine conditions have been reported in at least five locations in Sudan, including displacement camps in Darfur, according to the United Nations. Türk said that recent moves by the RSF towards establishing governing authority in areas it controls were likely to 'further entrench divisions and the risk of continued hostilities.' He also noted continued supplies of weapons to the warring parties from outside the country, including more advanced arms.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-chief-warns-of-mass-deaths-from-famine-in-sudan/7990219.html	2025-02-27T08:35:57-08:00	
Outcry builds as Thailand deports Uyghurs to China after 10 years in detention	BANGKOK — The United Nations led criticism Thursday of Thailand’s government over its deportation to China of 40 Uyghurs held for more than a decade in detention in Bangkok. The deportation came despite warnings that the Uyghurs face persecution and the risk of torture if handed over to Chinese authorities. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk has called the deportation 'a clear violation of international human rights laws and standards.' The deportation 'violates the principle of non-refoulement for which there is a complete prohibition in cases where there is a real risk of torture, ill-treatment, or other irreparable harm upon their return,' Türk said in a statement. Campaigners say the fate of the group, which had been held at an immigration detention center in the Thai capital and unable to apply for asylum in Thailand, highlights a failure of Thai authorities to meet their own human rights commitments — as well as the reach of China to get its allies to act on its behalf. Thailand’s police chief late Thursday confirmed 40 Uyghurs had been sent on a chartered jet to China after images emerged before dawn of several police trucks with blacked-out windows rushing from the detention center to the airport. 'The Chinese government sent a letter to the Thai government stating their intention to look after the safety of this group of Uyghur people,' Police General Kitrat Phanphet told reporters. 'They reiterated that they will sincerely take care of their safety, their accommodation, as well as allow their family members of these Uyghurs to welcome them home,' he said. Uyghurs in China Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority from China’s remote western region of Xinjiang, have faced oppression by Beijing that governments, including the United States and U.K., have described as genocide. Since 2017, China has put more than a million Uyghurs into internment camps, according to Amnesty International. In 2022, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said Beijing’s treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang may constitute 'crimes against humanity.' Uyghurs fleeing China to Thailand have long been a delicate issue for the Southeast Asian kingdom. Successive governments have faced intense pressure from Beijing to return them. In July 2015 more than 100 detainees were deported to China against their will. A few weeks later, a bomb blast killed 20 people at a downtown shrine in Bangkok — an attack some security experts have linked to Uyghur diaspora groups. The Thai government has never publicly confirmed that connection. Until Thursday, 53 remaining Uyghurs were languishing in a legal limbo in detention since that bomb attack, despite pleas for asylum. Five died in that time. It was not immediately clear what has happened to the eight who were not confirmed among the 40 sent to China on Thursday. The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok said that '40 Chinese nationals' were deported after a decade detained in Thailand 'due to complex international considerations.' 'This is a formal measure between China and Thailand in combating smuggling and protecting the rights and interests of Chinese citizens in accordance with the laws of both countries,' it said in a statement, promising to return them 'back to their normal lives.' Criticism at home and abroad After years of lobbying, Thailand in January joined the U.N. Human Rights Council for a three-year term. The deportation has raised concerns over Thailand’s priorities. Ruvendrini Menikdiwela, assistant high commissioner for protection at the UNHCR — the UN’s refugee arm — said the deportation of the 40 was a 'clear violation of the principle of non-refoulement' and admonished the Thai government for breaching its 'obligations under international law.' While Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra refused to be drawn into the issue, opposition lawmakers led condemnation. 'Today I feel utterly upset and sad,' Kannavee Suebsang, a member of parliament for the Fair Party who was also a field officer with UNHCR, told parliament. 'But I will not cry for the Uyghur brothers and sisters. … Instead, I will cry for the inhumane handling of this government for pushing these people back to face calamity.' Shinawatra traveled to China earlier this month promising tighter cooperation to crack down on cross-border crimes, principally a massive scam crisis. But concerns have been raised about what other deals may have been struck. Rangsiman Rome, a prominent opposition lawmaker, said, 'Deporting these Uyghurs to China violates the kingdom’s anti-torture law — which is our own domestic law, as well as international law' due to the risks they face in China. Rights campaigners who have urged Thailand to provide sanctuary to the Uyghurs said Thailand has done the 'unthinkable' in sending them back to China, where they can face torture. 'This massive human rights violation blows apart any pretense the Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and her Thai government has made to be a rights-respecting member of the U.N. Human Rights Council,' said Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates. 'The Thai government should resign its seat on the Council to show responsibility for its outrageous and unacceptable action,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/outcry-builds-as-thailand-deports-uyghurs-to-china-after-10-years-in-detention/7990187.html	2025-02-27T07:54:39-08:00	
China flexes military muscle in Indo-Pacific, testing US and allies	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China has held a series of live-fire military drills across the Indo-Pacific region over the past week, from the Taiwan Strait to the Tasman Sea. Analysts say the exercises, which included 'extremely capable' weapons systems, were aimed at testing the United States and regional countries’ responses to military threats. 'China understands there is a strategic window to demonstrate its ability to conduct military exercises [in areas near some U.S. allies] because the bandwidth of the Trump administration is spread quite thin by global issues that it has to deal with,' said Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo's International Christian University. 'These drills are predatory because when China senses gaps, it will move in and fill those vacuums,' he told VOA by phone. On Wednesday, the People’s Liberation Army, or PLA, conducted 'shooting training' in waters 74 kilometers (46 miles) off Taiwan’s southwestern coast, prompting Taipei to deploy military aircraft and naval vessels to monitor the situation. In addition to the 'shooting training,' which Taiwanese authorities said was unannounced and posed threats to commercial flights and shipping, the Chinese military also conducted a 'joint combat readiness drill' in waters and airspace near Taiwan, deploying 45 Chinese military aircraft and 14 naval vessels. 'During this period it even blatantly violated international practice by setting up a drills area in waters about 40 nautical miles (74 kilometers) off the coast ... without prior warning, claiming that it would carry out 'shooting training,'' Taiwan’s defense ministry said in a statement released on Wednesday. While the Chinese defense ministry has yet to comment on the military drills, the Chinese Communist Party’s fourth-ranked official, Wang Huning, 'called for resolute efforts to advance the cause of national reunification' during an annual meeting on works related to Taiwan on Tuesday. During the Chinese defense ministry’s monthly press conference Thursday, spokesperson Wu Qian described the 'shooting training' near Taiwan as 'routine drills.' He added that Taiwanese authorities’ criticism was 'pure hype.' 'We request that they stop playing this kind of game to attract interest,' he said. Gulf of Tonkin and Tasman Sea In addition to Taiwan, the PLA conducted live-fire drills in the Gulf of Tonkin near Vietnam and the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. The live-fire drills carried out by three Chinese naval vessels in the Tasman Sea prompted Canberra and Wellington to express serious concerns. New Zealand’s defense minister, Judith Collins, said the Chinese vessels were equipped with 'extremely capable' weapons, such as anti-ship ballistic missiles that could potentially hit Australia. 'We’ve certainly never seen a task group of this capability undertaking this sort of work. It’s certainly a change,' she told Radio New Zealand on Monday, adding that the Chinese military didn’t inform Wellington about the planned exercises. Meanwhile, New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during a meeting in Beijing that the naval drills were 'a failure' in the bilateral relationship and Wellington hopes it could be 'corrected into the future.' Despite concerns expressed by New Zealand and Australia, the Chinese defense ministry said Canberra 'has unjustly criticized China and deliberately exaggerated the issue, and we are astonished and strongly dissatisfied with this.' ‘Disruptive and destabilizing’ Some experts describe the Chinese live-fire drills as 'disruptive and destabilizing' and say the activities show Beijing has no intention of improving relations with countries in the Indo-Pacific region through dialogue. 'It’s difficult to fathom why China would conduct military-to-military dialogue with Australia after a five-year gap and then conduct live-fire exercises as far from China’s shores,' Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former Pentagon official, told VOA by phone. 'It sends a very mixed signal and the message is that China is choosing violence, not peace,' he added. Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in East Asia at King's College London, said these exercises also reflect 'a great sense of maturity' in the Chinese military’s capabilities. 'They've been able to conduct repeated exercise on top of a very intense daily activity, particularly in areas around Taiwan,' he told VOA by phone. While regional countries are alarmed by the Chinese military drills, Thompson said they need to recognize that their 'diplomatic efforts' have failed to deter China’s aggression and start investing more in their defense capabilities. 'For these countries to ensure their security, they need to invest much more heavily in their own defense,' he told VOA. In an interview with New Zealand’s 1News on Sunday, New Zealand’s Collins said the country needed to 'spend a lot more' in defense. In addition to increasing defense spending, Nagy in Japan said regional countries should consider documenting and highlighting the Chinese military’s aggressive behavior in their nearby areas. Efforts to document and 'share activities that the Chinese military engages in with the global community does put China in a position where they have to explain their bad behavior, which is not something they do very well,' he told VOA. Since the Trump administration remains focused on facilitating peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, Patalano said he expects China to keep conducting 'short-term, not-too-much-pre-announced' military exercises across the Indo-Pacific in the coming months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-flexes-military-muscle-in-indo-pacific-testing-us-and-allies/7990197.html	2025-02-27T07:44:12-08:00	
Andrew Tate, accused of rape, trafficking in Romania, leaves for US	BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — Influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who are charged with human trafficking in Romania, left for the United States after authorities lifted travel restrictions imposed as part of the case, an official said Thursday. The brothers — who are dual U.S.-British citizens and have millions of online followers — were arrested in late 2022 and indicted last year on charges they participated in a criminal ring that lured women to Romania, where they were sexually exploited. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny the allegations. In December, a court ruled that the case couldn’t go to trial because of multiple legal and procedural irregularities on the part of the prosecutors. The case, however, remained open, and there is also another ongoing investigation against them in Romania. Romania’s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, said in a statement Thursday that prosecutors approved a request to change the travel restrictions on the Tates but didn't say who made the request. The brothers are still required to appear before judicial authorities when summoned. 'The defendants have been warned that deliberately violating these obligations may result in judicial control being replaced with a stricter deprivation of liberty measure,' the statement said. Andrew Tate, 38, a former professional kickboxer and self-described misogynist who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X, has repeatedly claimed that prosecutors in Romania have no evidence against him and that there is a political conspiracy to silence him. He and Tristan Tate, 36, are vocal supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump. The Tates’ departure came after Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu said this month that an official in the Trump administration expressed interest in the brothers’ case at the Munich Security Conference. The minister insisted no pressure was applied to lift restrictions on the Tates after a Financial Times report on the meeting caused a stir in Romania. The Bucharest Court of Appeal’s decision that the Tate case could not proceed was a huge setback for DIICOT, but it didn’t mean the defendants could walk free, and the case hasn’t been closed. Last August, DIICOT also launched a second case against the brothers, investigating allegations of human trafficking, the trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor, influencing statements and money laundering. They have denied those charges as well. The Tate brothers’ legal battles aren't limited to Romania. Late last year, a U.K. court ruled that police can seize more than $3.3 million to cover years of unpaid taxes from the pair and freeze some of their accounts. Andrew Tate called it 'outright theft' and said it was 'a coordinated attack on anyone who dares to challenge the system.' In March, the Tate brothers appeared at the Bucharest Court of Appeal in a separate case after U.K. authorities issued arrest warrants over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to 2012-2015. The appeals court granted the U.K. request to extradite the Tates, but only after legal proceedings in Romania have concluded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/andrew-tate-accused-of-rape-trafficking-in-romania-leaves-for-us/7990115.html	2025-02-27T06:49:21-08:00	
Imprisoned Kurdish leader urges PKK to disarm and disband as part of peace effort with Turkey	Istanbul — Imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan called on his militant group on Thursday to lay down its arms and dissolve as part of a new bid to end a four-decade long conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. In a message from his prison on an island off Istanbul on Thursday, Ocalan said the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, should hold a congress and decide to disband. 'Convene your congress and make a decision. All groups must lay their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself,' Ocalan said, according to a message that was relayed by pro-Kurdish party politicians who visited Ocalan earlier in the day. Ocalan's momentous announcement is part of a new effort for peace between the group and the Turkish state, that was initiated in October by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli. The far-right politician suggested Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands. Ocalan, 75, has been imprisoned on the island of Imrali, off Istanbul, since 1999 after being convicted of treason. Despite his incarceration, he continues to wield significant influence over the PKK. The group's leadership is widely expected to heed any call Ocalan makes, although some factions within the group could resist, analysts say. The peace effort comes at a time when Erdogan may need support from the DEM party in parliament to enact a new constitution that could allow him to stay in power. The Turkish Constitution doesn't allow Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003 as prime minister and later as president, to run for office again unless an early election is called — something that would also require the support of the pro-Kurdish party. The DEM party has long pressed for greater democracy in Turkey and rights for the country's Kurdish population, and also to improve conditions for the imprisoned Ocalan. Founded by Ocalan in 1978, the PKK has led an insurgency in Turkey's southeast since 1984. The group is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies. Previous peace efforts with the PKK have ended with failure — the most recent in 2015. Even amid the latest peace efforts, Erdogan's government has widened a crackdown on the opposition, arresting journalists and politicians. Several elected Kurdish mayors have been ousted from office and replaced with state-appointed officials. Thursday's meeting was the third time DEM party officials have met with Ocalan as part of the peace efforts. The officials have also met with Selahattin Demirtas, an imprisoned former pro-Kurdish party leader, and traveled to Iraq for talks with Kurdish leaders there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/imprisoned-kurdish-leader-urges-pkk-to-disarm-and-disband-as-part-of-peace-effort-with-turkey/7990140.html	2025-02-27T06:47:18-08:00	
On Moscow streets, Russians welcome thaw in relations with Washington	Anticipation is growing in Russia for a summit - yet to be scheduled - between U.S. President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. On the streets of Moscow, many Russians welcome what they see as a thaw in relations with Washington, and what some hope is the beginning of the end of their country's isolation from the West. Jonathan Spier narrates this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-moscow-streets-russians-welcome-thaw-in-relations-with-washington/7990118.html	2025-02-27T06:40:27-08:00	
Ethiopia PM visits Somalia as neighbors try to improve relations	Washington — Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed met with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in Mogadishu Thursday, as their nations try to mend relations strained by Ethiopia’s deal for sea access with Somaliland – a breakaway republic Somalia considers part of its territory. Abiy flew into the Somali capital Thursday, as Somali forces, backed by African Union peacekeepers, beefed up security at Mogadishu’s Aden Ade International Airport and along the road leading to the presidential place. Mogadishu’s main roads were closed, and vehicular traffic was restricted. VOA reporters said that Ethiopian flags were flying at the airport, as the Somali National Music Band and traditional folklore dancers greeted Abiy at the airport. After meeting at the Somali presidential palace, the two leaders issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to enhancing cooperation for mutual benefit. 'This visit follows consecutive engagements over the past few months and reinforces the normalization of bilateral relations between the two nations,' the statement said. 'Ethiopia and Somalia are interdependent nations with a common destiny and a shared vision for regional stability and prosperity.' The leaders also welcomed the start of technical talks in Turkey’s capital aimed at resolving the standoff over the Ethiopian-Somaliland deal. Under that deal, landlocked Ethiopia would lease 20 kilometers of Somaliland seafront for 50 years, in return for diplomatic recognition of Somaliland. Even though Somaliland has run its affairs separate from Somalia since 1991, no country has recognized it as an independent nation, in part due to ardent opposition from Somalia. Details of the agreement have not been made public, but the Somali government said Ethiopia's plan was to build a naval base. After months of high diplomatic tension, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan mediated an agreement between Somalia and Ethiopia in December in which the countries reaffirmed their respect for each other’s sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity. The Ankara agreement calls for Somalia to give Ethiopia access to a commercial port. Details are being discussed at the technical talks. However, Ethiopia has not officially left the Somaliland deal. In January, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud paid a surprise visit to Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, where he met with the Ethiopian prime minister. Analysts say that such high-profile visits are aimed at 'confidence building' before Turkish President Erdogan makes a planned visit to Somalia and Ethiopia some time this year. 'Somalia and Ethiopian leaders need to build confidence and encourage the technical talks aimed at reaching a potential agreement that upholds Somalia’s territorial integrity while allowing Ethiopia access to the sea under the Ankara Agreement,' said Virginia-based analyst Abdiqafar Abdi Wardhere. Meanwhile, this week an Ethiopian delegation led by military chief Field Marshal Birhanu Jula, accompanied by Ethiopian intelligence chief Redwan Hussien, met with Somali officials in Mogadishu, where the two sides signed an agreement that secured the participation of Ethiopian troops in the new African Union mission in Somalia, known as AUSSOM.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-pm-visits-somalia-as-neighbors-try-to-improve-relations/7990067.html	2025-02-27T06:00:18-08:00

Cybercrime laws risk 'steady criminalization' of journalists, analysts warn	washington — As more countries enact cybercrime legislation, analysts warn that efforts to combat legitimate concerns could also allow for easier targeting of critics. Analysts have warned that amendments in Pakistan and Myanmar in recent months could add to already repressive environments. Some point to Nigeria as a test case. Since passing its cybercrime law in 2015, watchdogs have documented 29 cases of journalists being charged, including four who were charged in a Lagos court in September. 'What we are seeing is a steady criminalization of journalists around the world, and it’s a huge threat to press freedom,' said Jonathan Rozen, a senior researcher at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. In Pakistan, the government in January amended the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act of 2016 (PECA). Authorities said the changes would curb cybercrime, online harassment and the spread of hateful content that could instigate violence. Pakistan’s federal information minister, Attaullah Tarar, said the law was needed 'to regulate social media.' 'Countries across the world have some codes or standards under which social media operate, but there was none in our country,' he told reporters last month. The amendment led to protests by journalists and civil society, who said the changes would make it easy for authorities to prosecute people whose opinions are not in line with those of the government. Analysts pointed to broad terms, including definitions of 'unlawful' content and 'person,' with the latter now including state institutions and corporations. Another amendment proposed the creation of a Digital Rights Protection Authority that can remove content from social media platforms. Critics and media rights groups worry this could expose journalists and social media users to increased restrictions and legal action, restrict dissent and open doors for the powerful military establishment to target and harass civilians. Before the reforms, watchdogs recorded more than 200 cases of journalists being investigated since PECA was passed. Joshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the changes in Pakistan’s cybercrime law would make an 'already repressive online atmosphere even worse and restrictive.' Pakistan’s military has imposed a 'much tougher crackdown' in the past year, said Kurlantzick. 'They have gone well out of their way to target individuals, civil rights activists, journalists, and use anti-freedom laws to target those people, and often put them in jail,' he said. Pakistan’s Ministry of Information did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. Similar concerns are shared in Myanmar, where the junta last July passed an expansive cybercrime law. The law targeted virtual private networks, or VPNs, that allow internet users to circumvent blocked websites and censorship. The junta said the new law was needed to protect against cyberattacks and cybercrimes that could threaten the country's stability. Since seizing power in a coup in February 2021, Myanmar’s military has revoked broadcast licenses, blocked access to websites and jailed journalists. The country is the third worst jailer of journalists, with 35 detained, according to the latest CPJ data. An expert with the Myanmar Internet Project, a digital rights group, told VOA at the time that the law was more focused on suppressing rights than protecting the public. 'All the provisions of the law are designed to suppress rather than protect the public,' the expert, who asked to be identified only as U Han, said. 'We believe that the junta will use this bill as a weapon prepared for this purpose.' Kurlantzick, however, believes the military would struggle to restrict the online space. 'Myanmar’s military has no power to restrict online dissent anymore, as 70% of the country is in control of the opposition groups,' he said. 'The government, which can’t provide power, water or other services even in the biggest cities, doesn’t have the ability to crack down on the internet now.' In Nigeria, the 2015 Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act has been used to file cases against journalists who investigate corruption. But the government has made some reforms based on civil society and press freedom group recommendations. Two sections of the cybercrime law had been of particular concern because of the 'very broad and vague wording' that allowed the arrest of journalists for sending what were deemed 'annoying' or 'defamatory' messages, said CPJ’s Rozen. Changes made in 2024 narrowed the language. 'It constrained the opportunity for authorities to arrest journalists only if the messages were knowingly false, or if it was causing a breakdown of law or causing a threat to life,' said Rozen, who added that other areas remain 'overly broad and could be abused.' One section he cited allows for law enforcement to access information from service providers without a court order. Nigeria’s police have used this to access data of journalists, said Rozen, noting that four journalists are currently facing prosecution under the cybercrime act. Rozen agrees that 'misinformation and disinformation are challenges for society, but what is being observed,' he said, 'is a criminalization of journalists on accusations that they are sharing false information, and in many cases, this is used as a shorthand to smother or crush' dissenting voices. With more reporting and publishing taking place online, the tools some governments use to suppress journalists are adapting to the modernization of the industry, Rozen said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cybercrime-laws-risk-steady-criminalization-of-journalists-analysts-warn/7989674.html	2025-02-27T05:13:04-08:00	
US, Russian diplomats meet to discuss embassy operations	U.S. and Russian diplomats met Thursday in Istanbul for talks about the operations of their respective embassies in Moscow and Washington. The meeting is the latest in a series of engagements between the two sides, including a phone call earlier this month between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Working to restore U.S.-Russia relations was on the agenda last week for talks between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The U.S. State Department said after those talks in Riyadh that the two sides had agreed to create 'a consultation mechanism to address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective diplomatic missions.' Diplomatic relations between Russia and the United States declined during the past decade, with both sides expelling diplomats.

Actor Gene Hackman, wife found dead at New Mexico home	Oscar-winning American actor Gene Hackman and his wife were found dead Wednesday at their home in the southwestern U.S. state of New Mexico. Authorities said they were investigating what caused their deaths but that foul play was not suspected as a factor. Authorities said they went to the home to do a welfare check and found the 95-year-old Hackman and his wife, 64-year-old pianist Betsy Arakawa, dead along with their dog. Hackman had a lengthy career on stage and screen, including appearing in Broadway shows, on television and in more than 80 films. He won an Oscar for best actor for his role in the 1971 film The French Connection and a best supporting Oscar for the 1992 film Unforgiven. Hackman’s resume featured three other Oscar nominations, including his breakout role in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 as well as I Never Sang for My Father in 1970 and Mississippi Burning in 1988. His work crossed genres as he appeared in action movies, thrillers and offbeat comedies. In addition to his award-nominated works, he was also known for roles in films such as The Poseidon Adventure, Young Frankenstein, Superman, Hoosiers, The Birdcage, and The Royal Tenenbaums. His last film was Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.

Australia discusses security, aid with Vanuatu amid competition with China	SYDNEY — Australia pledged to remain the South Pacific's largest aid donor on Thursday during security and economic talks with Vanuatu, as Canberra reviews the potential Pacific impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign aid cuts. 'Australia will always be there for you,' Australia's Minister for International Development Pat Conroy told a news conference in the Vanuatu capital Port Vila. Conroy, who held talks with Vanuatu Prime Minister Jotham Napat, pledged another $3.2 million in direct budget support for Vanuatu after an earthquake in December flattened commercial buildings and killed 16 people. 'There is geostrategic competition occurring in the Pacific as great powers get interested in our region, but we are proud to be the biggest development partner,' Conroy said. Australia was there 'well before any other countries, be it the United States or China, became interested in the Pacific,' he added. China is the second-biggest bilateral donor to the Pacific Islands after Australia, a Lowy Institute report on aid to the region found in November 2024. Australia and its main security ally the United States have been concerned at China's growing influence in the South Pacific and Trump's order to cut foreign aid has worried the region's small island nations. Australian officials said Canberra was reviewing any potential impact from the Trump administration's funding cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). In recent years Vanuatu has moved closer to China, which is its largest external creditor after a decade of infrastructure loans for construction including a new president's office last year. China's navy, which upset Canberra by holding live fire drills in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand in recent days, has made repeated port visits to Vanuatu, where Beijing funded the expansion of a wharf. A security treaty signed by Australia and Vanuatu in 2022 has not yet been ratified by Vanuatu's parliament, which has experienced a period of high political instability. Napat is the fourth prime minister since 2022. Napat told reporters he had discussed economic cooperation and security with Australia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-discusses-security-aid-with-vanuatu-amid-competition-with-china/7989847.html	2025-02-27T01:25:35-08:00	
Sri Lanka reports massive tolls in human-elephant conflicts	COLOMBO, SRI LANKA — Sri Lanka vowed Thursday to urgently tackle costly clashes between villagers and wild elephants after reporting the deaths of nearly 1,200 people and more than 3,500 animals in a decade. Environment minister Dammika Patabendi told parliament that they will build more electrified fences and deploy additional staff to help reduce elephant raids on villages near wildlife sanctuaries. 'We are allocating more money to reduce the human-elephant conflict, and are hopeful that within a short period of time we will be able to mitigate the situation,' Patabendi said. Between 2015 and 2024, 1,195 people and 3,484 wild elephants were killed, he said. In January this year, three more people and 43 elephants were killed. Opposition legislator Nalin Bandara said the toll was 'shocking' and urged authorities to protect people, while also ensuring that the wild animals were not harmed. He noted that disposing of the carcasses of wild elephants had cost the state about $11.6 million over a decade, while compensation to victims of elephant attacks was about $4 million over the same period. Killing or harming elephants is a criminal offense in Sri Lanka, which has an estimated 7,000 wild elephants, which are considered a national treasure, partly due to their significance in Buddhist culture. However, the massacre continues as desperate farmers struggle with elephants raiding their crops and destroying livelihoods. Many elephants have been electrocuted, shot and poisoned. Sometimes fruits packed with explosives are used to injure the animals, often ending in painful deaths. Elephants are also killed by trains running through their habitats. Seven elephants, including four calves, were killed when they were run over by an express train in the island's eastern Habarana region a week ago. It was the worst such accident recorded in the country. Asian elephants are recognized as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. An estimated 26,000 of them live in the wild, mostly in India, surviving for an average of 60-70 years outside captivity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-reports-massive-tolls-in-human-elephant-conflicts/7989844.html	2025-02-27T01:11:12-08:00	
School helps migrants in Mauritania; can it keep them from leaving for Europe?	NOUADHIBOU, MAURITANIA — Eager students from throughout west Africa raise their hands as teachers guide them through math and classical Arabic. Then they race outdoors to meet their parents, who clean houses, drive informal taxis or gut sardines in Chinese factories. Outside, government billboards urge these families and others to fight 'migrant smuggling,' showing overcrowded boats navigating the Atlantic's thrashing waves. Inside, posters warn the ocean can be deadly. Such messaging is hard to escape in Nouadhibou, Mauritania's second-largest city and a launch point on an increasingly popular migrant route toward Europe. As authorities strengthen security measures on long-established routes, migrants are resorting to longer, more perilous ones. From Mauritania, they risk hundreds of kilometers of sea and howling winds to reach Spain's Canary Islands. The route puts new strain on this port city of 177,000 people at the edge of the Sahara. Outdated infrastructure and unpaved roads have not kept pace as European and Chinese investment pours into the fishing industry, and as migrants and their children arrive from as far away as Syria and Pakistan. The school for children of migrants and refugees, set up in 2018 as an early response to the growing need, is the kind of program envisioned as part of the $219 million accord the European Union and Mauritania brokered last year. The deal — one of several that Europe has signed with neighboring states to deter migration — funds border patrol, development aid and programs supporting refugees, asylum-seekers and host communities. It's a response to rising alarm and anti-migration politics in Europe. Nearly 47,000 migrants arrived on boats in the Canaries last year, a record 'fueled by departures from Mauritania, even as flows from other departure points declined,' according to the EU border agency Frontex. Almost 6,000 were unaccompanied children under 18. Tracking deaths at sea is difficult, but the Spanish nonprofit Walking Borders says at least 6,800 people died or went missing while attempting the crossing last year. Conditions are so harsh that boats drifting off course can end up in Brazil or the Caribbean. Though many praise initiatives that fulfill migrants and refugees' overlooked needs, few believe they will be effective in discouraging departures for Europe — even the head of the group that runs the Nouadhibou school. 'We can't stop migration,' said Amsatou Vepouyoum, president of the Organization for the Support of Migrants and Refugees, the city's leading migrant aid group. 'But through raising awareness, we want to improve the conditions under which people leave.' Preparing for an uncertain future The organization years ago surveyed the migrant population and found that education was one of the biggest barriers to integration in Mauritania. Bill Van Esveld, a children's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that's true around the world. Many countries that migrants and refugees pass through erect bureaucratic hurdles to school access, he said. 'Without literacy or numeracy, how can you advocate for yourself as someone who has human rights in today's world?' Van Esveld said. Mauritania's Education Ministry in a January directive affirmed that refugee children have the right to attend public school. But that hasn't applied for many migrants who don't qualify as refugees and face difficulty enrolling because they lack birth certificates, residency papers or school records. The school for Nouadhibou's migrant and refugee children ages 5 to 12 runs parallel to Mauritania's school system and teaches a similar curriculum as well as Arabic, aiming to integrate children into public classrooms by sixth grade. Families often don't plan to stay in Mauritania, but parents still describe the school as a lifeline for kids' futures, wherever they will be. 'Sometimes life's circumstances leave you somewhere, so you adapt, and what ends up happening leads you to stay,' Vepouyoum said. Weak oversight and worried parents From Europe's perspective, funneling aid toward such initiatives is part of a larger effort to persuade people not to migrate. Some experts say it also demonstrates a disconnect between political goals and on-the-ground realities. 'The European Union always announces these big sums, but it's very difficult to figure out how the money is actually spent,' said Ulf Laessing, the Sahel program director at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a German think tank. Both the school and the Organization for the Support of Migrants and Refugees have had their work highlighted by the EU and member states, along with United Nations agencies. None have said how much money they have spent on the school or on other programs aimed at migrants in Mauritania. The school said it also charges students based on what families can afford so it can pay rent on its two-story cinderblock building and utilities, Vepouyoum said. But four parents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they worried about their children getting kicked out, said the baseline monthly fee of $15 per child was too much. 'If you can't pay, they'll kick you out,' a father of two students from Mali said. He said many parents want to give children opportunities they lacked in their home countries. He has heard from other parents that enrolling in school is easier in the Canary Islands, but limited access to education is also a problem there. The school in Nouadhibou says it has educated over 500 students. It has not tracked the number who continue on toward Europe. Pressures to move on Times are changing in Nouadhibou. Community leaders and business owners worry that increasing competition for jobs has fueled suspicion toward foreign-born communities. That includes workers from neighboring Senegal and Mali who settled in the city years ago. Aid groups say outreach is easier among long-term migrants because newcomers worry about drawing attention to themselves — sometimes because they're looking for smugglers to help them move on, said Kader Konate, a community leader from Mali. Many migrants say they just need help. 'We are doing this because we feel have no other choice,' Boureima Maiga said. The 29-year-old graduate with a teaching degree fled Mali as extremist violence escalated. On many days, he waits at the Nouadhibou port alongside hundreds of other migrants, hoping for work in fish factory 'cold rooms.' But without residency or work visas, they are often turned away, or have pay withheld — an abuse they fear would bring retaliation if reported. Maiga feels trapped in a country where deep racial divisions between Arab and Black Africans make integration nearly impossible, with discrimination by employers widespread.

Mauritius, La Reunion brace for 'dangerous' cyclone	PORT LOUIS, MAURITIUS — The Indian Ocean tourist meccas of Mauritius and La Reunion braced Thursday for an intense tropical storm, Cyclone Garance, which was labelled a 'direct threat' to the islands. Mauritius shut its main airport the previous day, while the nearby French island of La Reunion was set to do the same on Thursday. Garance was labeled a class 3 cyclone by Mauritius -- the second-highest alert level -- with gusts of up to 70 kph expected. The Mauritius Meteorological Service said the cyclone was 310 kilometers northwest of the island and had increased to become an 'intense tropical storm.' The cyclone is 'dangerously approaching Mauritius and constitutes a direct threat,' it said, adding that flooding was expected. Garance was heading east but has curved south to pass between Mauritius and the French island of La Reunion, whose local prefect said it was set to declare a red alert and close its airport on Thursday. The peak intensity of the cyclone was expected late in the day or into the night, French weather service Meteo-France said. The 'expected scenario is a direct impact on Reunion Island,' said Celine Jauffray, of Meteo-France, on Wednesday, but said its intensity and path could still change. Gusts of more than 150 kph were expected on the highest points of La Reunion, accompanied by heavy rain and rough seas. A red alert would require the population to stay indoors and only emergency services could move around the island. Schools were already closed from Wednesday afternoon. Air Mauritius said all flights had been suspended 'until further notice.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mauritius-la-reunion-brace-for-dangerous-cyclone/7989831.html	2025-02-27T00:10:20-08:00	
Japan's births fell to record low in 2024	TOKYO — The number of babies born in Japan fell to a record low of 720,988 in 2024 for a ninth consecutive year of decline, the health ministry said on Thursday, underscoring the rapid aging and dwindling of the population. Births were down 5% on the year, despite measures in 2023 by former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government to boost child-bearing, while a record number of 1.62 million deaths meant that more than two people died for every new baby born. Although the fertility rate in neighboring South Korea rose in 2024 for the first time in nine years, thanks to measures to spur young people to marry and have children, the trend in Japan has yet to show an upturn. Behind Japan's childbirth decline are fewer marriages in recent years, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, said Takumi Fujinami, an economist at the Japan Research Institute. Although the number of marriages edged up 2.2% to 499,999 in 2024, that came only after steep declines, such as a plunge of 12.7% in 2020. 'The impact could linger on in 2025 as well,' Fujinami said. Unlike some Western countries, only a few of every 100 babies in Japan are born out of wedlock, suggesting a stronger correlation between marriages and births. News this week that South Korea's fertility rate rose to 0.75 in 2024 from 0.72 in 2023 suggested the neighboring nation's demographic crisis might have turned a corner. In Japan, the most recent data shows the corresponding figure for the average number of babies a woman is expected to have during her reproductive life came in at 1.20 in 2023. While it was too early for any meaningful comparison between the figures in the two countries, Fujinami warned, it was important for both to improve job opportunities and close the gender gap to encourage young people to marry and have children. Experts believe South Korea's positive turn resulted from government support in the three areas of work-family balance, childcare and housing, as well as a campaign for businesses to nudge employees towards parenthood.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-births-fell-to-record-low-in-2024/7989816.html	2025-02-26T22:50:14-08:00	
North Korea behind $1.5 billion crypto theft, FBI says	WASHINGTON — The U.S. FBI on Wednesday accused North Korea of being behind the theft of $1.5 billion worth of digital assets last week, the largest crypto heist in history. '(North Korea) was responsible for the theft of approximately $1.5 billion in virtual assets from cryptocurrency exchange, Bybit,' the FBI said in a public service announcement. The bureau said a group called TraderTraitor, also known as the Lazarus Group, was behind the theft. It said they were 'proceeding rapidly and have converted some of the stolen assets to Bitcoin and other virtual assets dispersed across thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains.' 'It is expected these assets will be further laundered and eventually converted to fiat currency,' the FBI added. Lazarus Group gained notoriety a decade ago when it was accused of hacking into Sony Pictures as revenge for The Interview, a film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea's cyber-warfare program dates back to at least the mid-1990s. It has since grown to a 6,000-strong cyber-warfare unit known as Bureau 121 that operates from several countries, according to a 2020 U.S. military report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-behind-1-5-billion-crypto-theft-fbi-says/7989814.html	2025-02-26T22:26:23-08:00	
Vietnam jails leading journalist over Facebook posts	HANOI, VIETNAM — A Vietnamese court on Thursday sentenced a leading independent journalist to 30 months in prison over Facebook posts that criticized the government, state media said. Huy Duc worked for influential state-run newspapers before authoring one of Vietnam's most popular blogs and Facebook accounts, where he criticized the country's communist leaders on issues such as corruption, media control and relations with China. The court in Hanoi convicted the 63-year-old of 'abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state' through posting 13 articles on Facebook, according to Vietnam News Agency. The trial lasted just a few hours. 'These articles have a large number of interactions, comments, and shares, causing negative impacts on social order and safety,' the indictment read, according to state media. Shortly before his arrest last June, Huy Duc -- which is the journalist's pen name -- took aim online at Vietnam's most powerful leader To Lam, as well as his predecessor Nguyen Phu Trong. It is unclear if the charges related to these particular posts. Vietnam, a one-party state, has no free media and clamps down hard on any dissent. It is one of the world's top jailers of journalists, according to the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) press freedom campaign group. The trial in Hanoi came just months after blogger Duong Van Thai -- who had almost 120,000 followers on YouTube, where he regularly recorded livestreams critical of the government -- was jailed for 12 years on charges of publishing anti-state information. In January, a prominent former lawyer was jailed for three years over Facebook posts. 'Invaluable source of information' Huy Duc, whose real name is Truong Huy San, is a former senior army lieutenant. He was fired from a state news outlet in 2009 for criticizing past actions by Vietnam's former communist ally, the Soviet Union. Huy Duc spent a year at Harvard University on a Nieman Fellowship in 2012. During his time abroad, his account of life in Vietnam after the end of the war with the United States, The Winning Side, was published. RSF said previously that his articles were 'an invaluable source of information enabling the Vietnamese public to access censored information by the Hanoi regime.' Rights campaigners say the government has in recent years stepped up a crackdown on civil society. 'No country can develop sustainably based on fear,' Huy Duc wrote on Facebook in May, the month before he was arrested. In December, Vietnam enacted new rules requiring Facebook and TikTok to verify user identities and hand over data to authorities. Under 'Decree 147,' all tech giants operating in Vietnam must verify user accounts by phone numbers or Vietnamese identification numbers and store that information alongside their full name and date of birth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-jails-leading-journalist-over-facebook-posts/7989811.html	2025-02-26T22:16:36-08:00	
US Supreme Court pauses federal judge's order on Trump administration foreign aid funding	U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday paused a federal judge's order requiring President Donald Trump's administration to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients. Roberts issued an interim order placing on hold Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali's action that had imposed a deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday night. Roberts provided no rationale for the order, known as an administrative stay, which will give the court additional time to consider the administration's more formal request to block Ali's ruling. Roberts asked for a response from the plaintiffs -- organizations that contract with or receive grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department -- by noon on Friday. The order came after Trump's administration said in a court filing on Wednesday it had made final decisions terminating most U.S. foreign aid contracts and grants, while maintaining that it cannot meet Ali's court-ordered deadline. The administration is cutting more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development's foreign aid contracts and over $58 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, a State Department spokesperson said separately, calling the cuts part of Trump's 'America First agenda.' The foreign aid funding dispute arose from a pair of lawsuits brought by the aid organizations, alleging that the agencies have illegally frozen all foreign aid payments. The Trump administration has kept those payments largely frozen despite a Feb. 13 temporary restraining order from Ali that they be released, and multiple subsequent orders that the administration comply, culminating in the Wednesday night deadline. Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department have maintained that the administration has a right to suspend its agreements while it reviews them to determine whether they comply with administration policy. That review is now complete, the administration said in its new filing. It said USAID has made final decisions to cancel nearly 5,800 awards, while keeping more than 500, and that the State Department has canceled about 4,100 awards, while keeping about 2,700. An administration official said in an earlier court filing that grounds for terminating contracts include that they were related to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, or were deemed wasteful. Trump has taken a hard line on programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, signing an executive order in his second day in office last month directing federal agency chiefs to dismantle DEI policies. The administration said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had ordered that past-due invoices from the plaintiffs for work before Jan. 24, when the payment freeze began, to be 'expedited for payment without the ordinary vetting procedures, in a good-faith effort to comply' with Ali's order. It said that while some money would be paid on Wednesday, full payments could take weeks. Funding freeze undermines relief efforts Trump, a Republican, ordered a 90-day pause on all foreign aid on his first day in office last month. That order, and ensuing stop-work orders halting USAID operations around the world, have jeopardized the delivery of life-saving food and medical aid, throwing global humanitarian relief efforts into chaos. USAID administers some 60% of U.S. foreign assistance and disbursed $43.79 billion in fiscal 2023. According to a Congressional Research Service report this month, its workforce of 10,000, of which about two-thirds serves overseas, assisted about 130 countries. Trump's administration on Sunday said it was placing all but leaders and critical staff at USAID on paid administrative leave and eliminating 1,600 positions. Employee unions have sued to challenge the cuts, though a judge last week allowed them to go ahead. Ali, who was appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, former President Joe Biden, issued his temporary restraining order to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs while he considers their claims. The plaintiffs allege Trump has exceeded his authority under federal law and the U.S. Constitution by effectively dismantling an independent agency and canceling spending authorized by Congress. The plaintiffs have said the administration has not done anything to comply with the restraining order, and some have said they will shut down within days if they are not paid. 'The lengths that the government is willing to go to flout a court order, all for the goal of ending life-saving humanitarian assistance, is staggering,' said Allison Zieve, a lawyer representing two plaintiffs, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, on Wednesday. Other plaintiffs include international development company DAI Global and refugee assistance organization HIAS. Both Ali and a Rhode Island federal judge in a separate case over a broader federal payment freeze have castigated the Trump administration for failing to follow their orders. The administration in both cases has maintained it is trying in good faith to interpret and comply with the orders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-pauses-federal-judge-s-order-on-trump-administration-foreign-aid-funding/7989808.html	2025-02-26T22:07:10-08:00	
Transgender US service members to be separated from military, Pentagon memo shows	WASHINGTON — Transgender service members will be separated from the U.S. military unless they receive an exemption, according to a Pentagon memo filed in court on Wednesday, essentially banning them from joining or serving in the military. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month that took aim at transgender troops in a personal way -- at one point saying that a man identifying as a woman was 'not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.' This month, the Pentagon had said that the U.S. military will no longer allow transgender individuals to join and will stop performing or facilitating procedures associated with gender transition for service members. Wednesday's late-evening memo goes further. The memo said that the Pentagon must create a procedure to identify troops who are transgender within 30 days and then within 30 days of that, must separate them from the military. 'It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for service member readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,' said the memo, dated Feb. 26. 'This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria or who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria,' it added. The military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, according to Department of Defense data. Although transgender rights advocates say there are as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number is in the low thousands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/transgender-us-service-members-to-be-separated-from-military-pentagon-memo-shows-/7989803.html	2025-02-26T21:54:17-08:00	
North Korea opens to a group of international travelers for the 1st time in years	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week, making them the first international travelers to enter the country in five years except for a group of Russian tourists who went to the North last year. The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say. The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb. 20 to Feb. 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country's special economic zone is located. Koryo Tours General Manager Simon Cockerell said the travelers from the U.K., Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China. He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong Un. 'Since January of 2020, the country has been closed to all international tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,' Cockerell said. 'Our first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips,' he added. After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world's most draconian COVID-19 restrictions. But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders. In February 2024, North Korea accepted about 100 Russian tourists, the first foreign nationals to visit the country for sightseeing. That surprised many observers, who thought the first post-pandemic tourists would come from China, North Korea's biggest trading partner and major ally. A total of about 880 Russian tourists visited North Korea throughout 2024, South Korea's Unification Ministry said, citing official Russian data. Chinese group tours to North Korea remain stalled. This signals how much North Korea and Russia have moved closer to each other as the North has supplied weapons and troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Ties between North Korea and China cooled as China showed its reluctance to join a three-way, anti-U.S. alliance with North Korea and Russia, experts say. Before the pandemic, tourism was an easy, legitimate source for foreign currency for North Korea, one of the world's most sanctioned countries because of its nuclear program. North Korea is expected to open a massive tourism site on the east coast in June. In January when President Donald Trump boasted about his ties with Kim Jong Un, he said that 'I think he has tremendous condo capabilities. He's got a lot of shoreline.' That likely refers to the eastern coast site. A return of Chinese tourists would be key to making North Korea's tourism industry lucrative because they represented more than 90% of total international tourists before the pandemic, said Lee Sangkeun, an expert at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea's intelligence agency. He said that in the past, up to 300,000 Chinese tourists visited North Korea annually. 'North Korea has been heavily investing on tourism sites, but there have been not much domestic demand,' Lee said. 'We can assess that North Korea now wants to resume international tourism to bring in many tourists from abroad.' The restrictions that North Korea has typically imposed on foreign travelers — such as requirements that they move with local guides and the banning of photography at sensitive places — will likely hurt its efforts to develop tourism. Lee said that Rason, the eastern coast site and Pyongyang would be the places where North Korea feels it can easily monitor and control foreign tourists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-opens-to-a-group-of-international-travelers-for-the-1st-time-in-years/7989799.html	2025-02-26T21:07:37-08:00

British PM Starmer to meet Trump at the White House	WASHINGTON — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and bilateral trade ties, amid the U.S. leader’s tariff threats on Europe and demands that the continent rely less on Washington for its security. Ahead of their meeting, Trump, who wants NATO members to boost defense spending to 5% of their Gross Domestic Product, reiterated his stance that Europe should 'step up.' He told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that American taxpayers 'shouldn't be footing the bill than – more than the Europeans are paying.' In what appears to be a move to appease Trump, on Tuesday, Starmer announced an unexpected increase in the U.K. defense budget to 2.5% of the nation's GDP by 2027, then to 2.6% the following year. 'This week when I meet President Trump, I will be clear: I want this relationship to go from strength to strength,' Starmer told members of the British Parliament, underscoring what he calls his country’s 'most important bilateral alliance,' with the U.S. Starmer told reporters Tuesday that the increase in defense spending was 'three years in the making,' following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The increase will be funded by cutting Britain’s already depleted foreign aid budget to just 0.3% of the country’s GDP. He acknowledged that the decision to ramp up defense spending was 'accelerated' as Trump moves to negotiate with Moscow without the involvement of Ukraine or Europeans and made clear he is reducing U.S. support for Europe’s security. 'President Trump thinks we should do more, and I agree with him. It chimes with my thinking on this,' Starmer said. He said he also aims to further increase defense spending to 3% in the next Parliament, which will begin in 2029 at the latest after the next general election. A key message for Starmer to reinforce is that Europeans must be part of any discussions on Ukraine, said Gesine Weber, a fellow on the German Marshall Fund’s Geostrategy team. 'Because it would be very odd to have a situation where you have the burden shift to Europeans, but not the strategic responsibility and the strategic reflections,' she told VOA. In 2023, the U.S. spent 3.4% of its GDP on defense, according to U.S. government data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Insititute. European peacekeeping Starmer’s meeting comes on the heels of Emmanuel Macron's White House visit on Monday. The French president has proposed creating a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine as a security guarantee against future Russian aggression, a plan endorsed by Starmer. Under this scenario, the United States 'would do less in normal times, but be available as sort of a backstop,' when a crisis breaks, said Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution. It remains to be seen whether the plan will come to fruition considering the various interests within NATO and European Union, O’Hanlon told VOA. 'The most important thing, do these guys get along? Do they have a common vision?' he said of Trump and Starmer, because that could signal the emergence of a Western strategy to end the war with NATO’s support. 'If that's the case, then we're in a good position to try to promote a negotiation between Russia and Ukraine,' he added. On Wednesday Trump signaled Ukraine should 'forget about' a path toward NATO membership and that it should not expect much from Washington. 'I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much — we’re going to have Europe do that because we’re talking about Europe is their next-door neighbor.' Aside from negotiating with Moscow, Trump is also pushing Kyiv for a deal that would allow American access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals and recoup funds given by the Biden administration to support the country’s war efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet Trump at the White House on Friday. Tariff threats The visit is a challenge for Starmer as he seeks to balance the U.K.'s interests with those of its European allies while engaging with an unpredictable U.S. administration. He is keen to secure favorable terms amid potential U.S. tariffs that could impact British exports as the U.S. hits European countries with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump is threatening more, saying the European Union has been 'very unfair' to America. Starmer is 'in a bit delicate position' as the U.K. is not part of the European Union single market, said GMF’s Weber. 'So for him, the question is basically averting the situation where there are U.S. tariffs and of course also trying to appease Washington in that regard, while he’s also not going on a super confrontational line with the European Union,' she said. British finance minister Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday she was confident that U.S.-U.K. trade and investment would not be derailed amid Trump’s tariff threats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/british-pm-starmer-to-meet-trump-at-the-white-house/7989786.html	2025-02-26T20:05:45-08:00	
Trump $5 million 'gold card' plan sparks immigration confusion	Immigration law experts expressed confusion on Wednesday, the day after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would begin selling a gold card visa for $5 million that would allow wealthy foreigners to live and work in the U.S. and provide them with 'a route to citizenship.' In remarks in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the program would begin in two weeks and replace the EB-5 visa program that allows foreign investors to live and work in the U.S. if they invest in companies that create jobs for Americans. The EB-5 visa program, however, was created by an act of Congress in 1990, and it is unclear whether Trump has the authority to do away with it or to establish a new visa program without congressional action. 'We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,' Trump said. Questions about legality Immigration lawyers flatly disagreed. 'The truth is the president would need Congress to pass an act allowing for this new vehicle,' said Michael Wildes, a practicing immigration law attorney who also teaches the subject at Cardozo Law School in New York City. Wildes, who has represented first lady Melania Trump and members of her family in immigration matters, said that so little information has been made available about the program that it is difficult to gauge how large an impact it is likely to have. The information that has been released, however, reflects the president's approach to issues such as immigration, he said. 'He will treat people with deeper pockets more handsomely than others,' Wildes told VOA. 'This is consistent with his ethic.' 'If the administration is proposing to rework the terms of the EB-5 program, that is blatantly illegal,' Jorge Loweree, managing director of programs and strategy for the American Immigration Council, told VOA. 'The parameters of that program were designed by our legislative branch. The president can’t rewrite them on a whim.' David J. Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, wrote 'Selling green cards is good in theory, but Trump’s specific proposal has some problems.' One, he wrote, is that 'President Trump cannot lawfully eliminate Congress’s EB‑5 investor program.' The White House did not respond to a request for comment from VOA. Oval Office announcement Trump revealed the plan to a group of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, saying that the new offering would be superior to the document currently issued to foreigners with permanent residency status, commonly known as a green card. 'We're going to be selling a gold card,' Trump said. 'You have the green card? This is a gold card. We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges plus. It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card.' The president did not explain what privileges a gold card holder would enjoy that green card holders do not. He also did not explain what he meant by a 'route to citizenship.' Trump said that in addition to wealthy foreigners who want to live in the United States, he believes that U.S. corporations will be willing to buy the cards so that they can hire talented workers from outside the country. 'Companies will pay for people to get in and to have long-term status in the country,' he said. There are already several pathways available to foreigners who want to come work in the U.S. The H1-B visa program allows thousands of skilled workers into the country every year. In addition, there are several visa programs that allow executives of international companies to live and work in the U.S. if they are transferred to a U.S. office or affiliate. EB-5 program targeted Commerce Secretary Lutnick said Tuesday that the administration plans to discontinue the existing EB-5 visa program, which he described as 'full of nonsense, make-believe and fraud.' The EB-5 program provides green card status to foreigners who invest $1,050,000 in companies in the U.S. that create at least 10 jobs. The amount can be lowered to $800,000 if the investment is made in certain types of infrastructure or in parts of the country the government has targeted for economic development. Lutnick appeared to say that the $5 million fee for a gold card would not have to go toward job-creating investment; instead, it would go directly into federal coffers. 'We can use that money to reduce our deficit,' he said. Higher bar for entry Shereen Chen, an immigration attorney who practices in New Jersey, told VOA that for many wealthy foreigners hoping to come to the U.S., the new rules could complicate the process. The current rules include a 'stringent vetting program' to ensure that money invested under the EB-5 program was earned legitimately, Chen said. The process is lengthy and difficult and will only become more so, Chen said, if the amount of money being vetted increases fivefold. The new program would have dire implications for Chinese nationals hoping to come to the U.S. While many Chinese have made use of the EB-5 program, tighter monetary controls in China have made doing so increasingly difficult. 'Right now, it's very hard for Chinese nationals to use the EB-5 program, even at $1,050,000, because it's very hard for them to get money out of China,' Chen said. Common practice The U.S. is far from alone in having policies on its books that allow wealthy foreigners to trade investment for residency privileges. Henley & Partners, a London-based consultancy that advises clients seeking international residency and citizenship options, tracks programs in more than 100 countries that offer some sort of investment-for-residence program. About 30 jurisdictions offer citizenship in exchange for investment, a deal commonly known as a 'golden passport.' In recent years, the European Union has been pressing member states with such programs to eliminate them out of concern that they abet illegal activity such as tax evasion and money laundering.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-5-million-gold-card-plan-sparks-immigration-confusion/7989783.html	2025-02-26T19:45:03-08:00	
Survey: Decline in number of US Christians is leveling off	WASHINGTON — The number of Americans who identify as Christian has declined steadily for years, but that drop shows signs of slowing, according to a new survey Wednesday from the Pew Research Center. The Religious Landscape Study finds 62% of U.S. adults call themselves Christians. While a significant dip from 2007, when 78% of Americans identified as Christian, Pew found the Christian share of the population has remained relatively stable since 2019. The rapid rise of the religiously unaffiliated — the so-called 'nones' — has also reached at least a temporary plateau, according to Pew. Approximately 29% of U.S. adults identify as religiously unaffiliated, including those who are atheist (5%), agnostic (6%) or 'nothing in particular' (19%). 'It's striking to have observed this recent period of stability in American religion after that long period of decline,' said Pew's Gregory Smith, one of the study's co-authors. 'One thing we can't know for sure is whether these short-term signs of stabilization will prove to be a lasting change in the country's religious trajectory.' By some measures, the U.S. remains overwhelmingly spiritual. Many Americans have a supernatural outlook, with 83% believing in God or a universal spirit and 86% believing that people have a soul or spirit. About seven in 10 Americans believe in heaven, hell or both. Young adults are less religious than their elders Despite this widespread spirituality, there are harbingers of future religious decline. Most notably, Pew found a huge age gap, with 46% of the youngest American adults identifying as Christian, compared to 80% of the oldest adults. The youngest adults are also three times more likely than the oldest group to be religiously unaffiliated. 'These kinds of generational differences are a big part of what's driven the long-term declines in American religion,' Smith said. 'As older cohorts of highly religious, older people have passed away, they have been replaced by new cohorts of young adults who are less religious than their parents and grandparents.' Michele Margolis, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist not affiliated with the Pew survey, has studied how religious involvement changes over a lifetime. Young adults frequently move away from religion. 'Then when you get married and have kids, this is a time where scholars have noted that religion is more likely to become important,' Margolis said. Margolis said one question going forward is whether the youngest American adults firmly reject organized religion, or if some of them will return to the religious fold as they age. Between 2007 and 2024, Pew religious landscape studies haven't indicated that Americans are growing more religious as they get older. Smith at Pew said 'something would need to change' to stop the long-term decline of American religion, whether that's adults becoming more religious with age or new generations becoming more religious than their parents. How partisan politics intertwines with religious identity The long-term decline of U.S. Christianity and rise of the 'nones' has occurred across traditions, gender, race, ethnicity, education and region. But it is much more evident among political liberals, according to Pew. The survey shows 51% of liberals claim no religion, up 24 points from 2007. Only 37% of U.S. liberals identify as Christian, down from 62% in 2007. Penny Edgell, a University of Minnesota sociologist and expert adviser for the Pew study, said this religious and political sorting aligns with whether people 'support traditional, patriarchal gender and family arrangements.' Edgell also notes that Black Americans defy the assumption that all Democrats are less religious than Republicans. 'More Black Americans percentagewise are Democrats, but their rates of religious involvement are still really high,' Edgell said. 'That has something to do with the way that religious institutions and politics have been intertwined in historically unique ways for different groups.' Roughly seven in 10 Black Protestants told Pew that religion is very important to them — about the same rate as evangelicals and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But Black Protestants are likely to identify as Democrats (72%), whereas evangelicals and Latter-day Saints are likely to identify as Republican (70% and 73%, respectively). The Pew survey tracks many religious traditions It's been nearly 10 years since the last Religious Landscape Study, which tracks religious data that the U.S. census does not. The new survey found that a majority of immigrants to the U.S. are Christian (58%), but they also follow the upward trend of the religiously unaffiliated, with a quarter of foreign-born U.S. adults claiming no religion. The number of Americans who belong to religions besides Christianity has been increasing, though it's still a small portion of the population (7%). That includes the 2% who are Jewish, and the 1% each who are Muslim, Buddhist or Hindu. Of U.S. Christian adults, 40% are Protestant and 19% are Catholic. The remaining 3% in Pew's survey include Latter-day Saints, Orthodox Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses and smaller Christian groups. The two largest Protestant denominations in the Pew survey remain the Southern Baptist Convention and the United Methodist Church – though both have lost many members since the first Religious Landscape Study in 2007. The Pew Religious Landscape Study was conducted in English and Spanish between July 2023 and March 2024, among a nationally representative sample of 36,908 respondents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The survey's margin of error for results based on the full sample is plus or minus 0.8 percentage points.	https://www.voanews.com/a/survey-decline-in-number-of-us-christians-is-leveling-off/7989782.html	2025-02-26T19:30:40-08:00	
Nigeria's counterterrorism center warns of threats, launches review of strategy	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigeria's National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) warns that terrorist groups are getting more sophisticated — using new technologies and exploiting political and economic grievances to expand their operations. In response, authorities have launched a review of the national anti-terrorism strategy to address emerging threats. The official anti-terror strategy document was first developed in 2014 and revised two years later. Authorities say this latest revision is necessary to reflect evolving security threats and ensure counterterrorism measures remain effective. 'The tactics used by non-state actors keep evolving and have become highly unpredictable,' said Major General Adamu Garba Laka, the national coordinator of the Counter Terrorism Center. 'Nigeria is grappling with the challenges of insecurity, thanks to the efforts made by personnel and agencies in charge of securing the lives of citizens, which has ensured the decline in the number of such incidences.' The review comes three months after Nigerian authorities warned that a new terror group, Lakurawa, has emerged in the northwest region. Authorities say terrorist organizations are increasingly using advanced technology — such as encrypted messaging apps, social media recruitment campaigns and drones — to enhance their operations. They also exploit poverty, political grievances and weak law enforcement in remote areas to recruit fighters and spread their ideology. Laka said the updated strategy will redefine the roles of government agencies involved in counterterrorism efforts. For well over a decade, Nigeria has struggled to curb violence from terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and its offshoot, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). Since 2009, more than 35,000 people have been killed, and at least 2 million have been displaced. Although the overall number of terrorism-related deaths has declined in recent years, threats persist because of persistent poverty and poor governance. Security analyst Chidi Omeje said the increasing sophistication of terror groups is not surprising. 'I don't see it as something that we didn't expect. That's the reality of emerging security,' said Omeje. 'They have these links with terror networks, so they'll naturally grow in these proficiencies. So, it's up to us to devise ways to counter those technologies they're using.' Last month, terrorists attacked a military base near Nigeria's border with Niger, killing 20 soldiers. Security analyst Ebenezer Oyetakin argues that beyond reviewing counterterrorism strategies, authorities need to uncover terrorism financiers. 'When you take a look at the operation of al-Qaida, you compare it with ISIS — the way they move in their convoy — and then you compare it with Boko Haram, you'll see the semblance, which means they're too dynamic, they're not just a bunch of illiterates that are trying to make ends meet,' said Oyetakin. 'We should look for those behind them rather than contending with policies that are not sincerely being implemented.' Africa has become the global epicenter of terrorism, accounting for the highest number of terror-related deaths in 2023. Last April, Nigeria hosted the African Counter-Terrorism Summit, bringing together hundreds of experts and policymakers to develop a continent-wide strategy against terror groups. But for now, Nigerian authorities say their focus remains on strengthening the country's resilience against terrorism.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-counterterrorism-center-warns-of-threats-launches-review-of-strategy-/7989743.html	2025-02-26T18:53:14-08:00	
NYC resists federal call to stop its tolls to prevent traffic congestion	The Trump administration wants New York City to end its congesting pricing, an automatic toll program designed to reduce the bumper-to-bumper traffic in the city’s business area from 60th Street and below. But New York’s governor is fighting back. In a letter dated Feb. 20 and made public Wednesday, Gloria Shepherd, executive director of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), informed New York City and state transportation officials that FHWA officials would contact them 'to discuss the orderly cessation of toll operations' under the Central Business District Tolling Program. Shepherd said termination of the program should be effective March 21. New York Governor Kathy Hochul and the Metropolitan Transit Authority have filed a lawsuit to prevent ending the toll operation that the federal authorities approved and that has yielded millions of dollars for New York City since it began in January. Hochul told a recent MTA board meeting that while the federal government has called for an 'orderly cessation' of the program, she is proposing 'orderly resistance.' 'I guarantee that the president has never had to endure missing a child's sporting event because they were stuck on a delayed train. Never had to stand in a flooded subway station because we were not able to make the repairs. Not sitting in traffic, missing an important meeting because you couldn't get around,' Hochul told the MTA board. The congestion pricing program began Jan. 5. The revenue from the tolls from Jan. 5 to Jan. 31 totaled $48.66 million, with a net of $37.5 million. The toll program is on track to generate about $500 million for the MTA by year's end, MTA CEO Janno Lieber said, allowing the authority to progress with its plans for bus, subway and transit improvements. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nyc-resists-federal-call-to-stop-its-tolls-to-prevent-traffic-congestion/7989739.html	2025-02-26T18:06:27-08:00	
Hamas returns bodies of 4 hostages; Israel releases more Palestinian prisoners	KHAN YOUNIS, GAZA STRIP — Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, delivered the bodies of four hostages to the Red Cross early Thursday in exchange for Israel's release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, days before the first phase of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip will end. An Israeli security official confirmed that Hamas handed the bodies to the Red Cross. The official spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement. Around the same time, a Red Cross convoy carrying dozens of Palestinian prisoners left Israel's Ofer prison. Crowds of cheering families, friends and supporters of the prisoners were gathered in Beitunia, jostling for a glimpse of the bus that was on its way. Israel had delayed the release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it called the cruel treatment of hostages during their handover by Hamas. The terrorist group had called the delay a 'serious violation' of the ceasefire and said talks on a second phase weren't possible until the Palestinians were freed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Wednesday that the release of the bodies would be carried out without a ceremony, as opposed to past Hamas releases with stage-managed events in front of crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have called the ceremonies humiliating for the hostages. Israel releases hundreds Among those leaving Israel early Thursday were hundreds of detainees arrested from Gaza, held on suspicion of militancy after Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack, without charge for months. They included 445 men, 21 teenagers and one woman who were all arrested after the terror attack, according to lists shared by Palestinian officials that did not specify their ages. Only around 50 Palestinians were being released into the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem in this round. Dozens sentenced to life over deadly attacks against Israelis will be exiled out of the Palestinian territories, taken to Egypt at least temporarily until other countries accept them. The handover will complete both sides' obligations under the ceasefire's first phase, during which Hamas returned 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The family of a hostage in Gaza said it was notified he is dead, and his body was among those to be returned to Israel. The family did not say who informed them. Notifications typically come from Israel's military. Tsachi Idan was taken from Kibbutz Nahal Oz. His eldest daughter, Maayan, was killed as Hamas shot through the door of the safe room. French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X about Israeli French hostage Ohad Yahalomi, whose body was also expected to be released, 'In these suspended hours of pain and anguish, the nation stands by their side.' The ceasefire's six-week first phase expires this weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has said he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas would be released and an end to the war would be negotiated. Talks on the second phase were supposed to begin the first week of February. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of war that erupted after Hamas' 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. About 250 people were taken hostage. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who say over half the dead have been women and children. The fighting also displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population and decimated the territory's infrastructure and health system. Israel buries mother, sons killed in captivity On Wednesday, tens of thousands of Israelis lined highways as the bodies of a mother and her two young sons, killed in captivity in Gaza, were taken for burial on Wednesday. The bodies of Shiri Bibas and her sons, 9-month-old Kfir and 4-year-old Ariel, were handed over earlier this month. Israel says forensic evidence shows the children were killed by their captors in November 2023, while Hamas says the family was killed along with their guards in an Israeli airstrike. The husband and father, Yarden Bibas, was abducted separately and released alive in a different handover. His wife and their children were buried in a private ceremony near Kibbutz Nir Oz near Gaza, where they were living when they were abducted. They were buried in a joint grave next to Shiri's parents, who were killed in the attack. Infant dies of hypothermia in Gaza With people living in tent camps and damaged buildings in Gaza in chilly weather, health officials said another infant had died of hypothermia Wednesday, bringing the toll to seven over the past two weeks. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of Gaza's Health Ministry, said the baby, less than 2 months old, died because of the 'severe cold wave' that has hit the Palestinian enclave. Temperatures have been below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) at night, and the last few days have been particularly cold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-returns-bodies-of-4-hostages-israel-releases-more-palestinian-prisoners-/7989697.html	2025-02-26T17:55:38-08:00	
Trump ends permit to export Venezuelan oil to US	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — A permit issued by the United States government allowing energy giant Chevron Corp. to pump and export Venezuelan oil will be terminated this week, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday, ending what became a financial lifeline for the South American country. Trump's announcement in his Truth Social network accused the government of President Nicolás Maduro of not meeting democratic conditions for last year's July presidential election as well as of not moving fast enough to transport back to Venezuela immigrants set for deportation. 'We are hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicolas Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement,' Trump wrote. Trump's post did not specifically mention California-based Chevron nor the permit, formally known as a general license, that exempts the company from economic sanctions and allows it to export and sell Venezuelan oil in the U.S. But it is the only Venezuela-related license whose issuance and renewal information match the dates Trump did mention in his social media post. The administration of President Joe Biden authorized the license in 2022 after Maduro agreed to work with Venezuela's political opposition toward a democratic election. But the election, which took place in July 2024, was neither fair nor free, and Maduro was sworn in last month for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that his opponent got more votes. Biden's government resisted for months calls from Venezuela's opposition and others to rescind the license, whose goal the U.S. initially said was 'to support the restoration of democracy.' The opposition has estimated that Maduro's government has received about $4 billion through the permit, which was set to be renewed Saturday. Over time, the license has become responsible for roughly a quarter of Venezuela's oil production. 'We are aware of today's announcement and are considering its implications,' Chevron spokesperson Bill Turenne said in a statement. 'Chevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by U.S. government.' Venezuela sits atop the world's largest proven oil reserves and once used them to power Latin America's strongest economy. But corruption, mismanagement and eventual U.S. economic sanctions saw production decline steadily. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since 2013, when the oil-dependent economy came undone, and Maduro became president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the pandemic, they increasingly set their sights on the U.S. Chevron, which first invested in Venezuela in the 1920s, does business in the country through joint ventures with the state-owned company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA. The joint ventures produced about 200,000 barrels of oil a day in 2019. The following year, U.S. sanctions imposed by Trump's first administration to try to topple Maduro forced Chevron to wind down production. When the company got the license to export oil to the U.S. in November 2022, the joint ventures quickly began producing 80,000 barrels a day, and by 2024, they topped their daily output from 2019. The terms of the license bar Chevron from directly paying taxes or royalties to Venezuela's government. But the company sends money to the joint ventures, which are majority-owned by PDVSA. It is unclear how Maduro's government used that money, because it stopped publishing almost all financial data several years ago. On Wednesday, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in a podcast interview with Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., accused Maduro of using the funds for 'for repression, persecution and corruption.' 'This is a huge step, and it sends a clear, clear, firm message that Maduro is in huge trouble,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-ends-permit-to-export-venezuelan-oil-to-us/7989727.html	2025-02-26T17:50:21-08:00	
Trump orders large federal layoffs; Musk to seek deeper spending cuts	washington — U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday ordered federal agencies to undertake more large-scale layoffs of federal workers, as downsizing czar Elon Musk vowed at Trump's first Cabinet meeting to pursue deeper spending cuts. A new administration memo instructed agencies to submit plans by March 13 for a 'significant reduction' in staffing to the federal workforce. It did not specify numbers of desired layoffs. The memo, signed by White House budget director Russell Vought and Office of Personnel Management acting head Charles Ezell, represents a major escalation in Trump and Musk's campaign to slash the size of the U.S. government. Thus far, the layoffs have focused on probationary workers, who have less tenure in their current roles and enjoy fewer job protections. The next round would target the vastly bigger pool of veteran civil servants. At the Cabinet meeting, Trump said Lee Zeldin, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, plans to cut up to 65% of his more than 15,000 employees. On Tuesday, an Interior Department source told Reuters that bureaus such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs should prepare for workforce reductions ranging from 10% to 40%. About 100,000 of the nation's 2.3 million civilian federal workers have been fired or taken buyouts since Trump took office. Trump gave Musk an extraordinary sign of support for the cost-cutting campaign by inviting the billionaire to the Cabinet meeting and asking him to speak about the work of his Department of Government Efficiency, which is overseeing the overhaul. DOGE is not a Cabinet-level department. Musk expressed confidence that he could cut the $6.7 trillion budget by $1 trillion this year. Such an ambitious target would likely entail significant disruption of government programs. Without such deep spending cuts, Musk said, 'the country will go de facto bankrupt.' Later Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to work with DOGE to review and terminate all 'unnecessary' contracts and instructing the General Services Administration, which manages the government's real estate, to create a plan for disposing of any unneeded property. Thus far, Trump and Musk have failed to slow the rate of spending. According to a Reuters analysis, the government spent 13% more during Trump's first month in office than during the same time last year, largely because of higher interest payments on the debt and rising health and retirement costs incurred by an aging population. Trump reiterated his promise to refrain from cutting popular health and retirement benefits that account for nearly half of the budget. 'We're not going to touch it,' Trump said. Trump is simultaneously pushing Congress to extend the 2017 tax cuts, the signature legislative accomplishment of his first term, which are set to expire at year's end. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the 2017 cuts added $2.5 trillion to the nation's debt — now $36 trillion. It estimated that extending the tax cuts could cost more than $5 trillion over a decade. Republicans are weighing cuts to health care and food aid for the poor to help pay for the tax cuts, though specifics have not yet emerged. Workers ‘on the bubble’ Some of the Cabinet secretaries were taken by surprise over the weekend when federal workers received an email requiring them to list their accomplishments for the week, a demand that Musk said would result in termination if ignored. Some agencies told employees to ignore the directive, prompting days of confusion over whether Musk and Trump could make good on the threat. Musk, the world's richest person, told the Cabinet meeting his email was an attempt to find out whether government paychecks were going to actual workers. 'We think there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead,' he said, without providing evidence. Trump suggested that the roughly 1 million workers who did not respond to Musk's email might be at risk of losing their jobs. 'They are on the bubble,' he said, using a term that refers to a situation that has an uncertain outcome. Trump and Musk's unprecedented government overhaul has also frozen foreign aid and disrupted construction projects and scientific research. The GSA, informally known as the government's landlord, plans to terminate 1,100 leases for office space by the end of the year, according to a person briefed on the matter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-large-federal-layoffs-musk-to-seek-deeper-spending-cuts/7989725.html	2025-02-26T17:41:00-08:00

In Ukraine, resilience is key to three years of war coverage	WASHINGTON — In a flash protest to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 20 coffins are laid out in Republic Square in Paris. The coffins —19 open and one closed — symbolize journalists held by Russia. The sealed coffin is a reference to Victoria Roshchyna, who died while in Russian detention under unclear circumstances. Overall, the conflict has contributed to 13 deaths of local and foreign journalists and 47 cases of journalists being injured as they cover the war, according to Reporters Without Borders, known as RSF. One Ukrainian journalist remains missing. Cases include Russian strikes on TV stations, gunfire, shelling and journalists being hit by Russian drones while covering Ukrainian military operations. Among those affected is Fox News journalist Benjamin Hall, who was seriously injured in an attack that killed two of his colleagues in March 2022. Hall told VOA the road to recovery has been hard. 'For the first six or seven months, I was at a military hospital in Texas. And when you are going through the traumatic recovery, and you're in the ICU, it's brutal,' Hall said. 'The amount of pain — you don't know what's coming ahead. But I found those to be some of the easiest moments.' Returning home, he says, and coming to terms not only with life-changing injuries, including an amputation, but also with the trauma has been harder than the immediate treatment for his injuries. The veteran correspondent was traveling to the village of Horenka outside of Kyiv with his colleagues, French video journalist Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova, when a Russian mortar attack hit the vehicle two times. Hall was the only survivor. 'I had one goal, and that was to get home. And it was to get better and walk again, learn to walk again,' he said. 'Before, I was just this journalist. Suddenly, you are someone who was injured, and people see you in a different way. And I found that part of that recovery was a bit harder,' Hall added. Returning to journalism was a priority for his recovery. 'And so, as soon as I could, I was trying to get back in the field, and I returned to Ukraine,' he said. On Nov. 20, 2023, Hall returned to Ukraine and interviewed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The journalist traveled by train and said it was a milestone in his recovery. When he was evacuated after the shelling, he left on a train in critical health. Now he was returning on one. 'That in particular meant a lot to me,' he said. Covering the war in Ukraine changed Hall’s life, but he said the biggest impact is being made by local journalists on the ground — 'all journalists who cover conflict.' As a foreign correspondent, 'you go somewhere for a little bit, but you leave. I can only imagine the weight of being there day in, day out, and having to continue reporting for three years,' Hall said. That is where resilience comes in, said Pauline Maufrais, the Ukraine area manager for RSF. Local journalists put their lives at risk, work under very dangerous conditions and are under constant threat of being hit by shelling, drones or being kidnapped in occupied territories. 'All of them basically became war correspondents, in 2022,' Maufrais said. In wartime, it is hard to find accountability. Russia’s Defense Ministry informed Roshchyna’s family in October 2024 that she had died in custody. 'Since then, we are asking for answers. We're asking Russia to give us an explanation about what happened to Victoria,' Maufrais said. Russia has not yet given clarification on the cause of her death nor returned her body to her family. 'We want to know what happened. We want Russia to explain what happened to Victoria Roshchyna. And it is important that we continue working on that, and we [will] continue asking those questions until we have answers,' she added. Roshchyna, an International Women’s Media Foundation awardee for courage in journalism, disappeared in August 2023 while traveling to report on Russian-occupied territories. It was eight months before her family learned that she had been imprisoned. The 27-year-old journalist was due to be returned when her death was announced. In addition to journalists’ risks of physical safety are economical and logistical challenges, Maufrais said. 'Media outlets lacking professional journalists, many left Ukraine in exile; economic challenges; the destruction of communication towers and TV stations; as well as pressure from the Ukrainian government for those journalists who are covering corruption within the country,' said Maufrais. Maufrais said at least 329 media outlets have closed since the invasion, often because of a decrease in advertising revenue. For foreign correspondents like Hall, the experiences of covering the war have shaped his life. He recalled interviewing a young woman taken hostage on the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack and held for months. 'I realized that throughout my whole career, I had never quite been able to understand people who had gone through these traumatic events, who had been in wars. But finally, I did. So, I think it made me a much better journalist,' Hall said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-ukraine-resilience-is-key-to-three-years-of-war-coverage/7989677.html	2025-02-26T16:21:26-08:00

UN voices concern over Sudan paramilitary's 'charter'	united nations — U.N. Security Council members expressed deep concern Wednesday over the announcement earlier this week by the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that it plans to establish a parallel governing authority in parts of the country under its control. 'This is a dangerous step that fuels further fragmentation in Sudan and derails ongoing efforts toward peace and dialogue,' said Algeria’s Deputy Ambassador Toufik Koudri on behalf of the three African members of the council plus Guyana. 'We call for these actions to be reversed and urge the RSF and their allies to put the unity and national interests of Sudan above all other considerations.' The RSF and allied political and armed groups signed a 16-page 'charter' in Kenya over the weekend to establish a governing authority. The rebels control much of western Sudan, including most of the Darfur region. Council diplomats said the African members — Algeria, Sierra Leone and Somalia — have proposed a draft statement for the council’s consideration expressing 'grave concern' over the development, reaffirming its commitment to Sudan’s unity and urging the parties to engage in negotiations. It would require the consensus of all 15 members. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday that the RSF’s move could deepen the nearly two-year-old civil war. Nearly every council member expressed concern and disapproval of the RSF’s move, which comes as the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have been making progress in its bid to recapture districts in the greater Khartoum area, including Omdurman and Khartoum North. 'We support the restoration of civilian governance in a peaceful, unified Sudan. In this regard, we support efforts to promote a civilian political dialogue to foster a political process,' said U.S. political coordinator John Kelley. 'Attempts by the RSF and aligned actors to establish a government in RSF-controlled territory in Sudan are unhelpful for the cause of peace and security in Sudan and risk a de facto partition of the country.' 'Respect for Sudan’s [U.N.] Charter rights — its unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity — is vital and will be necessary for a sustainable end to this war,' said British Ambassador Barbara Woodward. She said Foreign Secretary David Lammy plans to convene 20 states and international organizations in London in April for talks on supporting a peaceful way forward for Sudan. South Korea’s envoy warned of the potential consequences of a fragmented Sudan, which is the continent’s third-largest country by size and home to 50 million people. 'The disintegration of such a vast, large nation would have profound and lasting ramifications and repercussions on the peace and prosperity of neighboring states and the wider region,' said Ambassador Hwang Joonkook. Sudan’s envoy, Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith Mohamed, criticized Kenya for allowing the signing of the RSF’s charter in its country, saying the agreement seeks to dismantle his country. 'I reiterate that neither President William Ruto nor the government of Kenya has recognized any independent entity in the Sudan or elsewhere,' Kenya’s Ambassador Erastus Lokaale responded in the council. 'Kenya believes strongly in availing the opportunity for dialogue and negotiations to diverse groups of Sudanese society and has remained consistent in its commitment to facilitate the expansion of Sudanese consensus across the political divide towards achieving a swift end to the conflict in the Sudan,' said Lokaale. Fighting continues The SAF-backed authorities have presented their own road map for ending the war that includes an inclusive national dialogue, the formation of a caretaker transitional government and the selection of a civilian prime minister. 'We call on the United Nations and the [U.N. secretary-general’s personal Sudan] envoy to support this road map, because it's the practical and realistic means to end the crisis,' Mohamed said. On Monday, the RSF announced a new assault on North Darfur’s embattled capital, El-Fasher, which is still held by the Sudanese military. 'But any ceasefire is rejected if El Fasher’s siege is not lifted,' Mohamed added. 'The rebels, within any agreement, must withdraw from the areas they continue to occupy because they target civilians and deliberately kill them.' The fighting in El Fasher, specifically in and around Zamzam displaced person’s camp, has caused the World Food Program to temporarily pause its distribution of critical food and nutrition assistance to the famine-affected camp. WFP said Wednesday that Zamzam’s market was destroyed by shelling, further hurting residents’ ability to access food. About a half million people live in the camp. On Monday, Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders, said it was also halting health and nutrition work at Zamzam because of insecurity. The United Nations says more than 12 million people have been displaced by the fighting between Sudan’s two rival generals, and nearly half the country’s population is experiencing acute hunger.

VOA Mandarin: Housing rents fall in major cities across China	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A new survey by Chinese media shows that housing rents in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen have fallen to 2015–2017 levels, while rents in Guangzhou, Chengdu and Tianjin have dropped to the early 2010s levels. Analysts attribute the decline in rents to falling household incomes, which have weakened demand.

VOA Mandarin: Xi's meeting with tech tycoons signals policy shift — but for how long?	WASHINGTON — Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent meeting with tech executives, including Jack Ma, signals a shift from regulatory crackdowns to a more supportive stance toward China's private sector. This follows China's cyclical pattern of tech regulation: initial leniency, strict crackdowns, and eventual relaxation to restore market confidence. The policy shift stems from economic concerns as China faces slowing growth and needs for the private sector to drive innovation and employment. While the tech sector enters a period of regulatory easing, the duration remains uncertain as China's regulatory pendulum could swing back if new economic or political concerns emerge.

Industry hails overdue Botswana-De Beers diamond deal	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Experts have welcomed the signing of a long-delayed rough diamond sales agreement between Botswana and South African mining giant De Beers. Representatives of the Botswana government and De Beers put pen to paper Tuesday on a 10-year deal following six years of negotiations. Under the new agreement, Botswana will keep 30% of rough diamonds mined from a joint venture between the government and De Beers, up from 25% under the previous deal. In the following five years, Botswana’s share of the stones will rise to 40%. Meanwhile, De Beers’ mining licenses in Botswana have been extended to 2054. Local economist Keith Jefferis said concluding the deal was critical to the global diamond industry. '[It is] a very positive move that the deal has finally been reached,' Jefferis said. 'It will certainly help to bring some certainty to the global diamond industry. Overall, it’s a good deal for Botswana. To me, the most important part of that is the agreement that extends mining leases up to 2054 for the major mines, that is Jwaneng and Orapa [mines.]' President Duma Boko, speaking at the contract signing, said Botswana made a good deal. 'We are happy,' Boko said. 'We have traveled a long path of negotiations, and I have said, I have continued to maintain, that when you negotiate, you know that you have achieved a reasonable, equitable and fair outcome when all the parties to the negotiation come out of the negotiation crying and celebrating in equal measure.' Diamonds are the cornerstone of Botswana’s economy, accounting for around 80% of total export revenues. De Beers chief executive Al Cook said under the new contract, the diamond company will invest an initial $75 million in a diamond for development program. Cook emphasized Botswana and De Beers will work together to market the precious stones. 'Key to the partnership that we are agreeing today is a marketing partnership, a partnership for the first time,' he said, 'putting the resources, the brains, the capabilities of the Botswana government together with the brains, the people of the resources of De Beers, a marketing partnership that can tell the story of diamonds of Botswana.' The Kimberley Process Civil Society Coalition is an umbrella body that observes the global diamond trade to prevent the sale of so-called blood diamonds. Coalition coordinator Jeff Bamenjo said the signing of the deal is welcome but must bring tangible gains to the communities where the diamonds are mined. 'We have always said when diamonds are exploited, we expect benefits for the country and also for the local community,' Bamenjo said. The newly signed agreement comes as the diamond industry reels from a global slump in sales, amid sanctions on stones mined in Russia, the world’s largest producer.	https://www.voanews.com/a/industry-hails-overdue-botswana-de-beers-diamond-deal/7989389.html	2025-02-26T14:52:39-08:00	
Uzbekistan, Pakistan pledge to advance proposed railway link via Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Uzbekistan and Pakistan agreed to establish a tripartite committee with Afghanistan to address issues that are hindering the implementation of a proposed railway project connecting the three countries. Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev reported the development after delegation-level talks with Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Tashkent, emphasizing the need to coordinate joint efforts to advance the trans-Afghan railway link. The three neighboring countries signed an agreement in February 2021 to construct a 573-kilometer (356-mile) railway line through Afghanistan, connecting landlocked Central Asia to Pakistani seaports, with an estimated cost of $4.8 billion to enhance regional economic connectivity. 'For the first time, we conducted comprehensive discussions [on the project],' Mirziyoyev said in remarks through his official interpreter broadcast live Wednesday on Pakistani state television. He noted that both sides agreed to form a tripartite committee to evaluate opportunities and address project challenges. The Uzbek leader stated that it was also central to discussions his government recently hosted with officials from Afghanistan. 'Now, we will have the tripartite [committee] meeting on resolving the problems,' said Mirziyoyev without elaborating. 'We know that this [project] is our future,' he added, calling it crucial for regional trade and travel. The Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021 and subsequent Western financial sanctions on the country briefly deterred Uzbekistan and Pakistan from advancing discussions on the railway connectivity project. Lately, Pakistan has accused the Taliban government, which is not recognized by any country, of harboring and facilitating militants responsible for terrorist attacks in the country. The ongoing violence has strained bilateral relations and prevented Islamabad from pursuing any meaningful economic partnership with Kabul, according to Pakistani officials. The Taliban reject allegations that foreign militant groups operate on their territory, saying that no one is allowed to use Afghan soil to threaten other countries. Sharif, speaking alongside Mirziyoyev, reiterated concerns about cross-border terrorism, emphasizing that militant groups should not use Afghan soil to launch attacks against other nations, including Pakistan. The Uzbek and Pakistani leaders announced Wednesday that they had also agreed to increase annual trade from more than $400 million to $2 billion and signed several agreements to deepen bilateral economic and trade ties. The two sides stated that they had discussed enhancing collaboration in agricultural, pharmaceuticals, machinery, geology, mineral resources, textiles, leather and other industries by exporting finished products to third-country markets. Islamabad and Tashkent also agreed to enhance air links with new flights planned between the largest Pakistani city of Karachi and the historic Uzbek cities of Samarkand and Bukhara.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uzbekistan-pakistan-pledge-to-advance-proposed-railway-link-via-afghanistan/7989378.html	2025-02-26T14:28:45-08:00	
US lawmakers seek compromise on government funding bills	U.S. President Donald Trump addressed concerns Wednesday that legislation funding the federal government past a March 14 deadline would include controversial cuts to social safety net programs such as Medicaid and Social Security. 'We're not going to touch it,' Trump told reporters, 'Now we are going to look for fraud. I'm sure you're OK with that, like people that shouldn't be off, people that are illegal aliens and other criminals.' Those cuts are one of the issues lawmakers are racing to resolve before a short-term spending bill runs out in just over two weeks. The House of Representatives passed a budget resolution 217-215 late Tuesday when Speaker of the House Mike Johnson secured enough votes from within his party. 'We promised to deliver President [Donald] Trump's full agenda, not just a part of it, not just a little bit of it now and return for the rest,' Johnson told reporters earlier Tuesday. The House and Senate bills will now have to be compromised to be signed into law. Before the vote, several members of the House Republican conference were still concerned about the size of the spending measure, how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts, and the political impact of cutting social safety net programs that benefit many American voters. 'Not only are we working to find savings for the American taxpayer, a better, more efficient use of their dollar, which we are morally obligated to do, we also have a moral obligation to bend the curve on the debt,' Johnson said Tuesday. Trump has called for lawmakers to pass 'one big, beautiful bill' that will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy agenda. Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House version of the budget, the Senate last week passed a funding resolution that provides $150 billion in military funding and $175 billion for border security. That measure also avoids the controversial Medicaid cuts of the House version. In a statement Wednesday, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham warned, 'Time is of the essence when it comes to border security. ICE will run out of money in weeks, not months. Stalling President Trump's border security agenda is not only bad politics, it is dangerous.' Trump posted on Truth Social last week that 'The House and Senate are doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!' If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees temporarily without pay and suspending some nonessential government services. Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not rule out the possibility of another short-term spending bill to give lawmakers more time to work. 'We're keeping all the options on the table, but we are running out of time,' Thune told reporters Tuesday. The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House version. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a first step toward hurting voters. 'Last night, almost every single House Republican signed their names to what would be the largest Medicaid cuts in American history. The havoc, the damage that would do to tens of millions of American families would be almost unprecedented when it comes to Medicaid,' Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday. 'The Republican agenda is quickly taking shape: Under Donald Trump's Republican Party, billionaires win, American families lose,' Schumer said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-seek-compromise-on-government-funding-bills/7989287.html	2025-02-26T13:12:55-08:00	
What we know about Congo illness that has sickened 400, killed 50	KINSHASA, CONGO — Unidentified illnesses in northwestern Congo have killed more than 50 people over the past five weeks, nearly half of them within hours after they felt sick. The outbreaks in two distant villages in Congo's Equateur province began on Jan. 21 and include 419 cases and 53 deaths. Health officials still do not know the cause, or whether the cases in the two villages, which are separated by more than 190 kilometers (118 miles), are related. It's also unclear how the diseases are spreading, including whether they are spreading between people. The first victims in one of the villages were children who ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said this week. More infections were found in the other village, where at least some of the patients have malaria. Outbreaks in two remote villages Illnesses have been clustered in two remote villages in different health zones of Equateur province, which is 640 kilometers (398 miles) from Kinshasa. The first outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours. More than two weeks later a second and larger outbreak was recorded in the village of Bomate, where more than 400 people have been sickened. According to WHO's Africa office, no links have been established between the cases in the two villages. Dr. Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center, and one of the government experts deployed to respond to the outbreak, says the situations in the two villages are somewhat different. 'The first one with a lot of deaths, that we continue to investigate because it's an unusual situation, (and) in the second episode that we're dealing with, we see a lot of the cases of malaria,' said Ngalebato. The WHO Africa office said the quick progression from sickness to death in Boloko is a key concern, along with the high number of deaths in Bomate. What are the symptoms? Congo's Ministry of Health said about 80% of the patients share similar symptoms including fever, chills, body aches and diarrhea. While these symptoms can be caused by many common infections, health officials initially feared the symptoms and the quick deaths of some of the victims could also be a sign of a hemorrhagic fever such as Ebola, which was also linked to an infected animal. However, Ebola and similar diseases including Marburg have been ruled out after more than a dozen samples were collected and tested in the capital of Kinshasa. The WHO said it is investigating a number of possible causes, including malaria, viral hemorrhagic fever, food or water poisoning, typhoid fever and meningitis. What is being done in response? Congo's government says experts have been sent to the villages since Feb. 14, mainly to help investigate the cases and slow the spread. Ngalebato said patients have been responding to treatments that target the different symptoms. The remote location of the villages has hindered access to patients while the weak health care infrastructure has made it difficult to carry out surveillance and manage patients. Such challenges are common in disease outbreaks in Congo. In December, an unknown illness killed dozens. In the latest outbreaks, several victims died before experts could even reach them, Ngalebato said. There needs to be urgent action 'to accelerate laboratory investigations, improve case management and isolation capacities, and strengthen surveillance and risk communication,' the WHO Africa office has said. The United States has been the largest bilateral donor to Congo's health sector and supported the training of hundreds of field epidemiologists to help detect and control diseases across the vast country. The outbreaks were detected as the Trump administration put a freeze on foreign aid during a 90-day review. Is there a link to Congo's forests? There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where people regularly eat wild animals. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022. Experts say this might be what is happening in Congo, which is home to about 60% of the forests in the Congo Basin, home to the largest expanse of tropical forest on Earth. 'All these viruses are viruses that have reservoirs in the forest. And so, as long as we have these forests, we will always have a few epidemics with viruses which will mutate,' said Gabriel Nsakala, a professor of public health at Congo's National Pedagogical University, who previously worked at the Congolese health ministry on Ebola and coronavirus response programs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-we-know-about-congo-illness-that-has-sickened-400-killed-50/7989291.html	2025-02-26T13:01:18-08:00	
Security experts highlight pros, cons of Ukraine-US minerals deal	Ukraine and the United States are set to sign a landmark minerals agreement, marking a significant step toward strengthening economic ties between the two nations. However, security experts tell VOA that concerns persist about the broader implications of the deal. Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers approved the agreement Wednesday and U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit the White House on Friday to sign it. The deal includes provisions for the co-ownership and management of a post-war reconstruction fund for Ukraine, to which Ukraine will allocate 50% of future revenues from the country’s natural resources. The agreement states that the U.S. will maintain a 'long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.' The deal makes no direct reference to efforts to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though, or about future security arrangements for the Eastern European country, apart from a single line: 'The Government of the United States of America supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.' While the deal aims to unlock Ukraine’s mineral wealth and bolster its economic recovery, security experts warn it may fall short in addressing Ukraine’s ongoing security challenges amid continued Russian aggression. American business perspective Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, explained to VOA by telephone that the deal aims to establish a new American-Ukrainian fund, focusing on state-owned enterprises and Ukraine's rich subsoil resources, including gas, oil, and critical minerals. A representative of American business in Ukraine, Hunder expressed optimism about the agreement's potential impact: 'We’re excited. Professional fund managers can turn these enterprises profitable very quickly. This is a win-win for both Ukrainian and American taxpayers,' he told VOA on Wednesday. Hunder said the fund could unlock profits rapidly by introducing professional management to Ukraine's state-owned enterprises, which currently face mismanagement issues. 'Ukraine has the second highest number of state-owned enterprises in the world, many of which are being managed, or some are being mismanaged, by the Ukrainian state. So, I think we get new professional fund managers into these entities, and this is where you could seal profits and turn them around very, very quickly,' he said. Hunder revealed that discussions about Ukrainian economic potential were high on the agenda between the two countries in 2024, '[s]tarting when Senator Lindsey Graham came in March and May of 2024, and we have looked into this, and we see opportunity.' 'To take advantage of this opportunity, the war must end, and this deal, in his view, is a step toward a peaceful solution. I think this is really what the new administration under President Trump is focusing on — finding ways to stop the killing of Ukrainians by the Russians. We do expect a ceasefire this year, in 2025, and now is the time when Ukraine will present the biggest opportunity, the largest recovery, and the reconstruction of a nation in Europe since World War II,' he said to VOA. Roman Opimakh, former general director of the Ukrainian Geological Survey. agrees the deal could benefit both countries. It will help the U.S. to diversify its rare metal supply and 'decrease dependence on China,' he said. For Ukraine, he said, the deal could enable post-war re-industrialization and economic growth. We can renew the industrial potential of our country and actually increase the role of Ukraine globally,' Opimakh said by phone. While the deal indicates strong U.S. interest in Ukraine's economic future, security experts caution that it is not a comprehensive solution to Ukraine’s security challenges. Former defense minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk, now the chairman of the Center for Defense Strategies in Ukraine, told VOA in a phone call the deal has broader implications: 'The U.S. framed this deal as a demonstration of vested interest in Ukraine, signaling support for Ukrainian stability. Investments of this scale serve as anchor investments, potentially attracting more resources to Ukraine’s economy.' Zagorodnyuk cautioned that economic ties are 'not enough' to guarantee Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of Russian aggression. To deter future attacks, Ukraine needs military power — either on its own or in partnership with NATO and European allies, he stated to VOA. 'We recognize that Russia might be attempting to manipulate the situation and convey to Trump's administration that even if they continue their aggression for any reason, they would still respect American interests or something like that,' he said. Asked by VOA what Ukraine needs from the U.S. for long-term security, Zagorodnyuk said ideally, the country would have NATO. However, 'if NATO isn’t an option, there should be a package that enables Ukraine to defend against aggression. This package must be robust, and that strength needs to be clear to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,' he said. Agreement details According to VOA sources, who cannot be named because they are not authorized to speak about the matter, negotiations concerning the details of the deal continued right up to the Cabinet ministers’ meeting late Wednesday afternoon, Kyiv time. According to news reports, Ukraine negotiated more favorable terms than the U.S. originally proposed, bringing down an initial U.S. demand for a $500 billion claim on its natural resources. The deal does not include explicit U.S. security guarantees, which Kyiv had originally sought. The U.S. will maintain decision-making authority within the fund under its own legal framework, with ownership terms to be defined in later agreements. Geopolitical ramifications Despite praising the agreement as a step toward strengthening Ukraine's economy, Trump sparked controversy recently by labeling Zelenskyy a 'dictator' without elections and pressuring him to finalize the deal quickly. The U.S. administration has described the deal as a way for the U.S. to recover tens of billions of dollars in military aid sent to Ukraine. The question remains whether this economic partnership also can foster lasting peace and stability in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/security-experts-highlight-pros-cons-of-ukraine-us-minerals-deal-/7989174.html	2025-02-26T11:50:15-08:00

US, Ukraine near minerals deal, but security issues unsettled	The United States said Wednesday it is nearing a deal on Ukraine’s lucrative rare earth minerals needed for technology products to compensate Washington for the more than $100 billion worth of munitions it has sent to Kyiv to defend itself against Russia’s three-year war of aggression. 'We’re very close to the finish line,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a news conference that the framework of an economic deal is complete, but that U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine that the Kyiv government views as vital have yet to be settled. Zelenskyy is expected to visit Washington on Friday for talks with President Donald Trump, who has long expressed skepticism about continued U.S. military support for Ukraine. In recent weeks, he has refused to say he wants Ukraine to win the war and has initiated talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin without Kyiv’s involvement to settle the conflict that started with Russia’s invasion three years ago this week. Trump said Tuesday of Zelenskyy, 'Certainly, it’s okay with me if he’d like to' visit the White House. 'He would like to sign [the economic deal] together with me. I understand that. It’s a big deal.' Trump has called Zelenskyy a dictator, without blaming Putin for the invasion. The U.S. leader has said he is particularly peeved that his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, agreed to the Ukraine military assistance without any provision that Ukraine would pay back the cost. Biden led the coalition of Western allies in providing the military aid to fight Russian aggression without sending their own troops to fight alongside Ukrainian forces. Zelenskyy says the U.S. military aid was a grant and not a loan that needed to be repaid. Zelenskyy said he expects to have wide-ranging substantive discussions with Trump. 'I want to coordinate with the U.S.,' Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian leader said he wants to know whether the U.S. plans to halt military aid and, if so, whether Ukraine would be able to purchase weapons directly from the U.S. He also wants to know whether Ukraine can use frozen Russian assets for weapons investments and whether Washington plans to lift its economic sanctions on Russian entities and high-level associates and friends of Putin. Elements of the deal Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told the country’s public television channel that Ukraine and the United States had reached preliminary agreement on the broad rare earth minerals deal and that it would be signed. The preliminary agreement sets out the terms and conditions of an investment fund for the rebuilding of Ukraine, Shmyhal said. Under terms of the deal, the plan would include investing 50% of proceeds from Ukraine’s minerals, oil and gas to create a 'stable and economically prosperous Ukraine' if the war is ended, and half to a U.S.-controlled fund. The New York Times reported the economic agreement includes a line that says the U.S. 'supports Ukraine’s effort to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace' but does not spell out details on what that might entail. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting with Trump on Wednesday in Washington to spell out a European initiative for a 30,000-person peacekeeping force to enforce a Russian ceasefire with Ukraine if such a truce can be reached, although no peace talks have been scheduled. European leaders have said a peacekeeping force would require an American 'backstop' of military assistance, such as American satellite surveillance, air defense or air force support. Trump has not committed the U.S. to such a plan.

New app lets homebuyers know about future neighbor’s politics	Most homebuyers get to know the people who live next door after they move in. But a new real estate app allows future homebuyers to learn a potential neighbor’s political leanings before they make what, for many people, is the biggest purchase of their life. 'The purpose of Oyssey [the app] is to democratize data for buyers in their home search experience … to get you, as a prospective buyer, a feel for the area and community,' says Darian Kelly, co-founder of Oyssey. 'It's to get you to the understanding of, when I move here, these are the type of people that I might be inviting over for dinner. The type of people that I will be raising my child alongside.' The Oyssey data is pulled from sources like election results, campaign contributions and information from marketing research firms. The app has only launched in Florida and New York so far, but its founders say they expect to take it nationwide later this year. Realtors subscribe to Oyssey and then give their homebuyer clients access to the service. For the initial launch, the platform breaks down political affiliation block by block, but Kelly says potential homebuyers will eventually be able to look up whether their prospective new neighbor is a registered Democrat or Republican. Ben McCartney, an assistant professor of commerce at the University of Virginia, co-authored a study published in 2024 that found that 1 of every 100 moves is politically motivated, and that the people most likely to relocate for this reason tend to be less involved in politics. 'They don't want politics to be part of their everyday life, but then they get a new neighbor, and that new neighbor is not only very politically vocal, but also affiliated with the opposite party, and there's where we see the strongest tensions arise,' McCartney says. The study found that current residents are slightly more likely to move away if they get new neighbors with different political views than if the new neighbor is affiliated with the same political party. 'So, political polarization isn't just a social media phenomenon but is affecting real economic decisions, as well,' McCartney says. The study found the numbers of Democrats and Republicans who wanted to move away from neighbors with different political views to be roughly even. That’s why an app like Oyssey makes sense to McCartney. 'People do seem to care about the political identities of their new neighbors, so I'm not surprised that some company is now selling that information, or providing that information, to would-be buyers,' he says. 'And I tend to be supportive of policies that make it easier for people to make informed decisions.' The Oyssey platform also provides other data relating to quality of life for the individual homebuyer, such as where to find the most dog parks. 'Where is the area with the most registered dogs throughout their state or county?' Kelly says. 'And we can try to get an idea and figure out where do the dogs live, because as a pet owner, that’s where I want to be.' He dismisses any suggestion that Oyssey could contribute to deepening America’s political divide. 'I actually get upset by the question. … I think the question makes the assumption that you shouldn't be the driver, you shouldn't be the writer of your own story,' Kelly says. 'We believe that we're giving people the data and the information to control their own destiny and do what they will with that information. The data already exists.' Oyssey’s stated goal is to make that public information easier to find.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-app-lets-homebuyers-know-about-future-neighbor-s-politics-/7988658.html	2025-02-26T09:42:22-08:00

First measles death reported in West Texas outbreak that's infected more than 120 people	LUBBOCK, TEXAS — A person who was hospitalized with measles has died from measles in West Texas, the first death in an outbreak that began late last month. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center spokesperson Melissa Whitfield confirmed the death Wednesday. It wasn't clear the age of the patient, who died overnight. Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 124 cases across nine counties, the state health department said Tuesday. There are also nine cases in eastern New Mexico. Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. The outbreak is largely spreading in the Mennonite community in an area where small towns are separated by vast stretches of oil rig-dotted open land but connected due to people traveling between towns for work, church, grocery shopping and other day-to-day errands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-measles-death-reported-in-west-texas-outbreak-that-s-infected-more-than-120-people/7988850.html	2025-02-26T07:39:01-08:00	
US will spend up to $1 billion to combat bird flu, USDA secretary says	WASHINGTON — The U.S. will invest up to $1 billion to combat the spread of bird flu, including increasing imports of eggs, agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said on Wednesday. A three-year bird flu outbreak in U.S. poultry has killed 166 million chickens since 2022, according to USDA data. The virus has also infected nearly 1,000 dairy herds and almost 70 people, including one death, since early 2024. The USDA will spend up to $500 million to provide free biosecurity audits to farms and $400 million to increase payment rates to farmers who need to kill their chickens due to bird flu, Rollins said at a conference of state agriculture officials. Some of the money will come from cuts to USDA spending by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, Rollins said in a Wednesday Wall Street Journal op-ed. The USDA is exploring vaccines for chickens but is not yet authorizing their use, Rollins said. The poultry industry is divided on whether to vaccinate chickens because of potential trade implications. The administration plans to increase imports and decrease exports of eggs to boost domestic supply and combat record high egg prices, Rollins said. Turkey has said it will export 15,000 tons of eggs to the U.S. through July. In May, the administration of former president Joe Biden allocated more than $800 million to combat bird flu in livestock. About $450 million of that money is still available, a USDA official said on Tuesday at the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture conference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-spend-up-to-1-billion-to-combat-bird-flu-usda-secretary-says/7988809.html	2025-02-26T07:13:29-08:00	
WFP pauses food aid in famine-hit Sudan refugee camp	ROME — The U.N. World Food Program said Wednesday that it was forced to suspend operations in and around the famine-hit Zamzam displacement camp in Sudan’s North Darfur because of escalating violence. 'Intense fighting in Zamzam camp in Sudan’s North Darfur region has forced' the Rome-based agency 'to temporarily pause the distribution of life-saving food and nutrition assistance in the famine-hit camp for displaced people.' 'Over the past two weeks escalating violence left WFP’s partners with no choice but to evacuate staff for safety,' it said in a statement. Fighting between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, intensified this month in the camp, which the United Nations says shelters more than half a million people. 'Without immediate assistance, thousands of desperate families in Zamzam could starve in the coming weeks,' said Laurent Bukera, WFP’s regional director for Eastern Africa and acting country director for Sudan. 'We must resume the delivery of life-saving aid in and around Zamzam safely, quickly and at scale. For that, the fighting must stop and humanitarian organizations must be granted security guarantees,' Bukera said. The RSF stormed Zamzam on Feb. 11, triggering two days of clashes with the army and allied militias and forcing about 10,000 families to flee, according to the International Organization for Migration. 'The recent violence left Zamzam’s Central Market destroyed by shelling, pushing residents of the camp ... further away from accessing essential food and supplies,' the WFP statement said. Famine was first declared in Zamzam in August and has since spread to two more displacement camps near the North Darfur capital of El-Fasher. It is expected to expand to five more areas, including El-Fasher itself, by May, according to a U.N.-backed assessment. Before the latest violence, around 1.7 million people were displaced in North Darfur alone, with 2 million civilians facing extreme food insecurity, the United Nations said. Established in 2004, Zamzam has received waves of displaced Sudanese during the current war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wfp-pauses-food-aid-in-famine-hit-sudan-refugee-camp/7988796.html	2025-02-26T07:11:42-08:00	
IAEA: Iran’s stock of near-bomb-grade uranium grows sharply	VIENNA — Iran’s stock of uranium enriched to near weapons grade has grown sharply since it announced a dramatic acceleration in December and there has been no progress on resolving outstanding issues, two reports by the U.N. nuclear watchdog showed on Wednesday. The stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% of bomb grade, has been a long-standing concern for Western powers, which say there is no civil justification for enriching uranium to such a high level. Iran says it seeks only peaceful nuclear energy. While U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has said it plans to pressure Iran over its nuclear program, the International Atomic Energy Agency has said time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on Iran’s activities. Two quarterly reports sent by the IAEA to member states showed that while the stock of 60% material has grown by around half, there has been no real progress on resolving long-running issues with Iran, including the unexplained presence of uranium traces found at undeclared sites. 'The significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon state to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,' the IAEA said in a passage that, unusually, was included in both reports. The stock of uranium refined to up to 60% in the form of uranium hexafluoride grew by 92.5 kilograms in the past quarter, to 274.8 kilograms, one of two confidential IAEA reports said. That is enough in principle, if enriched further, for six nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick. There is enough for more weapons at lower enrichment levels. One of the reports also spelled out the lack of progress on the outstanding issues such as explaining the uranium traces, which the IAEA has been asking the Islamic Republic to do for years. 'Iran states that it has declared all of the nuclear material, activities and locations required under its Safeguards Agreement. This is inconsistent with the Agency’s assessments of the unexplained nuclear-related activities that took place at all four of the undeclared locations in Iran referred to above,' the report said. 'The Agency is, therefore, at an impasse with regard to resolving these outstanding safeguards issues.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-iran-s-stock-of-near-bomb-grade-uranium-grows-sharply/7988745.html	2025-02-26T06:36:46-08:00	
Manbij will never have rest,' Syrian resident says amid war in north	Since the Syrian civil war mostly ended in December, fighting has continued outside the city of Manbij, where car bombs have killed dozens.

EU will ask India to cut tariffs on cars, wine to boost ties, reduce reliance on China	NEW DELHI — The European Union plans to urge India to lower its high tariffs on cars and wine to boost trade, as it seeks to reduce its reliance on China, a senior official from the bloc said, ahead of a visit by the European Commission president to New Delhi. Echoing U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of reciprocal tariffs, the official said the EU would press India to cut tariffs on some goods and broaden market access for its products, while offering flexibility on agriculture issues to expedite free trade agreement talks. 'The Indian market is relatively closed, especially to key products of commercial interest to the European Union and our member states’ industries, including cars, wines and spirits,' said the official, who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the discussions. EC President Ursula von der Leyen's two-day visit from Thursday, accompanied by leaders of EU member nations, coincides with escalating geopolitical tensions, with Brussels and New Delhi set to outline key areas for deeper cooperation under their strategic partnership. Leyen will meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, followed by discussions with trade minister Piyush Goyal. The next trade negotiations round is scheduled for March 10-14 in Brussels. The EU's call for lower tariffs comes amid Trump's threats to impose reciprocal tariffs from early April, which has caused anxiety for India's exporters. Analysts from Citi Research estimate potential losses of about $7 billion annually. The EU is India's largest trading partner in goods, with trade nearing $126 billion in 2024, marking an increase of about 90% over the past decade. Reducing reliance on China As part of its 'de-risking' strategy, the EU aims to strengthen economic and security ties with India, diversify supply chains, and reduce reliance on key products from China. The EU also views India as a vital ally in addressing security challenges, the official said, including cyber threats and tensions in the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific. Leyen is also expected to seek India's support for a 'peaceful and just deal' for Ukraine's security, the official said. The EU and India could sign an agreement to share classified security information to tackle common threats such as cyber attacks and terrorism, while exploring defense equipment trade. Despite these potential benefits, trade analysts said the visit may not yield tangible results. For substantial cooperation, the EU should acknowledge India as a data-secure country, said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think-tank Global Trade Initiative, and India's former negotiator on trade talks with the EU. 'While both parties have concerns about China, neither sees it as a top priority,' Srivastava said, adding India is focused on border tensions with China, while the EU is more concerned with the Ukraine-Russia conflict and NATO matters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-will-ask-india-to-cut-tariffs-on-cars-wine-to-boost-ties-reduce-reliance-on-china-/7988575.html	2025-02-26T03:49:27-08:00	
Philippine police rescue kidnapped teen, hunt ex-gambling site operators	Manila — A young kidnap victim clad in pajamas and missing a finger was rescued from the side of a busy Manila thoroughfare this week after his abductors ditched him during a police pursuit, Philippine authorities said Wednesday. The kidnappers, like their teenaged target, were Chinese nationals, said the interior department's Juanito Victor Remulla, and part of a 'sophisticated' syndicate with ties to the now-banned offshore gambling sites known locally as POGOs. Notorious as fronts for human trafficking, money laundering and fraud, POGOs were banned by President Ferdinand Marcos last year, sending those who worked for them in search of new income streams. 'We are definite that the syndicate behind the kidnapping were former POGO operators,' Remulla told reporters, adding those involved had lost a lucrative living when the sites were shuttered. The kidnappers tried and failed to obtain a ransom -- at one point sending the parents a video of the victim's finger being severed -- before they were tracked down on Tuesday and pursued by police who homed in on their cellphone signal. 'The choice was pursuing the vehicle or securing the child. Obviously, the [police] prioritized the child,' Remulla said. A manhunt remains underway. The boy's driver, who had picked him up outside an exclusive private school days earlier, was found murdered inside another vehicle in Bulacan province north of Manila. 'These [cases] arose in January after all POGOs were closed; they got into kidnapping,' Remulla said, without providing statistics. AFP is aware of at least two other kidnapping cases involving Chinese nationals living in the Philippines this year. While describing the incident as 'Chinese against Chinese' crime, Remulla said disaffected former Filipino police or soldiers were likely used as foot soldiers in some cases. Gilberto Cruz, chief of the Philippines' anti-organized crime commission, told AFP that government figures showed there were still about 11,000 Chinese nationals in the country after the gambling sites they worked for were shuttered. 'Some have turned to other crimes, but we can't provide numbers as of now,' he said, before adding that some had likely ventured into 'kidnapping operations.' At a press conference on Wednesday, the immigration department said about 300 foreign nationals linked to POGOs were being held at a detention facility built for 100 while awaiting deportation. In a separate statement, the department said 98 Chinese nationals had been repatriated to China aboard a chartered Philippine Airlines flight on Tuesday night. The Chinese embassy said the joint repatriation marked 'another step in the law enforcing cooperation of the two countries after the ban on POGOs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-police-rescue-kidnapped-teen-hunt-ex-gambling-site-operators-/7988566.html	2025-02-26T03:36:34-08:00	
Sudanese army plane crashes in residential area, 46 killed	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Forty-six people were killed when a Sudanese army plane crashed in a residential area near a military airport in the capital's twin city Omdurman, the Khartoum state media office said, and military sources said a senior commander was among the dead. The crash took place late on Tuesday near the Wadi Sayidna military airport in northern Omdurman. The Sudanese army had said several military personnel and civilians were killed, but did not provide further details. Military sources said the plane crash was most likely due to technical reasons. The media office said 10 people were also injured. Among those killed was Major General Bahr Ahmed, a senior commander in Khartoum who previously served as the commander of the army across the entire capital, military sources said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudanese-army-plane-crashes-in-residential-area-46-killed/7988539.html	2025-02-26T02:49:48-08:00	
Absences and disputes mar G20 finance chiefs' talks	CAPE TOWN, South Africa — A number of finance ministers skipped a gathering of the Group of 20 top economies in South Africa on Wednesday, and other top officials curtailed trips to a meeting marred by disputes over the main issues of climate, debt and inequality. Agreeing on a declaration has always been tough for a gathering that includes China, Russia, the European Union and the United States. But differences are starker than ever and some finance ministers were too consumed with domestic politics to show up for the two-day meeting in Cape Town. Finance ministers from many of the G20's biggest economies - the U.S., China, Japan, India and Canada - canceled their attendance at the event, which is meant to bring them and central bankers together to discuss global economic challenges. The EU's senior economic official also stayed away. Their absences reduced what was already a small chance of agreeing on a communique. There also seemed little hope of accord on issues that the host, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, sees as key: scant climate finance from rich nations, reform of a financial system that penalizes poor countries and widening inequalities. 'At this time of global uncertainty and escalating tension, it is now more important than ever that the members of the G20 work together,' he said in his opening remarks. 'The erosion of multilateralism presents a threat to global growth and stability.' South Africa's central bank governor, Lesetja Kganyago, said a number of recent G20 meetings had finished without agreement on a communique and that the fact that some countries were being represented by deputy ministers was not a problem. 'There is no one in the room then saying ... 'I'm going to make this point, but I think I am too junior so they might ignore it',' he told Reuters. Alex van den Heever, political scientist at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said the absence of the United States from G20 talks - it also declined to send its top diplomat to a meeting of G20 foreign ministers last week - 'makes it very difficult to see how people will move forward.' South Africa had hoped to make the G20 a platform for putting pressure on rich countries to do more to tackle climate change, and to give more toward poorer countries' transitions to green energy and adaptation to worsening weather. 'Those most responsible for climate change have a duty ... to support those least responsible,' Ramaphosa said last week. Energy Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa told Reuters on Tuesday that 'what the American presidency does, effectively, is reconfigure the conversation (on green energy by) ... reintroducing elements we thought were resolved.' 'Where it leads is anyone's guess,' he said, adding that some countries might reconsider the scale and pace of their transition from fossil fuels to green energy as a result. Some analysts said the retreat of the G20's biggest economy from the discussions raised questions about its relevance. Others saw an opportunity for moving ahead without the U.S. 'There could very well be synergies between large portions of what's left by excluding the U.S. on particular issues,' said Daniel Silke, director of the Political Futures Consultancy. 'It's an opportunity for South Africa to take its leadership role.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/absences-and-disputes-mar-g20-finance-chiefs-talks/7988524.html	2025-02-26T02:17:29-08:00	
France wants Europe cooperation on visas over expulsion of undocumented migrants	PARIS — France's foreign minister said Wednesday that he wanted 'all' European countries to cooperate and start cutting back visas available to nationals of countries that refuse to take back illegal migrants expelled by Paris. Jean-Noel Barrot spoke after an Algerian-born man went on a stabbing rampage in the eastern French city of Mulhouse at the weekend, killing one person and wounding several others in what President Emmanuel Macron called an 'Islamist terrorist act.' The 37-year-old suspect was on a terrorism watch list and subject to a deportation order. France had attempted to expel him multiple times, but Algeria refused to cooperate, French authorities say. 'If a country does not cooperate with the French authorities, I will propose that all European countries restrict the issuing of visas at the same time,' Barrot told broadcaster France 2. 'When we do it on a national level, it doesn't work unfortunately,' he added. But if foreign governments cooperate, the European Union also could consider reducing customs tariffs for such countries, Barrot proposed. 'It is a particularly powerful lever,' he said. French authorities are seeking to tighten immigration policies and border controls, in a move emblematic of the right-ward shift in French politics. 'If we want our migration policy to be as effective as possible, there are many things that will be much more effective if we do it at a European level,' he said. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was set later Wednesday to chair a meeting on immigration controls. Bayrou has called for a national debate on immigration and what it means to be French, suggesting that immigrants were 'flooding' France.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-wants-europe-cooperation-on-visas-over-expulsion-of-undocumented-migrants/7988502.html	2025-02-26T01:19:08-08:00	
Power restored to most homes after Chile's massive blackout	SANTIAGO, CHILE — Chilean authorities said they restored power to most homes on Wednesday, hours after a massive, rare blackout caused transport chaos in the capital and forced the president to declare a state of emergency and curfew across much of the country. Chile's worst blackout in well over a decade struck on Tuesday afternoon, leaving millions without power. President Gabriel Boric blamed private companies that manage the grid for the system's failure. 'This is outrageous! The daily life of millions of Chileans can't be impacted like this by companies that don't do their job,' Boric said in a statement issued by his office. Early Wednesday, '90 percent of (electricity) consumption was restored' to homes, the power system's operator said in a statement. According to the Senapred disaster response agency, the outage affected an area stretching all the way from Arica in the long, narrow South American country's north to Los Lagos in the south, an area home to over 90% of Chile's 20 million people. The blackout disrupted transport in the capital Santiago, where thousands were evacuated from the metro and people jostled to board overflowing buses. President Boric had activated 'a state of emergency due to a catastrophe' and announced a curfew until 6 a..m. Wednesday. Attack ruled out Interior Minister Carolina Toha ruled out sabotage as the reason for the power loss, which began at 3:16 p.m .in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer. 'There is no reason to assume that this is an attack,' she said on Tuesday, telling reporters it was more likely 'a failure in the system's operation.' The metro company, which transports 2.3 million passengers every day, said workers were deployed to all stations 'to support safe evacuations.' Out-of-service traffic lights caused major gridlock, with some people having to walk for hours under the hot sun to reach their homes. Shops and offices closed early. 'They let us leave work because of the power cut, but now I don't know how we will get home because all the buses are full,' worker Maria Angelica Roman told AFP in Santiago. 'At the bank where I work, all operations had to stop,' 25-year-old clerk Jonathan Macalupu said. Dramatic rescues The Chilevision broadcaster showed video of people trapped on a mechanical ride several meters high at an amusement park in Santiago before being rescued. An AFP photographer saw firefighters rescue a distraught elderly woman, who had been trapped inside an elevator. The country's hospital system and prisons were operating on emergency generators. Boric flew over the capital by helicopter to assess the situation. In the coastal city of Valparaiso, witnesses also reported shops and businesses closing early and traffic chaos. Chile boasts one of the best power networks in South America and has not had a blackout this big in about 15 years. In 2010, damage to a power plant in southern Chile plunged hundreds of thousands of people into darkness for several hours. That outage happened a month after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake killed more than 500 people and rocked the national power grid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/power-restored-to-most-homes-after-chile-s-massive-blackout/7988495.html	2025-02-26T00:42:03-08:00	
China holds 'shooting' drills off Taiwan's coast, vows 'reunification' push	TAIPEI/BEIJING — China's military held 'shooting training' on Wednesday off Taiwan's southwest coast in a move Taipei described as provocative and dangerous, while a senior Chinese leader vowed unswerving efforts to bring the island under Beijing's control. Democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, has repeatedly complained of Chinese military activities, including several rounds of full-scale war games over the past three years. From shortly before 9 a.m. local time, Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement, it had detected 32 Chinese military aircraft carrying out a 'joint combat readiness drill' with Chinese warships in the Taiwan Strait area. 'During this period it even blatantly violated international practice by setting up a drills area in waters about 40 nautical miles (74 km) off the coast ... without prior warning, claiming that it would carry out 'shooting training,'' it added. Taiwan's major southwestern population centers of Kaohsiung and Pingtung that figured in the ministry's statement are both home to important naval and air bases. The exercises endanger the safety of international flights and shipping and is a 'blatant provocation' to regional peace and stability, the ministry said in a statement, adding that it had dispatched its own forces to keep watch. There was no immediate confirmation from China that it was carrying out new drills around Taiwan and its defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment. China's other recent military activity in the region, such as that off Australia's coast, gave 'proof that China is the only, and the greatest, threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific,' Taiwan's ministry said. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule, and has denounced both President Lai Ching-te, who took office last year, as a 'separatist,' and the United States for its support for Taiwan. Earlier on Wednesday, China's official Xinhua news agency said the ruling Communist Party's fourth ranked leader, Wang Huning, had called this week for greater effort in the cause of Chinese reunification. China must 'firmly grasp the right to dominate and take the initiative in cross-strait relations, and unswervingly push forward the cause of reunification of the motherland,' it quoted Wang as telling an annual meeting on work related to Taiwan. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-holds-shooting-drills-off-taiwan-s-coast-vows-reunification-push/7988492.html	2025-02-26T00:34:08-08:00	
Ukrainian officials say deadly drone attack hits Kyiv region	Ukrainian officials said Wednesday a Russian drone attack killed at least one person and injured two others in the Kyiv region. Kyiv Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on Telegram that the attack also damaged five houses and four multi-story residential buildings. Fragments from destroyed drones damaged apartment buildings, a university building, and a theater in the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said Wednesday. Ukraine’s military said Wednesday it shot down 110 of the 177 drones that Russian forces used in their latest overnight attacks. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday its air defenses destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones, more than half of which were shot down over the Krasnodar region located along the Black Sea. Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram that the attacks damaged homes in three districts but did not hurt anyone. Russian air defenses also shot down drones over Russia-occupied Crimea, the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea and Russia’s Bryansk and Kursk regions, the Defense Ministry said.

Thailand bus overturns in ditch killing at least 18 passengers	BANGKOK — At least 18 people were killed and 23 injured in eastern Thailand on Wednesday after the brakes failed on a tour bus and it rolled upside down into a ditch, police said. 'It was a downhill road and the brakes failed, and the driver lost control of the vehicle before it overturned,' said Colonel Sophon Phramaneehe, adding that those who died were adults on a study trip. There were 49 people on the bus, all Thai, including the driver, the police official told Reuters. Social media posts showed rescue and medical workers at the scene in Prachinburi province, 155 km east of the capital Bangkok, helping victims near the bus with its undercarriage exposed. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims' families and said an investigation was taking place. 'If it is found that there is a violation of the use of vehicles that do not meet the standards or are involved in reckless use of vehicles, legal action will be taken,' she said in a post on X. 'Inspection of vehicles must be safe and pass the specified standards before they are put into use to prevent accidents and reduce losses like this again,' she said. Road accidents and fatalities are common in Thailand due to weak enforcement of vehicle safety standards and poorly maintained roads. The Southeast Asian nation ranked ninth out of 175 World Health Organization member countries for road traffic deaths, according to its 2023 report. Last year, a school bus caught fire due to a gas cylinder leak, killing 23 people, including 16 students.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-bus-overturns-in-ditch-killing-at-least-18-passengers/7988467.html	2025-02-25T23:07:52-08:00

Thousands freed from Myanmar scam centers face slow repatriation process	WASHINGTON — A sweeping crackdown led by authorities from Thailand, China and Myanmar has dismantled scam centers along the Thai-Myanmar border and freed thousands from nearly 30 countries, but helping them return home remains a big challenge, says the spokesperson for the Karen Border Guard Force, or BGF. Over a week ago, BGF, an ally of Myanmar's military junta, played a key role in evacuating more than 6,000 people from scam centers in Myanmar's Shwe Kokko fraud hub, near the border with Thailand. Although many have been freed, the spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Naing Maung Zaw, told VOA's Burmese Service the repatriation process is complex and will remain slow. 'Originally, we planned to send 1,000 people a day, but now we are only able to send a few hundred at a time,' he said in an interview Tuesday. 'So far, 673 people have been transferred to Thailand.' Getting those rescued from scam centers to where they can be processed is part of the challenge, he said. The BGF operates in a region where local militia groups control large swaths of territory. These groups have historically maintained uneasy alliances with the Myanmar military while engaging in illicit economic activities, including human trafficking and scam operations. According to the United Nations, criminal gangs have trafficked hundreds of thousands of people, forcing them to work in Southeast Asian scam centers such as the ones in Myanmar. Thousands of the recently freed remain in temporary shelters in Myanmar, awaiting processing by Myanmar's military authorities. 'We have evacuated more than 6,000 people, but overcrowding is an issue,' spokesperson Naing Maung Zaw said. 'About 500 people are crammed into warehouses, increasing risks of disease and escape attempts.' The repatriation process involves coordinating with multiple countries, as individuals from nearly 30 nations have been found in the scam centers. 'We are prioritizing the return of those who have been rescued,' he said. 'After China, the largest number of people are from Indonesia, followed by Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Pakistan, India, Uganda, Ethiopia, Nepal, Thailand, Rwanda, Kenya, Cambodia, and Ghana — making a total of 15 countries. According to our special forces on the ground, people from other countries are also among those affected, bringing the total to nearly 30 countries.' The Thai government said it is 'working closely with Myanmar and other countries to ensure the safe return of victims. Over 7,000 rescued individuals are currently in the process of being transferred.' Raids on scam centers continue, but operations will pause at the end of February, Naing Maung Zaw said. 'It's estimated that tens of thousands are still trapped in these scam centers. It will take months to repatriate everyone,' he said. The crackdown is a response to growing international pressure, particularly from China. On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Public Security announced the repatriation of 200 nationals rescued from Myanmar’s scam hubs, with more expected to follow. However, according to Xinhua, these individuals are being referred to as 'suspects in call center fraud,' suggesting that China views them as potential criminals rather than victims. The operation is being overseen by Liu Zhongyi, China's assistant minister of public security, who has been coordinating efforts with Thai and Myanmar officials to dismantle the criminal networks. Liu emphasized that shutting down these operations is critical not only for ensuring the safety of Chinese citizens but also for curbing organized crime across the region. China's role in cybercrime crackdown China has taken a leading role in dismantling cyber scam networks operating along the Thailand-Myanmar border, leveraging diplomatic pressure and regional cooperation with both countries. The crackdown intensified, with Thai authorities cutting gas and oil supplies to Myanmar earlier this month and deploying military units to weaken criminal syndicates. On Feb. 5, the Thai authorities cut electricity, fuel, and internet supplies to several Myanmar border towns known to host scam operations. This action aimed to disrupt the infrastructure supporting these illicit activities. Additionally, Thai military units were deployed to the border area to further weaken the criminal syndicates operating there. China’s Ministry of Public Security confirmed the repatriation of 200 Chinese nationals from Myanmar, labeling them as suspects in telecom fraud. The ministry stated that over 800 more would be repatriated soon as part of a joint effort with Myanmar and Thailand to combat transnational cybercrime. Jason Tower, the Myanmar country director for the U.S. Institute of Peace, has been monitoring transnational cybercrime for nearly a decade. He told VOA in an interview Monday that 'the campaign is the most aggressive crackdown seen along the Thailand–Myanmar border.' Previous short-term disruptions, such as power and internet cuts, that once lasted only a few weeks, have now been replaced with sustained pressure, he said. 'The Thai military's presence and comprehensive cuts on electricity, internet, gas and oil have created significant challenges for these criminal networks,' he said. China has played a crucial role in coordinating regional efforts, pushing for tougher actions against cybercrime syndicates. 'A surge in social media outcry over high-profile trafficking cases has given Beijing the political capital to demand cross-border cooperation,' Tower said. While repatriation efforts continue, Tower said, dismantling the infrastructure linked to organized crime is equally critical. 'Without sustained pressure and intelligence-sharing, these criminal networks will continue to adapt and thrive,' he warned. Meanwhile, China has taken legal action against key figures over their alleged involvement in transnational cybercrime. Influential in the Myanmar town of Kokang, the Ming family, accused of colluding with cross-border scammers, was publicly tried in Wenzhou, China, last week, according to AFP. Kokang is an area in northeastern Myanmar along the southern Chinese border that is home to a Mandarin-speaking ethnic group of Chinese under the same name. The 23 defendants face charges in Wenzhou, including murder, fraud, and extortion. According to the Chinese court, they are linked to 14 Chinese deaths and illicit financial gains, exceeding $1.4 billion since 2015. Among those tried was the former head of the Kokang Administration, who was arrested in Nay Pyi Taw and handed over to China by Myanmar's junta last year. The six-day trial concluded with a verdict pending, underscoring Beijing's commitment to holding suspected major players accountable. Challenges amid ongoing crackdown Despite aggressive measures, scam syndicates continue to operate, shifting their hubs across borders. Syndicates can easily relocate to Cambodia, Laos or Dubai, Tower said. Impunity also remains a major issue. While some key figures were brought to justice in 2023-2024, many kingpins still operate freely. Since 2016, scam networks have flourished with little oversight, particularly in Cambodia, where large-scale scam centers remain active. Another challenge is repatriating trafficking victims and recovering stolen funds. Thai authorities have identified victims quickly, but returning them across multiple countries is complex. 'Without coordinated intelligence sharing, these networks will keep adapting,' Tower cautioned.

UN chief rules out UN peacekeepers for Haiti	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has ruled out transitioning the multinational security support mission (MSS) in Haiti into a U.N. peacekeeping force for now, and is instead recommending creating a U.N. support mission to back the MSS that will be funded through the U.N. peacekeeping budget. 'Such a transition could be considered, once significant progress has been made in substantially reducing gang territorial control,' Guterres said of U.N. peacekeepers, in a letter Tuesday to the U.N. Security Council and obtained by VOA. 'A realistic option is based on a dual-track strategy, with the United Nations assuming new roles to enable the MSS, the national police and Haitian authorities, to substantially reduce gang territorial control through peace enforcement,' the U.N. chief said. 'This would require a robust mandate for the use of force and the capacities to conduct targeted operations against gangs.' Guterres sent his recommendation to the Security Council on Tuesday following a request from its members to come up with a range of U.N. options. The MSS is not a U.N. mission, but it does have Security Council authorization and the U.N. oversees its financial trust fund. He suggests establishing a U.N. support office for the MSS to provide logistical and operational support. It would be paid for by the U.N. peacekeeping budget — giving it reliable funding. The secretary-general said the mission needs stronger intelligence capabilities and more equipment, and it should be reinforced with specialized police units to protect critical infrastructure, including seaports, airports, oil terminals and major roads. The island nation has been plagued by gang violence and instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. The national police are under-staffed and poorly equipped and have been unable to stop the gangs, which are terrorizing the population, especially in the capital, Port-au-Prince. A transitional government is now in place with the goal of organizing credible elections, but it has faced internal and external challenges. Late last year, the United States and then-council member Ecuador, which were co-leads on Haiti on the council, had called for the MSS to become a U.N. peacekeeping operation. But not all members agreed. China and Russia have expressed reservations about sending peacekeepers to Haiti when there is a lack of peace to keep. Haiti’s past experiences with U.N. peacekeeping missions have ended badly, and it was originally felt that a non-U.N. mission was a better idea. But a lack of funding, equipment and logistics has brought even Haiti’s struggling government around to the idea of a U.N. peacekeeping mission, which would benefit from sustainable funding and access to more resources. The MSS started deploying in June and is mandated through Oct. 2, 2025. Guterres said it recently reached the level of 1,000 personnel. They come from the Bahamas, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica and Kenya, which is leading the mission. But 1,000 is less than half of the 2,500 personnel planned for the mission. Financing has been a problem from the start. Guterres said the mission’s trust fund has $110.8 million in voluntary contributions from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, Spain, Turkey and the United States, of which $48 million has not been allocated and much more is needed. 'The MSS is slowly assuming the shape of a real multinational effort to support Haiti,' Guterres wrote. 'We must all stand behind it as an immediate and credible effort to help the Haiti’s national police beat back armed gangs, prevent their territorial expansion and protect the people of Haiti.' He added that when the MSS is fully deployed and adequately resourced it, 'represents the most viable solution to meet the medium-term goal of reducing gang territorial control.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-rules-out-un-peacekeepers-for-haiti/7988427.html	2025-02-25T19:47:56-08:00	
Pope signs decree for canonization of Venezuela's first saint	Dr. Jose Gregorio Hernandez — known as the 'doctor of the poor' — will soon become Venezuela's first saint. Pope Francis, the first South American pope, signed the decree for the canonization of Hernadez from a hospital in Rome on Tuesday. A date for his canonization has not been set. The South American country has long sought the canonization of Hernandez, who died in 1919. 'This historic event, long awaited by the Venezuelan people, is a recognition of the exemplary life and heroic virtues of a man who dedicated his existence to alleviating human suffering and transmitting a message of love and hope,' the Archdiocese of Caracas said in a statement. A petition signed by 5 million people calling for his canonization was given to Pope John Paul II when he visited Venezuela in 1996. Hernandez was born in 1864 in Isnotu, in western Venezuela. He studied in Europe and the U.S. He became known as the 'doctor of the poor' in Venezuela as he tended to patients during the Spanish flu global pandemic. In 1919, after getting medicine at a pharmacy for an impoverished woman, he was hit by a car and died, according to an Associated Press report. An estimated 20,000 people participated in his funeral procession. He was beatified, a preliminary step to sainthood, in 2021 after a miracle was attributed to him in the case of girl who had been shot in the head in 2017. Doctors had said the 10-year-old girl would suffer permanent brain damage, but the girl's mother prayed to Hernandez, and the child made a full recovery. Any miracles attributed to a potential saint must be validated by teams of doctors, theologians and cardinals. Pope Francis is reported to be in stable but critical condition. He has been hospitalized for more than a week with double pneumonia. The Vatican said that the pope received the Eucharist Tuesday morning and then 'resumed work activities.' Some information provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-signs-decree-for-canonization-of-venezuela-s-first-saint/7988421.html	2025-02-25T19:13:32-08:00	
Israel, Hamas agree on new exchange, leaving fragile ceasefire intact	JERUSALEM — Officials from Israel and Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, said Tuesday they have reached an agreement to exchange the bodies of hostages for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, keeping their fragile ceasefire intact for at least a few more days. Israel has delayed the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it says is the cruel treatment of hostages during their release by Hamas. The terrorist organization has said the delay is a 'serious violation' of their ceasefire and that talks on a second phase are not possible until they are freed. The deadlock had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires this weekend. But late Tuesday, Hamas said an agreement had been reached to resolve the dispute during a visit to Cairo by a delegation headed by Khalil al-Hayya, a top political official in the group. The breakthrough appeared to clear the way for the return of the bodies of four more hostages and hundreds of additional prisoners scheduled to be released under the ceasefire. The prisoners previously slated for release 'will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli prisoners who were agreed to be handed over,' along with the release of a new set of Palestinian prisoners, the Hamas statement said. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed an agreement to bring home the bodies in the coming days. He gave no further details. But Israeli media reports said the exchange could take place as soon as Wednesday. The Ynet news site said the Israeli bodies would be handed over to Egyptian authorities without any public ceremony. The latest agreement would complete both sides' obligations of the first phase of the ceasefire — during which Hamas is returning 33 hostages — including eight bodies — in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. It also could clear the way for an expected visit by the White House's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region. Witkoff, who is expected in the region in the coming days, has said he wants the sides to move into negotiations on the second phase, during which all remaining hostages held by Hamas are to be released and an end to the war is to be negotiated. The Phase 2 talks were supposed to begin weeks ago but did not. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of heavy fighting that erupted after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 people hostage. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population and destroyed the territory's infrastructure and health system. The Hamas-run Health Ministry says over half of the dead have been women and children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-hamas-agree-on-new-exchange-leaving-fragile-ceasefire-intact-/7988414.html	2025-02-25T18:58:36-08:00	
8 sentenced to death for murder of Tunisia opposition leader	TUNIS, TUNISIA — A Tunisian court sentenced eight defendants to death on Tuesday over the 2013 assassination of leftist opposition figure Mohamed Brahmi, according to local reports. Charges included 'attempting to change the state's nature' and 'inciting armed conflict,' local media reported. Three of the defendants also received additional death sentences for 'deliberate participation in premeditated murder,' according to the reports. A ninth, who is on the run, was sentenced to five years in prison for 'failing to report terrorist crimes to the authorities,' said the reports. Tunisia still hands down death sentences, particularly in 'terrorism' cases, even though a de facto moratorium in effect since 1991 means they are effectively commuted to life terms. The verdict marked the first set of rulings in the case of Brahmi's assassination, which took place outside his home on July 25, 2013, amid Tunisia's turbulent post-revolution political landscape. Demonstrators took to the streets across the country, as Brahmi's distinctive round face and thick mustache became symbols of protest against militant violence. Brahmi, a nationalist left-wing leader of the People's Movement and member of Tunisia's Constituent Assembly, was an outspoken critic of the Islamist-inspired government dominated by Ennahdha at the time. His assassination further shocked the nation as it came less than six months after the killing of another prominent leftist figure, Chokri Belaid, who was also gunned down outside his home. Brahmi had been elected in Sidi Bouzid, the birthplace of the 2011 revolution that toppled ex-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and later swept through the Arab world. He was shot 14 times by two assailants in front of his wife and children. His family had long accused Ennahdha of being behind the murder, but the then-ruling party denied the allegations. It had also pushed back against accusations of excessive leniency, blacklisting the formerly legal Salafist movement Ansar al-Charia as a terrorist organization. Fighters affiliated with the Islamic State claimed responsibility for both the Brahmi and Belaid assassinations. The aftermath of the 2011 revolution saw a surge in Islamist radicalism in Tunisia with thousands of volunteers leaving to fight in Syria, Iraq and neighboring Libya. Tunisia faced heightened security threats, with armed groups operating from the Chaambi Mountains near the Algerian border, primarily targeting security forces and the military. In 2015, attacks in Sousse and the capital Tunis killed dozens of tourists and police, although authorities say they have since made significant progress against the extremists. In recent years, Tunisian authorities claim significant progress in combating violence, but the country remains under a state of emergency. In 2022, President Kais Saied — who has framed the murders of Brahmi and Belaid as national issues and often called them 'martyrs' — dismissed dozens of judges after alleging they had obstructed investigations. The high-profile killings, and the mass protests they drew, ultimately forced Ennahdha to relinquish power to a technocratic government following the adoption of a new constitution. The crisis had nearly derailed Tunisia's fragile democratic transition. But political dialogue led by four civil society organizations, including the Tunisian General Labour Union, helped restore stability and earned the nation of 12 million the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sentenced-to-death-for-murder-of-tunisia-opposition-leader-/7988404.html	2025-02-25T18:43:37-08:00	
Nominee for No. 2 spot at Pentagon warns China 'incredibly determined' to surpass US	PENTAGON — President Donald Trump's nominee for deputy secretary of defense is warning that China's military is resolute on surpassing the United States and is calling for a fix to 'significant' military shortages at a time when administration leaders are trying to make big budget cuts. 'China is incredibly determined, they feel a great sense of urgency, and they'll be fully dedicated to becoming the strongest nation in the world and having dominance over the United States,' Steve Feinberg told members of the Senate Armed Service Committee on Tuesday. Feinberg, a businessman and investor, said the U.S. military shortages include 'shipbuilding, nuclear modernization, aircraft development, cyber defense, hypersonics, counter space, defending our satellites [and] counter drones.' 'We really need to plug these shortages, focus on our priorities, get rid of legacy programs, be very disciplined, while at the same time focusing on the economics. If we do that, given America's great innovative capability, entrepreneurship, we will defeat China. If we don't, our very national security is at risk,' Feinberg said. The hearing comes as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called on the department to cut 8% — roughly $50 billion — to reinvest in priorities aligned with a 'more lethal fighting force.' Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Tuesday pushed back against the move saying, 'Slashing the defense budget will not create efficiency in our military. It will cripple it.' The concern about cuts to the military has echoed on both sides of the aisle. Republican committee Chairman Roger Wicker told the Breaking Defense news organization last month that he hoped to increase defense spending by as much as $200 billion in coming years. And Republican Senator Dan Sullivan on Tuesday called for prioritizing solutions to shipbuilding to counter threats from China and others. 'We're in the worst crisis in shipbuilding in over 40 years. The Chinese are building a giant navy. It's already bigger than ours,' he said. China's military has about 370 warships, according to the Pentagon's latest China Military Power Report, while the U.S. military has about 300. Feinberg acknowledged that the shipbuilding shortage is 'a tough problem' for the military. 'Our supply chain is definitely weak. Our workforce needs to be improved. But a big piece of improving our supply chain is working more closely with our private sector. We have companies that can get at where our needs are, where our shortages are, and we need to work more closely with them. We need people inside of government that understand their issues,' Feinberg said. Several Democrats on the committee were critical of interference at the Pentagon by the Department of Government Efficiency, saying it could create a major vulnerability should its members not handle data more carefully. 'They [DOGE] just sent an unclassified email with CIA recent hire names in an unclassified space. As a former CIA officer, you just blew the cover of someone who was going to risk their life abroad to protect our country,' said Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin. 'Do you know how appetizing it is for our adversaries to have this data? ... It is quite literally an issue of safety and security,' she added. Democrats also raised concern about plans to let go more than 5,000 Pentagon civilian employees this week, while Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin countered that cutting 5,000 jobs amounted to less than 0.5% of the workforce. 'Our national debt is now costing us more to just pay interest than we spend on our military. That's a huge national security risk,' he said. 'And so, at what point do we start making cuts?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nominee-for-no-2-spot-at-pentagon-warns-china-incredibly-determined-to-surpass-us/7988386.html	2025-02-25T17:55:45-08:00	
Ukraine, US agree on a framework economic deal, Ukrainian officials say	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine and the United States have reached an agreement on a framework for a broad economic deal that would include access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals, three senior Ukrainian officials said Tuesday. The officials, who were familiar with the matter, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. One of them said Kyiv hopes that signing the agreement will ensure the continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs. President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, said he'd heard that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was coming and added that 'it's OK with me, if he'd like to, and he would like to sign it together with me.' The agreement could be signed as early as Friday and plans are being drawn up for Zelenskyy to travel to Washington to meet Trump, according to one of the Ukrainian officials. Another official said the agreement would provide an opportunity for Zelenskyy and Trump to discuss continued military aid to Ukraine, which is why Kyiv is eager to finalize the deal. Trump called it 'a very big deal,' adding that it could be worth 1 trillion dollars. 'It could be whatever, but it's rare earths and other things.' According to one Ukrainian official, some technical details are still to be worked out. However, the draft does not include a contentious Trump administration proposal to give the U.S. $500 billion worth of profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for its wartime assistance to Kyiv. Instead, the U.S. and Ukraine would have joint ownership of a fund, and Ukraine would in the future contribute 50 percent of future proceeds from state-owned resources, including minerals, oil, and gas. One official said the deal had better terms of investments and another one said that Kyiv secured favorable amendments and viewed the outcome as 'positive.' The deal does not, however, include security guarantees. One official said that this would be something the two presidents would discuss when they meet. The progress in negotiating the deal comes after Trump and Zelenskyy traded sharp rhetoric last week about their differences over the matter. Zelenskyy said he balked at signing off on a deal that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed during a visit to Kyiv earlier this month, and the Ukrainian leader objected again days later during a meeting in Munich with Vice President JD Vance because the American proposal did not include security guarantees. Trump then called Volodymyr Zelenskyy 'a dictator without elections' and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom. But the two sides made significant progress during a three-day visit to Ukraine last week by retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia. The idea was initially proposed last fall by Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv's hand in future negotiations with Moscow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-us-agree-on-a-framework-economic-deal-ukrainian-officials-say-/7988354.html	2025-02-25T17:21:43-08:00	
South Korean president's impeachment trial ends with denial of wrongdoing	South Korea's Constitutional Court on Tuesday heard the last of the oral arguments in President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment trial. The court's decision on whether Yoon will be reinstated or removed from office is expected by mid-March. Yoon has denied that he did anything wrong when he declared martial law on Dec. 3. In his closing statement Tuesday, he defended the declaration, saying it was a 'proclamation that the nation was facing an existential crisis.' He told the court that 'external forces, including North Korea, along with anti-state elements within our society' were 'working together to seriously threaten our national security and sovereignty.' The liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached Yoon, a conservative, after his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law decree. They accused Yoon of taking the extraordinary measure, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war, without proper justification. In his statement, Yoon said he 'could no longer neglect a do-or-die crisis facing this country' and that he had 'tried to inform the people of these anti-state acts of wickedness by the mammoth opposition party and appealed to the people to stop it with their surveillance and criticism.' Yoon had said the opposition parties blocked a revision to an anti-espionage law, preventing the prosecution of foreign nationals spying on South Korea. 'This was never a decision made for my personal benefit,' he told the court Tuesday. The ruling People Power Party (PPP) pushed for an amendment to the law to broaden its scope from targeting 'enemy states' to include 'foreign countries,' citing threats posed by Chinese espionage. The opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) blocked the revision for fear of potential misuse of the law. Yoon also was arrested last month and indicted on rebellion charges after his declaration. The charges carry possible penalties that include life imprisonment or a death sentence. After declaring martial law, Yoon ordered troops and police officers into the National Assembly where lawmakers were gathering to veto his decree. He said it was not his intention to prevent the lawmakers, who unanimously voted against the decree, from doing their work. He said he deployed the security forces to maintain law and order. However, some commanders of the forces sent to the assembly told investigators and assembly hearings that they were ordered to drag the lawmakers from the assembly. An opposition lawyer had an emotional reaction to that tactic at the impeachment trial, telling the court, 'As a citizen and a father, I feel a sense of rage and betrayal toward Yoon, who tried to turn my son into a martial law soldier.' If Yoon's impeachment is upheld by the court, a new election must be held within 60 days. VOA’s Christy Lee contributed to this article.

US expands visa restrictions on Cubans tied to labor export program	WASHINGTON/HAVANA — The United States has expanded a visa restriction policy to target Cuban officials believed to be tied to a labor program that sends Cuban workers overseas, particularly health care workers, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Tuesday. Cuba's health service generates major export earnings by sending doctors and health workers around the world. In a statement, Rubio said the expanded restrictions target individuals and immediate family members of individuals believed to be responsible for the program, which he described as 'forced labor.' The U.S. has already imposed restrictions on several people, including some Venezuelans, he added. Cuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodriguez, lashed out at the restrictions, calling the measure part of Rubio's 'personal agenda' and unjustified. 'Suspension of visas associated with Cuba's international medical cooperation agreements represents the seventh measure of unjustified aggression against our population in a month,' Rodriguez said on X. The decision to restrict visas for those involved with Cuban medical missions is the latest significant escalation in U.S. policy toward Cuba since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Rubio has signaled a tough new stance on the communist-run island, reversing a last-minute effort by the Biden administration to loosen sanctions on long-time foe Cuba and complicating money transfers to the island. Rubio, a former U.S. senator and the son of immigrants who came to Florida from Cuba in the 1950s, has long opposed more normal relations with Havana, dating back to the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama. Rubio on Tuesday branded the labor programs as self-serving and abusive. 'Cuba's labor export programs, which include the medical missions, enrich the Cuban regime, and in the case of Cuba's overseas medical missions, deprive ordinary Cubans of the medical care they desperately need in their home country,' Rubio said. Cuba has for decades rejected such accusations. Since its 1959 leftist revolution, Cuba has dispatched an 'army of white coats' to disaster sites and disease outbreaks around the world in the name of solidarity. In the last decade, they have fought cholera in Haiti and Ebola in West Africa. But Cuba has also exported doctors on more routine missions in exchange for cash or goods in recent decades, an increasingly critical source of hard currency in a nation suffering a deep economic crisis. The United States and Cuba have had a strained relationship since Fidel Castro took over in the 1959 revolution, and a U.S. trade embargo has been in place for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-expands-visa-restrictions-on-cubans-tied-to-labor-export-program-/7988318.html	2025-02-25T16:50:57-08:00	
US Embassy tracks 3 Americans on death row in Democratic Republic of Congo	STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States says its embassy in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to attend legal proceedings and closely follow developments in the case of three detained U.S. citizens who face the death penalty. The U.S. State Department declined to comment on whether negotiations are underway to secure their release. Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler, noted in a social media post that the three Americans are still being held by the DRC government. In September 2024, a military court in the DRC sentenced 37 people to death, including three Americans — Tyler Thompson Jr., Marcel Malanga and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun — for their role in a failed coup in the Central African nation in May 2024. A State Department spokesperson told VOA on Monday, 'The United States supports DRC authorities upholding a fair and transparent legal process,' adding that U.S. Ambassador to Congo Lucy Tamlyn and embassy staff in Kinshasa have been communicating with their counterparts at the highest levels of the DRC government throughout the process. The U.S. State Department has not declared the three Americans to be wrongfully detained. 'The Department continuously reviews the circumstances surrounding the detentions of U.S. nationals overseas, including those in the DRC, for indicators that they are wrongful,' the State Department spokesperson said. 'When making these assessments, the Department looks at the totality of the circumstances for each case individually,' the spokesperson added, noting that the Secretary of State has the ultimate authority to determine whether a case qualifies as a wrongful detention. Once the U.S. government designates an American detained abroad as wrongfully detained, the case must be transferred from the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs to the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. The U.S. government is then required to actively seek the release of wrongfully detained Americans. The State Department refrained from commenting on whether discussions are in progress to repatriate the three American citizens. 'Due to privacy and other considerations, we have no further comment,' said the spokesperson. Minerals for peace? Meanwhile, DRC President Felix Tshisekedi has reportedly proposed granting the United States access to its vast mineral resources as an incentive for U.S. intervention to help end the conflict in eastern Congo, where Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have captured two provincial capitals — Goma and Bukavu — and other territory. Rwanda continues to deny backing the group in the face of evidence presented by United Nations experts and human rights groups. The United States has called on Rwanda’s leaders to end their support for M23 and to respect the DRC’s sovereignty. In a social media post on X on Sunday, Tshisekedi’s spokesperson, Tina Salama, shared a photo from a recent meeting between the Congolese President and Trump’s envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell. The post indicated that a proposal on DRC's rich mineral resources was 'revealed' during the meeting. She said Tshisekedi 'invites' the U.S. to buy minerals directly from Congo instead of sourcing looted resources through Rwanda. The State Department did not respond to questions from VOA about whether a mineral deal was in offered in the meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-embassy-tracks-3-americans-on-death-row-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/7988019.html	2025-02-25T16:48:59-08:00

Trump turns eye on China's copper production	WHITE HOUSE — China's growing copper reserves have caught the eye of President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday ordered an investigation into what administration officials say is Beijing's move to 'gain control of the world's copper markets.' Trump, in the Oval Office, asked his newly minted secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, to explain. Lutnick read from what he said was a social media post he planned to release, saying: 'Tariffs will help rebuild back our American copper industry and strengthen our national defense. American industries depend on copper, and they should be made in America. No exemptions, no exceptions. America first creates American jobs and protects our national security. It's time for copper to come home.' Earlier in the day, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing explained the administration's concerns. 'China has long used industrial overcapacity and dumping as an economic weapon to dominate global markets, systematically undercutting competitors and driving rival industries out of business by massively subsidizing key industries, flooding international markets with below-cost goods and then consolidating control once competitors collapse,' Peter Navarro said in a call with reporters ahead of the signing. 'China has successfully expanded its economic influence in sectors ranging from steel and aluminum to solar panels and electric vehicles.' Trump's order jumpstarts an investigation under the authority of the Trade Expansion Act, which focuses on whether importation of a certain item presents a threat to national security. The president can decide whether to follow the recommendations of the report, due in 270 days. China's government released a report earlier this month where they laid out a plan to increase copper ore reserves by 5% to 10% by 2027. Chinese government figures state that in 2024, China topped the world in the production of both refined copper and copper-processed materials. Navarro told reporters the U.S. hopes to do more with the nation's 'untapped' copper potential and cited plans to boost U.S. production by 70% and reduce external reliance on the material vital for electrical equipment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-turns-eye-on-china-s-copper-production/7988338.html	2025-02-25T16:31:53-08:00

VOA Russian: Russia's economy growth is forecast to stall	Three years since the beginning of the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has continued to grow because of its rampant defense spending. VOA Russian spoke with the experts who predict the defense-based growth is unsustainable and about to hit the ceiling as both industrial capacities and workforce are at near maximums. Thousands of Western sanctions imposed on Moscow also have hit certain sectors of the Russian economy, particularly damaging Gazprom, the car industry and aviation.

Blackout hits Chile, leaving millions without power	SANTIAGO, CHILE — A sweeping blackout hit Chile on Tuesday, stranding commuters, knocking out traffic lights, paralyzing countless businesses and leaving millions of people across the South American nation without power. The National Electrical Coordinator, Chile's grid operator, said a disruption had occurred in a high-voltage transmission line that carries power from the Atacama Desert of northern Chile to the capital of Santiago in the country's central valley. It did not say what actually caused the disruption that pushed much of the country's power grid into shutdown, from the northernmost Chilean port of Arica to the southern Los Lagos agricultural region. Chile's national disaster response service, Senapred, reported that a 'disruption in the supply of electricity' had provoked a 'massive power outage' across 14 of the country's 16 regions, including Santiago, a city of some 8.4 million people, where authorities said there would be no subway service until further notice. Interior Minister Carolina Toha said hospitals, prisons and government buildings were switching on backup generators to keep essential equipment operating. In a press conference, Toha urged the public to stay calm and said officials were racing to put the grid back in operation and restore electric service across the country of some 19 million people. 'It's affecting the entire electrical system of the country,' she said of the breakdown in the 500-kV backbone transmission line. Toha said if all areas didn't return to normal by sunset, the government would take emergency measures to avert a crisis. One of the country's main electricity distributors, Saesa, which serves more than 1 million people across Chile, confirmed that all of its customers had experienced the power failure. Officials said they were evacuating passengers from darkened tunnels and subway stations in Santiago and elsewhere in the country, including the coastal tourist hot spot of Valparaiso. Videos on social media from all over Chile, a long ribbon of a country stretching 4,300 kilometers (more than 2,600 miles) along the southern Pacific coast, showed chaos at intersections with no functioning traffic lights, people having to use their mobile phones as flashlights in the underground metro and police dispatched to help evacuate office buildings. Transport Minister Juan Carlos Munoz urged people to stay home, saying it's 'not a good time to go out since we have a transport system that is not operating normally.' At the very most, he said, just 27% of city traffic lights are working. Mobile phone services also blinkered offline in parts of the country. Authorities at Santiago International Airport said terminals had switched to emergency power to keep flights operating as usual.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blackout-hits-chile-leaving-millions-without-power-/7988065.html	2025-02-25T16:16:11-08:00	
Apple shareholders reject proposal to scrap company's diversity programs	Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the technology trendsetter into joining President Donald Trump's push to scrub corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce. The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy Research — a self-described conservative think tank — urged Apple to follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the Trump administration's crosshairs. After a brief presentation about the anti-DEI proposal, Apple announced shareholders had rejected it. In a regulatory filing submitted Tuesday evening, Apple disclosed that 97% of the ballots cast were votes against the measure. The outcome vindicated Apple management's decision to stand behind its diversity commitment even though Trump asked the U.S. Department of Justice to look into whether these types of programs have discriminated against some employees whose race or gender aren't aligned with the initiative's goals. But Apple CEO Tim Cook has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump since his first term in office, an alliance that so far has helped the company skirt tariffs on its iPhones made in China. After Cook and Trump met last week, Apple on Monday announced it will invest $500 billion in the U.S. and create 20,000 more jobs during the next four years — a commitment applauded by the president. Tuesday's shareholder vote came a month after the same group presented a similar proposal during Costco's annual meeting, only to have it overwhelmingly rejected, too. That snub didn't discourage the National Center for Public Policy Research from confronting Apple about its DEI program in a pre-recorded presentation by Stefan Padfield, executive director of the think tank's Free Enterprise Project, who asserted 'forced diversity is bad for business.' In the presentation, Padfield attacked Apple's diversity commitments for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential lawsuits for alleged discrimination. He cited the Trump administration as one of Apple's potential legal adversaries. 'The vibe shift is clear: DEI is out, and merit is in,' Padfield said in the presentation. The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against Target alleging the retailer's recently scaled-back DEI program alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of shareholders. Just as Costco does, Apple contends that fostering a diverse workforce makes good business sense. But Cook conceded Apple may have to make some adjustments to its diversity program 'as the legal landscape changes' while still striving to maintain a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current market value of $3.7 trillion — greater than any other business in the world. 'We will continue to create a culture of belonging,' Cook told shareholders during the meeting. In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple disclosed that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees were men. Other major technology companies for years have reported employing mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs — a tendency that spurred the industry to pursue largely unsuccessful efforts to diversify.	https://www.voanews.com/a/apple-shareholders-reject-proposal-to-scrap-company-s-diversity-programs/7988035.html	2025-02-25T15:09:46-08:00	
Kremlin disinformation campaigns aim to discredit French military in Sahel, analysts say	On Feb. 20, Ivory Coast became the latest African nation to expel French troops, taking control of the last remaining French military base in the country. This followed the departure of French forces from Chad, which had hosted them for nearly 70 years. These moves marked the end of France's military presence in the Sahel region, after the expulsions from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, all ruled by military juntas. Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby called the French withdrawal a 'new dawn for a fully sovereign Chad.' Nigerian Senator Shehu Sani, with 3.3 million followers on X, claimed, 'The French forces are of no use,' contradicting the statistical data. Since France began withdrawing in 2022, conflict-related fatalities in the Sahel have risen by 65%, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). Analysts point to Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns as key drivers of the shift away from France in the Sahel. Bakary Sambe of the Timbuktu Institute told VOA that Russia has exploited anti-imperialist sentiment and historical colonial grievances to turn public opinion in Africa against France. The military leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, after expelling French forces, have increasingly aligned with Russia, which has deployed Wagner mercenaries across the region. Human rights groups have accused Russian troops in Africa of committing abuses against civilians. As French forces departed Chad, identical pro-Russian messages circulated on social media, often from influencers known for pushing anti-Western narratives. X content creators including African Hub, Typical African and RT News India echoed the sentiment, framing the French withdrawal as the end of colonial exploitation, dating back to the French invasion in 1900. All three accounts posted a video of French troops' departure from Chad with identical wording that described it as France's 'final humiliation.' The Africa Center for Strategic Studies, affiliated with the U.S. Defense Department, notes that Russia is the primary source of disinformation in Africa, with over 80 documented campaigns targeting more than 20 countries. These campaigns leverage paid African influencers, digital avatars and manipulated media to fuel anti-Western sentiment. The ''Russian embassies appear to have helped set up a network of ostensibly African grassroots front organizations,'' the Africa Center said. These disinformation campaigns 'employ paid African influencers, digital avatars, and the circulation of fake and out-of-context videos and photographs. These messages copy-and-paste from and are amplified through multiple channels of Russian state-controlled media, radio, and official communications, creating the repetitive echo chambers in which disinformation narratives become rote,'' the Africa Center reported. The Africa Digital Democracy Observatory (ADDO) tracks how digital tools shape public opinion in Africa, noting the influence of prominent pan-Africanist figures such as Kemi Seba and Nathalie Yamb. The U.S. State Department said Seba was closely working with Russian political operatives linked to the now deceased oligarch and Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, seeking to influence elections in Madagascar. Yamb has been involved in Russian-backed activities, including attending the 2019 Russia-Africa summit. During the 2023 Niger coup, Russian content creators falsely claimed that ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) was planning an invasion of Niger, a narrative debunked by ECOWAS leaders. Russia has also expanded its cultural influence in the Sahel, establishing 'Russian Houses' across the region. In N'djamena, Chad's capital, VOA's Henry Wilkins visited one such 'Russian House' last month. Unlike Western cultural institutes, these Russian centers are involved in propaganda efforts, with some training journalists to spread anti-Western disinformation, Wilkins reported. The Russian Embassy in Chad and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to VOA requests for comment. Russia's goal, according to Constantin Gouvy of the Clingendael Institute, is to replace Western powers such as France as the primary partner for the Sahel states using disinformation to destabilize the region. Sambe of the Timbuktu Institute suggests that Russia's actions in Africa are a form of retaliation against NATO, particularly France, for its role in European geopolitics.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kremlin-disinformation-campaigns-aim-to-discredit-french-military-in-the-sahel-analysts-say-/7988010.html	2025-02-25T14:57:41-08:00	
Pentagon chief tours Guantanamo Bay as more detainees arrive	Washington — More migrants slated for deportation from the United States have arrived at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, just as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited the naval base to get an update on mass deportation efforts. A U.S. cargo plane carrying nine migrants from Fort Bliss in Texas landed at Guantanamo Bay midday Tuesday, a U.S. defense official told VOA. A second official said all nine passengers are considered 'high threat illegal aliens,' and they were taken to the detention center there. A third official said that an additional flight carrying more migrants was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. All of the officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity since they were not authorized to discuss the deportation operations. The new detainees join another 17 detainees sent from Fort Bliss to Guantanamo Bay on Sunday. Neither the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has so far responded to questions about the identities of the detainees, their countries of origin or the crimes with which they are charged. Tuesday's flight carrying detainees from the U.S. mainland to the naval base in Cuba is the second since ICE last Thursday deported 177 detainees who had been brought to Guantanamo Bay earlier this month. Of the 177, officials had said that more than 120 were dangerous criminals, including members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. The other 50 or so individuals had been held at the base's migrant facility, designed to hold nonviolent individuals. Hegseth on Tuesday shared photos of his visit to the base on his X social media account, praising U.S. troops there for their support of U.S. deportation efforts. 'These warriors are directly supporting the apprehension and deportation of dangerous illegal aliens,' he wrote in one post. 'We cannot thank them or their families enough.' The commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers earlier this month that the base's migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500 nonviolent detainees. Efforts were underway to allow it to house as many as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation. U.S. deportation efforts have sparked criticism from immigration rights groups. Earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union and several other organizations filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility before being deported Thursday had been improperly denied access to lawyers. DHS dismissed the lawsuit's allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-tours-guantanamo-bay-as-more-detainees-arrive/7987965.html	2025-02-25T14:14:59-08:00	
House leader works to secure enough votes to pass US budget	WASHINGTON — A partial U.S. government shutdown appeared increasingly likely Tuesday afternoon as U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson worked to secure every single vote in the Republican conference to pass a spending bill. With the slimmest of majorities, Johnson cannot afford to lose a single vote. 'We promised to deliver President Trump's full agenda, not just a part of it. Not just a little bit of it now and return for the rest,' Johnson told reporters Tuesday. But several members of the House Republican conference are still concerned about the size of the spending measure, how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts, and how to pay down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety net programs that help American voters. Senate leadership has proposed passing the tax cuts in a separate bill later this year. 'Not only are we working to find savings for the American taxpayer, a better, more efficient use of their dollar, which we are morally obligated to do, we also have a moral obligation to bend the curve on the debt,' Johnson said. President Donald Trump has called for lawmakers to pass 'one big, beautiful bill' that will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy agenda. Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House of Representatives version of the budget, the Senate passed a funding resolution Friday that provides $150 billion in military funding and $175 billion for border security. That measure also avoids the controversial Medicaid cuts of the House version. Republican Representative Tony Gonzales led a group of seven other House Republicans warning against potential cuts to health care program Medicaid, food assistance funding and other social safety net programs. 'Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing homes are already struggling to keep their doors open,' the lawmakers said in a letter to Johnson last week. Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, also said he would vote no on the version of the budget up for a vote. Several House Republicans have not yet announced their votes on the measure. Congressional Democrats also object to the Republican tax cut proposal, arguing it would harm lower-income and middle-class Americans who are already concerned about the cost of living and inflation. In a 'Dear Colleagues' letter sent Monday morning, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote, 'Far-right extremists are determined to push through $4.5 trillion of tax breaks for wealthy Republican donors and well-connected corporations, explode the debt and saddle everyday Americans with the bill by ending Medicaid as we know it. We must be at full strength to enhance our opportunity to stop the GOP Tax Scam in its tracks.' Trump posted on Truth Social last week that 'The House and Senate are doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!' If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees temporarily without pay and suspending some nonessential government services. Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not rule out the possibility of another short-term spending bill to give lawmakers more time to work. 'We're keeping all the options on the table, but we are running out of time,' Thune told reporters Tuesday. The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House version. The two versions will have to be compromised to be signed into law. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a first step toward hurting voters. 'Make no mistake, it will rob seniors, kids and the disabled to pay for the rich to get richer. It's wrong. We're going to use every lever we have at our disposal to lift up the concerns that we are hearing from our constituents, band together and organize with them and fight to stop this tax break for billionaires,' Schumer told reporters Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-speaker-works-to-secure-enough-votes-to-pass-budget-avoid-partial-government-shutdown/7987938.html	2025-02-25T14:13:44-08:00	
UN warns two-state solution for Israelis, Palestinians ‘withering away’	UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations’ top official for the Middle East warned Tuesday that the window may be closing on the possibility of achieving a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. 'The people of the region can emerge from this period with peace, security and dignity,' Sigrid Kaag, special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council. 'However, this may be our last chance to achieve the two-state solution.' She later told reporters that the impacts of conflict, the situation in Gaza, the expansion of Israeli settlements and threats of annexation of the West Bank are pushing a two-state solution further away. 'So, it's also my intent to remind the council that statements are one thing, but we need action,' she said. 'And it's the two-state solution as a viable solution, geographically, is withering away before our very eyes. And words themselves won't solve it. It needs active political engagement and diplomacy.' In the council, Kaag expressed alarm about the expansion of Israeli military operations in the West Bank that began on Jan. 21, particularly in Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarm. 'Israeli forces have deployed airstrikes and other heavy weapons, while Palestinian militants have used improvised explosive devices and carried out shooting attacks,' she said. 'This takes place alongside continued violence and intimidation by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and attacks by Palestinians against Israelis. Gaza ceasefire On Gaza, Kaag said the three-phase ceasefire and hostage release deal must be implemented and the resumption of fighting avoided at all costs. 'I call on both sides to fully honor their commitments to the ceasefire deal and conclude negotiations for the second phase,' she said. 'I commend the mediators — Egypt, Qatar and the United States — for their steadfast work in securing the first phase and pursuing the second phase.' The acting U.S. ambassador said the Trump administration is continuing its work to ensure full implementation of the deal. 'Hamas still holds 63 hostages, including New Jersey native Idan Alexander and the remains of four Americans murdered by Hamas in Gaza,' Ambassador Dorothy Shea said of the U.S.-designated terror group. 'As long as Hamas stands as a force that can govern, or as a force that can administer, or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible,' she said. 'Hamas must be eliminated. It must be eradicated.' Israel’s ambassador agreed, saying Israel would continue to act. 'We will not be deterred. We will eliminate Hamas,' Danny Danon told council members. 'Believe me when I say it. We will bring our people home, and we will secure the safety and future of Israel.' Pressed further on whether that includes resuming the fighting, Danon told reporters that is one option, but other options are also being discussed. He referenced as an example a deal that saw Palestine Liberation Organization fighters leave Lebanon to Tunisia, following Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon in pursuit of them. 'But the end game will be no Hamas in Gaza,' he said. Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour expressed concern that the first phase of the ceasefire will expire in days with no firm agreement on the second phase. 'For the U.S., the conclusion of this agreement and its implementation is about the hostages. But for Israel, was it?' Mansour said to the council. 'The next few days yet again test its true priorities. Will they destroy the ceasefire and resume fighting? Or will they — will all of you, will all of us — make the ceasefire permanent to save lives?' Israeli hostage appeal Noa Argamani, a young Israeli woman kidnapped from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023, and held hostage for eight months by Hamas in Gaza before her rescue by the Israeli military, appealed for the parties to fully implement the three phases of the fragile ceasefire deal so all remaining hostages, living and dead, are released. She said her partner, Avinatan Or, who was also taken captive, is not eligible for release until the second phase of the deal. 'Work hard to get everyone home now,' Argamani told the Security Council, the first time a former Oct. 7 hostage has directly addressed the council. She said the remaining hostages 'are in hell' and 'deserve to come back home.' Under the terms of the deal agreed upon in mid-January, the first stage of 42 days will expire this Saturday. Local news reports say 30 Israeli and foreign hostages have been released, plus the remains of four slain captives, including two children. Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners have also been released. Israel’s military has pulled back to the edges of Gaza, and Palestinians have begun returning to their homes in the north of the Gaza Strip, which was previously off-limits. The second phase is expected to see the remaining male hostages freed, including soldiers, in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners. And in the third phase, the bodies of dead Israeli hostages are expected to be exchanged for dead Palestinian fighters. Argamani warned that 'every second in captivity is dangerous.' 'This is why it is absolutely critical that we end this terrible tragedy. Without immediate action, many more innocent people will be killed,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-two-state-solution-for-israelis-palestinians-withering-away/7987942.html	2025-02-25T14:12:45-08:00	
AU, Somalia agree on troop numbers for new mission	The federal government of Somalia and the African Union have agreed on the number of troop-contributing countries for a new AU mission following weeks of differences between Ethiopia and Somalia, and later on between Somalia and Burundi over the number of troops coming from each country. An AU official, who requested anonymity because he does not have authorization to speak with media, told VOA that Burundian forces who have been in Somalia since 2007 will be leaving the country after the two governments disagreed on the number of troops coming from Burundi. The African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia, or AUSSOM, is expected to have 11,900 personnel operating on the ground in Somalia, including soldiers, police and civilian support staff, according to Somali and AU officials. The new arrangement allocates 4,500 soldiers to Uganda, 2,500 to Ethiopia, 1,520 to Djibouti, 1,410 to Kenya and 1,091 to Egypt, according to the official. A second AU diplomat who requested anonymity for the same reasons told VOA that the negotiations about Burundian soldiers in Somalia are still ongoing. 'The departure of Burundi would have significant political and financial repercussions for the AU,' the second diplomat said. 'In addition, there is still a major issue of funding for AUSSOM that has not been resolved. Burundi sacrificed a lot, and they deserve to have their concerns addressed,' he added. There will also be several hundred police personnel from Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Egypt, to be based in Mogadishu, Jowhar, and Baidoa. The completion of the troop-contributing countries was delayed by diplomatic tension between Somalia and landlocked Ethiopia over the latter’s controversial sea access deal with Somaliland on Jan. 1, 2024. Mogadishu protested the deal as a 'violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Somaliland is a breakaway region of Somalia. The tensions eased after the two sides reached a breakthrough agreement on Dec. 11 in Ankara with the mediation of Turkey, where they pledged to end their differences. This week, Somalia and Ethiopia signed an agreement that secured the participation of Ethiopian troops in the new African Union mission in Somalia. The agreement followed a visit to Mogadishu over the weekend by an Ethiopian delegation led by military chief Field Marshal Birhanu Jula, accompanied by Ethiopian intelligence chief Redwan Hussien, where they met with their Somali counterparts, General Odawa Yusuf Rage and Abdullahi Mohamed Ali Sanbalolshe. State media in Somalia and Ethiopia both confirmed the visit. Somalia’s National News Agency, or SONNA, said the talks focused on counterterrorism, regional stability and the role of Ethiopian forces in AUSSOM. 'The chiefs underscored the role of ENDF (Ethiopian National Defense Force) in African Union peace support operations and agreed on the Force disposition of ENDF in the African Union Support and Stabilization mission in Somalia (AUSSOM),' said a communique published by SONNA. Ethiopian troops will be deployed to the same Somali regions where they were stationed over the years — Gedo, Bay, Bakool and Hiran regions. The only new troops joining the mission will come from Egypt, which supported Somalia in Mogadishu's dispute with Ethiopia. Ethiopia also maintains troops outside the AU mission based on a bilateral agreement. This week’s deal between Ethiopian and Somali officials extends that arrangement. 'At bilateral level, the Chiefs agreed to develop a Status of Force Agreement a (SOFA) for all the bilateral forces that will operate in Somalia,' Sunday’s communique read. The first AU contingent from Uganda was deployed in Somalia in March 2007 at a time when al-Shabab was gaining a foothold in the country. The U.S.-designated terrorist group remains a threat to the international community-backed government. On Tuesday, al-Shabab launched multiple front attacks in central Somalia, entering small towns and villages before government forces repelled them. In the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, security forces are continuing their almost two months long offensive against Islamic State militants, taking one town after the other. Local security officials say they are confident of capturing the largest main base of the group within days.

German election winner: Europe must defend itself as US 'does not care'	London — Germany’s likely next chancellor has warned that the United States cares little about Europe’s fate and has called for the continent to urgently organize its own defense capabilities, marking a profound shift in approach from Europe’s biggest economy. 'I would never have thought that I would have to say something like this in a TV show. But after Donald Trump's remarks last week, it is clear that the Americans — or in any case, the Americans in this administration — do not care much about the fate of Europe,' Friedrich Merz said in a post-election televised debate after his Christian Democrats, or CDU Party, won 28.5% of the vote in Sunday’s election, 8% ahead of the second place Alternative for Germany Party, or AfD. 'My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,' added Merz. He said the NATO summit in June could be a defining moment, adding that it’s unknown whether allies 'would still be talking about NATO in its current form or whether we will have to establish an independent European defense capability much more quickly.' Ukraine support Until now, Germany has been the second-biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine, after the United States. Merz may seek to boost that support, according to Liana Fix of the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations. 'Friedrich Merz has spoken in favor of Ukraine's victory. In general, he has adopted a more hawkish position than [outgoing Chancellor] Olaf Scholz had. He advocated for German long-range missile deliveries to Ukraine, the Taurus. He made clear that support for Ukraine will have to continue, even if a ceasefire deal is reached,' Fix told VOA. Merz’s election victory came on the eve of the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Brandenburg Gate, once the frontier between east and west Berlin during the Cold War, was lit up Monday in the Ukrainian national colors to mark the anniversary. The potential threat from Moscow loomed heavy over the German election. Berlin resident Juergen Harke, who was among those attending a pro-Ukrainian demonstration outside the Russian Embassy, said it was vital that Merz remains true to his word. 'I hope that the new government will continue to supply weapons to Ukraine, that it will work together with the European states to develop a major counterweight to Russia — and now also to Trump,' Harke told Reuters. Shifts in US policy Trump has engineered a dramatic change in U.S. policy toward Ukraine and its defense against the Russian invasion. Last week, he falsely blamed Kyiv for starting the war and labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator.' On Monday, the U.S. joined Russia in voting against a European-backed resolution at the United Nations Security Council which blamed Moscow for the war and called for an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. Monday on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump congratulated Merz on his victory. 'Looks like the conservative party in Germany has won the very big and highly anticipated election. Much like the USA, the people of Germany got tired of the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration that has prevailed for so many years,' Trump wrote, using all capital letters. Russia, meanwhile, said it would wait to see how relations with the new German chancellor play out. 'Each time we want to hope for a more sober approach to reality, for a more sober approach to what could be issues of mutual interest [between Russia and Germany] and mutual benefits. But let's see how it will be in reality,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday. Europe defense The sudden reversal in U.S. foreign policy has shocked Europe, said analyst Mattia Nelles, founder of the German-Ukrainian Bureau, a policy consultancy based in Dusseldorf. 'We are, as Germany, shocked and utterly unprepared for the end of the Pax Americana, the end of America providing security for Europe. And we now find ourselves in a difficult position to organize the transition away from U.S. being the leading provider of security to a more European-driven approach — not just to Ukraine, but to organizing our own self-defense,' Nelles told VOA. 'And that’s a huge effort. It’s going to require a lot of political will,' he said. 'But Merz has said he's willing to lead on that, and let's see whether we are able to step up.' Can Europe afford to pay for its own defense? 'Merz can agree to joint debt on the European level, which the conservatives always hated,' Fix of the Council on Foreign Relations said. Europe is currently holding around $200 billion of Russian state assets, which were frozen following the invasion. Merz 'can agree to seizing Russian frozen assets, which has not been done so far but should be done soon before Hungary vetoes. He has talked about the U.K. and France having to extend the nuclear umbrella to Germany as a possible pathway,' Fix added. German debt In the election campaign, Merz supported maintaining Germany’s so-called 'debt brake,' which limits annual government borrowing to only 0.35% of the country’s gross domestic product. Germany’s budget deficit is among the lowest in the G7 group of nations, although critics say the policy blocks critical investment. Merz has hinted that the debt brake may be eased to boost defense spending. 'Given the challenges at hand, we're looking at the reform of the so-called debt brake, and that requires constitutional amendments, for which there is not a majority of the centrist parties in parliament,' Nelles noted. The Christian Democrats are well short of a majority, but Merz has ruled out forming a coalition with the far-right AfD. Far-right firewall The so-called 'firewall' around the AfD, whereby German centrist parties have refused to rely on parliamentary votes or to enter any coalition with the far right, has been strongly criticized by Washington. Alice Weidel, co-leader of the AfD, echoed those concerns. 'We consider this blockade to be undemocratic. You cannot exclude millions of voters per se,' she told supporters on Monday. Instead, Merz plans to begin coalition talks with the Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 'The conservatives now have to negotiate and change the tone and find constructive agreement with the Social Democrats on the difficult issues ranging from migration to debt reform in Germany, public financing, rebooting the German economic model and of course, on Ukraine,' Nelles said. Merz said Monday that he hoped a coalition government would be formed by Easter at the latest. 'There's optimism that there is a reenergized focus now — with Germany soon having a functioning government again and a majority in parliament — reenergizing and joining this coalition of the willing, to rally more support for Ukraine and more support for European defense,' Nelles added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-election-winner-europe-must-defend-itself-as-us-does-not-care/7987844.html	2025-02-25T12:11:33-08:00	
What's behind Israeli, US silence on Lebanon blocking Iranian flights delivering cash to Hezbollah?	WASHINGTON — Israel and the United States have responded with silence to claims by Hezbollah that the two allies secretly threatened Lebanon this month into stopping the arrivals of Iranian commercial airliners delivering cash to the Lebanese terror group. The silence of the Israeli and U.S. governments on Hezbollah's allegations is typical of their low-key approaches to dealing with some regional security problems, according to U.S. and Israeli researchers who spoke to VOA in recent days. The researchers also say Lebanon's indefinite suspension of landing rights for Iranian airlines, in effect since Feb. 13, will make it harder but not impossible for Iran to airlift cash to Hezbollah, its main regional proxy force. Beirut began the suspension by calling it a 'security' measure and denying landing rights to a scheduled flight that day of Iran's Mahan Air, whose passengers were left stranded in Tehran. Lebanese authorities initially said the halt to commercial flights from Iran would last five days but then extended it with no declared end date. A day before the flight suspension began, the Israeli military posted a warning to the X social media platform, calling for a stop to Iran's elite military Quds Force using civilian planes to smuggle cash to Hezbollah via Beirut's airport. The warning said Israel 'will use all available means' to ensure its security, as Hezbollah tries to refinance and rebuild from major losses sustained in a months-long Israeli offensive that ended with a November ceasefire. Iran's U.N. mission in New York did not respond when asked by VOA to comment on the Israeli warning. In a recorded speech televised on February 16, Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said the Lebanese government had received a warning that Israel would attack the Beirut airport runway if the Mahan Air jet had been granted permission to land there. On Feb. 19, Hezbollah TV network Al Manar published a commentary that also blamed the flight's cancelation on 'American bullying and threats,' which it said included 'U.S. financial and political sanctions' on Lebanon if the government did not agree to 'limit' Hezbollah's freedom of movement. In a conversation with reporters on February 18, Lebanese President Jospeh Aoun said his government's measures against Iranian airlines 'are linked to the sanctions imposed on them.' Several Iranian airlines, including Mahan Air and Iran Air, are under U.S. and EU sanctions that prohibit transactions with those companies. The Lebanese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a VOA request for comment on whether the government had received a warning that Israel would bomb Beirut's airport runway if the Mahan Air flight had landed there on Feb. 13. The Israeli military also has declined to comment to VOA on whether it made such a threat. The U.S. State Department did not respond to several VOA inquiries about whether it conveyed Israel's Feb. 12 warning to the Lebanese government through the U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring mechanism. Israeli Brigadier General (Retired) Assaf Orion, a defense researcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Israel did not have to publicize a specific threat against Beirut's airport to get its point across to Lebanon. He cited multiple Israeli strikes on Syria's main civilian airports in Damascus and Aleppo in October and November 2023. The strikes, which left the Syrian airports temporarily inoperable, were part of a years-long Israeli military campaign to obstruct Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah through Syria, then ruled by Iranian ally Bashar al-Assad. 'Look at Israel's track record at Damascus International Airport. Assad, before he fled Syria into exile in December, understood that if he wanted his airport to be operational, he needed to stop it from bringing in Iranian arms shipments,' Orion said. The U.S. also typically conveys warnings to Lebanon through a combination of private communications and public diplomacy rather than through issuing public threats, said former Israeli intelligence official Avi Melamed, who runs Inside the Middle East, a U.S. nonprofit research group. U.S. Deputy Special Envoy for the Middle East Morgan Ortagus, in a visit to Lebanon on Feb. 7, told reporters that Hezbollah must be prevented from using any role in the Lebanese government to terrorize the Lebanese people, calling that a 'red line' for Washington. She did not mention the possibility of any new sanctions on Lebanon. U.S. Major General Jasper Jeffers, who arrived in Lebanon in November to lead the ceasefire monitoring mechanism, has said little publicly about his work. In a January 15 comment, the latest of three Jeffers statements published by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, he commended the Lebanese Armed Forces' efforts in 'providing for the security and stability of Lebanon.' The researchers said Iran's inability to fly its civilian planes to the Lebanese capital will complicate its longstanding efforts to deliver cash by air to Hezbollah. Eyal Zisser, a Middle East history professor at Tel Aviv University, said Iran has alternative options of transporting cash on Iraqi and Turkish airliners that fly to Beirut. 'But if you are moving millions of dollars through Iraqi and Turkish airports, you would need cooperation from authorities of those countries,' Zisser said. 'Transferring the money from an Iranian plane to a Turkish plane at a Turkish airport would be a complicated process.' Delivering smaller amounts of cash on Iraqi and Turkish flights to Beirut would be relatively easier for Iran and harder for authorities of other nations to prove as illicit activity, according to David Daoud of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The Lebanese government began asserting more control over security at Beirut's airport last October, reducing the influence of Hezbollah as it was reeling from Israel's offensive. But Daoud said Lebanon's decision to suspend flights only from Iran, rather than from other nations, shows that its tightening of security has been inconsistent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-s-behind-israeli-us-silence-on-lebanon-blocking-iranian-flights-delivering-cash-to-hezbollah-/7987736.html	2025-02-25T12:06:26-08:00	
Canada’s immigration overhaul signals global shift in student migration	From Europe to North America, nations are tightening their immigration policies.

US consumer confidence drops sharply, survey shows	U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in its biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a business research group said Tuesday. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped from 105.3 in January to 98.3 this month, the largest month-to-month decline since August 2021. With U.S. consumer spending accounting for about 70% of the world’s largest economy, the three major stock indexes on Wall Street all fell on news of the report. The tech-heavy NASDAQ dropped by more than a percentage point. The Conference Board said in a statement, 'Views of current labor market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a 10-month high.' Separately, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent contended Tuesday that the U.S. economy is more fragile under the surface than economic indicators suggest, and he vowed to 'reprivatize' growth by cutting government spending and regulation. In his first major economic policy address, Bessent told a group at the Australian Embassy in Washington that interest rate volatility, enduring inflation and reliance on the public sector for job growth have hobbled the American economy, despite general national economic growth and low unemployment. Bessent blamed 'prolific overspending' under former President Joe Biden and regulations that have hindered supply-side growth as the main drivers of 'sticky inflation.' 'The previous administration's over-reliance on excessive government spending and overbearing regulation left us with an economy that may have exhibited some reasonable metrics but ultimately was brittle underneath,' he said. Bessent said that 95% of all job growth in the past 12 months has been concentrated in public and government-adjacent sectors, such as health care and education, jobs offering slower wage growth and less productivity than private-sector jobs. Meanwhile, he said jobs in manufacturing, metals, mining and information technology all contracted or flatlined over the same period. 'The private sector has been in recession,' Bessent said. 'Our goal is to reprivatize the economy.' Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading toward the end of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. But U.S. retail sales dropped sharply in January, with unusually cold weather throughout much of the U.S. taking some of the blame. Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came after two months of robust gains. With inflation remaining a concern for consumers and uncertainty about President Donald Trump’s plan to impose new or stiffer tariffs on imports from other countries, policymakers at the country’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, have taken a cautious approach on whether to further cut its benchmark interest rate. The Fed left its key borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after cutting it at the previous three. 'Consumers' confidence has deteriorated sharply in the face of threats to impose large tariffs and to slash federal spending and employment,' Pantheon Macroeconomics chief Samuel Tombs wrote in a note to clients. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-consumer-confidence-drops-sharply-survey-shows/7987763.html	2025-02-25T11:39:38-08:00	
US expands visa restrictions on Cubans tied to labor export program	WASHINGTON — The United States has expanded an existing visa restriction policy to target Cuban officials believed to be tied to a labor program that sends Cuban workers overseas, particularly health care workers, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Tuesday. In a statement, Rubio said the expanded restrictions target individuals and immediate family members of individuals believed to be responsible for the program, which he described as 'forced labor.' The U.S. has already imposed restrictions on several people, including some Venezuelans, he added. The Caribbean island nation's health service generates major export earnings by sending health workers around the world. 'Cuba's labor export programs, which include the medical missions, enrich the Cuban regime, and in the case of Cuba's overseas medical missions, deprive ordinary Cubans of the medical care they desperately need in their home country,' Rubio said. The Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The United States and Cuba have had a strained relationship since Fidel Castro took over in a 1959 revolution, and a U.S. trade embargo has been in place for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-expands-visa-restrictions-on-cubans-tied-to-labor-export-program/7987728.html	2025-02-25T11:23:53-08:00	
More Thai firms turning up on US sanctions list for trade with Russia	BANGKOK — Thailand is emerging as one of Russia’s main pipelines for machine and computer parts with the potential for military use, with a growing number of local companies accused of helping Moscow evade Western export controls meant to cripple its war on Ukraine. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has imposed sanctions on seven companies in Thailand for exporting these 'high priority items' to Russia, the last of them in December. Trade data published last year by S&P Global, a financial analytics and services firm based in New York, also show a huge spike in these exports out of Thailand since 2022. Thailand eluded mention when the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments started warning in mid-2023 of third countries being used to funnel high-priority items to Russia as a way of skirting the West’s export controls. 'So, it was a surprise to see them … as a new country or a new location which had been involved in this type of goods transaction,' Byron McKinney, a sanctions risk and supply chain expert at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told VOA of his team’s research. Supply chains hit by sanctions, McKinney said, are 'a little like water in a stream — if you try damming in one place, it will try and move around. So, Thailand kind of appeared in this way, as a country which wasn’t there originally for the transshipment or transit of these goods but has appeared later on.' Within days of the 2022 invasion, the U.S. Commerce Department placed export controls on dozens of high-priority items it said Russia needed most 'to sustain its brutal attack on Ukraine,' from ball bearings to microchips. These are commonly known as dual-use goods for their potential to be put to both civilian and military use. A 2024 report by McKinney and his team shows China exporting or reexporting the vast majority of these goods to Russia since the invasion — over $6 billion worth in 2023 alone. It also shows countries funneling more such goods to Russia than Thailand. But of the 14 countries whose exports and reexports to Russia that the report breaks down, Thailand saw the sharpest spike of any, from $8.3 million in 2022 to $98.7 million in 2023, a jump of over 1,000%. Thailand’s 2023 shipments also included an especially large proportion of the most sensitive, high-priority goods such as microchips, designated by U.S. Customs as Tier 1. More recent data shared with VOA by S&P Global show Thailand’s exports and reexports of high-priority goods to Russia again topping $90 million in 2024. McKinney said the trade routes on which the goods are shipped are in constant flux. But for the time being, he added, 'Thailand just happens to be in an area where there’s the possibility to transit these goods easier or quicker because maybe the regulation is a bit more light touch, for example, than it would be in other locations. So, it kind of gets picked on from that particular perspective and … turns up as a particular transit or transshipment hub.' The U.S. has put sanctions on seven Thailand-registered companies in the past 13 months. The first was NAL Solutions in January 2024. In announcing the sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department said NAL was part of a network of companies controlled by Russian national Nikolai Aleksandrovich Levin channeling electronics and other goods from the United States and other countries to Russia. Washington sanctioned another five firms in Thailand in October, including Intracorp, which Treasury accused of setting up other companies that send high-priority goods to Russia. Treasury also tied Thailand’s Siam Expert Trading — added to the sanctions list in December — to the TGR Group, which it described as 'a sprawling international network of businesses and employees that have facilitated significant sanctions circumvention on behalf of Russian elites.' Five of the seven firms did not reply to VOA’s repeated requests for comment about the sanctions. The other two could not be reached. Spokespersons for the Thai government and Ministry of Commerce, which oversees the country’s exports and company licensing, did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment either. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Thailand has been keen to keep up warm diplomatic and economic ties with Russia. At an international summit on China’s Belt and Road Initiative in Beijing two years ago, Thailand’s prime minister at the time, Srettha Thavisin, hailed his country’s 'close relations' with Russia, shook hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin and invited him to Thailand. 'When Srettha became prime minister in 2023, he was focused like a laser on economic growth and viewed Russia as a useful economic partner,' Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told VOA. 'Visa-free entry was extended for Russian tourists, and the authorities turned a blind eye to incidents of antisocial behavior and illegal activities.' He said Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who replaced Srettha last year, has carried on both his fixation on economic growth and neutral stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. Just last month at Putin’s invitation, Thailand joined BRICS, a group of developing countries with Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa at its core, focused on forging closer economic ties. And while bilateral trade between Russia and Thailand has been falling in recent years, Storey says Russians have become major players in Thailand’s property market. They have also helped boost Thailand’s tourism sector, a pillar of the economy. In an interview with Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency in 2023, Vitaly Kiselev, president of the Thai-Russian Chamber of Commerce, said Western sanctions on Moscow were also opening up more trade opportunities between Russia and Thailand. He said chamber membership was on the rise. Given Thailand’s priorities, and U.S. President Donald Trump’s approach to negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, Storey doubts that Thai authorities will step in to stop the country’s trade in dual-use goods. 'If Bangkok hasn't taken action to crack down on this trade three years after the war started, there's little chance that it will do so now, especially as the Trump administration is making nice with Russia,' he said. Across Asia, only Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan have imposed trade restrictions or other sanctions on Russia since the 2022 invasion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-thai-firms-turning-up-on-us-sanctions-list-for-trade-with-russia-/7987637.html	2025-02-25T10:24:18-08:00	
Dying to leave: Why Pakistanis are risking their lives to reach Europe	ISLAMABAD — When Amir Ali left the narrow alleys of his village in Pakistan’s Punjab province last summer for Spain, he thought his dream of a better life was finally coming true. The 21-year-old had failed seven times before to get a visa for countries in Europe and the Middle East. Six months later, in mid-January, Ali was one of 22 Pakistani men whom Moroccan authorities rescued from a stranded migrant boat in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West Africa. At least 43 Pakistanis were among 50 men who perished from hunger, dehydration and physical torture at the hands of human smugglers. Limping with an injured foot in his home in Gujranwala district, Ali said he felt lucky to be alive. 'It’s not as if we survived because of some food or water,' he said. 'Not at all. It’s just that God wanted to save us, so we survived.' Since December 2024, dozens of Pakistanis have died as boats carrying migrants to Europe have run into accidents. While Pakistan does not rank among the top 10 countries from which migrants attempting irregular entry into Europe come, thousands of its nationals risk their lives every year to reach the continent. Human smugglers are becoming savvy too, officials say, as kingpins move to evade an ongoing crackdown, and rely on digital currencies to transfer the proceeds of their crime. A harrowing journey Ali traveled 1,200 kilometers south of Gujranwala to Karachi, where he boarded a plane to Senegal on a visa that smugglers had arranged. 'I didn’t even know that a country with that name existed,' Ali told VOA. From Senegal he obtained a visa to enter Mauritania, where he stayed in a safe house with dozens of other migrants for almost five months. The dream journey was turning into a nightmare. 'There were so many boys in one room, there was no room to sit,' Ali said. 'It was mentally very tough.' In the wee hours of the morning on Jan. 2, he was stuffed with more than 80 others on a boat headed from Nouakchott, Mauritania, to Spain’s Canary Islands. After a day of travel, the boat ran out of fuel. To lighten the load, Ali said, the smugglers threw away the passengers’ belongings and took away their meager rations. 'On the fourth day on the boat, a man went crazy because of hunger. He jumped into the ocean. We all got very scared thinking about what was going to happen next,' Ali said. Smugglers, the survivor said, thrashed anyone who complained or didn’t comply. 'The smugglers told us to throw the dead bodies in the water,' said Ali. 'When we refused, thinking how could we throw our brothers, they beat us up a lot.' The ordeal ended almost two weeks later when Moroccan authorities rescued the survivors after a fishing boat spotted them. Ali’s family sold livestock and precious agricultural land and took loans to raise $10,000 to get their son to Spain. His mother is worried about the debt but delighted that her son is alive. Who is leaving and why Almost two hours away in Gujrat district of Punjab, Haji Shaukat Ali is devastated. His son Chaudhry Atif and nephew Chaudhry Sufyan did not survive. A roadside sign leading to their village commemorates the two as martyrs. 'We sent them because of our weakness,' said Ali, sitting among a group of mourners, some of whom had come from Europe. 'The weakness is money.' Studies conducted by Gallup Pakistan and the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, or PIDE, in recent years show lack of jobs as the primary reason for wanting to leave a country where economic growth is barely keeping up with population growth. According to Pakistan’s Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, more than 65,000 people left legally to work abroad just in January 2025. Between 2022 and 2024, an average of 800,000 nationals moved abroad for work annually. Most went to the Middle East but a few to Europe. Pakistanis also made nearly 5,000 attempts to enter Europe illegally in 2024, data from the EU’s border and coast guard agency Frontex indicates. Amir Ali’s home district of Gujranwala and Atif and Sufyan’s home district of Gujrat lead in migration trends, along with nearby Sialkot, Mandi Bahauddin and Faisalabad districts, despite being hubs of agriculture and industrial activity. 'They are not the poorest of the poor,' said demographer Durre Nayab, pointing to the ability of migrants from this region to pull together thousands of dollars to fund their journey. 'But it’s not just the financial aspect,' Nayab, who was involved in the PIDE study, told VOA. 'The two other aspects that came out were lifestyle, and somehow, they thought they would gain more respect out of [the] country.' Many Pakistanis wanting to leave felt poorly treated compared to their wealthier countrymen, Nayab explained. 'This difference made them disillusioned about the whole system,' the demographer said. The PIDE study showed 37% of Pakistanis would leave, if given a chance. Does life get better? Kashif Ali, a cousin of the deceased Atif, spent hundreds of dollars to arrange a sponsor for a work permit to Italy a decade ago. 'In Pakistan, a middle-class laborer earns around $3 a day. For that same work, they make $20 to $25 overseas,' said Ali, who works in boat making. His family in Pakistan now has a new home and a car. Such a turn of fortune is on display across small towns and villages in central Punjab. Experts say it inspires many others to risk their lives to reach Europe. It was a similar story of success that made Ishraq Nazir move from Mandi Bahauddin to Greece. He entered the European country after a brief stay in Turkey as a tourist in 2009. It took him a decade to get a Greek residency permit after his asylum request was rejected. For years he worked odd jobs like herding cows and painting trees to get by. Now he works in a packaging factory earning almost $60 a day and said he finally feels settled. 'I had to face a lot of difficulties, but the fact is that if I had stayed in Pakistan, I would have not gotten anything given the type of jobs they have,' Nazir told VOA on the phone while packing disposable plates. 'My friends are still where they started.' Umar Shaid from district Sialkot arrived illegally in Greece by boat from Libya in October. 'I am struggling. It’s very hard to find work. There are very few opportunities. I don’t have any friends or relatives to seek help from,' Shaid said by phone over the sound of the Athens metro. Shaid said he has spent around $15,000 to pay smugglers and take care of his day-to-day expenses. 'Honestly, I believed the stories people told me and took this silly decision,' said Shaid. Still, he said he was not planning to go back to Pakistan. Crackdown on smugglers Pakistan began cracking down on human smuggling after hundreds of its nationals died off the coast of Pylos, Greece, in June 2023 in one of the worst migrant boat disasters. A report by Pakistan’s National Commission for Human Rights says after that disaster, authorities arrested 854 suspected human smugglers. Frustrated by recent incidents, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a high-level task force in January, with himself as the head, to combat human smuggling. The Federal Investigation Agency, or FIA, has ramped up efforts, arresting dozens of alleged human smugglers and confiscating the assets of others to force them out of hiding. 'For the first time we have seen that they [smugglers] are using Bitcoin and digital currency. They have shifted away from traditional ways of money laundering.' Bilal Tanvir, FIA deputy director for the Gujrat region, told VOA. However, he said a lack of resources and low rate of conviction of alleged criminals posed a challenge in curbing the crime. The FIA is also facing increased scrutiny. Sharif’s government removed the agency head three weeks ago. More than 100 officials have been fired, suspended or blacklisted for alleged involvement in and insufficient action against human smuggling. Survivor Ali told VOA his group of migrant men faced no hurdle boarding the flight for Senegal at the Karachi airport. 'Someone connected with the agents came, held our hand and told us to come after him. Wherever we went, we followed him,' Ali said. 'Nobody stopped us.' Tanvir defended his agency, saying officers focus on those entering the country more than those on their way out. The impact of tragedies Surrounded by friends and neighbors, Ali looked disappointed. He told VOA he would not recommend attempting to reach Europe by boat. Others in the room felt differently. 'Why should I lie?' said Tariq Bajwa, who supports his young sons’ plan to head to Europe illegally in a few years. 'Looking at others, we are willing to try as well.' Several young men in the room agreed. Why Europe? 'Just because,' said Hamza Qayyum, the son of a farmer. 'There’s farming in Europe. I don’t feel like it doing it here,' the 20-year-old with a sixth-grade education explained. Asked if they would risk drowning in the sea, Muhammad Zohaib, whose brothers work in the Middle East asked, 'Why not?' 'Planes crash too, so what’s the big deal if a boat sinks?' the 20-something said. 'One can run into an accident right outside the house.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dying-to-leave-why-pakistanis-are-risking-their-lives-to-reach-europe/7987593.html	2025-02-25T10:21:02-08:00

Starmer to boost UK defense spending against Russian threat	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday that the U.K. would increase its defense spending by 2027 to bolster its security against the threat of Russian aggression exhibited by Moscow’s three-year war against Ukraine. Starmer told Parliament that defense spending would increase by $17 billion annually, boosting outlays from 2.3% of the United Kingdom’s economic production to 2.5%, with corresponding cuts in overseas development assistance. Starmer told lawmakers the increased defense spending was a 'generational response' and the 'biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War.' He said it was necessary because 'tyrants like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin only respond to strength.' 'We must stand by Ukraine, because if we do not achieve a lasting peace, then the economic instability and threats to our security, they will only grow,' said Starmer, who is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday. 'And so, as the nature of that conflict changes as it has in recent weeks, it brings our response into sharper focus, a new era that we must meet as we have so often in the past, together, and with strength,' Starmer told the House of Commons. Britain previously said it would increase its defense spending to 2.5% of its national economic production but did not pinpoint a date. It already is one of 23 of the 32 countries in NATO that meets the goal of the West’s main military alliance for each country to spend at least 2% of its gross domestic product on defense. Starmer’s push to increase defense spending comes as European countries have expressed new concerns about ongoing military support from the United States as Trump advances his 'America First' foreign policy agenda and pushes to settle the Ukraine war in discussions with Putin. Starmer has offered to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a force to safeguard any ceasefire that might be agreed to but says an American 'backstop' will be needed to ensure a lasting peace. Trump has not committed to providing security guarantees for Ukraine, saying Monday after meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House that 'Europe is going to make sure nothing happens.' Trump last week called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' but has declined to characterize Putin the same way.

US Supreme Court throws out Oklahoma man's murder conviction, death sentence	Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out the murder conviction and death penalty for Richard Glossip, an Oklahoma man who has steadfastly maintained his innocence and averted multiple attempts by the state to execute him. The justices found that Glossip's trial violated his constitutional rights. The justices heard arguments in October in a case that produced a rare alliance in which lawyers for Glossip and the state argued that the high court should overturn Glossip's conviction and death sentence because he did not get a fair trial. The victim's relatives had told the high court that they want to see Glossip executed. Oklahoma's top criminal appeals court had repeatedly upheld the conviction and sentence, even after the state sided with Glossip. Glossip was convicted and sentenced to death in the 1997 killing in Oklahoma City of his former boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese, in what prosecutors have alleged was a murder-for-hire scheme. Glossip has always maintained his innocence. Another man, Justin Sneed, admitted robbing Van Treese and beating him to death with a baseball bat but testified he only did so after Glossip promised to pay him $10,000. Sneed received a life sentence in exchange for his testimony and was the key witness against Glossip.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-throws-out-oklahoma-man-s-murder-conviction-death-sentence/7987443.html	2025-02-25T08:06:43-08:00	
Guantanamo Bay: A new front in US immigration policy?	U.S. President Donald Trump plans to send 30,000 undocumented migrants to Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base in Cuba. While it is most well known for housing terror suspects after 9/11 — and for drawing condemnation from human rights groups — Guantanamo has been occasionally used as a processing center for immigrants trying to reach the U.S., mostly from Haiti and Cuba. Although Guantanamo's Migrant Operations Center is separate from the high-security jail, that doesn’t mean it has escaped scrutiny.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guantanamo-bay-a-new-front-in-us-immigration-policy-/7987381.html	2025-02-25T07:51:22-08:00	
Hong Kong Democratic Party’s plan to disband marks ‘end of an era’	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Hong Kong’s largest and oldest opposition party, the Democratic Party, has announced that it will start the process of disbanding, a move that analysts say will mark 'the end of an era' for the city’s pro-democracy forces. During a press conference last Thursday, Democratic Party chairperson Lo Kin-hei told journalists that the party, founded in 1994, would set up a three-person task force to 'study' the procedures needed for the party to shut down. 'We considered the overall political environment in Hong Kong and all those future plans that we can foresee, and that is the decision that we make,' he said, adding that party members’ votes will determine the final decision for disbandment. Lo did not specify when the vote might take place. Hong Kong’s government has yet to comment on the news of the party’s possible disbandment and authorities did not respond to inquiries from VOA. In an editorial published Monday, the Chinese Communist Party-controlled media outlet Wen Wei Po said the Democratic Party’s planned disbandment was the result of the party’s connections to detained media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who is facing several national security charges, and its support of 'violent protesters' during the 2019 pro-democracy protests. The Democratic Party, founded a few years before the end of British colonial rule, played a pivotal role in Hong Kong’s transition to Chinese governance, with some of its early leaders, including prominent figures such as Martin Lee and Albert Ho, helping to shape the 'One Country, Two Systems' model, a constitutional arrangement set up to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under Chinese rule. Following Hong Kong’s handover to China in 1997, the Democratic Party became the most influential opposition force in the port city’s legislative council, leading street protests and advocating for the fulfillment of universal suffrage and direct elections that were embedded in the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. But following months-long anti-government protests that sent shockwaves across the city in 2019, Beijing initiated a series of moves to tighten control over Hong Kong, including the imposition of the controversial National Security Law, or NSL, in July 2020 and the overhaul of the city’s electoral system that essentially blocks pro-democracy candidates from running in elections. ‘Chilling effect’ felt in Hong Kong Analysts say the Democratic Party’s decision to begin disbandment reflects Hong Kong authorities’ intensifying crackdown on pro-democracy organizations, with several opposition political parties, such as the Civic Party, deciding to shut down due to increasing political pressure and restrictions on operating. 'Democratic Party’s decision to start preparing for disbandment marks the end of the good old times when there were functioning opposition parties that could maintain a presence in the legislative council, serve constituents, and consult the government on policies,' said Maggie Shum, a political scientist at Penn State University in the U.S. Additionally, she said, the crackdown has affected independent bookstores, independent media, and independent institutions. 'It’s like the Hong Kong government is going down a long list of democratic institutions and taking every one of them off the list,' Shum told VOA by phone, adding that the trend has created a 'society-wide chilling effect' in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Journalist Association, or HKJA, the main journalism group in the city, was forced to scrap its annual fundraising dinner this month after two hotels cancelled bookings. The head of HKJA, Selina Cheng, has said the cancellations were likely the result of 'political pressure' the hotels had faced. Local authorities have said nothing about the issue. Additionally, the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, which tracks public attitudes on a wide range of issues in the city, announced it would suspend all self-funded research and might even 'close down' after its CEO Robert Chung was summoned by national security police for investigations. Some pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong say authorities have shifted the focus of their crackdowns to groups dedicated to issues such as labor rights in recent months. 'The Hong Kong government has proposed legislative amendments that will ban individuals convicted of national security offenses from being part of labor unions while imposing stricter vetting mechanisms on foreign funding,' said Debby Chan, a former pro-democracy district councilor in Hong Kong. Emily Lau, the former chairperson of the Democratic Party, said these trends show Hong Kong’s political system is pivoting away from democracy. 'More than a dozen groups have dissolved over the last two to three years and in the current environment, it will be hard for pro-democracy figures or organizations to have the space to operate,' she told VOA by phone, adding that Hong Kong authorities’ goal is to 'annihilate' pro-democracy figures’ attempts to 'organize.' Beijing: ‘National security safeguarded’ in Hong Kong In response to inquiries from VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said Beijing 'firmly supports' Hong Kong authorities’ efforts to 'safeguard national security' and urged 'critics' to 'stop smearing the Chinese central government’s policy governing Hong Kong.' 'Hong Kong’s economy is booming, and the constitutional order is in stable operation, national security is safeguarded and the ‘patriots ruling Hong Kong’ is implemented,' Liu Pengyu, the Chinese Embassy spokesperson, told VOA in an email. Shum at Penn State said Hong Kong people may 'get disoriented or forced to withdraw from caring about politics' because authorities are rapidly tightening control over civil society and 'taking away their power to take collective actions.' 'Hong Kong is implementing the Chinese model of governance and using an authoritarian way to control every aspect of life,' she told VOA. Shum said Hong Kong’s people could still find symbolic ways to express support for democracy. 'The online censorship in Hong Kong is not as dire as compared to China and there are a lot of exiled media outlets reporting on the situation in Hong Kong, which serve as channels for Hong Kong people to connect with the outside world,' she said, adding that that 'could potentially serve as anchors for people who care about democratic values.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-democratic-party-s-plan-to-disband-marks-end-of-an-era-/7987402.html	2025-02-25T07:49:02-08:00	
Trial begins in Germany for 4 alleged Hamas members	BERLIN — A trial began Tuesday in Germany for four alleged members of U.S.-designated terror group Hamas who are suspected of organizing weapons caches across Europe. The country's top prosecutor accuses the men of membership in a foreign terrorist organization. It's a pilot case for prosecutors, German news agency dpa reported. 'For the first time in Germany, people are facing charges of participating as members of the foreign terrorist organization Hamas,' prosecutor Jochen Weingarten said, according to dpa. The men are accused of seeking out some weapons depots set up years ago, as well as setting up new ones, for Hamas across Europe so it could later use the firearms and ammunition for attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets on the continent, prosecutors said when filing charges last year. The weapons were allegedly moved around Europe in preparation for Hamas' terror attack against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, prosecutors said. Around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in that attack, and about 250 taken hostage. The attack triggered Israel's air and ground offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians. The ministry says more than half the dead have been women and children. Hamas also considered targeting the Israeli Embassy in Berlin, the area around Tempelhof Airport in the capital and the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany, authorities said. Abdelhamid Al A., Mohamed B., Nazih R. and Ibrahim El-R. were arrested in December 2023. Prosecutors identified them only by their first name and last initial in line with German privacy laws. All four had important positions within Hamas, prosecutors asserted. The men allegedly set up a weapons cache in Bulgaria in 2019 and in Denmark later that year. They sought to find a spot in Poland but were unsuccessful, prosecutors said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-begins-in-germany-for-4-alleged-hamas-members/7987308.html	2025-02-25T06:54:05-08:00

Church of England eyes disciplining clergy over child abuse scandal	The Church of England will seek to bring disciplinary proceedings against 10 clerics including former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, it said on Tuesday, implementing recommendations from an abuse report last year. The CoE, central to 85 million Anglicans worldwide, has been in crisis over safeguarding the vulnerable since the November report, which said ex-leader Justin Welby had taken insufficient action to stop one of the church's most prolific serial abusers. Welby eventually stepped down over the findings. Eight priests and a former bishop were also listed among those potentially facing disciplinary action in the CoE statement as the CoE concluded its own independent review into all clergy criticized in last year's report. That report found that the late John Smyth, a British lawyer who volunteered at Christian summer camps, subjected more than 100 boys and young men to 'brutal and horrific' physical and sexual abuse over a 40-year period. The potential outcomes of the CoE's disciplinary process, which is at its first stage, could result in various penalties ranging from a permanent ban from ministry to resignation by consent. 'We must not forget that at the heart of this case are the survivors and victims who have endured the lifelong effects of the appalling abuse by John Smyth. We are truly sorry,' Alexander Kubeyinje, the CoE's National Director of Safeguarding, said in the statement. 'The Church is committed to taking very seriously its response to the findings of the review as well as responding to its recommendations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/church-of-england-eyes-disciplining-clergy-over-child-abuse-scandal-/7987210.html	2025-02-25T05:26:43-08:00	
Unknown illness kills over 50 in part of Congo with hours between symptoms and death	KINSHASA, DR Congo — An unknown illness has killed over 50 people in northwestern Congo, according to doctors on the ground and the World Health Organization on Monday. The interval between the onset of symptoms and death has been 48 hours in the majority of cases, and 'that’s what’s really worrying,' Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center, told The Associated Press. The latest disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo began on Jan. 21, and 419 cases have been recorded including 53 deaths. According to the WHO’s Africa office, the first outbreak in the town of Boloko began after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours following hemorrhagic fever symptoms. There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where wild animals are popularly eaten. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022. After the second outbreak of the current mystery disease began in the town of Bomate on Feb. 9, samples from 13 cases have been sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, for testing, the WHO said. All samples have been negative for Ebola or other common hemorrhagic fever diseases like Marburg. Some tested positive for malaria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unknown-illness-kills-over-50-in-part-of-congo-with-hours-between-symptoms-and-death-/7987202.html	2025-02-25T05:13:32-08:00	
Taiwan investigating Chinese-crewed ship believed to have severed an undersea cable	TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwanese authorities are investigating a Chinese-crewed ship suspected of severing an undersea communications cable in the latest such incident adding to tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan's coast guard intercepted the Togolese-flagged cargo ship Hongtai in waters between its main island's west coast and the outlying Penghu Islands early Tuesday, according to a statement by the coast guard. The coast guard had earlier been notified by telecommunications provider Chunghwa Telecom that one of its undersea cables had been severed 6 nautical miles (11 kilometers) northwest of Jiangjun Fishing Harbor. The Hongtai had been anchored in that same area since Saturday evening, the coast guard said. From Saturday until early Tuesday, authorities in the nearby Anping Port in Tainan had sent signals to the vessel seven times but had received no response. After the Chunghwa Telecom cable damage report, the coast guard approached the ship, which had begun to sail northwestward, and escorted it to Anping Port. Taiwanese authorities said the ship's entire eight-person crew were Chinese nationals and the case was being handled 'in accordance with national security-level principles.' 'The cause of the underwater cable break, whether it was due to intentional sabotage or simply an accident, is still pending further investigation for clarification,' the coast guard said. 'The possibility of this being part of a gray-zone incursion by China cannot be ruled out,' it added. Communications on the Penghu Islands were not disrupted because Chunghwa Telecom had successfully activated a backup cable, the coast guard said. This is the latest in a series of incidents in recent years in which undersea Taiwanese cables have been damaged — with Taipei in some instances blaming China. Earlier this year, a Chinese cargo ship was suspected of severing a link northeast of the island. In February 2023, two undersea cables serving Taiwan's Matsu Islands were severed, disrupting communications for weeks. Taipei fears China might damage its underwater communications cables as part of attempts to blockade or seize the island, which Beijing claims as its own. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said during a regular press briefing on Tuesday that he was not aware of the issue and it did not pertain to diplomacy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-investigating-chinese-crewed-ship-believed-to-have-severed-an-undersea-cable-/7987166.html	2025-02-25T04:29:49-08:00	
ICC prosecutor arrives in DR Congo amid conflict in east	Kinshasa, DR Congo — The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC) Karim Khan has arrived in the DR Congo, his office said Tuesday, as the country grapples with an upsurge in fighting in the east. The Rwanda-backed M23 has in recent weeks seized two major cities in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, giving the armed group a major foothold in the region since taking up arms again in late 2021. 'We are extremely worried about recent developments in Congo, we know the situation particularly in the east is acute,' Khan told reporters on his arrival in the capital Kinshasa. 'The message has to be conveyed very clearly: any armed group, any armed forces, any allies to armed groups or armed forces don't have a blank cheque,' he said. 'They must comply to international humanitarian law,' Khan added. According to UN experts, the M23 is supported by around 4,000 Rwandan soldiers. Since its resurgence, the fighting between the group and Congolese armed forces has provoked a humanitarian crisis in a region plagued by conflict for three decades. 'This is a moment where we will see if international humanitarian law can withstand the demands that the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo insist upon, which is the equal application of the law,' Khan said. 'The people of the DRC are as precious as... the people of Ukraine, the people of Israel or Palestine, girls or women of Afghanistan,' he added. Khan is set to meet DRC President Felix Tshisekedi, government ministers, the U.N. Secretary General's country representative Bintou Keita, as well as victims of the conflict and civil society members. The first investigation that the ICC opened after it began its work in 2002 concerned the DRC. Since then, the court has convicted three people for crimes committed in the country. The ICC prosecutor's office also opened an investigation in 2023 into allegations of crimes committed since January 2022 in North Kivu province in the east of the vast nation. Khan's office, which visited the country in May 2023, indicated early this month that the current situation in eastern DRC 'is part of the ongoing investigation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-prosecutor-arrives-in-dr-congo-amid-conflict-in-east-/7987151.html	2025-02-25T04:08:10-08:00	
US again sends ‘high threat’ migrants to Guantanamo Bay	Washington — The United States has started sending more migrants deemed by officials to be 'high threat' criminal aliens to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, just days after emptying out the base’s migrant facilities. A U.S. defense official confirmed to VOA that a C-130 military cargo plane carrying migrants left Fort Bliss in Texas and arrived at Guantanamo Bay on Sunday. A second defense official said all 17 migrants were assessed to be 'high threat' and are being held at the base’s detention facility. Both officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation operations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, along with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has not yet responded to questions about the identities of the latest round of detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay, their countries of origin, or the crimes with which they are charged. The latest flight carrying migrants to Guantanamo Bay comes as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to visit the base Tuesday to review the military’s efforts to support the mass deportations ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump. Hegseth, according to a Pentagon statement, 'will receive briefings on all mission operations at the base, including at the Migrant Operations Center and the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility.' 'The Secretary's trip underscores the Department's commitment to ensuring the security and operational effectiveness of Guantanamo Bay Naval Station,' the statement added. ICE announced last Thursday that it had transported 177 migrants being held at Guantanamo Bay to Honduras, where they were to be picked up by the Venezuelan government. U.S. officials had previously said that more than 120 of those detainees were dangerous criminals, including members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. The approximately 50 other individuals who were deported Thursday had been held at the base's migrant facility, designed to hold nonviolent individuals. Earlier this month, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers that the base's migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500 nonviolent detainees. Efforts are under way to allow it to house as many as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation. The American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, earlier this month filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility before being deported had been improperly denied access to lawyers. DHS dismissed the lawsuit's allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-again-sends-high-threat-migrants-to-guantanamo-bay-/7987133.html	2025-02-25T03:46:07-08:00	
Exploration firm restarts search for MH370 11 years on	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — A fresh search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been launched more than a decade after the plane went missing in one of aviation's greatest enduring mysteries. Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity has resumed the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loke said Tuesday. Loke told reporters contract details between Malaysia and the firm were still being finalized but welcomed the 'the proactiveness of Ocean Infinity to deploy their ships' to begin the search for the plane which went missing in March 2014. Loke added that details on how long the search would last had not been negotiated yet. He also did not provide details on when exactly the British firm kicked off its hunt. The Malaysian government in December had said it had agreed to launch a new search for MH370, which disappeared more than a decade ago. The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has never been found. 'They (Ocean Infinity) have convinced us that they are ready,' said Loke. 'That's why the Malaysian government is proceeding with this,' he added. In December, Loke had said the new search would be on the same 'no find, no fee' principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if it finds the aircraft. The contract was for 18 months and Malaysia would pay $70 million to the company if the plane was found, Loke previously had said. Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018. The company's first efforts followed a massive Australia-led search for the aircraft that lasted three years before it was suspended in January 2017. The Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometers in the Indian Ocean but found hardly any trace of the plane, with only some pieces of debris picked up. The plane's disappearance has long been the subject of theories -- ranging from the credible to outlandish -- including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue. A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exploration-firm-restarts-search-for-mh370-11-years-on/7987100.html	2025-02-25T02:41:51-08:00	
National dialog a 'historic opportunity' for Syria, interim president says	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Syria's interim president said on Tuesday his country had a 'historic opportunity' to rebuild, addressing a national dialog summit billed by Syria's Islamist rulers as a key milestone after decades of Assad family rule. Hundreds of Syrians gathered at the presidential palace in Damascus for the one-day event, arriving on a red carpet previously reserved for the few foreign dignitaries visiting former president Bashar al-Assad, until he was toppled last year by a rebel offensive spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The group's head, Ahmed al-Sharaa, was named by military rebel commanders as the country's interim president last month and he swiftly pledged to hold a national dialog to discuss the country's future. 'Syria liberated itself on its own, and it suits it, to build itself on its own,' he said in his opening address on Tuesday. 'What we are living today is an exceptional, historic and rare opportunity. We must take advantage of every moment of it to serve the interests of our people and our country,' he said. Sharaa stressed that Syria must unify the various armed groups under a single military command, saying the country's 'strength lies in its unity.' Participants divided into six working groups to discuss a transitional justice system; the constitution; building state institutions; personal freedoms; Syria's future economic model and the role civil society would have in the country. The discussions were confidential, with a moderator allocating two minutes to participants to speak and restrictions on removing any documents from the summit hall. Organizers say the recommendations set to be agreed by the end of the day will help shape a constitutional declaration intended to lay out the basic principles for Syria's new governing order. They will be considered by a new transitional government that is set to take power on March 1. Proponents say the process is a notable shift from decades of autocratic rule by the Assad family, when political dissent was often met with detention in a labyrinthine prison system. But critics have questioned the rushed preparation for the summit, the lack of minority representation and the weight it will ultimately hold in a political process steered heavily so far by HTS. The summit will be closely watched by Arab and Western capitals alike, which have conditioned full ties with Syria's new leaders - including the possible lifting of sanctions - on whether the political process is inclusive of Syria's ethnically and religiously diverse population, three diplomats said. Syria-based diplomats were not invited to the conference, three foreign envoys in the country said. Its organizers did not take up offers by the United Nations to help with the summit. The U.N., the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on HTS as a group. The U.S. and the European Union also have widespread sanctions in place on Syria, but have issued temporary lifts on some sectors in recent weeks. Speaking after Sharaa, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani criticized international sanctions still in place, saying they were being used 'as a means of pressure on the will of the Syrian people.' Following his comments, a woman in attendance stood up and shouted, 'Thank God, the People's Palace has returned to the people!' To put together the event, a seven-member preparatory committee hosted listening sessions organized by province, sometimes holding several two-hour sessions a day to fit in all of Syria's 14 regions over the course of a week. Five of the committee members are either in HTS, or close to the group, and there are no Druze or Alawite members, both of which are significant minorities in Syria. No members of the Kurdish-led autonomous administration in northeast Syria or the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces were invited, officials from both groups told Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/national-dialog-a-historic-opportunity-for-syria-interim-president-says/7987094.html	2025-02-25T02:31:13-08:00	
Singaporeans lose record $822 million to scams in 2024, police say	SINGAPORE — Singaporeans lost a record $822 million to scams last year, with cryptocurrency schemes accounting for almost a quarter of the losses, the city-state's police force said on Tuesday. The amount lost to scams increased by 70.6% from $486 million in 2023, while the number of cases rose by about 11% to 51,501, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a report. Cryptocurrency scams accounted for 24.3% of total money lost, while the e-commerce scams were the most numerous, with $13 million lost in 11,665 cases. 'The majority of the cases, more than 70%, saw less than $3,700 in losses. The increase in total amount lost was driven by a small number of cases with very high losses,' the SPF said, with four cases accounting for $178 million of the losses. The police said that while people aged 65 and above only made up 8.4% of scam victims, the average amount lost per victim was the highest among the various age groups. Of the total amount lost, Singapore's Anti-Scam Command recovered more than $136 million, the police said. In January, Singapore passed a new law allowing police to freeze bank accounts of potential scam victims to prevent further losses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singaporeans-lose-record-822-million-to-scams-in-2024-police-say/7987089.html	2025-02-25T02:23:43-08:00

Trump administration proposes steep fees on Chinese cargo ships	The Trump administration has proposed punitive new fees on international shipping that would target vessels owned by Chinese companies or manufactured in Chinese shipyards, promising to dramatically alter the economics of global trade. The new policy would charge Chinese-owned cargo ships, as well as third-country flagged vessels built in China, $1 million or more per port-of-call in the U.S. Large container ships often make multiple stops when delivering goods to the U.S., and would face new fees at each port. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) published the proposal Friday, tying it to an investigation into allegations by several U.S. labor unions that China has unfairly distorted the international shipbuilding industry. The investigation, conducted under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, determined that the Chinese government has pursued a policy of subsidizing its domestic shipbuilding industry with the aim of 'targeting for dominance' the global market. Growing market share The investigation pointed out that over the past 25 years, China’s share of the global shipbuilding industry has exploded. China accounted for about 5% of the total tonnage of ships manufactured in 1999. By 2023, the Chinese share of the market surpassed 50%. The USTR found that Chinese policy 'burdens or restricts U.S. commerce by undercutting business opportunities for and investments in the U.S. maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors; restricting competition and choice; creating economic security risks from dependence and vulnerabilities in sectors critical to the functioning of the U.S. economy; and undermining supply chain resilience.' The results of the investigation, which began during President Joe Biden’s administration, were announced last month. The proposal is open for public comment until March 24, at which point the administration will determine whether or not to implement it. Chinese reaction On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian sharply criticized the U.S. move. '[T]o serve its political agenda at home, the U.S. has abused Section 301 investigation[s], which seriously violated WTO [World Trade Organization] rules and further undermined the multilateral trading system,' he said. 'We call on the U.S. side to respect facts and multilateral rules and immediately stop its wrongdoings.' The China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry (CANSI) and China Shipowner Association had previously blasted the USTR investigation as being 'conclusions full of lies and distortion of facts.' In a statement issued when the results of the investigation were released, CANSI said, 'Development of China’s shipbuilding industry strictly follows the international trading rules and is the result of collaboration with global partners, as well as the tech innovation, and the hard-wording and excellent performances of Chinese industry players.' Complex new rules The USTR proposal contains a number of complicated elements that made it unclear precisely how any new regime of port fees would be administered. Each ship owned by a Chinese entity would be charged a $1 million fee on entering a U.S. port, though the proposal also appears to consider a different fee calculation of $1,000 per ton of capacity, which could add up to considerably more for large ships that carry thousands of tons of cargo. Chinese-built ships operated by non-Chinese shipowners would be subject to a $1.5 million fee, which could be adjusted, depending on the percentage of Chinese-built ships in that shipowner’s fleet. This would apply even if the ship’s cargo was not manufactured in China. Ships owned by companies that have existing orders for new ships pending with Chinese shipbuilders could be hit with an additional $1 million fee per entry at U.S. ports. The rule also provides for 'refunds' of a similar amount each time a shipping company sends a U.S.-built cargo ship into a U.S. port. Economic justifications hazy Mary Lovely, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said it was difficult to find an economic justification for the proposal. 'The thing that's really disturbing is that it's not linked to any particular policy that would benefit American businesses or consumers,' she said. International trade will continue to flow to the United States, but through more convoluted routes that add time and expense. For example, Lovely predicted that many shipping firms would explore the possibility of diverting their ships to ports in Mexico and Canada, and trucking the cargo into the U.S. 'It seems to me that this is just a tremendous way to reduce volume and employment at U.S. ports and basically force trade to take transportation routes and transportation modes that are clearly going to raise prices for U.S. businesses and consumers,' Lovely said. 'There's no way around it.' In an email exchange with VOA, Joe Kramek, World Shipping Council president and CEO, echoed those concerns. 'USTR's proposed draconian $1 million-plus per U.S. port visit fees on ships that carry the large majority of the U.S. trade, if they are Chinese-built or –operated – or on any ship operator from any country that has even a single Chinese ship in its fleet or on order – if carried forward, would cause broad economic harm across all sectors of the U.S. supply chain,' wrote Kramek, whose organization represents shipping companies. 'The fees would result in fewer U.S. port calls, higher prices for U.S. consumers, and severe impacts for exporters, particularly American farmers,' he wrote. Unlikely to benefit US shipbuilders Though ostensibly aimed at helping U.S. shipbuilders, the law is unlikely to have a significant impact on that industry, said Marc Levinson, a Washington-based economist and historian who has written two books about container shipping. 'This is not likely to do much for U.S. shipbuilding,' Levinson told VOA. 'U.S. commercial shipbuilders are very far away from global scale. They don't produce anything that is competitive on the international market for commercial oceangoing vessels.' 'The winners of this policy would be Japan, Korea, the Philippines, other countries where commercial shipbuilding is on a larger scale today than the United States,' Levinson said. The losers, he added, will include U.S. consumers, as the port fees are passed on in the form of higher prices for imported goods. In an email exchange with VOA, the National Retail Federation registered its opposition to the policy, writing, 'NRF strongly opposes a port fee remedy, which will do nothing to force China to change its behavior and practices. It will only increase shipping costs for retailers and further disrupt the maritime market.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-proposes-steep-fees-on-chinese-cargo-ships/7987079.html	2025-02-25T02:05:06-08:00	
Pope Francis rested well all night, Vatican says	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis, who is in critical condition in a hospital battling double pneumonia, rested well throughout the night, the Vatican said on Tuesday. The 88-year-old pope was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14. 'The pope rested well all night,' the Vatican said in a one-sentence statement. On Monday, the Vatican said the pontiff's condition remained critical but had shown a 'slight improvement,' adding that the 'mild kidney insufficiency,' first reported at the weekend, was not a cause for concern. Double pneumonia is a serious infection that can inflame and scar both lungs, making it difficult to breathe. The Vatican has described the pope's infection as 'complex,' and said it was caused by two or more microorganisms. Francis, who has been pope since 2013, has suffered bouts of ill health over the past two years. He is particularly prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed. Thousands of people gathered in St. Peter's Square on Monday evening to pray for the pope's recovery. His friend, the Honduran cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga, told La Repubblica newspaper: 'I think...it's not time for him to go to heaven yet.' The pope signaled in early February that he had a bad cold, which meant he could not read out his speeches. Despite this, he continued to work, with multiple daily meetings and even taking part in open-air Masses, despite the chill. Some well-wishers have said he should have taken better care of himself, but Maradiaga defended his work ethic. 'He is aware that he has a mission he must carry out, and nothing stops him. The pope explained that he did not accept his election (as pontiff) in order to rest,' he said. In Monday's statement, the Vatican said Francis had resumed working in his self-contained apartment within the Gemelli hospital, and had called the Catholic parish in Gaza, which the pope has done frequently during the Israel-Hamas war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-rested-well-all-night-vatican-says/7987084.html	2025-02-25T02:03:34-08:00	
At least four dead in South Korea highway construction project collapse	ANSEONG, South Korea — At least four people died and six were injured on Tuesday after a collapse at a highway construction site in an area south of the South Korean capital, Seoul, fire authorities said. The accident took place at 9:49 a.m. local time, in Anseong, about 70 km from Seoul, when five 50-meter concrete structures supporting the highway bridge collapsed, one after another, after being hoisted into place by a crane, the Yonhap News Agency reported. Ko Kyung-man, an Anseong fire official, said that four people had died, including two Chinese nationals, and six were injured, including five who were in a critical condition. The five also included one Chinese citizen. 'They were working to install a deck on the bridge,' Ko told a televised briefing. 'All of the 10 were up on the deck ... and fell from both sides when it collapsed.' Broadcaster YTN aired dramatic footage showing a deck of a towering bridge collapsing at the site. Rescue workers at the site were seen examining twisted metal struts and fractured concrete slabs below the columns of the highway bridge. Acting President Choi Sang-mok called to mobilize all available personnel and resources to rescue any missing people and to ensure safety measures to prevent further damage, his office said. The National Fire Agency said that it has mobilized three helicopters and nearly 150 officials for the search and rescue operation, and the Transport Ministry said it has dispatched a team of officials to the scene. Deadly accidents continue to regularly occur at industrial sites in South Korea, which introduced a law in 2022 to address safety lapses and punish company management if a worker is killed on the job. Earlier in February, six people died in a fire in a hotel construction site in the port city of Busan, with around 100 people evacuated including 14 workers plucked to safety by a helicopter after they had taken refuge on a rooftop. In June last year, a fire at a lithium battery factory that authorities blamed on quality control failures and inadequate safety training killed 23 workers. Data released in March by South Korea's labor ministry showed that 598 industrial workers died in 2023, with the construction sector accounting for nearly half, or 303, though the total death toll was down from 644 in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-four-dead-in-south-korea-highway-construction-project-collapse/7987066.html	2025-02-25T00:59:31-08:00	
Talks to protect Earth's biodiversity resume with money topping the agenda	BOGOTA, Colombia — An annual United Nations conference on biodiversity that ran out of time last year will resume its work Tuesday in Rome with money at the top of the agenda. That is, how to spend what's been pledged so far — and how to raise a lot more to help preserve plant and animal life on Earth. The talks in Colombia, known as COP16, yielded some significant outcomes before they broke up in November, including an agreement that requires companies that benefit from genetic resources in nature — say, by developing medicines from rainforest plants — to share the benefits. And steps were taken to give Indigenous peoples and local communities a stronger voice in conservation matters. But two weeks turned out to be not enough time to get everything done. The Cali talks followed the historic 2022 COP15 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures aimed at protecting biodiversity. Those included putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework. 'Montreal was about the ‘what’ — what are we all working towards together?' said Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns for the Zoological Society London. 'Cali was supposed to focus on the ‘how’ — putting the plans and the financing in place to ensure we can actually implement this framework.' 'They eventually lost a quorum because people simply went home,' said Linda Krueger of The Nature Conservancy, who is in Rome for the two days of talks 'And so now we’re having to finish these last critical decisions, which are some of the nitty gritty decisions on financing, on resource mobilization and on the planning and monitoring and reporting requirements under the Global Biodiversity Framework.' The overall financial aim was to achieve $20 billion a year in the fund by 2025, and then $30 billion by 2030. So far, only $383 million had been pledged as of November, from 12 nations or sub-nations: Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Province of Québec, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Participants will discuss establishing a 'global financing instrument for biodiversity' intended to effectively distribute the money raised. And a big part of the talks will be about raising more money. ‘Completely off track’ on larger financial goal Chandler and Kruger both said the finance points at Colombia's talks were particularly contentious. 'It’s really about how do we collect the money and how do we get it distributed fairly. Get it to the ground where it’s needed most, so that that’s really the core issue,' said Kruger. Oscar Soria, chief executive of The Common Initiative, a think tank specializing in global economic and environmental policy, was pessimistic about raising a great deal more money. 'We are completely off track in terms of achieving that money,' Soria said. Key sources of biodiversity finance are shrinking or disappearing, he said. 'What was supposed to be a good Colombian telenovela in which people will actually bring the right resources, and the happy ending of bringing their money, could actually end up being a tragic Italian opera, where no one actually agrees to anything and everyone loses,' Soria said. Susana Muhamad, Colombia's former environment minister and the COP16 president, said she's hopeful of 'a good message from Rome.' 'That message is that still, even with a very fragmented geopolitical landscape, with a world increasingly in conflict, we can still get an agreement on some fundamental issues,' Muhamad said in a statement. 'And one of the most important is the need to protect life in this crisis of climate change and biodiversity.' Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to an October report from the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London. 'Biodiversity is basically essential to our livelihoods and well-being,' Chandler said. 'It’s essential to the the air we breathe, the water we drink, rainfall that food systems rely on, protecting us from increasing temperatures and increasing storm occurrences as well.' Chandler said deforestation in the Amazon has far-reaching impacts across South America, just as it does in the Congo Basin and other major biodiverse regions worldwide. 'We know that has an impact on rainfall, on food systems, on soil integrity in other countries. So it’s not just something that’s kind of small and isolated. It's a widespread problem,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/talks-to-protect-earth-s-biodiversity-resume-with-money-topping-the-agenda-/7987061.html	2025-02-25T00:50:14-08:00	
China adviser pushes to lower legal marriage age to 18 to boost birthrate	HONG KONG — A Chinese national political adviser has recommended lowering the legal age for marriage to 18 to boost fertility chances in the face of a declining population and 'unleash reproductive potential,' a state-backed newspaper said on Tuesday. Chen Songxi, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told the Global Times that he plans to submit a proposal on completely relaxing restrictions on childbirth in China and establish an 'incentive system' for marriage and childbirth. Chen's comments come ahead of China’s annual parliamentary meeting next week where officials are expected to announce measures to offset the country's declining population. The legal age for marriage in China is 22 for men and 20 for women, amongst the highest in the world, compared with most developed countries where the legal marriage age is 18. Chen said China's legal marriage age should be lowered to 18 'to increase the fertility population base and unleash reproductive potential.' It is to be consistent with international norms, Chen said. China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, as marriages plummeted by a fifth, the biggest drop on record, despite efforts by authorities to encourage young couples to wed and have children. Much of China's demographic downturn is the result of its one-child policy imposed between 1980 and 2015. Couples have been allowed to have up to three children since 2021. Chen said China should remove restrictions on the number of children a family can have to meet the 'urgent needs of population development in the new era.' However, a rising number of people are opting to not have children, put off by the high cost of childcare or an unwillingness to marry or put their careers on hold. Authorities have tried to roll out incentives and measures to boost baby making including expanding maternity leave, financial and tax benefits for having children, as well as housing subsidies. But China is one of the world's most expensive places to bring up a child, relative to its GDP per capita, a prominent Chinese think tank said last year, detailing the time and opportunity cost for women who give birth. CPPCC, a largely ceremonial advisory body, meets in parallel with parliament. It is made up of business magnates, artists, monks, non-communists and other representatives of broader society, but has no legislative power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-adviser-pushes-to-lower-legal-marriage-age-to-18-to-boost-birthrate/7987015.html	2025-02-24T23:28:57-08:00	
Vietnam's US exports account for 30% of GDP, making it highly vulnerable to tariffs	HANOI, VIETNAM — Vietnam's goods exports to the United States accounted for 30% of its gross domestic product last year, the highest share among U.S. top trade partners, a Reuters review of public data shows, making the country highly vulnerable to reciprocal tariffs. The Southeast Asian nation experienced a surge in foreign investment after the first Trump administration started a trade war with Beijing in 2018, as foreign multinationals moved factories from China to its southern neighbor to avoid U.S. tariffs. It hosts major operations of South Korea's Samsung Electronics and Taiwan's contract manufacturer Foxconn. Apple, chipmaker Intel and footwear and apparel giant Nike are among U.S. corporations which in recent years bet on Vietnam as a production hub for goods often exported to the United States. The massive inflow of manufacturing investment has turned the Communist-run nation into a major node in global supply chains and significantly boosted its economic ties with the United States. Vietnam now directs 29% of its exports to its former foe, according to Vietnamese customs data. Last year, with goods exports worth $142.4 billion, Vietnam became the sixth largest exporter to the United States, after Mexico, China, Canada, Germany and Japan, United Nations commodity trade statistics show. Shipments to the U.S. last year represented about 30% of Vietnam's GDP of $468 billion, based on IMF's estimates, the largest share for all U.S. trading partners. Only Mexico, which is facing explicit threats from Trump of 25% tariffs, has a comparable exposure. It ships more than three times more goods than Vietnam to the U.S., with the total value of its exports accounting for 27.6% of its larger GDP. By comparison, China's exports to the U.S. are worth 2.5% of its GDP, and Japan's 3.7%. Vietnam's vulnerability is compounded by large trade imbalances that could make it stand out as U.S. officials study global reciprocal tariffs, which U.S. President Donald Trump has mandated to prepare by April. Vietnam's booming exports, combined with limited imports from the U.S., made it last year the U.S. partner with the fourth-largest trade surplus, lower only than China, the 27-country EU and Mexico, according to U.S. trade data. The country also 'satisfies (other) criteria for tariff applications set by the White House,' said Sayaka Shiba, a senior analyst at research firm BMI, noting that compared to the U.S., it has higher tariff rates, levies VAT, has non-trade barriers and is on the U.S. watchlist for possible currency manipulation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-us-exports-account-for-30-of-gdp-making-it-highly-vulnerable-to-tariffs/7987014.html	2025-02-24T23:28:09-08:00	
Russian aerial attacks hit Kyiv, Sumy	Multiple regions of Ukraine came under aerial attack from Russian forces overnight, with officials in Kyiv and Sumy saying Tuesday there were injuries and damage to buildings. Mykola Kalashnyk, governor of the Kyiv region, said a 44-year-old woman was hospitalized as a result of the attacks, which also damaged several houses. Officials in Sumy said Ukrainian air defenses shot down seven drones, but that the attacks injured two people and damaged two apartment buildings. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said Tuesday on Telegram that the military destroyed 20 drones over his region. Taburets said there were no reports of injuries or damage. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said air defenses destroyed three Russian drones, while Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim said the military shot down seven drones in his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down 20 Ukrainian drones overnight, mostly over the Bryansk region that is located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram there were no injuries from the Ukrainian attack. Other intercepts took place over the Kursk and Kaluga regions, the Defense Ministry said.

Trump says Canada, Mexico tariffs on schedule despite border, fentanyl efforts	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said on Monday that tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports are 'on time and on schedule' despite efforts by the countries to beef up border security and halt the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. ahead of a March 4 deadline. 'The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,' Trump told a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. He had been asked whether Canada and Mexico had done enough to avoid the punishing 25% U.S. duties. Many had hoped the top two U.S. trading partners could persuade Trump's administration to further delay tariffs that would apply to over $918 billion worth of U.S. imports from the two countries, from autos to energy. This could wreak havoc on the integrated North American economy, with the automotive sector hit particularly hard. Trump did not specifically mention the March 4 deadline. He later referred to his desire for 'reciprocal' tariffs to match the duty rates and offset the trade barriers of all countries, including France. Trump and Macron did not publicly discuss another sticking point -- digital services taxes imposed by France, Canada and other countries aimed at dominant U.S. tech giants including Google, Facebook and Amazon. On Friday, Trump ordered his administration to revive tariff investigations into countries that levy digital service taxes on U.S. firms. Border hopes dimmed Canada and Mexico have taken steps to beef up border security, which bought them about a month's reprieve from Trump's earlier Feb. 1 deadline to impose the tariffs, based on a national emergency declaration. Any further delay negotiated ahead of the deadline will keep the tariff threat in place at least until clear evidence emerges that Canadian and Mexican measures are working, said Dan Ujczo, a lawyer specializing in U.S.-Canada trade matters. 'There's progress being made on the security front,' said Ujczo, senior counsel with Thompson Hine in Columbus, Ohio. 'But it's overly optimistic to think that those tariffs would be fully rescinded.' The White House, U.S. Trade Representative's office and Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment on negotiations expected this week ahead of the March 4 deadline. More tariff threats Since Trump's initial 25% tariff threat and imposition of a 10% duty on all Chinese imports, he has heaped on more tariff actions that could muddy the waters on border negotiations. These include substantially raising tariffs on steel and aluminum to a flat 25%, rescinding longstanding exemptions for Canada and Mexico, the largest sources of U.S. imports of the metals. These steep increases, which also extend to hundreds of downstream steel products, are due to take effect a week after the border tariffs, on March 12. Trump has also said he wants to impose 25% tariffs on imports of autos, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, and to match duty rates and trade barriers of other countries. The threatened tariffs could kick off an early launch of a renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement on trade that is due by 2026, Ujczo added. Trump signed the USMCA into law in 2020 after renegotiating the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement but has increasingly expressed dissatisfaction with imports of autos from Mexico and Canada. Progress cited On Thursday, Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday he had a 'constructive dialog' during a meeting with Trump's top trade officials. Ebrard said in a post on X that the 'joint work' on U.S. trade matters starts on Monday. Mexico has begun deploying as many as 10,000 national guard troops to its northern border, as part of the agreement that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said also called on the U.S. to work to stop the flow of firearms into Mexico. Canada this month created a new fentanyl czar to coordinate the fight against smuggling of the deadly opioid, appointing senior intelligence official Kevin Brosseau to the post. Ottawa also has reclassified drug cartels as terrorist entities and has deployed drones, helicopters and other surveillance technologies on the vast northern U.S. border. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has kept in close contact with Trump on the border issues in recent days, including in a Saturday call that included discussions of joint efforts to curb fentanyl trade. He has threatened retaliatory tariffs on $107 billion of U.S. imports, including American beer, wine and bourbon and Florida orange juice, but said last week that Canada is 'going to do the work' to ensure that tariffs are not imposed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-canada-mexico-tariffs-on-schedule-despite-border-fentanyl-efforts/7986957.html	2025-02-24T18:34:57-08:00	
Musicians release silent album to protest UK's AI copyright changes	LONDON — More than 1,000 musicians including Kate Bush and Cat Stevens on Tuesday released a silent album to protest proposed changes to Britain's copyright laws which could allow tech firms to train artificial intelligence models using their work. Creative industries globally are grappling with the legal and ethical implications of AI models that can produce their own output after being trained on popular works without necessarily paying the creators of the original content. Britain, which Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants to become an AI superpower, has proposed relaxing laws that currently give creators of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works the right to control the ways their material may be used. The proposed changes would allow AI developers to train their models on any material to which they have lawful access, and would require creators to proactively opt out to stop their work being used. The changes have been heavily criticized by many artists, who say it would reverse the principle of copyright law, which grants exclusive control to creators for their work. 'In the music of the future, will our voices go unheard?' said Bush, whose 1985 hit 'Running Up That Hill' enjoyed a resurgence in 2022 thanks to Netflix show 'Stranger Things.' The co-written album titled 'Is This What We Want?' features recordings of empty studios and performance spaces to represent what organizers say is the potential impact on artists' livelihoods should the changes go ahead. A public consultation on the legal changes closes later on Tuesday. Responding to the album, a government spokesperson said the current copyright and AI regime was holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from 'realizing their full potential.' 'We have engaged extensively with these sectors throughout and will continue to do so. No decisions have been taken,' the spokesperson said, adding that the government's proposals will be set out in due course. Annie Lennox, Billy Ocean, Hans Zimmer, Tori Amos and The Clash are among the musicians urging the government to review its plans. 'The government's proposal would hand the life's work of the country's musicians to AI companies, for free, letting those companies exploit musicians’ work to outcompete them,' said organizer Ed Newton-Rex, the founder of Fairly Trained, a non-profit that certifies generative AI companies for fairer training data practices. 'The UK can be leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/musicians-release-silent-album-to-protest-uk-s-ai-copyright-changes/7986931.html	2025-02-24T17:35:23-08:00	
Trump hosts French leader to discuss Ukraine endgame	President Donald Trump said Monday he’s nearing a deal with Ukraine and with Russia to end the war in Ukraine after a packed day of meetings at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump urged Europe to take a bigger role in funding, and Paris pushed for more assurances from Moscow. The U.S. president pushed his desire for a deal to end the war, which struck its grim third anniversary Monday. He has said this will include an agreement with Ukraine for its critical minerals — a deal he hinted could be signed as soon as next week by Ukraine’s president. 'There's tremendous distrust on both sides,' Trump said. 'That's why it's good that I'm coming in now. But I think it's to the very much benefit of Russia to make a deal and to go on with leading Russia in a very positive way. That's what you have to do. But I really believe that he wants to make a deal. I may be wrong, but I believe he wants to make a deal.' Macron was more circumspect, correcting Trump in the Oval Office when Trump said Europe supported Ukraine with a loan. Macron then warned against trusting Moscow. 'Let’s try to get something first which ... can be assessed, checked and verified,' he said in English. 'And let's be sure that we build sufficient guarantees in the short run. And this is where we are ready to be engaged. As for France, a lot of my European colleagues are ready to be engaged. But we do need this American backup, because this is part of the credibility of the security guarantees. And this is our collective deterrence capacity. And I have the feeling that the president has this capacity.' Analysts spoke of what the two leaders accomplished in their meetings. 'It looks like they agreed to have European peacekeepers enforce the peace between Russia and Ukraine,' said William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Wilson Center Kennan Institute. 'There are a lot of other side issues that I haven't really been able to get a hold of, but yes, there are attempts to have a peace agreement and a use of peacekeepers to enforce the agreement between Russia and Ukraine.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope and emphasized the importance of Washington’s role. 'Our teams are already working productively with the U.S. on an economic agreement, which we hope to sign in Washington,' he said in English. 'And President Trump, we would really like to hear from you, because all our people, all our families, are very worried: ‘Will there be support from America? Will America be the leader of the free world?’ And I want to be very honest, very honest with you: For our people, for life in general, it is so important that American support, American assistance remains.' But other world leaders expressed concerns that Ukraine was kept out of high-level discussions in Saudi Arabia between Washington and Moscow. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who recently met with Zelenskyy in Ankara, also said Russia hasn’t always been part of the process. 'Apart from the Istanbul process, Russia has been excluded from the tables established so far, and therefore the desired result has not been achieved,' Erdogan said. 'If results are to be obtained from the new process, Ukraine must definitely be included in the process, and this war must be ended through mutual negotiations.' Russian President Vladimir Putin said that so far, talks have not been specific. 'During the phone conversation and at the meeting in Riyadh, we certainly touched on issues related to the Ukrainian crisis,' he said. 'However, it was not discussed in essence. We only agreed that we would approach it. That being said, of course, we are not rejecting the participation of European countries.' Some analysts warn that Trump’s idea of a deal is not advantageous to Ukraine. 'We have to see this as a move by Donald Trump to undermine the legitimacy of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — and in the worst case, as Trump advocating for Russia's position, which has been in the past that elections have to be part of a negotiation process in Ukraine, although it's an entirely Ukrainian domestic issue,' said Liana Fix, a fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'So, it's not only a back and forth between Trump and Zelenskyy. We do see a broader realignment here of U.S. policy towards a normalization of relations with Russia, where Ukraine is perceived as a problem to this normalization,' she said. Meanwhile in Europe, as Ukraine somberly marked Monday as the third anniversary of the war, Paris’ most famous icon, the Eiffel Tower, burned brightly in the yellow and blue colors of the Ukrainian flag.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-hosts-french-leader-to-discuss-ukraine-endgame/7986909.html	2025-02-24T16:40:42-08:00	
Top US general in Asia begins 2-day visit to Cambodia	The top U.S. Army officer for the Asia-Pacific region began a two-day visit to Cambodia Monday in a trip designed to expand and improve frayed ties between the two nations. General Ronald P. Clark, the commanding general of the United States Army Pacific met with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and senior Cambodian military officials in Phnom Penh. Ties between the U.S. and Cambodia have been strained with Washington’s criticism of Cambodia’s political repression and human rights violations. However, the U.S. and other countries are also greatly concerned with Cambodia’s close ties with China. Of special interest is China’s access to the Ream Naval Base near the disputed South China Sea, a waterway China claims almost in full. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague rejected China’s sweeping claims. The naval base is strategically located in the Gulf of Thailand, which borders the western section of the South China Sea. The base’s renovation was funded by China. China has contributed massive amounts of money to Cambodia’s updating of its infrastructure with the help beginning when the prime minister’s father, Hun Sen, was leading the country. That funding continues and later Monday, Manet met with Yin LI, a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, according to a post on the prime minister’s Telegram account. The post said the Li praised the progress on 'all cooperation in all fields' between Cambodia and China. During the meeting, Clark also expressed his admiration for Cambodia for sending U.N. peacekeepers to several international locations, according to the prime minister’s office. The prime minister also thanked the U.S. for its assistance in helping to clear explosives from Cambodia after years of war that left Cambodia in the late 1990s with 4 million to 6 million land mines and other unexploded ordnance, including unexploded U.S. bombs. Clark also met Monday with General Mao Sophan, Cambodia’s military chef. The two military generals had 'constructive discussions,' the army said in a statement. Topics of their talks included defense, trade, tourism, counterterrorism, peacekeeping and demining, the Cambodian army said. Their discussion also included the possible revival of the Angkor Sentinel exercise, the joint military exercises previously held by the U.S. and Cambodia that were abandoned nearly 10 years ago, the army said.

Deadly floods in Botswana kill 9; nearly 2,000 people evacuated	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswana authorities say at least nine people were confirmed dead Monday, as rare flooding hit the semi-arid country. More than 5,000 people have been affected by the floods as record rainfall fell over the last week. Addressing Parliament on Monday, Moeti Mohwasa, the minister for state president, said the nine people who died had all drowned. Of the deceased, six were minors. 'While the risk level has generally reduced ... I regret to inform this house that we have lost one more person yesterday evening, bringing to nine the total number of fatalities to date. … So far, the number of people evacuated has increased to 1,806 from 1,749 reported yesterday,' Mohwasa said. The United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) said at least 600,000 schoolchildren were experiencing disruptions due to the floods. Schools have been closed since last week, but Mohwasa said most are expected to reopen Tuesday. 'After a thorough assessment of the situation, I am happy to announce that schools will reopen tomorrow, February 25, 2025,' he said. 'Another positive note is that our critical infrastructure remain[s] stable, with both electricity and water supply fully restored. Our 24-hour clinics, primary hospitals, and referral hospitals are operational and accessible to all, although there may be occasional interruptions in service provision.' While the situation is improving with rain subsiding, more than 600 people remained at evacuation centers Monday. Calvin Moalosi, a Gaborone resident who was at one of the centers, said he lost his belongings due to the floods. 'I have never seen so much water in my life. The house became a pool of water, and it is really sad that some people were swept away in the floods,' Moalosi said. 'The government has done its best to evacuate people and take them to safe areas.' Most parts of the country recorded heavy rains from 150 mm (6 inches) to 200 mm (8 inches) in a 24-hour period several times last week. Kutlwano Mukokomani, chief executive at the local Red Cross Society, said the organization is continuing to provide relief at evacuation centers across the country. 'The Botswana Red Cross Society provided relief items to evacuation centers. We continue to provide these relief items to ensure that our communities are kept safe. We provided food items, blankets, mattresses and also hygiene packs. We are also doing assessments so that they can further guide our response,' Mukokomani said. Botswana, like most southern African countries, has been recovering from the devastating El Nino-induced drought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-floods-in-botswana-kill-9-nearly-2-000-people-evacuated/7986895.html	2025-02-24T16:23:33-08:00	
US lawmakers rush to avoid March 14 government shutdown	U.S. lawmakers are one step closer to funding the government past a March 14 deadline, but Congress still has serious issues to resolve as they come back to work in the nation’s capital this week. At question is how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts and how to pay down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety net programs that help American voters. President Donald Trump has called for lawmakers to pass 'one big, beautiful bill' that will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy agenda. Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House of Representatives version of the budget, the Senate passed a funding resolution Friday that provides $150 billion in military funding and $175 billion for border security. That measure also avoids the controversial Medicaid cuts in the House version. Senate leadership has proposed passing the tax cuts in a separate bill later this year. 'Republicans are moving forward on legislation to fund continued efforts to deport criminal aliens, as well as provide other necessary resources to secure our border, discourage illegal immigration and restore respect for the rule of law,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Monday on the Senate floor. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a first step toward extending the tax cuts. 'What are Republicans doing? They're spending precious time trying to cater to the wishes of the absolutely richest people in America, instead of working to avoid a disastrous halt of services that help tens of millions of middle-class American families,' Schumer said Monday. The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House version. The two versions will have to be compromised to be signed into law. The House is set to hold a procedural vote on Tuesday, but Speaker of the House Mike Johnson holds a slim Republican majority and cannot afford to lose any members of his own to pass his version of the budget. Republican Representative Tony Gonzales led a group of seven other House Republicans warning against potential cuts to health care program Medicaid, food assistance funding and other social safety net programs. 'Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing homes are already struggling to keep their doors open,' the lawmakers said in a letter to Johnson sent last week. Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, also expressed concern about the version of the budget up for a vote, along with several other undecided House Republicans who have not yet announced their votes on the measure. Congressional Democrats also object to the Republican tax cut proposal, arguing it will harm lower-income and middle-class Americans who are already concerned about the cost of living and inflation. In a 'Dear Colleagues' letter sent Monday morning, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote, 'Far-right extremists are determined to push through $4.5 trillion of tax breaks for wealthy Republican donors and well-connected corporations, explode the debt and saddle everyday Americans with the bill by ending Medicaid as we know it. We must be at full strength to enhance our opportunity to stop the GOP Tax Scam in its tracks.' Trump posted on Truth Social last week that 'The House and Senate are doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!' If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees temporarily without pay and suspending some non-essential government services.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-rush-to-avoid-march-14-government-shutdown-/7986622.html	2025-02-24T15:35:25-08:00	
China eyes Trump's Ukraine strategy, strengthens ties with Russia	STATE DEPARTMENT — Three years into Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, China is closely monitoring U.S. President Donald Trump’s strategy to end the war, as Beijing calculates its moves to position itself as a strategic partner for Ukraine while maintaining a no‐limits partnership with Russia, according to experts and former officials. This week, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are set to hold in-person meetings in Washington, following the Feb. 18 direct talks between senior U.S. and Russian officials in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Macron met with Trump Monday morning at the White House for a meeting that lasted nearly two hours. Both leaders participated in a videoconference with other G7 leaders about Ukraine. Earlier on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who updated Xi on the Riyadh talks and reaffirmed the 'comprehensive strategic partnership' between Russia and China. A Chinese readout said, 'China welcomes the positive efforts made by Russia and relevant parties to resolve the crisis.' 'Crisis’ but not war For three years, Chinese officials have said Beijing will 'play a constructive role' in the 'political settlement of the crisis,' refraining from using the term 'Ukraine war' to describe Russia's aggression since Feb. 24, 2022. Beijing also commended the recent U.S.-Russia talks, during which Ukraine was not present. China and Ukraine 'established a strategic partnership in 2011. ... In recent years, China has been Ukraine's largest trading partner,' Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha on Feb. 15 on the margins of the Munich Security Conference. 'Regarding the Ukrainian crisis ... China has always worked for peace and promoted talks,' Wang said. Notably, the Chinese readout of the meeting made no mention of Ukraine’s sovereignty or territorial integrity. On Feb. 20, two days after the U.S.-Russia talks, Wang held in-person discussions with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the G20 ministerial meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, where Lavrov briefed him on the Riyadh talks. Wang reaffirmed China’s 'comprehensive strategic partnership' with Russia. Wang said China 'supports' all efforts dedicated to peace, including 'the recent consensus reached between the United States and Russia' in Riyadh. Talks, not negotiations U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Riyadh talks — the first between Washington and Moscow in years — were not negotiations aimed at striking any deal on Ukraine, despite concerns from Ukraine and European countries that they were being sidelined. He said the talks were intended to determine whether the Russians were serious about ending the war. In a measured tone, Rubio characterized the talks — which lasted for more than four hours — as steps toward establishing 'lines of communication' on bilateral issues between the United States and Russia. Among these efforts is the goal of achieving 'some normalcy in our missions and their ability to function.' Some analysts said Beijing is nervous over a reset of U.S.-Russia ties. 'While a complete rapprochement might not be in the cards, they’re nervous because if Trump lifts sanctions on Russia, then Moscow’s dependency on China decreases,' Dennis Wilder, who was a top White House China adviser to former U.S. President George W. Bush, told RFE/RL. But others warned that the U.S. risked bolstering China's global information campaign, which portrays Washington as an unreliable ally. Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, a defense analyst at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), said, 'We immediately gave away what leverage we had' and 'misattributed who the aggressor was' while rushing into talks with the Russians. China, 'stumbling into this good news,' certainly gets the benefit, Montgomery said in a recent webinar hosted by FDD. 'I have no doubt that diplomats from China are whispering in ears around the world about the unreliability of Americans, and unfortunately, this administration is giving them some talking points,' Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the FDD, said during the webinar. Experts skeptical A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on whether China would consider sending peacekeeping forces to Ukraine after the conflict ends. Xi and Putin are scheduled to exchange visits to Moscow and Beijing later this year. The two held a virtual meeting on Jan. 21. Additionally, Xi took a phone call from Putin on the afternoon of Feb. 24. Some former U.S. officials are skeptical about the extent to which the Chinese government is genuinely willing to act to stop Russia’s war on Ukraine. They believe China may use the issue as leverage in its dealings with Trump. 'I think the Chinese will look at the Ukraine issue, and they will offer some help to Trump. They probably won't do very much, and then they will claim success,' Evan Medeiros, director of Georgetown University’s Asian Studies program, said during a recent podcast with the German Marshall Fund’s Indo-Pacific program. Medeiros served on the White House National Security Council from 2009 to 2015. 'Anything that is in their direct material interests, like helping to rebuild Ukraine, they will embrace. But of course, that doesn't have to do with encouraging Russia to reach a peace deal. That's about ensuring that Chinese infrastructure companies get lots of big fat contracts,' Medeiros added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-eyes-trump-s-ukraine-strategy-strengthens-ties-with-russia/7986607.html	2025-02-24T15:11:31-08:00

US Supreme Court rebuffs free speech challenge to abortion clinic buffer zones	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a challenge to the legality of buffer zones used to protect access to abortion clinics and limit harassment of patients in a challenge brought by anti-abortion activists who have argued that their free speech rights were being violated. The justices turned away appeals by self-described 'sidewalk counselors' in New Jersey and Illinois of lower court decisions to throw out their lawsuits that had claimed that the buffer zones violate free speech protections under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. The activists had been asking the Supreme Court to overturn its 2000 ruling allowing a Colorado buffer zone law. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would have taken up the appeals. The legality of so-called buffer zones that create a perimeter around abortion facilities, or 'floating' zones that put distance between demonstrators and a clinic's patients or staff, has been legally contested for decades. The issue pits free speech rights against concerns over harassment and violence by anti-abortion protesters. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. In 2022, the court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide, ending its recognition of a woman's constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy. Since that ruling, the issue of buffer zones has regained prominence. While numerous Republican-led states have banned or severely restricted abortion, some municipalities in states where it remains legal have adopted buffer zone ordinances to limit intimidation and harassment, drawing legal challenges. In Carbondale, Illinois, a group called Coalition Life that organizes sidewalk counselors sued after the local city council passed such an ordinance in 2023. The measure established a floating 8-foot (2.4 meters) buffer that prevents people from approaching people without their permission in the vicinity of health care facilities, in response to increased threats and disorderly acts at abortion clinics. The ordinance has since been repealed. It had been modeled after a nearly identical Colorado law that the Supreme Court upheld in 2000 in a case called Hill v. Colorado. The Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the coalition's case in March 2024, noting that the challengers cannot prevail so long as the Hill ruling remains in place. Thomas, in his dissent on Monday, criticized the court's Hill decision and expressed regret that the justices had declined 'an invitation to set the record straight on Hill's defunct status.' 'I would have taken this opportunity to explicitly overrule Hill,' Thomas added. The coalition's lawyers had asked the Supreme Court to overrule the Hill ruling because in places where 'anti-abortion views are disfavored,' buffer zones are a 'ready tool to try to silence those who advance them — and to do so precisely when and where their speech may matter most.' In New Jersey, a sidewalk counselor named Jeryl Turco sued the city of Englewood for adopting a 2014 ordinance that created an 8-foot buffer zone protecting the entrances and driveways of healthcare facilities. The buffer was set after reports of people associated with an evangelical Christian ministry engaging in aggressive and hostile protests outside Metropolitan Medical Associates, a local abortion clinic. Turco was not associated with the ministry, and said she delivered only peaceful counseling. The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Turco's complaint in January 2024, saying a buffer zone can help protect an individual's health, safety and access to pregnancy-related services, and 'does not place a substantial burden on Turco's speech.' The 3rd Circuit said its ruling was in line with the Hill precedent. Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said after the Supreme Court acted on Monday that buffer zones 'help to create a safer environment for patients, providers and staff.' 'No patient should have to encounter threats, intimidation and attacks while seeking health care — and no medical provider or health center staff should be threatened because of their work to deliver abortion care to patients in need,' Johnson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-rebuffs-free-speech-challenge-to-abortion-clinic-buffer-zones-/7986592.html	2025-02-24T14:47:54-08:00	
Oscar performers include Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande and Doja Cat	After devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles, the 97th Academy Awards are going forward. Like the Grammys and other awards shows this year, the ceremony will be transformed by the fires and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has pledged to help its members and the broader film community recover. Here’s everything you need to know about this year’s show: When are the Oscars? The Academy Awards will be held March 2, at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. The show, to be broadcast live by ABC, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Eastern/4 p.m. Pacific. Who's hosting the Oscars? Conan O’Brien is hosting the Academy Awards for the first time. O’Brien, the late-night host turned podcaster and occasional movie star, said upon the announcement: 'America demanded it and now it’s happening: Taco Bell’s new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I’m hosting the Oscars.' How have the wildfires altered the show? The wildfires that consumed large parts of Los Angeles in early January led some to call for the cancellation of the Academy Awards. The academy twice postponed the announcement of nominations but never pushed the March 2 date of the ceremony. Academy leaders have argued the show must go ahead, for its economic impact on Los Angeles and as a symbol of resilience. Organizers have vowed this year’s awards will 'celebrate the work that unites us as a global film community and acknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires.' Still, the fires have curtailed much of the usual frothiness of Hollywood's awards season. The film academy canceled its annual nominees’ luncheon. For many involved in the Oscars, the fires have been felt acutely. O'Brien's Pacific Palisades home survived but his family has been unable to go back to it. O'Brien's assistant and podcast co-host Sona Movsesian lost her home. 'I know so many people who lost their homes and I’m just, was ridiculously lucky,' O’Brien told The Associated Press. 'So, we want to make sure that that show reflects what’s happening and that we put a light on the right people in the right way.' Who's presenting at the Oscars? More stars were added to the presenter lineup last week, including Selena Gomez, Oprah Winfrey, Joe Alwyn, Goldie Hawn, Ben Stiller, Ana de Armas, Sterling K. Brown, Willem Dafoe, Lily-Rose Depp and Connie Nielsen. They'll join the likes of Halle Berry, Penelope Cruz, Elle Fanning, Whoopi Goldberg, Scarlett Johansson, John Lithgow, Amy Poehler, June Squibb and Bowen Yang, as well as last year's acting winners — Emma Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Da’Vine Joy Randolph — on the Oscar stage. Though the academy initially said it would bring back the 'fab five' style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per category, organizers have reportedly abandoned those plans for this year’s ceremony. Nick Offerman will also be participating as the Oscars announcer. Will there be any performances? The academy has announced that, unlike previous years, the original song nominees will not be performed this time. That doesn't mean there won't be music, though. Doja Cat, LISA of Blackpink, Queen Latifah and RAYE will be part of 'showstopping performances celebrating the filmmaking community and some of its legends,' producers announced Monday, as will Wicked's Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. (The songs from Wicked weren't eligible for best song since, hailing from the Broadway musical, they aren't original to the movie.) The Los Angeles Master Chorale will also appear. What's nominated for best picture? The 10 nominees for best picture are: Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part 2, Emilia Perez, I’m Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance, and Wicked. How to watch Oscar-nominated films? Some of the nominees are still in theaters, but many of this year’s Oscar nominees are streaming on various platforms. Who are the favorites? More than most years, that’s a tricky question, but a front-runner had emerged after Anora took the top awards at the Producers Guild, Directors Guild and Independent Spirit Awards. The best picture race had been seen as unusually wide open, with Anora, Conclave, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Emilia Perez all having legitimate hopes of winning — the hopes of Conclave further boosted by its Screen Actors Guild ensemble win. In the acting categories, Demi Moore (The Substance) is favored for best actress, although Mikey Madison's BAFTA and Independent Spirit wins for Anora makes it more of a race. Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) is most likely in best actor — though SAG winner Timothee Chalamet could threaten — while Zoe Saldana (Emilia Perez) is the supporting actress front-runner and Kieran Culkin (A Real Pain) is the favorite for best supporting actor. None of those awards, however, is considered a definite lock. What's the deal with ‘Emilia Perez’? Jacques Audiard’s Emilia Perez, a narco-musical about a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender-affirming surgery, comes in with a leading 13 nominations. The film, at one point, seemed like Netflix’s best chance yet to land the streamer its first best picture win. Its star, Karla Sofia Gascon, made history by becoming the first openly trans actor nominated for an Oscar. But no nominee has had a rockier post-nominations Oscar campaign. After old offensive tweets by Gascon were uncovered, the actress issued an apology. The fallout, though, has badly damaged a movie that was already a divisive contender, and led Netflix to radically refocus its flagging campaign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oscar-performers-include-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-and-doja-cat/7986581.html	2025-02-24T14:24:48-08:00	
Doctors Without Borders halts activities at Sudan's Zamzam camp due to heavy fighting	Doctors Without Borders on Monday halted its operations in Sudan's famine-stricken Zamzam camp due to an escalation of attacks and fighting in the vicinity. The international medical aid group, also known by its French name Medecins Sans Frontieres and acronym MSF, said fighting between the Sudanese military and its rival paramilitary the Rapid Support Forces intensified in the camp, located in North Darfur. The escalation made it 'impossible' for the group to provide life-saving humanitarian needs to thousands of displaced people in the area, it said in a statement, adding it had suspended all activities in Zamzam, including at its field hospital. 'Halting our project in the midst of a worsening disaster in Zamzam is a heart-breaking decision,' said Yahya Kalilah, the group's head of mission in Sudan. Kalilah said that being close to violence, experiencing great difficulty in sending supplies, dealing with the 'impossibility' of sending experienced staff, and the uncertainty around routes out of the camp, left MSF with 'little choice.' Sudan plunged into war when fighting began in April 2023 between the military and the RSF after simmering tensions. As a result of fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to the other parts of the country. The conflict that killed more than 24,000 people, forced over 14 million people out of their homes, and created famine across various parts of the country. The fighting in Zamzam ramped up Feb. 11-12, according to MSF. The field hospital received 130 wounded patients, most suffering from gunshot and shrapnel wounds. The MSF facility in Zamzam can't provide trauma surgery for those in critical conditions as it was originally established to address the significant malnutrition crisis unfolding in the camp. Kalilah said that 11 patients died in the hospital, including five children, because staff couldn't treat them properly or refer them to the local hospital in El Fasher, the regional capital. Access to water and food in the area has been more compromised because of the fighting, according to the MSF. The central market has been looted and burned. Zamzam camp hosts around 500,000 people and has seen displaced families newly arriving from the areas of Abu Zerega, Shagra, and Saluma, who told MSF teams of abuses in villages and roads in the El Fasher locality that include killings, sexual violence, lootings and beatings. 'In January and December, two of our ambulances carrying patients from the camp to El Fasher were shot at,' Kalilah said. 'Now, it's even more dangerous and as a result, many people, including patients requiring trauma surgery or emergency caesarean sections, are trapped in Zamzam.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/doctors-without-borders-halts-activities-at-sudan-s-zamzam-camp-due-to-heavy-fighting-/7986565.html	2025-02-24T14:23:29-08:00	
US judge allows Trump's AP Oval Office ban to stand over use of 'Gulf of Mexico' name	WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Monday denied a request by the Associated Press to restore full access for the news agency's journalists after President Donald Trump's administration barred them for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in coverage. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, declined to immediately grant the AP's request for a temporary injunction restoring its access to the Oval Office and Air Force One during a hearing in Washington federal court. The AP sued three senior Trump aides on Friday, arguing that the decision to block its reporters from those locations violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of speech by trying to dictate the language they use in reporting the news. Lawyers for the Trump administration argued in a court filing before the hearing that the AP does not have a constitutional right to what it called 'special media access to the president.' White House Communications Director Steven Cheung in an earlier statement had called the AP lawsuit a 'blatant PR stunt.' During an appearance last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also said, 'We feel we are in the right in this position.' Leavitt is one of the three White House officials named as defendants in the lawsuit. The other two, Chief of Staff Susan Wiles and Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich, have not responded to requests for comment. Trump signed an executive order last month directing the U.S. Interior Department to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The AP said in January it would continue to use the gulf's long-established name in stories while also acknowledging Trump's efforts to change it. The White House banned AP reporters in response. The ban prevents the AP's journalists from seeing and hearing Trump and other top White House officials as they take newsworthy actions or respond in real time to news events. The White House Correspondents' Association said in a legal brief backing the AP in the case that the ban 'will chill and distort news coverage of the president to the public's detriment.' Reuters released a statement in support of the AP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-allows-trump-s-ap-oval-office-ban-to-stand-over-use-of-gulf-of-mexico-name-/7986557.html	2025-02-24T14:05:10-08:00	
Clint Hill, agent who leaped onto JFK's car after president was shot, dies at 93	BELVEDERE, CALIFORNIA — Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent who leaped onto the back of President John F. Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot, then was forced to retire early because he remained haunted by memories of the assassination, has died. He was 93. Hill died Friday at his home in Belvedere, California, according to his publisher, Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. A cause of death was not given. Although few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on Abraham Zapruder's chilling home movie of the assassination, provided some of the most indelible images of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. Hill received Secret Service awards and was promoted for his actions that day, but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy's death, saying he didn't react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save the president. 'If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess,' a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS' 60 Minutes in 1975, shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. 'And I'll live with that to my grave.' It was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally start putting the assassination behind him and accept what happened. On the day of the assassination, Hill was assigned to protect first lady Jacqueline Kennedy and was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its way through Dealey Plaza. Hill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine. Zapruder's film captured Hill as he leaped from the Secret Service car, grabbed a handle on the limousine's trunk and pulled himself onto it as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy, who had crawled onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off. Hill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service, retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and recurring memories of the assassination. The 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller In the Line of Fire, about a former Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in part by Hill. Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency's Denver office for about a year, before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and first family. Since his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the assassination only a handful of times, but the most poignant was his 1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several times. 'If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today,' Hill said. 'You mean you would have gotten there, and you would have taken the shot?' Wallace asked. 'The third shot, yes, sir,' Hill said. 'And that would have been all right with you?' 'That would have been fine with me,' Hill responded. In his 2005 memoir, Between You and Me, Wallace recalled his interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career. In 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN's Larry King Live, where Hill credited that first 60 Minutes interview with helping him finally start the healing process. 'I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then thank him more because he's what caused me to finally come to terms with things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,' he said. 'It was because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to recover.' Decades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books — including Mrs. Kennedy and Me and Five Presidents — about his Secret Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021. 'We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for,' McCubbin Hill said in a statement. 'We were soulmates.' Clint Hill also became a speaker and gave interviews about his experience in Dallas. In 2018, he was given the state of North Dakota's highest civilian honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A portrait of Hill adorns the Capitol gallery of fellow honorees. A private funeral service will be held in Washington, D.C., on a future date.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clint-hill-agent-who-leaped-onto-jfk-s-car-after-president-was-shot-dies-at-93/7986546.html	2025-02-24T14:01:35-08:00

VOA Russian: Analyst notes Russia's military equipment losses in war with Ukraine	VOA Russian spoke to independent analyst Jakub Janovsky who documents Russian military equipment losses in the war with Ukraine. He noted that Russia has lost 136 military planes and 151 helicopters in three years of the war, reducing its aviation fleet so Moscow now relies more on long-range missiles and drones. Janovsky also said Russia has noticeably reduced the use of the heavy military equipment, such as tanks and armored fighting vehicles, on the frontline in Ukraine in the past several months, though the reasons for that are unknown.

At UN, competing resolutions on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine approved	The U.N. General Assembly marked the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine by narrowly approving competing resolutions on ending the war, one drafted by Kyiv with the European Union, and a second from the United States. 'Russia believed Ukraine would surrender. Russia believed we would fall in three days. Russia believed our government would flee. However, Russia miscalculated gravely,' Mariana Betsa, Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, told the gathering, saying Ukrainians continue to stand firm and resist. In the weeks leading up to the meeting, there was only the Ukrainian draft resolution, which reflected previous ones adopted by the 193-member body. That resolution included a reference to Russia’s 'full-scale invasion of Ukraine' and called for a 'comprehensive, just and lasting peace' in line with the United Nations Charter and 'within its internationally recognized borders.' Then late Friday afternoon, the United States put forward its own brief text, titled: 'The Path to Peace,' which called for 'a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.' It did not mention Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s U.N. ambassador called the U.S. draft 'a good move.' 'This is our opportunity to build real momentum toward peace,' U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Friday. European diplomats met through the weekend to find a way to prevent the U.S. draft from undermining international support for Ukraine at a critical moment in the war. On Monday, they proposed three amendments to the U.S. text, all of which were adopted by the General Assembly. They added language to the U.S. text that included replacing the wording 'the Russia-Ukraine conflict' with 'the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.' A paragraph was inserted that said: 'Reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters.' The paragraph also included language on supporting the U.N. Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. When the amended U.S. text was put to a vote, Washington abstained on its own resolution. It was adopted with 93 states in favor, 8 against and 73 abstentions. 'These amendments pursue a war of words rather than an end to the war,' U.S. envoy Dorothy Shea said. 'The attempt to add this language detracts from what we are trying to achieve with this forward-looking resolution: A firm consensus from the members of this body to unite behind a resolution calling for the end to this conflict.' Russia also voted against the U.S. draft, because their attempt to amend it with language to address what it says are the root causes of the conflict was rejected by the Assembly. 'The essence of it has become completely distorted,' Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, but he welcomed the U.S. move and said he hoped it would be followed by other new initiatives. 'I think that today, our American colleagues have seen for themselves that the road to peace in Ukraine will not be an easy one, and there will be many who will try to make sure the peace does not come for as long as possible,' Nebenzia said. The Ukrainian resolution was approved to loud applause with 93 states in favor, 18 against and 65 abstentions. It was the weakest support Ukraine has had over the course of the last three years in the Assembly. The United States voted against the Ukrainian text as did Russia, its allies Belarus and North Korea, several African states, European Union outlier Hungary, and Israel. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they do carry the moral weight of the international community. The United States is expected to still bring its original draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council later Monday for a vote. It would need the support of at least nine of the 15 members and no veto from any permanent member — Britain, China, France, Russia or the United States. The Europeans have said they will bring their three amendments to the council for a vote as well. A senior State Department official said Monday that Washington would veto any amendments — European or Russian — to its original text. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in Geneva on Monday, where he said countries 'must spare no effort to bring an end to this conflict and achieve a just and lasting peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions.' Macron in Washington The diplomatic drama at the United Nations was taking place as French President Emmanuel Macron was at the White House for a meeting and lunch with President Donald Trump that included discussions about the war in Ukraine. Macron said last week that he planned to tell Trump the U.S. leader 'cannot be weak' in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to visit Washington later this week for similar talks, and like Macron has emphasized the need for Ukraine’s sovereignty to be at the center of any peace effort. A group of leaders including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited Kyiv on Monday in a show of support for Ukraine. 'We are in Kyiv today, because Ukraine is Europe,' von der Leyen said on X. 'In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake. It’s Europe’s destiny.' New EU sanctions on Moscow European Union foreign ministers on Monday approved a new round of sanctions against Russia, which EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said include measures against ships that work to evade restrictions on transporting certain goods, banks that circumvent sanctions and equipment used to pilot drones. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the new sanctions 'entirely predictable,' and said the European nations seemed to want the war to continue. Fighting continued Monday with Russia saying it shot down 23 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 16 over the Oryol region. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-competing-resolutions-on-ending-russia-s-war-in-ukraine-approved/7986387.html	2025-02-24T12:06:00-08:00	
Russia's 3-year-war on Ukraine still unresolved	Russia’s war on Ukraine hit the three-year mark Monday and the conflict is no more settled than it was when Moscow’s troops first stormed across the border of its neighbor. In the earliest days of fighting, Russian President Vladimir Putin had hoped to quickly overwhelm Kyiv’s forces and capture the one-time Soviet satellite state. But Ukrainian forces, supplied with tens of billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. and European munitions, fought back over three years and now the war is at something of a deadly stalemate with any settlement of it, and on what terms, in a state of uncertainty. By numerous accounts, hundreds of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or wounded, along with tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians who have been killed and injured in the Russian ground and aerial attacks. Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally seized in 2014, and lands captured by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in the ensuing years and territory taken over by Moscow’s forces since the war started on Feb. 24, 2022. As the war rages, Russian troops are gaining even more territory. But the political overseers who could control Ukraine’s fate have changed. Former U.S. President Joe Biden, who led the Western coalition of nations funding Ukraine’s war effort, vowed continued support for Kyiv against Russia for 'as long as it takes.' Now, the new U.S. leader is President Donald Trump, who declined last year during a political debate to say he wanted Ukraine to win the war. Last week he called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator.' Trump claimed that Zelenskyy, not Putin, started the war, and laid the groundwork for a settlement of the war with Putin. Last week, the U.S. and Russia excluded Ukraine and European countries from the initial discussions, with Trump saying Zelenskyy could have negotiated with Russia three years ago to talk Putin out of invading. On Monday, more than a dozen Western leaders attended events in Ukraine to mark the third anniversary of the war. Trump has said he wants the carnage to end, but Ukrainian and European officials are worried that he envisions a settlement that would be more favorable to Moscow than Kyiv. He has demanded that Ukraine turn over a large portion of its rare earth minerals to the U.S. to pay for its military support over the last three years. The Kremlin says it has no intention of yielding any of the territory it now holds while the U.S. says that Ukraine’s goal of joining NATO, the West’s key military alliance, as part of a negotiated end to the war is unrealistic. U.S. officials say both Russia and Ukraine will have to make concessions to reach a peace deal, but the terms of any settlement are far from a conclusion. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned at a conference in Kyiv that world security is at stake depending on how the Russia-Ukraine war might end. 'The autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there's any impunity if you violate international borders or invade your neighbor, or if there is true deterrence,' she said. Some of Ukraine's most important backers, including European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were among the stream of dignitaries arriving by train in Kyiv. Others spoke at a conference via video link. The officials echoed similar messages that Ukraine and its European partners must be consulted in any peace negotiations, Putin's ambitions must be thwarted, and Europe must take on more of the burden for its own defense. The shift in Washington's policy toward Ukraine under Trump has touched off deep concerns in Europe, where governments fear being sidelined by the U.S. in efforts to secure a peace deal and are weighing how they might pick up the slack of any cut in U.S. aid for Ukraine. European Council President Antonio Costa announced Sunday that he would convene an emergency summit of the 27 European Union leaders in Brussels on March 6, with Ukraine at the top of the agenda. 'We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,' he said in a post on social media. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are both heading to Washington this week to meet with Trump. Starmer said Ukrainians' voices 'must be at the heart of the drive for peace,' while Trump's intervention had 'changed the global conversation' and 'created an opportunity.' 'Russia does not hold all the cards in this war,' Starmer said. EU foreign ministers Monday approved a new array of sanctions against Russia that target Moscow’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of ships that it uses to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU said 74 vessels were added to its shadow fleet list. Asset freezes and travel bans were imposed on 83 officials and 'entities,' typically government agencies, banks or companies. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would provide a more than $1 billion military systems package to Ukraine this year. Coming off his victory in Sunday's German elections, conservative leader Friedrich Merz — also a staunch backer of Ukraine — posted on X Monday: 'More than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength.' 'For a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations,' he wrote. The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, insisted that the U.S. cannot seal any peace deal to end the war without Ukraine or Europe being involved. She highlighted what she said were pro-Russian positions being taken by the Trump administration. 'You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine, then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal,' Kallas told reporters in Brussels.

Taliban continues corporal punishment, flogging 20 Afghans over alleged adultery	ISLAMABAD — Afghanistan’s hard-line Taliban authorities publicly flogged 20 men and women Monday on charges of adultery, rape, and engaging in 'illegitimate relations.' The Taliban's Supreme Court reported that all defendants received sentences of 39 lashes each and prison terms ranging from one to seven years. The punishments were carried out in the eastern Khost and central Parwan provinces, with residents, judicial, and government officials among the spectators. Since regaining control of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban have publicly flogged hundreds of men and women. Most were charged with offenses such as adultery, sodomy, eloping, having illegitimate relations and robbery. The number of Afghans subjected to flogging this month alone has reached 86, with 17 women among the victims, according to data from the top court. The United Nations has condemned corporal punishment being conducted by the Taliban as a violation of international law and human dignity, calling for the practice to be halted immediately. The Taliban government, which is not recognized by any country, defends its criminal justice system and overall governance by stating that they are aligned with Islamic law or Sharia and dismissing foreign criticism as misguided. The de facto Afghan leaders have placed sweeping restrictions on women’s access to education and employment, effectively erasing most of them from public life in Afghanistan and drawing persistent calls from the U.N. to reverse what it condemns as 'gender-apartheid.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-continues-corporal-punishment-flogging-20-afghans-over-alleged-adultery-/7986154.html	2025-02-24T10:16:29-08:00	
Roberta Flack, Grammy-winning singer with an intimate style, dies at 88	NEW YORK — Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose intimate vocal and musical style on Killing Me Softly with His Song, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and other hits made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday. She was 88. She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing, Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face as the soundtrack for one of cinema's more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film Play Misty for Me. The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack's graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year. In 1973, she matched both achievements with Killing Me Softly, becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record. She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that 'her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.' Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach. For Flack's many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges — for which she was acquitted — for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, major league baseball's first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children's entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, Free to Be ... You and Me.	https://www.voanews.com/a/roberta-flack-grammy-winning-singer-with-an-intimate-style-dies-at-88/7986124.html	2025-02-24T08:50:54-08:00	
Apple to build 23,200-square meter facility in Texas	U.S. tech giant Apple has announced plans to create some 20,000 jobs and invest $500 billion over the next four years in the United States. Apple says it will expand teams and facilities in nine states across the country and that it aims to open a 23,200-square-meter server manufacturing facility in Texas in 2026. The announcement comes just days after Apple CEO Tim Cook met with U.S. President Donald Trump. 'We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,' Cook said on the investment. 'From doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we’re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we’ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation,' he added in a company statement. Trump thanked Cook and Apple for the investment on Monday morning on the social media platform Truth Social. 'Apple has just announced a record $500 billion investment in the United States of America. The reason, faith in what we are doing, without which, they wouldn’t be investing 10 cents,' Trump said. Most of Apple’s consumer goods are currently assembled and produced overseas. Many of them, assembled in China, are liable to 10% tariffs imposed by Trump earlier in February. To reduce its reliance on international supply chains, Apple announced in January that it had begun mass producing its own chips at an Arizona factory owned by TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The TSMC Arizona factory, along with legislation aimed at increasing U.S. semiconductor production, were two of Trump’s largest industrial policy moves during his first term. In a release on its website, Apple said the $500 billion commitment includes the company’s work with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states, direct employment, Apple Intelligence infrastructure and data centers, corporate facilities, and Apple TV+ production in 20 states. Apple said it is also set to open a manufacturing academy in Michigan, offering training led by engineers and local university staff to support mid-sized manufacturing firms in areas like project management and manufacturing processes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/apple-to-build-23-200-square-meter-facility-in-texas/7986112.html	2025-02-24T08:33:59-08:00	
US imposes new sanctions on Iran's 'shadow fleet'	Washington — The United States imposed sanctions on more than 30 people and vessels for their role in selling and transporting Iranian petroleum-related products as part of Tehran's 'shadow fleet,' the Treasury Department said. The sanctions target oil brokers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Hong Kong, tanker operators and mangers in India and China, the head of Iran's National Iranian Oil Company, and the Iranian Oil Terminals Company, Treasury said. It said the vessels sanctioned ship tens of millions of barrels of crude oil valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the department said in a statement. 'Iran continues to rely on a shadowy network of vessels, shippers, and brokers to facilitate its oil sales and fund its destabilizing activities,' said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The sanctions build on those imposed by the Biden administration. Such sanctions target key sectors of Iran's economy with the aim of denying the government funds for its nuclear and missile programs. The move generally prohibits any U.S. individuals or entities from doing any business with the targets and freezes any U.S.-held assets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iran-shadow-fleet/7986107.html	2025-02-24T08:28:45-08:00

Pakistan, Azerbaijan sign agreements, MOUs on trade and energy	Islamabad — Pakistan and Azerbaijan have signed agreements and memorandums of understanding (MOUs), chiefly about trade and energy, during a visit to Azerbaijan by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Sharif arrived Sunday in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, for a two-day visit to hold talks with President Ilham Aliyev and other top officials. In a post on social media, the Pakistani leader said he had an 'excellent meeting' with Aliyev, saying the two worked on finalizing a portfolio of investments Azerbaijan plans to make in Pakistan. Aliyev promised a $2 billion investment during a visit to Pakistan last July. 'This will be the first quantum jump in our trade and investment relations and will be a huge reflection of our fraternal ties,' a statement from the Pakistani prime minister’s office quoted Sharif as saying. This is Sharif’s second visit to the Central Asian country since taking office in February of last year. Aliyev is expected to sign final agreements for investment during a visit to Pakistan in April. 'We received concrete projects from Pakistan, and Azerbaijani representatives are evaluating them. Today we put ambitious and realistic targets to finalize all the discussions within one month and by the beginning of April, the documents will be prepared for signing,' the Pakistani statement quoted Aliyev as saying. Agreements on pipeline, LNG delivery During Sharif’s visit, Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil company, SOCAR, exchanged several MOUs with Pakistan’s oil trading and refining companies, including one to complete a pipeline in the South Asian country, Pakistan's state-run news agency reported. The Machike-Thallian-Tarujabba White Oil Pipeline Project is designed to transport oil within Pakistan. Both sides also signed updated agreements and MOUs on the delivery of liquified natural gas, or LNG, from Azerbaijan to Pakistan. Prior to the trip, Pakistan’s Economic Cooperation Committee approved a three-year extension of the LNG Framework Agreement between SOCAR and Pakistan LNG Limited Thursday. Signed in 2023, the agreement allows Pakistan to procure one shipload of LNG per month when required, without any financial commitments, according to the statement from Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance. Such an agreement allows Pakistan to purchase energy products as needed rather than using precious foreign exchange reserves to pay for unused cargo. According to Sharif’s office, Aliyev also discussed joint defense production with Pakistan. 'Azerbaijan has already acquired defense equipment from Pakistan and we are satisfied with the quality of this equipment and we will continue to do it,' the Azerbaijani leader was quoted as saying. Last September, the Pakistani military signed a deal to sell JF-17 Thunder block III fighter jets to the Central Asian country. The jets are jointly produced by Pakistan and China. The visit, aimed at bringing more foreign investment to Pakistan, comes as the country prepares for a review of a three-year bailout program with the International Monetary Fund when the lender’s team visits in March. Pakistan reached a $7 billion loan agreement with the Washington-based lender last September to avoid a balance-of-payment crisis. In a push to further deepen ties with Central Asian countries, Sharif heads to Uzbekistan Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-azerbaijan-sign-agreements-mous-on-trade-and-energy/7986025.html	2025-02-24T07:22:22-08:00	
Russian court upholds French researcher's jail sentence	Moscow — A Russian court on Monday upheld a three-year prison sentence for French researcher Laurent Vinatier, one of several Westerners jailed by Russia during the Ukraine offensive. France condemned the sentence as 'arbitrary' and demanded Vinatier's 'immediate release,' after accusing Russia of taking Westerners hostage. Vinatier, who works for a Swiss conflict mediation NGO, was arrested last summer as tensions with France and other Western countries soared over Ukraine. In October, Russia found Vinatier guilty of gathering information on the Russian military and of violating its 'foreign agent' law — which has usually been reserved for Russian nationals. 'The sentence... against Laurent Vinatier is left unchanged,' judge Tatyana Sokolova said at an appeal hearing, an AFP reporter in court heard. After the sentence was upheld, tears welled in Vinatier's eyes. Speaking in Russian in a video link from prison, Vinatier had earlier told the court: 'I fully admit my guilt. I repent.' The researcher has said he was not aware that he should have registered as a 'foreign agent.' The label, which has Stalin-era connotations, has mainly been used against domestic Kremlin critics. Vinatier worked as an adviser with the Geneva-based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue and is a veteran researcher on Russia and other post-Soviet countries. Vinatier has said in court that in his work he always tried to 'present Russia's interests in international relations.' 'Everything I did in Russia together with its representatives was only for the sake of peace,' Vinatier said. His lawyer Oleg Besonov said the sentence was 'too severe' and told the court that Vinatier had two dependent minor children, one of whom is disabled. The French foreign ministry in a statement repeated a demand for Russia to release Vinatier and repeal its 'foreign agents' law, which it said goes against Russia's human rights commitments. French President Emmanuel Macron has repeatedly called on Russia to free Vinatier, saying that he is unfairly detained and that the 'propaganda' against him 'does not match reality.' Paris is one of Ukraine's strongest supporters and Russia has singled out France as a particularly hostile state during the conflict. Russia has arrested several Westerners since its offensive in Ukraine and held several prisoner exchanges with the United States, including the biggest East-West swap since the Cold War in August 2024. Tensions between Europe and Moscow remain high, while US President Donald Trump meanwhile has warmed U.S. ties with the Kremlin in a dramatic policy shift. This month, Russia freed a U.S. citizen, Kalob Byers, just a few days after detaining him at a Moscow airport for possession of cannabis-laced gummies in his luggage, a sign of a major turnaround between Moscow and Washington. Several U.S. citizens previously spent long stints in Russian jails before being exchanged. Basketball player Brittney Griner, arrested with prescribed medicinal cannabis oil in her luggage, spent 10 months in jail before being swapped, while Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was held in prison for almost one and a half years on 'espionage' charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-court-upholds-french-researcher-s-jail-sentence-/7986013.html	2025-02-24T07:20:41-08:00	
Syria's national dialogue conference set to kick off Monday	Damascus — A long-awaited national dialogue conference intended to help chart Syria’s political future after the fall of former President Bashar Assad is set to begin Monday. The main session will be held on Tuesday, with participants holding workshops to discuss transitional justice, the structure of a new constitution, reforming and building institutions, personal freedoms, the role of civil society and the country’s economy. The outcome of the national dialogue will be nonbinding recommendations to the country’s new leaders. Plans for the conference — which had been promised by the country’s new authorities in the immediate aftermath of Assad’s fall in a lightning rebel offensive in December — had been in flux up until the last minute. The date of the conference was announced on Sunday, one day before it was to start. Two days before that announcement, Hassan al-Daghim, spokesperson for the committee organizing the national dialogue, had said the date of the conference had not been set and the timing was 'up for discussion by the citizens.' He also said the number of participants had not been determined yet and might range from 400 to 1,000. It was not clear Monday what the final number would be or how the invited participants had been selected. The committee said Sunday that it had held more than 30 meetings across Syria’s provinces in which some 4,000 people participated in the runup to the conference 'to ensure the representation of various components of Syrian society,' state-run news agency SANA reported. It said participants had repeatedly called for a temporary constitutional declaration, an economic plan, the restructuring of government sectors, involving citizens in the management of institutions, and enhancing security and stability. After Assad was toppled, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its 'salvation government' that had ruled in northwestern Syria. They said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria’s interim president after a meeting of most of the country’s former rebel factions. The groups agreed to dissolve the country’s constitution, the former national army, security service and official political parties. The armed groups present at the meetings also agreed to dissolve themselves and for their members to be absorbed into the new national army and security forces. Notably absent was the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which holds sway in northeastern Syria and which has not been invited to participate in the national dialogue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-national-dialogue-conference-set-to-kick-off-monday-/7985773.html	2025-02-24T03:55:31-08:00	
Xi affirms 'no limits' partnership with Putin in call on Ukraine war anniversary	BEIJING — China's President Xi Jinping reaffirmed his 'no limits' partnership in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, China's state media reported, on the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The leaders held the talks as U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a quick deal to end the Ukraine war, raising the prospect that Washington could draw a wedge between Xi and Putin and focus on competing with the world's second largest economy. The call appeared aimed at dispelling any such prospects — the two leaders underscored the durability and the 'long-term' nature of their alliance, with its own 'internal dynamics' that would not be impacted by any 'third party.' 'China-Russia relations have strong internal driving force and unique strategic value, and are not aimed at, nor are they influenced by, any third party,' said Xi, according to the official readout published by state media. 'The development strategies and foreign policies of China and Russia are long-term,' said Xi Trump has alarmed Washington's European allies by leaving them and Ukraine out of talks with Russia last week and blaming Ukraine for Russia's 2022 invasion. This was the second call both leaders have held this year, after they discussed in January how to build ties with Trump. China and Russia declared a 'no limits' strategic partnership, days before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Xi has met Putin over 40 times in the past decade and Putin in recent months described China as an 'ally.' Beijing has refused to condemn Moscow for its role in the war, straining its ties with Europe and the U.S. as a result.	https://www.voanews.com/a/xi-affirms-no-limits-partnership-with-putin-in-call-on-ukraine-war-anniversary-/7985763.html	2025-02-24T03:41:13-08:00	
Projectiles thrown at Russian consulate in France, one explodes, says security source	MARSEILLE, France — Two projectiles were thrown at the perimeter wall of Russia's consulate in the southern French port city of Marseille on Monday, one of which exploded, a French security source said. It was not immediately clear if the projectiles cleared the wall. BFM TV said the projectiles were Molotov cocktails and that they landed in the consulate's garden. Russia demanded a full French investigation and said the incident looked like an act of terrorism, state news agency TASS reported. No one was injured, the security source said. Consulate staff were kept indoors and police set up a security perimeter around the consulate. The incident in the southern French city took place on the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war. 'The explosions on the territory of the Russian Consulate General in Marseille have all the hallmarks of a terrorist attack,' TASS quoted Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying.	https://www.voanews.com/a/projectiles-thrown-at-russian-consulate-in-france-one-explodes-says-security-source/7985736.html	2025-02-24T02:51:08-08:00	
China says rising food demand requires production boost	Beijing — China's rising demand for food calls for increased efforts to boost grain production even after record-high output in recent years, China's Central Rural Work Leading Group said on Monday. 'More than 1.4 billion of us want to eat, and we want to eat better and better,' Han Wenxiu, a director from China's Central Rural Work Leading Group told a news conference. More people eat meat, eggs and milk in greater volumes, which requires a large-scale increase in grain for feed, Han said. China is the world's largest agriculture producer and importer, bringing in more than 157 million metric tons of grain and soybeans last year, when it also reported record grain production of 706.5 million tons. In its annual rural work policy blueprint released on Sunday, known as the No. 1 document, the State Council sharpened China's focus on self-sufficiency and supply stability to counter potential disruptions to agricultural trade with the United States, the European Union and Canada. Last year's bumper harvest helped to stabilize prices and relieved consumers' concerns, Han said. But he cited 'the current complex and severe domestic and international environment,' and said the need to buffer shocks from extreme weather conditions called for increased output. 'The central government's policy is clear: grain production can only be strengthened, not relaxed. We must not say that grains have passed the test just because of a momentary downturn in prices,' he said. China has further potential to develop and integrate biotechnology, strengthen equipment support and build a diversified food supply system to ensure food security, he said. The agriculture ministry aims to increase grain production by 50 million tons by 2030, which would be a 7% increase over 2024's grain harvest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-rising-food-demand-requires-production-boost/7985727.html	2025-02-24T02:37:04-08:00	
Thousands in limbo on Thai-Myanmar border after scam center crackdown	BANGKOK — Thousands of foreigners freed from online scam-operating centers in Myanmar are stuck in limbo on the border with Thailand after a multinational crackdown on the compounds run by criminal gangs, three sources told Reuters on Monday. In recent weeks, authorities from China, Thailand and Myanmar have attempted to dismantle scam centers and illegal online operations on the border, part of a network of illegal compounds across Southeast Asia where hundreds of thousands have been trafficked by gangs, according to the United Nations. Thai and Cambodian police raided a building in a border town and freed 215 foreigners, a senior Thai official said on Sunday. Two Myanmar armed groups - the Karen National Army (KNA) and the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA)- are currently holding around 7,000 former scam center workers but are unable to send them to Thailand, a Thai security official and two aid workers said. 'Many are stuck in limbo and Thailand's lack of response is causing great harm,' said one of aid workers, currently on the Thai side of the border. 'It is like these victims are being revictimized again.' Thailand's foreign ministry said that agencies are currently planning for future handovers of those freed, which would 'proceed based on the readiness of the embassies or the countries of origin.' KNA and DKBA officials did not respond to calls from Reuters. The majority of these workers are Chinese, with about 1,000 from other foreign countries, according to the aid workers. Many of the former scam center workers are being held in dire conditions and local authorities are concerned about the lack of sanitation and health facilities, they said. Thai Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said last Thursday that Thailand doesn't have the capacity to accept more people unless foreign embassies repatriate those crossing over. Thailand this month accepted 260 scam center workers, more than half of whom were from Ethiopia, which has no embassy in the country. Thai authorities also allowed China to repatriate 621 of its nationals via a series of flights from a border town last week. Scam centers have been operating in the region for years, but face renewed scrutiny after the rescue of Chinese actor, Wang Xing, who was lured to Thailand with the promise of a job, and then abducted and taken to one such center in Myanmar. Southeast Asian countries have since stepped up efforts to tackle scam centers, including Thailand cutting power, fuel and internet supply to areas linked with scam centers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-in-limbo-on-thai-myanmar-border-after-scam-center-crackdown/7985721.html	2025-02-24T02:27:57-08:00	
Pope resting on 10th day of hospitalization	ROME — Pope Francis was resting Monday morning after a quiet night, on the 10th day of his hospitalization for a complex lung infection that has provoked the early stages of kidney failure, the Vatican said. The one-line statement didn’t say if Francis, 88, had woken up. 'The night passed well, the pope slept and is resting,' it said. Late Sunday, doctors reported that blood tests showed early kidney failure that was nevertheless under control. They said Francis remained in critical condition but that he hadn't experienced any further respiratory crises since Saturday. He was receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen and, on Sunday, was alert, responsive and attended Mass. They said his prognosis was guarded. Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. They have warned that the main threat facing Francis is sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. To date there has been no reference to any onset of sepsis in the medical updates provided by the Vatican, including on Sunday. Monday marks Francis’ 10th day in the hospital, making this equal to the longest hospitalization of his papacy. He spent 10 days at Rome’s Gemelli hospital in 2021 after he had 33 centimeters of his colon removed. In New York on Sunday, Cardinal Timothy Dolan acknowledged what church leaders in Rome weren’t saying publicly: that the Catholic faithful were united 'at the bedside of a dying father.' 'As our Holy Father Pope Francis is in very, very fragile health, and probably close to death,' Dolan said in his homily from the pulpit of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, though he later told reporters he hoped and prayed that Francis would 'bounce back.' Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. His condition has revived speculation about what might happen if he becomes unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, and whether he might resign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-resting-on-10th-day-of-hospitalization/7985700.html	2025-02-24T00:54:13-08:00	
Germany's Merz faces tricky talks with potential coalition ally	BERLIN — Germany's likely next chancellor Friedrich Merz will start trying to form a coalition government on Monday after his conservative bloc won a national election that saw far-right and far-left parties hoover up support from disaffected voters. Merz, who has no previous experience in office, is set to take charge with Europe's largest economy ailing, its society split over migration and its security caught between a confrontational U.S. and an assertive Russia and China. The 69-year-old faces lengthy coalition negotiations after the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged to a historic second place in a fractured vote, following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's unloved three-way alliance. In an early indication of his policy intentions, Merz also took aim at the U.S. after his win, criticizing the 'ultimately outrageous' comments flowing from Washington during the campaign, comparing them to hostile interventions from Russia. 'For me, the absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that we can achieve real independence from the USA, step by step,' Merz said on Sunday. His conservative CDU/CSU bloc came in first place on 28.6%, ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany on 20.8%, its best-ever result, according to provisional results. Mainstream parties, however, rule out working with the AfD, a party which is monitored by German security services on suspicion of extremism but has been endorsed by U.S. figures including billionaire Elon Musk. That means Merz will have to negotiate with Scholz's center-left Social Democrats (SPD) to form a coalition in talks that are likely to take months following a bruising campaign that highlighted policy differences. Merz will, however, not have to rely on support from the Greens for an outright parliamentary majority, after the new BSW party founded by Sahra Wagenknecht, a former leader of the Left party, just missed the 5% threshold required to enter the lower house.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-merz-faces-tricky-talks-with-potential-coalition-ally/7985692.html	2025-02-24T00:23:53-08:00	
UN to vote on Russia-Ukraine war resolutions	A resolution drafted by the United States and another drafted by Ukraine and backed by the European Union calling for an end to the war in Ukraine are set for votes Monday at the United Nations. The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on the Ukrainian resolution, followed by the U.S. resolution. The U.N. Security Council is expected to hold its own vote on the U.S. resolution later in the day. The U.S. calls for 'a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.' The U.S.-drafted measure does not mention Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began three years ago Monday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the resolution would 'affirm that this conflict is awful, that the U.N. can help end it, and that peace is possible.' 'This is our opportunity to build real momentum toward peace,' Rubio said in a statement. The more extensive Ukrainian resolution says the Russian invasion 'has persisted for three years and continues to have devastating and long-lasting consequences not only for Ukraine, but also for other regions and global stability.' It calls for 'a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine' and highlights the need for the war to end this year. The Ukrainian draft says earlier resolutions adopted by the General Assembly need to be fully implemented, including those calling for Russia to fully withdraw from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they do carry the moral weight of the international community. At the Security Council, a resolution needs the support of at least nine of the 15 members, with none of the permanent members—Britain, China, France, Russia, or United States—using their veto power. The U.S. measure is expected to have enough support Monday. The votes come as French President Emmanuel Macron visits the United States for talks with President Donald Trump that are expected to include the war in Ukraine. Macron said last week that he planned to tell Trump the U.S. leader 'cannot be weak' in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to visit Washington later this week for similar talks, and like Macron has emphasized the need for Ukraine’s sovereignty to be at the center of any peace effort. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa visited Kyiv on Monday in a show of support for Ukraine. 'We are in Kyiv today, because Ukraine is Europe,' von der Leyen said on X. 'In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake. It’s Europe’s destiny.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-to-vote-on-russia-ukraine-war-resolutions/7985679.html	2025-02-23T23:41:17-08:00	
Kenyan police officer killed in Haiti in confrontation with gang members	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — A Kenyan police officer was killed on Sunday in Haiti, north of the capital, Port-au-Prince, the first casualty since the Kenyan-led security mission arrived in the Caribbean country in June 2024, the mission's authorities said. The Multinational Security Support Mission to Haiti said in a statement on Sunday that the Kenyan officer was injured during an operation in the Artibonite department and then airlifted to a hospital, where he died. Jack Ombaka, the mission's spokesperson, told Reuters that Sunday's casualty was the first the mission has suffered since the U.N.-backed anti-gang force arrived in the country, where rampant gang violence has displaced more than a million people. The officer was killed during a confrontation with gang members, Ombaka wrote in a statement. 'We salute our fallen hero,' the statement read. 'We will pursue these gangs to the last man standing. We will not let you down.' The death on Sunday came amid a surge in gang-related violence in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince over the last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-police-officer-killed-in-haiti-in-confrontation-with-gang-members/7985667.html	2025-02-23T22:55:05-08:00	
Philippine, Japan ministers agree to further enhance defense partnership	Manila, Philippines — Japan and the Philippines agreed on Monday to further deepen defense ties in the face of an 'increasingly severe' security environment in the Indo-Pacific region, Japanese defense minister Gen Nakatani said on Monday. Nakatani met his Philippine counterpart Gilberto Teodoro in Manila for a meeting in which the two ministers tackled regional security issues, including the maritime situation in the East and South China Seas. 'The security environment surrounding us is becoming increasingly severe and that it is necessary for the two countries as strategic partners to further enhance defense cooperation and collaboration to maintain peace and stability in Indo-Pacific,' Nakatani said through a translator. Nakatani said the Philippines and Japan have agreed to deepen cooperation on military exchanges, establish a high-level strategic dialogue among its military and deepen information sharing. Security ties between the two U.S. allies have strengthened over the past two years as Japan and the Philippines share common concerns over China's increasingly assertive actions in the region. Last year, Manila and Tokyo signed a landmark military pact allowing the deployment of their forces on each other's soil. Japan and China have repeatedly faced off around uninhabited Japanese-administered islands that Tokyo calls the Senkaku and Beijing calls the Diaoyu. The Philippines and China have also clashed frequently in the South China Sea around disputed shoals and atolls that fall inside Manila's exclusive economic zone. Nakatani visited military bases in the northern Philippines on Sunday, including a naval station that houses a coastal radar that Japan donated as part of its $4 million security assistance in 2023. Manila was one of the first recipients of Tokyo's official security assistance, a program aimed at helping boost deterrence capabilities of partner countries. In December, the two countries signed a second security deal in which Japan agreed to provide the Philippine navy rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIB) and additional coastal radar systems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-japan-ministers-agree-to-further-enhance-defense-partnership/7985663.html	2025-02-23T22:34:10-08:00	
Chinese aerospace executive expelled from Communist Party for graft	BEIJING — A former Chinese aerospace defense executive has been expelled from the ruling Communist Party for corruption, China's anti-graft watchdog said on Monday, part of a sweeping anti-corruption purge across China's military-industrial complex. The former chairman of Aviation Industry Corporation of China, Tan Ruisong, 'lived off the military sector' and took a huge amount in bribes, according to a statement from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. The move comes after 14 military delegates were expelled from China's national legislative body in the past two years, as part of a purge of the world's largest military unprecedented in size and scale. These include four generals, eight lieutenant generals and two major generals. At least three more aerospace defense executives have been expelled from China's top political advisory body. Tan 'had lost his ideals and beliefs, betrayed his original aspirations,' 'accepted banquets' in violation of Party regulations, 'engaged in power-for-sex transactions' and used his position to 'seek profits for others in enterprise restructuring and ... contracting engineering projects,' the unusually detailed statement said. His case has been transferred to prosecutors, the statement added. Reuters could not reach Tan for comment. State-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tan's case comes three months after a senior Chinese military official, Miao Hua, was put under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline.' Miao had been the People's Liberation Army's leading political officer and sat on the six-person Central Military Commission, the army's top command body headed by President Xi Jinping. China's two previous defense ministers, Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, were also expelled from the Communist Party in June for corruption. Li's case in particular was connected to corrupt procurement of military equipment, Reuters reported. Many of those ousted earlier were connected to the PLA Rocket Force - an elite arm of the PLA that oversees its most advanced conventional and nuclear missiles. Analysts say that exposing deep-set graft could take time and potentially slow Xi's long-running military modernization plans.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-aerospace-executive-expelled-from-communist-party-for-graft/7985659.html	2025-02-23T22:10:42-08:00	
No passengers, no planes, no local benefits. Pakistan's newest airport is a bit of a mystery	GWADAR, Pakistan — With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan’s newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in October 2024, the airport is a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it. For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC. Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there’s scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn’t connected to the national grid — electricity comes from neighboring Iran or solar panels — and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000-passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people. 'This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,' said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specializes in Pakistan-China ties. 'It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.' Caught between insurgency and the military CPEC has catalyzed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence — targeting both Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan’s ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by the government and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges the government denies. Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs. Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. The city's fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage. Many local residents are frazzled. 'Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,' said 76-year-old Gwadar native Khuda Bakhsh Hashim. 'We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas.' 'We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from,' he added. 'We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.' Hashim recalled memories, warm like the winter sunshine, of when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn’t go to bed hungry and men found work easily, he said. There was always something to eat and no shortage of drinking water. But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. The government says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it’s not clear whom they mean by 'local' — Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate. People in Gwadar see few benefits from China's presence Gwadar is humble but charming, the food excellent and the locals chatty and welcoming with strangers. It gets busy during public holidays, especially the beaches. Still, there is a perception that it's dangerous or difficult to visit — only one commercial route operates out of Gwadar's domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, located at the other end of Pakistan's Arabian Sea coastline. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, hundreds of miles inland, or the national capital of Islamabad, even further north. A scenic coastal highway has few facilities. Since the Baloch insurgency first erupted five decades ago, thousands have gone missing in the province — anyone who speaks up against exploitation or oppression can be detained, suspected of connections with armed groups, the locals say. People are on edge; activists claim there are forced disappearances and torture, which the government denies. Hashim wants CPEC to succeed so that locals, especially young people, find jobs, hope and purpose. But that hasn't happened. 'When someone has something to eat, then why would he choose to go on the wrong path,' he said. 'It is not a good thing to upset people.' Militant violence declined in Balochistan after a 2014 government counterinsurgency and plateaued toward the end of that decade, according to Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. Attacks picked up after 2021 and have climbed steadily since. Militant groups, especially the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, were emboldened by the Pakistani Taliban ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022. An inauguration delayed Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area’s mountains — and their proximity to the airport — could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to the media and public. Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, district president of the Balochistan Awami Party, said not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, 'not even as a watchman.' 'Forget the other jobs. How many Baloch people are at this port that was built for CPEC,' he asked. In December, Hoth organized daily protests over living conditions in Gwadar. The protests stopped 47 days later, once authorities pledged to meet the locals’ demands, including better access to electricity and water. No progress has been made on implementing those demands since then. Without local labor, goods or services, there can be no trickle-down benefit from CPEC, said international relations expert Khalid. As Chinese money came to Gwadar, so did a heavy-handed security apparatus that created barriers and deepened mistrust. 'The Pakistani government is not willing to give anything to the Baloch people, and the Baloch are not willing to take anything from the government,' said Khalid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-passengers-no-planes-no-local-benefits-pakistan-s-newest-airport-is-a-bit-of-a-mystery/7985656.html	2025-02-23T21:17:59-08:00	
Ahead of UN action on Ukraine, US urges countries to vote no on rival European resolution	UNITED NATIONS — The United States is urging the United Nations General Assembly to back its resolution to mark the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Monday, oppose any amendments and vote no on a rival text drafted by Ukraine and European allies. In a diplomatic note sent on Sunday and reviewed by Reuters, the United States described its brief resolution as 'a forward-looking resolution focused on one simple idea: ending the war.' 'Through this resolution, Member States can build real momentum towards international peace and security, the maintenance of which is the principal purpose of the United Nations,' it said, asking countries to 'vote no on any other resolution or amendments presented' during Monday's meeting. The U.S. draft resolution, put forward on Friday, pits it against Ukraine and the European Union, which have for the past month been negotiating with U.N. member states on their own resolution on the war in Ukraine, which repeats the U.N. demand that Russia withdraw its troops and halt hostilities. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly has overwhelmingly repeatedly backed Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders since the war began. The U.S. draft makes no reference to that. The U.S. text mourns the loss of life during the 'Russia-Ukraine conflict,' reiterates that the U.N.'s main purpose is to maintain international peace and security and peacefully settle disputes. It 'implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.' Proposed amendments The 15-member Security Council is also set to vote on the same U.S. text later on Monday, diplomats said. A council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the U.S., Russia, China, Britain or France to be adopted. The U.S. push for U.N. action comes after President Donald Trump launched a bid to broker an end to the war, sparking a rift with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and raising concerns among European allies that they could be cut out of peace talks. U.S. and Russian officials met on Tuesday. The General Assembly is set to vote on several proposed amendments to the U.S. draft resolution. Russia has proposed amending the U.S. draft to reference addressing the 'root causes' of the war. Russia called its 2022 invasion a 'special military operation' designed to 'denazify' Ukraine and halt an expansion of NATO. Britain and 24 European Union states have also proposed amendments to the U.S. draft in the General Assembly. They want to describe the conflict as 'the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation,' back Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and implore 'just, lasting and comprehensive peace' in line with the U.N.

Trump says Dan Bongino to be FBI deputy director	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said in a post on social media Sunday that Dan Bongino, a conservative talk show host, will be deputy director of the FBI. Bongino will join Kash Patel, who was recently confirmed by the Senate as director of the FBI. Trump said Bongino was named to the role by Patel. The position does not require Senate confirmation. 'Great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!' Trump posted on his social media network, Truth Social, calling Bongino 'a man of incredible love and passion for our Country.' Bongino was previously a New York City police officer, and a member of the U.S. Secret Service. He most recently had been known as a conservative radio host and podcaster. Trump said in his post that Bongino is 'prepared to give up' his program as he steps into the new role. 'The Dan Bongino Show' was most recently the 56th-ranked podcast in the United States, according to Spotify.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-dan-bongino-to-be-fbi-deputy-director/7985643.html	2025-02-23T19:56:59-08:00	
What happens to the leadership of the Catholic Church when a pope becomes sick or incapacitated?	VATICAN CITY — While the Vatican has detailed laws and rituals to ensure the transfer of power when a pope dies or resigns, they do not apply if he is sick or even unconscious. And there are no specific norms outlining what happens to the leadership of the Catholic Church if a pope becomes totally incapacitated. As a result, even though Pope Francis remains hospitalized in critical condition with a complex lung infection, he is still pope and very much in charge. Still, Francis' hospital stay is raising obvious questions about what happens if he loses consciousness for a prolonged period, or whether he might follow in Pope Benedict XVI's footsteps and resign if he becomes unable to lead. On Monday, Francis' hospital stay will hit the 10-day mark, equaling the length of his 2021 hospital stay for surgery to remove 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon. His age and prolonged illness have revived interest about how papal power is exercised in the Holy See, how it is transferred and under what circumstances. And it points to the legislative loophole that currently exists in what to do if a pope gets so sick that he can't govern. The Vatican Curia Francis may be in charge, but he already delegates the day-to-day running of the Vatican and church to a team of officials who operate whether he is in the Apostolic Palace or not, and whether he is conscious or not. Chief among them is the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. Other Vatican functions are proceeding normally, including the Vatican's 2025 Holy Year celebrations. What happens when a pope gets sick? Canon law does have provisions for when a bishop gets sick and can't run his diocese, but none for a pope. Canon 412 says a diocese can be declared 'impeded' if its bishop — due to 'captivity, banishment, exile, or incapacity' — cannot fulfil his pastoral functions. In such cases, the day-to-day running of the diocese shifts to an auxiliary bishop, a vicar general or someone else. Even though Francis is the bishop of Rome, no explicit provision exists for the pope if he similarly becomes 'impeded.' Canon 335 declares simply that when the Holy See is 'vacant or entirely impeded,' nothing can be altered in the governance of the church. But it doesn't say what it means for the Holy See to be 'entirely impeded' or what provisions might come into play if it ever were. In 2021, a team of canon lawyers set out to propose norms to fill that legislative gap. They created a canonical crowd-sourcing initiative to craft a new church law regulating the office of a retired pope as well as norms to apply when a pope is unable to govern, either temporarily or permanently. The proposed norms explain that, with medical advancements, it's entirely likely that at some point a pope will be alive but unable to govern. It argues that the church must provide for the declaration of a 'totally impeded see' and the transfer of power for the sake of its own unity. Under the proposed norms, the governance of the universal church would pass to the College of Cardinals. In the case of a temporary impediment, they would name a commission to govern, with periodical medical checks every six months to determine the status of the pope. 'At first, the promoting group was accused of imprudently choosing topics that were too sensitive and controversial,' said one of the coordinators, canon lawyer Geraldina Boni. But then, 'a widespread consensus formed,' she told The Associated Press. Even Francis' own canon lawyer, Cardinal Gianfranco Ghirlanda, acknowledged some sort of norms were necessary if the pope 'incurably, then irreversibly, lost consciousness or otherwise the ability to perform human acts.' 'The problem is, who declares that the pope is in a situation where he cannot govern?' he told Italian daily Il Giornale in 2022. Ghirlanda largely backed the crowd-sourcing initiative's idea, proposing a committee of medical experts to determine if the pope's condition is irreversible. If they confirm it is, the Rome-based cardinals would be summoned to declare the pope cannot govern, triggering a conclave. What about the letters? Francis confirmed in 2022 that shortly after he was elected pope, he wrote a letter of resignation, to be invoked if he became medically incapacitated. He said he gave it to the then-secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, and said he assumed Bertone had delivered it to Parolin's office when he retired. The text is not public, and the conditions Francis contemplated for a resignation are unknown. It is also not known if such a letter would be canonically valid. Canon law requires a papal resignation to be 'freely and properly manifested' — as was the case when Benedict announced his resignation in 2013. In 1965, Pope Paul VI wrote letters to the dean of the College of Cardinals hypothesizing that if he were to become seriously ill, the dean and other cardinals should accept his resignation. The letter was never invoked, since Paul lived another 13 years and died on the job. What happens when a pope dies or resigns? The only time papal power changes hands is when a pope dies or resigns. At that time, a whole series of rites and rituals comes into play governing the 'interregnum' — the period between the end of one pontificate and the election of a new pope. During that period, known as the 'sede vacante,' or 'empty See,' the camerlengo, or chamberlain, runs the administration and finances of the Holy See. He certifies the pope's death, seals the papal apartments and prepares for the pope's burial before a conclave to elect a new pope. The position is currently held by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the head of the Vatican's laity office. The camerlengo has no role or duties if the pope is merely sick or otherwise incapacitated. Likewise, the dean of the College of Cardinals, who would preside at a papal funeral and organize the conclave, has no additional role if the pope is merely sick. That position is currently held by Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91. Earlier this month, Francis decided to keep Re on the job even after his five-year term expired, rather than make way for someone new. He also extended the term of the vice-dean, Argentine Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, 81.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-happens-to-the-leadership-of-the-catholic-church-when-a-pope-becomes-sick-or-incapacitated-/7985642.html	2025-02-23T19:41:26-08:00	
The 31st SAG Awards get underway with a win for Kieran Culkin	The 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards kicked off Sunday night with host Kristen Bell paying tribute to Los Angeles firefighters and another supporting actor win for 'A Real Pain' co-star Kieran Culkin. Bell introduced the ceremony, streaming live on Netflix from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, as an ode to both the aspirational spirit of actors who come to Los Angeles to make it, and to the city, itself. The SAG Awards unfolded against the backdrop of the devastating wildfires that began in early January. Those fires forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and launched a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected. Before singing 'Do You Want to Be an Actor?' to tune of 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman?' from 'Frozen,' Bell introduced attending firefighters as 'the most attractive tables' among a sea of stars. 'First it was COVID then it was the strikes then it was the devastating wildfires,' actor Courtney B. Vance, president of the SAG-AFTRA charitable foundation told attendees ahead of the show. 'Thousands have lost their homes including our own members and their families.' The night's first televised award went to Culkin, who has won just about every award in the category. Gripping the SAG trophy, he could quickly tell the difference. 'It is funny that the heaviest of all awards is given by actors,' said Culkin, who characteristically riffed his way through a rambling acceptance speech before swearing sincerity: 'Believe it or not, this actually means a lot to me.' The SAG Awards should offer the final clue in an unusually unpredictable Oscar race. The other major awards — including the BAFTAs, the Producers Guild Awards, the Directors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes — have all had their say. But actors make up the largest piece of the film academy pie, so their picks often correspond strongly with Academy Award winners. After wins from the PGA and the DGA — and last night, the Independent Spirit Awards — Sean Baker's 'Anora' is seen as the favorite to win best picture in a week's time at the Oscars. But Edward Berger's 'Conclave' won last weekend at the BAFTAs, the latest wrench in an award season full of them. That's included the unlikely rise and precipitous fall of another top contender, 'Emilia Pérez.' The awards are being streamed lived by Netflix, which distributed 'Emilia Pérez,' for the second time. 'Wicked' comes in the leading film nominee, with five nods, while 'Shōgun' heads the TV categories. It took early awards for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and for best stunt ensemble. The corresponding award for film went to the stunt performer ode 'The Fall Guy.' The best actor and best actress categories should be nail biters. While Brody ('The Brutalist') has won a string of awards, Chalamet ('A Complete Unknown') and Ralph Fiennes ('Conclave') could easily pull off the upset. Best actress could go to either Moore ('The Substance') or Madison ('Anora'). In addition to the competitive categories, Jane Fonda will be given the SAG Life Achievement Award.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-31st-sag-awards-get-underway-with-a-win-for-kieran-culkin/7985630.html	2025-02-23T19:12:14-08:00	
Report: In record year of internet shutdowns, Myanmar leads	Bangkok — In a record year for internet shutdowns, countries in the Asia-Pacific region imposed the most restrictions, according to a new report. Myanmar is the worst-affected country worldwide, with 85 shutdowns last year, research by the digital rights group Access Now found. Its report, released Monday, Feb. 24, shows authorities worldwide imposed at least 296 shutdowns in 54 countries. Conflict — followed by protests, school or university exams and elections — was the biggest trigger, Access Now found. For the Asia-Pacific region, the report finds 202 shutdowns in 11 countries or territories. It is the highest number ever recorded by Access Now in a single year for the region. The three countries with the worst record are all in Asia: 190 cases in Myanmar, India and Pakistan accounted for around 64% of all recorded shutdowns in 2024. India, often referred to as the biggest democracy in the world, had 84 recorded cases. VOA contacted Myanmar’s military administration, and the Washington embassies for India and Pakistan for comment. As of publication, VOA had not received a reply. Raman Jit Singh Chima, the Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, warned of a rise of digital authoritarianism in Asia. 'Shutdowns destabilize societies, undermine digital progress, put entire communities at risk, and provide a cloak of impunity for human rights abuses,' he said in a statement. 'Authorities from Myanmar to Pakistan are isolating people from the rest of the world with impunity, reflecting the rising digital authoritarianism in Asia.' Access Now collects data on shutdowns, which include cables being cut, equipment confiscated, platforms being blocked, and orders to telecommunication companies. 'Rebirth' of radio Since seizing power in a coup in February 2021, the junta in Myanmar has regularly blocked access to the internet. The junta says the blocks are to maintain 'stability' and prevent what it calls the spread of disinformation and fake news. At the same time, the junta has jailed dozens of journalists and revoked media licenses. Out of the 85 shutdowns imposed in Myanmar last year, 31 coincided with documented human rights abuses and at least 17 correlated with airstrikes on civilians, the Access Now report found. The record puts the country among the worst for digital rights for the fourth consecutive year, the report found. Toe Zaw Latt, a veteran journalist from Myanmar, told VOA it was 'no surprise' that the country tops the list. 'Myanmar has one of the worst censorship [records] on digital platforms,' he said. '[The military does this] so most of the people can’t access independent information or internet mainly, especially young people. They just want one version of truth, the army’s version of truth.' Zaw Latt said the junta is trying to prevent 'independent access of information on the internet.' A journalist for decades, Zaw Latt is also secretary of the Independent Press Council Myanmar. He said the internet blocks have seen a 'rebirth' in radio. 'Globally, radio is dying but it’s having a rebirth in Burma because it’s cheap and accessible,' he said, using the country’s former name. 'Even some people go back, very primitive, back to print because of these internet shutdowns.' Still, Zaw Latt said, it is not possible to completely cut off the internet, 'because people will find a way.' Alongside shutdowns the junta has passed laws to further control the information narrative. On Jan. 1, a cybersecurity law was enacted in Myanmar, banning the use of Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, that people use to access blocked or censored content. The law penalizes those who share information from banned websites. Experts say it’s another attempt from the junta to suppress public information. Two other Asian countries — Malaysia and Thailand — also made the list for the Southeast Asia region for the first time. Thailand was included after it shut electricity and internet connections on its border with Myanmar following an attempt to crack down on scam centers that have lured thousands into forced labor and scammed billions from internet users worldwide. Overall, press freedom in East Asia continues to see a decline, according to Reporters without Borders. The global watchdog reports that 26 out of 31 countries in the Asia-Pacific region have seen a decline in press freedoms between 2023 and 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-in-record-year-of-internet-shutdowns-myanmar-leads/7985585.html	2025-02-23T18:02:32-08:00	
Spain smashes sex trafficking gang that exploited more than 1,000 women	MADRID — Spanish police have smashed a human trafficking ring that lured more than 1,000 women to the country over the past year with false job offers before forcing them into sex work, police said Sunday. The women, who were mainly from Venezuela and Colombia, were told they would be working in the beauty or cleaning sectors, Spain's National Police said in a statement. 'On arrival in Spain they were transferred to clubs where they were sexually exploited and forced to work all hours,' police said. The women were only allowed out for two hours per day and were kept under video surveillance. Three alleged ring leaders — two Colombian women and a Spaniard — were among 48 suspects arrested in raids in Alicante and Murcia, in southeastern Spain, and three strip clubs were closed as part of the operation. Police also seized more than $157,000 in cash, blocked bank accounts containing $980,960 and seized 17 properties. Six of the suspects were held in pre-trial detention, police said. The others were released on bail to face trial at a later date.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-smashes-sex-trafficking-gang-that-exploited-more-than-1-000-women/7985605.html	2025-02-23T17:30:25-08:00	
Kamala Harris receives prestigious Chairman's prize at NAACP Image Awards	Los Angeles — Former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped on the NAACP Image Awards stage Saturday night with a sobering message, calling the civil rights organization a pillar of the Black community and urging people to stay resilient and hold onto their faith during the tenure of President Donald Trump. 'While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this chapter in our American story, this chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us,' Harris said after receiving the NAACP's Chairman's Award. 'The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.' The 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Los Angeles area. Harris, defeated by Trump in last year's presidential election, was the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president. She had previously been a U.S. senator from California and the state's attorney general. In her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did not reference her election loss or Trump's actions since entering the Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Harris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying alert, seeking the truth and America's future. 'Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask 'What do we do now?'' Harris said. 'But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize, mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having an easy path.' Other winners of the Chairman's prize have included former President Barack Obama, the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee. NAACP Hall of Fame Harris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family. The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades. Keenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized. Marlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock's 'Bel-Air' was up for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family's rise. 'He raised us all like Jedis,' he said. 'We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for our big brother.' Marlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was leaving college for comedy, she said, 'Boy, I've known you your whole life, and you ain't never said nothing funny. That's the funniest thing you've said.' The crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has kept audiences laughing for more than three decades. The family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created the sketch comedy series 'In Living Color' in 1990 and directed the 2000 slasher spoof 'Scary Movie,' which was written by Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in 'White Chicks' in 2004. Damon Wayan's had a starring role in the 1995 comedy 'Major Payne,' and currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom 'Poppa's House,' which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were nominated for their acting on the show. Damon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed comedies in recent years: 'Happy Endings' and 'New Girl.' Kim Wayans, a comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the 2011 drama 'Pariah.' Entertainer of the year Keke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as winner of the coveted entertainment of the year. 'Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn't think I was going to win,' said Palmer, who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo's Oscar-nominated performance in 'Wicked.' Palmer starred in the buddy comedy 'One of Them Days,' which debuted No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting efforts on NBC's 'Password.' 'It's such an amazing category to be in with all these people,' Palmer said. 'It's a beautiful night. It's Black History Month, y'all. It's so important we all come here together and celebrate one another with one another.' Other nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon Sharpe. Awards recognize LA residents impacted by wildfires Image Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena neighborhood who were affected by January's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires. A video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut took the stage. 'Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and over two dozen souls gone forever,' said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and Malibu. 'But what was not lost is the spirit of our community,' said Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday. Many in the audience stood and applauded. Cole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for Kanye West's wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts. The opening act was a lead-up to the evening's first award: Queen Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in 'The Equalizer.' Chappelle honored Dave Chappelle was honored with the President's Award for his 'thought-provoking humor.' Accepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP's push against negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of representation. 'Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster of a machine,' he said. Past recipients of the President's Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill, Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kamala-harris-receives-prestigious-chairman-s-prize-at-naacp-image-awards/7985604.html	2025-02-23T17:04:18-08:00	
California governor asks Congress for nearly $40 billion for Los Angeles wildfire relief	Sacramento, California — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked Congress to approve nearly $40 billion in aid to help the Los Angeles area recover from January's devastating wildfires, which he said could become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Newsom sent a letter Friday asking for support from lawmakers including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chair. 'Los Angeles is one of the most economically productive places on the globe, but it can only rebound and flourish with support from the federal government as it recovers from this unprecedented disaster,' Newsom wrote. The total economic losses from the firestorm have been estimated to surpass $250 billion — with real estate losses from the Palisades and Eaton fires predicted to potentially top $30 billion, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis. More than 16,200 structures were destroyed as flames ripped through Pacific Palisades, Malibu, Pasadena and Altadena. Newsom vowed that the funding would be used to rebuild homes, infrastructure, businesses, schools, churches and health care facilities, while supporting the needs of people affected by the devastation. 'Make no mistake, Los Angeles will use this money wisely,' Newsom wrote. His largest request is for an additional $16.8 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, mostly intended for the rebuilding of property and infrastructure, with $5 billion earmarked for debris cleanup. Newsom also asked for $9.9 billion from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for grants to fire victims, homeowners, businesses and renters, as well as $5.29 billion from the Small Business Administration for homeowner and business loans. Newsom thanked President Donald Trump for support for fast-tracking debris removal. The letter did not mention recent threats by the Trump administration that federal aid could come with strings attached. 'We are eternally grateful,' Newsom said. Trump has been a frequent critic of Newsom and California's water policies. Ric Grenell, a Trump ally serving as his envoy for special missions, said Friday that 'there will be conditions' to any federal aid for the state. He said one of the possible conditions being discussed was defunding the California Coastal Commission, which regulates coastal development and protects public beach access. Trump has criticized the agency as overly restrictive, bureaucratic and a hindrance to timely rebuilding efforts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-governor-asks-congress-for-nearly-40-billion-for-los-angeles-wildfire-relief/7985599.html	2025-02-23T16:51:00-08:00	
Australia fines Telegram for delay in answering child abuse, terror questions	Sydney — Australia's online safety regulator fined messaging platform Telegram about $640,000 on Monday for its delay in answering questions about measures the app took to prevent the spread of child abuse and violent extremist material. The eSafety Commission in March 2024 sought responses from social media platforms YouTube, X and Facebook to Telegram and Reddit, and blamed them for not doing enough to stop extremists from using live-streaming features, algorithms and recommendation systems to recruit users. Telegram and Reddit were asked about the steps they were taking to combat child sexual abuse material on their services. They had to respond by May, but Telegram submitted its response in October. 'Timely transparency is not a voluntary requirement in Australia and this action reinforces the importance of all companies complying with Australian law,' eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement. Telegram's delay in providing information obstructed eSafety from implementing its online safety measures, Grant said. Telegram said it had fully responded to all eSafety's questions last year, with no outstanding issues. 'The unfair and disproportionate penalty concerns only the response time frame, and we intend to appeal,' the company said in an email. Australia's spy agency in December said one in five priority counterterrorism cases investigated involved youths. The messaging platform has been under growing scrutiny around the world since its founder Pavel Durov was placed under formal investigation in France in August in connection with alleged use of the app for illegal activities. Durov, who is out on bail, has denied the allegations. Grant said Big Tech must be transparent and put in place measures to prevent their services from being misused as the threat posed by online extremist materials poses a growing risk. 'If we want accountability from the tech industry we need much greater transparency. These powers give us a look under the hood at just how these platforms are dealing, or not dealing, with a range of serious and egregious online harms which affect Australians,' Grant said. If Telegram chooses to ignore the penalty notice, eSafety would seek a civil penalty in court, Grant said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-fines-telegram-for-delay-in-answering-child-abuse-terror-questions/7985591.html	2025-02-23T16:38:08-08:00	
Sudan's military touts field advances, breaks RSF siege of crucial city	Cairo — Sudan’s military on Sunday broke a more than year-long siege on the crucial city of Obeid, restoring access to a strategic area in the south-central region and strengthening crucial supply routes in its nearly two years of war against a notorious paramilitary group, officials said. The military also kicked the Rapid Support Forces from its last stronghold in the White Nile province in another setback to the notorious group, military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Nabil Abdullah said in a statement. Sudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare across the country. The fighting, which wrecked the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups. Abdullah, the spokesperson, said military troops in the al-Sayyad axis managed to reopen the road to the city of Obeid and break the RSF siege on the city which serves as the provincial capital of North Kordofan province. The city hosts a sprawling airbase and the military’s 5th Infantry Division known as Haganah. A commercial and transportation hub, Obeid is located on a railway linking Khartoum to Nyala, the provincial capital of South Darfur province. It was besieged by the RSF since the onset of the ongoing conflict in April 2023. Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim hailed the military’s advances in Obeid as a 'massive step' to lift the RSF siege on Al-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, as well as delivering humanitarian aid to the Kordofan area. Sunday’s RSF defeats were the latest in a series of setbacks for the notorious group that started in September when the military launched an offensive aimed at recapturing the Great Khartoum area — Khartoum and its two sister cities of Omdurman and Khartoum North, or Bahri. The military has since captured strategic areas including its own main headquarters and is now close to recapturing the Republican Palace which RSF fighters stormed in the first hours of the war trying to kill military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. The RSF has also suffered multiple battlefield setbacks elsewhere in the country. It lost control of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, and other areas in the province. The military also regained control of the country’s largest oil refinery. The developments on the ground have given the military the upper hand in the war, which is approaching its 2-year mark with no peaceful settlement on the horizon. International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, have not halted the conflict. The RSF and its allies meanwhile signed a charter that paved the way for the establishment of a parallel government to challenge the military-backed administration. The move has raised concerns about a potential split of the country. Cholera spreading to another city Cholera has spread to Rabak, the provincial capital of White Nile province, according to health authorities in the province. The disease first hit Kosti, another White Nile city, before reaching Rabak, the health ministry said. A total of 68 people died from cholera in the two cities between Thursday and Sunday, according to the health ministry. More than 1,860 others were diagnosed with the disease, it said. An anti-cholera vaccination campaign in Kosti and Rabak reached 67% of its targeted people in the last two days, according to the ministry. The outbreak was blamed mainly on contaminated drinking water after Kosti’s water supply facility was knocked out during an attack by the RSF, the health ministry said. The facility was later fixed as part of the government's efforts to fight the disease. Cholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and can be fatal if not immediately treated, according to the World Health Organization. It’s transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Cholera outbreaks are not uncommon in Sudan. The disease killed more than 600 and sickened over 21,000 others in Sudan between July and October last year, mostly in the country’s eastern areas where millions of people displaced by the conflict were located.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-military-touts-field-advances-breaks-rsf-siege-of-crucial-city/7985349.html	2025-02-23T15:48:46-08:00	
Trump administration fires 2,000 USAID workers, puts thousands of others on leave	Washington — The Trump administration said Sunday that it was placing all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave worldwide and eliminating 2,000 U.S.-based staff positions. The move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader campaign to slash the size of the federal government. The move comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the administration to move forward with its plan to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government's plan. 'As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,' according to the notices sent to USAID workers that were viewed by The Associated Press. At the same time, the agency said it was beginning a reduction in force that would eliminate 2,000 U.S.-based staffers. That means many of the Washington-based staffers who are being placed on leave would soon have their positions eliminated. The Trump appointee running USAID, deputy administrator Pete Marocco, has indicated he plans to keep about 600 mostly U.S.-based staffers on the job in the meantime, in part to arrange travel for USAID staffers and families abroad. USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The move escalates a monthlong push to dismantle the agency, which has included closing its headquarters in Washington and shutting down thousands of aid and development programs worldwide following an effort to freeze all foreign assistance. Trump and Musk contend that USAID's work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda. Lawsuits by government workers' unions, USAID contractors and others say the administration lacks the constitutional authority to eliminate an independent agency or congressionally funded programs without lawmakers' approval. The Trump administration efforts upend decades of U.S. policy that aid and development work overseas serves national security by stabilizing regions and economies and building alliances, a critical tool of U.S. 'soft power' for winning influence abroad. The notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination in the past week, according to copies that AP viewed. The blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors, excluding the names or positions of those receiving them, could make it difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits, workers noted. A different judge in a second lawsuit tied to USAID has temporarily blocked the foreign funding freeze and said this past week that the administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-firing-2-000-usaid-workers-putting-thousands-of-others-on-leave/7985347.html	2025-02-23T15:37:57-08:00	
Some US agencies tell workers not to reply to Musk's 'accomplishments email'	Washington — Multiple U.S. federal agencies told employees not to respond immediately to a demand by President Donald Trump's adviser Elon Musk to list their accomplishments in the last week or be fired, as a chaotic campaign to cull the bureaucracy pushes forward. Trump administration-appointed officials at the FBI and State Department sent their staff emails telling them not to respond outside their chains of command, in a possible sign of tension between members of the Republican administration and the world's richest person in his campaign to cut down the government's 2.3 million-member civilian workforce. 'The FBI, through the office of the director, is in charge of all our review processes,' said FBI Director Kash Patel, a Trump appointee, in an email to staff seen by Reuters. Musk leads the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which in the first weeks of Trump's administration has laid off more than 20,000 workers and offered buyouts to another 75,000, across wide swaths of the government from the Defense Department — long a top Republican priority — to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where all staff have been ordered to halt work. The frantic pace has led the federal government in some cases to rush to rehire workers who perform critical functions like securing the nation's nuclear arsenal and trying to fight the worsening bird flu outbreak, which has caused egg prices to spike higher. While there is bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government, which carries $36 trillion in debt, would benefit from reform, Musk's tumultuous approach has drawn widespread criticism, including from voters in some Republican areas. Federal workers Saturday evening received an email instructing them to detail the work they did during the previous week by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday (0459 GMT Tuesday), shortly after Musk posted on his X social media site that failing to respond would be taken as a resignation. The subject of the email read, 'What did you do last week?' and came from a human resources address in the Office of Personnel Management, but did not include Musk's threat of termination. Workers at the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Education and Commerce, as well as at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Institutes of Health and the Internal Revenue Service also were told not to respond, pending further guidance, according to sources and emails reviewed by Reuters. 'To be clear — this is irregular, unexpected, and warrants further validation,' a senior executive at the National Centers for Environmental Information, an agency that manages environmental data and is part of the Commerce Department, wrote. Some officials welcomed the move. Ed Martin, Trump's nominee for U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., who is serving in an interim capacity, praised Musk and DOGE in an email response. But other offices within the Justice Department, including the executive office that supports all U.S. attorneys and the department's civil division, told employees not to reply, pending additional information. Employees at the Drug Enforcement Administration, part of the Justice Department, were told to respond, according to an email seen by Reuters. Union questions Musk's authority The largest federal workers' union, the American Federation of Government Employees, wrote on X on Sunday that it did not believe Musk had the authority to fire employees who did not respond and would formally request that OPM rescind the message. Meanwhile, the union advised members to ask their supervisors directly whether to reply and to follow their guidance. The email left some employees even more frustrated and worried after weeks of uncertainty about their futures. 'I really wonder when someone is going to say enough,' one IRS employee told Reuters. Media offices at the Commerce, Justice, Education and Treasury departments, as well as at the FDIC and NIH, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment, and a State Department spokesperson referred questions to the White House. Musk on X on Sunday called the email 'a very basic pulse check.' Senator John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, said he supports the Trump administration's efforts to reduce government spending, but that Musk should take a more humane approach. 'If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it's please put a dose of compassion in this,' Curtis said on CBS News' 'Face the Nation.' 'These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. It's a false narrative to say we have to cut, and you have to be cruel to do it as well.' Some federal judiciary employees, including judges, also received the Saturday email from OPM, even though the court system is not part of the executive branch, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts confirmed. The judiciary advised employees that no action should be taken in response to the message, according to an email reviewed by Reuters. In some cases, employees were left unsure how to respond even if they chose to do so. Some lawyers, for instance, expressed concern that their work is confidential. Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the email, according to people with knowledge of the matter, even though they were all ordered to cease working since early this month, leaving them with little to do.	https://www.voanews.com/a/some-us-agencies-tell-workers-not-to-reply-to-musk-s-accomplishments-email-/7985346.html	2025-02-23T15:24:28-08:00	
Syria's new president invited to emergency Arab League summit in Egypt	Cairo — Syria's new President Ahmed al-Sharaa has received an invitation from Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah el-Sissi to attend an emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on March 4, the Syrian presidency said Sunday in a statement, marking a major step in rebuilding ties with the Arab world after the downfall of Bashar al-Assad. Sharaa, whose Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group spearheaded the offensive that toppled autocratic leader Assad in December, was declared president for a transitional phase last month. Since assuming power, Sharaa has sought to strengthen ties with Arab nations, pledging a political transition that includes the formation of an inclusive government and eventual elections, which he has said could take up to four years to organize. Egypt, which views Islamists as an existential threat, has treaded with caution after Sharaa took office, with officials saying Syria's new administration needed to adopt an inclusive political transition free from 'external interventions.' While Sissi congratulated Sharaa upon his appointment, their first face-to-face meeting is expected to take place during the Arab League summit. The upcoming Cairo summit is set to focus primarily on Arab efforts to counter U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to redevelop war-torn Gaza into an international beach resort and his calls for Egypt and Jordan to resettle displaced Palestinians from Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-new-president-invited-to-emergency-arab-league-summit-in-egypt/7985325.html	2025-02-23T13:53:03-08:00

Hegseth defends Trump's firings of Pentagon leaders, says more may be to come	Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists President Donald Trump 's abrupt firing of the nation's senior military officer amid a wave of dismissals at the Pentagon wasn't unusual and he suggested more firings could come. 'Nothing about this is unprecedented,' Hegseth told 'Fox News Sunday' about Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr. being removed Friday night as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 'The president deserves to pick his key national security advisory team.' Hegseth said 'there are lots of presidents who made changes' citing former commanders in chief, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama. Obama, Hegseth said, 'fired or dismissed hundreds' of military officials. Months into his first term, Obama removed Army Gen. David McKiernan from being commander of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan. However, Trump, while running for his second term, vowed to eradicate 'woke' ideologies from the military and to swiftly dismiss many top leaders. Hegseth and Trump have made no secret about focusing on pushing aside military officers who have supported diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks. The administration says the move will better fortify a lethal fighting force. Brown was just the second Black general to serve as chairman. His 16 months in the post were consumed with the war in Ukraine and the expanded conflict in the Middle East. Trump in 2020 nominated Brown as Air Force's chief of staff. Trump wants to replace Brown with Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan 'Razin' Caine, who retired in December. It is unclear what recalling Caine to active-duty service will require. The position requires Caine to be confirmed by the Senate. Hegseth said Friday's dismissals affected six three- and four-star generals and were 'a reflection of the president wanting the right people around him to execute the national security approach we want to take.' He called Brown 'honorable' but said he is 'not the right man for the moment,' without citing specific deficiencies. After the 2020 murder of George Floyd, Brown in a video spoke of his experience as a Black pilot, apparently making him fodder for the Trump administration's wars against inclusion initiatives in the military. Of Caine, Hegseth said that Trump 'respects leaders who untie the hands of war fighters in a very dangerous world.' Retired Gen. George Casey called the firings 'extremely destabilizing.' Casey, who was Republican President George W. Bush's commander of the U.S. and multinational forces in Iraq from 2004 to 2007, also noted that the Trump administration can change Pentagon policy without changing personnel, but added, that what happened is 'within the president's prerogative.' 'That's his prerogative,' Casey told ABC's 'This Week.' 'He is the commander in chief of the armed forces.' Still, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee told ABC that the firings were 'completely unjustified' and that 'apparently, what Trump and Hegseth are trying to do is to politicize the Department of Defense.' Hegseth was also asked on Fox News about officials potentially compiling lists of more defense officials they plan to fire. He said there was no list but suggested that more dismissals could indeed be coming. 'We have a very keen eye towards military leadership and their willingness to follow lawful order,' Hegseth said. 'Joe Biden gave lawful orders. A lot of them are really bad,' he said, adding that things like COVID vaccine mandates 'eroded' the military ideologically 'President Trump has given another set of lawful orders and they will be followed,' Hegseth said. 'If they're not followed then those officers will find the door.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hegseth-defends-trump-s-firings-of-pentagon-leaders-says-more-may-be-to-come-/7985292.html	2025-02-23T12:05:38-08:00	
Estonia pushing for EU to seize Russian assets for Ukraine	Brussels — Estonia has launched a new push to get fellow EU members to agree to seize frozen Russian assets and use them to help Ukraine, dismissing a Russian idea on how the money could be used as part of a peace deal. The Baltic country has sent a discussion paper on the issue to European Union partners and will raise it at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday, officials said. Some 210 billion euros ($219.62 billion) in Russian assets are immobilized in the EU by sanctions as part of an international crackdown on Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Last year, the G7 group of nations – including the EU – agreed to use profits from frozen Russian assets to fund a $50 billion loan for Ukraine. But the assets themselves remain untouched. 'The decision to use the windfall profits was a step in the right direction. I see that the time is ripe now to take the next step,' Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told Reuters. On Friday, Reuters reported that Moscow could agree to allow Russian assets frozen in Europe to be used for reconstruction in Ukraine but would insist part of the money is spent on the part of the country controlled by its forces. Tsahkna dismissed that idea. 'Giving Russia some of the assets to use in the occupied areas means accepting Russia’s occupation of some parts of Ukraine,' he said. The EU has insisted Ukraine’s territorial integrity must be respected in any peace deal. Several EU countries, including Baltic states and Poland, have said they are ready to consider seizing the assets. But Germany, France, Belgium and the European Central Bank have been wary, warning of legal challenges and undermining the euro as a reserve currency. Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear holds most of the Russian assets frozen in Europe. But the issue has resurfaced on the political agenda, particularly as the Trump administration has said it expects Europe to take on a larger share of support for Ukraine. The Estonian paper, seen by Reuters, tries to address its partners' concerns. It says asset seizure can be justified under international law, as a countermeasure to Moscow's war and because 'Russia refuses to engage in reparations.' It also says joint action by the EU and international partners could mitigate any risk to the euro as a reserve currency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/estonia-pushing-for-eu-to-seize-russian-assets-for-ukraine/7985281.html	2025-02-23T11:43:25-08:00	
American Airlines flight from New York to Delhi lands safely in Rome after security concern	Rome, Italy — An American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi, India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday afternoon after it was diverted due to a security concern , which later proved to be 'non-credible,' the airline said. American Airlines said Flight 292 'was inspected by law enforcement' after landing at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport and 'cleared to re-depart.' It didn't clarify the cause of the security concern, but added an inspection was required by protocol before the flight could land in New Delhi. 'The flight will stay in Rome overnight to allow for required crew rest before continuing to Delhi as soon as possible tomorrow,' the airline said. An Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed. The airport continued to operate normally, a spokesman with Rome's airport said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-airlines-flight-from-new-york-to-delhi-lands-safely-in-rome-after-security-concern/7985282.html	2025-02-23T11:41:07-08:00	
EU leaders will hold emergency summit on Ukraine and European security	Brussels — The leaders of the 27 European Union countries will have an emergency summit on March 6 about next steps for Ukraine and Europe's security. European Council President Antonio Costa announced Sunday that he is convening the summit in Brussels. 'We are living a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,' Costa said in a post on social media. Since the EU leaders last met Feb. 3, the Trump administration has upended years of U.S. support for Ukraine and decades of commitment to defending European allies. The leader of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and other members of the EU's executive branch, will visit Kyiv on Monday to show support for Ukraine on the third anniversary of Russia's invasion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-leaders-will-hold-emergency-summit-on-ukraine-and-european-security-/7985274.html	2025-02-23T11:20:51-08:00

Captain America' dives in 2nd weekend, 'The Monkey' boosts Neon's successes	New York — 'Captain America: Brave New World' soared on opening weekend but crashed down in its second go-around with audiences. 'Brave New World,' the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn’t quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%. While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023’s 'The Marvels,' which fell 78%, and 2023’s 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,' which dropped 70%. The Anthony Mackie-led 'Captain America' installment has been slammed by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a 'B-' CinemaScore. 'Brave New World,' which fans had hoped would right the Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre- 'Avengers: Endgame' aura of invincibility. Still, 'Brave New World' has quickly grossed $289.4 million worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks, it will have scant competition through much of March. The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins’ 'The Monkey,' the director’s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, 'Longlegs.' Adapted from a Stephen King short story, 'The Monkey' opened with $14.2 million for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor. The best? 'Longlegs,' which launched with $22.4 million. Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards contender, 'Anora,' by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into next Sunday's Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday. Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of 'The Monkey,' have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on the way. Even if 'The Monkey' doesn’t reach the heights of 'Longlegs' ($126.9 million globally), Perkins and Neon return with 'Keeper' this October. 'The Monkey,' starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low. As it did with 'Longlegs,' Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for 'The Monkey,' along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was held at Los Angeles’ Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings took place at the Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan, cost $10 million to make. Lionsgate’s 'The Unbreakable Boy' opened with a paltry $2.5 million in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is autistic and has brittle bone disease. 'Paddington in Peru,' the third installment of the marmalade-mad bear, fell to third place in its second weekend. It grossed $6.5 million in 3,890 locations, bringing its two-week total to $25.2 million. 'Paddington in Peru' has been most popular overseas, where its collected $150 million thus far. 'Ne Zha 2,' the animated Chinese juggernaut, took in $3.1 million from 800 theaters in its second weekend. In China, the sequel has grossed $1.7 billion this month, setting numerous box-office records. Those totals put 'Ne Zha 2' past 'Inside Out 2' ($1.66 billion) as the highest grossing animated film ever. Top 10 movies by domestic box office With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. 1. 'Captain America: Brave New World,' $28.2 million. 2. 'The Monkey,' $14.2 million. 3. 'Paddington in Peru,' $6.5 million. 4. 'Dog Man,' $5.9 million. 5. 'Ne Zha 2,' $3.1 million. 6. 'Heart Eyes,' $2.9 million. 7. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $2.5 million. 8. 'The Unbreakable Boy,' $2.5 million. 9. 'Chhaava,' $1.5 million. 10.

Netanyahu says Israel won't allow Syrian forces 'south of Damascus'	Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will not allow Syria's new army or the insurgent group that led the ouster of former President Bashar Assad to 'enter the area south of Damascus' as his government made clear Israeli forces would stay in parts of southern Syria for an indefinite period. Netanyahu's comments Sunday at a military graduation led to new concerns over the Israeli presence, and sway, in a swath of southern Syria as Damascus' new leaders attempt to consolidate control after years of civil war. 'Take note: We will not allow HTS forces or the new Syrian army to enter the area south of Damascus,' Netanyahu said, referring to Syria's new authorities as well as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main former rebel group. 'We demand the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Suwayda from the forces of the new regime. Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria.' There was no immediate response from Syrian authorities. Defense Minister Israel Katz added that Israeli forces will remain on the peak of Mt. Hermon in southern Syria and in a buffer zone 'for an indefinite period of time to protect our communities and thwart any threat.' He said Israeli forces have built two posts on the mountain and another seven in the buffer zone 'to ensure defense and offense against any challenge.' After the fall of Assad in December, Israel seized the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory. The zone was set up under a 1974 ceasefire agreement. Syria's new authorities and U.N. officials have called for Israel to withdraw. Meanwhile, Netanyahu's government has been under pressure to protect Israelis living near border areas in the north. Katz said Israel will 'strengthen ties with friendly populations in the region,' notably the Druze, a religious minority who live in both southern Syria and in Israel's Golan Heights, where Druze navigate their historically Syrian identity while living under Israeli rule. 'We will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria,' Netanyahu said. More broadly, Israeli forces 'will not allow hostile forces to establish themselves and be present in the security zone in southern Syria from here to Damascus. And we will act against any threat,' Katz said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-says-israel-won-t-allow-syrian-forces-south-of-damascus-/7985248.html	2025-02-23T10:32:44-08:00	
Washington, Kyiv near deal for Ukrainian ‘critical minerals’ rights	The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are nearing an agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are 'making progress' in reaching a deal. He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion, although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed. The war hits the three-year mark on Monday. The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European Union. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s 'State of the Union' that he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week. Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the agreement. Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding. Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms made 'no sense' to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015. Zelenskyy said, 'I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe] Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan. And we don't have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like it and thinks that it's unjust. Maybe. I don't know. But here is what this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it's not about the figure. We simply don't see it as a loan.' Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and accused him of starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form of compensation guarantee. Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to 'understand' his position and come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend itself against the Russian invasion. 'I want very much from Trump understanding of each other,' Zelensky said at his news conference, adding: 'Security guarantees from Trump are much needed.' Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for Ukraine's entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to. 'If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready,' Zelenskyy said. 'I can exchange this for NATO [membership], if that condition is there, immediately.' The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading. 'I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,' Trump told U.S. state governors at the White House. 'They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,' Trump said of Ukraine. Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'in total alignment with the way we see things.' Witkoff said the war 'wouldn’t have had to happen' if Ukraine hadn’t been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the war. Witkoff said that eventually 'you’ll see concessions signed by both sides' in a peace deal. Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the Kyiv government. 'The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,' he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors. 'No one will ever sell off these territories,' Peskov said. 'That's the most important thing.' A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia. 'This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,' Peskov told state TV. Russia on Sunday marked Defender of the Fatherland Day — a holiday hailing soldiers and veterans. In a video released by the Kremlin, Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with 'the mission' to defend Russia. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks on Ukraine, which he condemned as 'aerial terror.' Ukrainian officials reported damage in five regions of the country. Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 35 missiles of various types.

France arrests 10 linked to escape of gang leader with Romania set to extradite him	Paris — Police have arrested 10 suspected accomplices of a suspected gangland killer described as France's 'public enemy number one,' the Paris chief prosecutor said Sunday, as Romania prepares to hand him over following his arrest in Bucharest. Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the 10 are alleged to have helped in the escape of Mohamed Amra in an ambush nine months ago in which two prison officers were shot dead and three wounded. Amra, who is accused of gangland murders and drug trafficking, was arrested near a shopping center in Bucharest on Saturday. Romania will hand him over to France within 30 days, his lawyer said after a court hearing in Bucharest. He had vanished after the attack with military-style assault weapons on a prison van carrying him in northern France last May. The brutality of the ambush, which was caught on CCTV, shocked France and Amra instantly became the country's most wanted man. The authorities tasked more than 300 investigators with finding Amra, who is known as 'La Mouche' (The Fly), and has a long history of convictions for violent crimes that started when he was in his early teens. According to a 2024 judiciary report, he started out with aggravated robberies and progressively 'slid towards violence,' eventually entering the world of organized crime. The report found that authorities underestimated for some time just how dangerous he had become. Amra is suspected of pursuing his drug-related activities from his prison cell, and even of ordering hits from detention. Facial recognition, fingerprints Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin on Sunday published an open letter to prison officers, promising them better working conditions. He also vowed the creation of 'prison police' units and a 'high security prison,' in response to concerns that it has become too easy for convicted criminals to continue their business despite being locked up, thanks notably to access to mobile phones. Such a supermax prison, to be completed within months, would keep France's '100 biggest drug traffickers' in complete isolation -- using Italian anti-mafia laws as a model — so that 'a case like Amra's can never happen again,' Darmanin said. At the time of his escape, Amra was facing one charge for attempted murder and another for participation in a gangland killing in the southern city of Marseille, a hub for drug trafficking and gang violence. The Paris prosecutor said in a statement that his 10 suspected accomplices had been detained on Saturday and early Sunday. A police source told AFP that they were arrested for the most part in Rouen and Evreux in northwestern France, and that police seized weapons during raids. 'They are suspected of having helped in the preparation and execution of the escape, and having helped the fugitive to hide,' the prosecutor said. Romanian police said Amra was arrested near a Bucharest shopping center and would be brought before a magistrate who will decide on his extradition to France. After being alerted by their French colleagues, it took Romanian police just 48 hours to locate, identify and capture Amra, the government in Bucharest said. Amra, who rejects the charges against him, had agreed to be returned to France, lawyer Maria Marcu said. 'He respects the decision of the French authorities who want to put him on trial,' she said. Beccuau said Amra, who had changed his appearance and dyed his hair, had been identified through facial recognition tools and his fingerprints. The lawyers for the families of the two agents killed in Amra's escape said they were 'relieved' that he had finally been apprehended.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-arrests-10-linked-to-escape-of-gang-leader-with-romania-set-to-extradite-him-/7985164.html	2025-02-23T08:40:01-08:00	
Rich in cash, Japan automaker Toyota builds city to test futuristic mobility	SUSONO — Woven City near Mount Fuji is where Japanese automaker Toyota plans to test everyday living with robotics, artificial intelligence and autonomous zero-emissions transportation. Daisuke Toyoda, an executive in charge of the project from the automaker's founding family, stressed it's not 'a smart city.' 'We're making a test course for mobility so that's a little bit different. We're not a real estate developer,' he said Saturday during a tour of the facility, where the first phase of construction was completed. The Associated Press was the first foreign media to get a preview of the $10 billion Woven City. The first phase spans 47,000 square meters (506,000 square feet), roughly the size of about five baseball fields. When completed, it will be 294,000 square meters (3.1 million square feet). Built on the grounds of a shuttered Toyota Motor Corp. auto plant, it's meant to be a place where researchers and startups come together to share ideas, according to Toyoda. Ambitious plans for futuristic cities have sputtered or are unfinished, including one proposed by Google's parent company Alphabet in Toronto; 'Neom' in Saudi Arabia; a project near San Francisco, spearheaded by a former Goldman Sachs trader, and Masdar City next to Abu Dhabi's airport. Woven City's construction began in 2021. All the buildings are connected by underground passageways, where autonomous vehicles will scuttle around collecting garbage and making deliveries. No one is living there yet. The first residents will total just 100 people. Called 'weavers,' they're workers at Toyota and partner companies, including instant noodle maker Nissin and Daikin, which manufactures air-conditioners. Coffee maker UCC was serving hot drinks from an autonomous-drive bus, parked in a square surrounded by still-empty apartment complexes. The city's name honors Toyota's beginnings as a maker of automatic textile looms. Sakichi Toyoda, Daisuke Toyoda's great-great-grandfather, just wanted to make life easier for his mother, who toiled on a manual loom. There was little talk of using electric vehicles, an area where Toyota has lagged. While Tesla and Byd emerged as big EV players, Toyota has been pushing hydrogen, the energy of choice in Woven City. Toyota officials acknowledged it doesn't expect to make money from Woven City, at least not for years. Keisuke Konishi, auto analyst at Quick Corporate Valuation Research Center, believes Toyota wants to work on robotic rides to rival Google's Waymo — even if it means building an entire complex. 'Toyota has the money to do all that,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rich-in-cash-japan-automaker-toyota-builds-city-to-test-futuristic-mobility/7985149.html	2025-02-23T08:15:08-08:00	
French authorities detained 4 people after stabbing linked to Islamic extremism	Paris — Four people were in custody Sunday after a deadly stabbing in eastern France that authorities linked to Islamic extremism, according to the national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office. A Portuguese man was killed in the Saturday attack in the city of Mulhouse, near the border with Germany. Seven police officers were wounded, including a parking control agent hospitalized with grave injuries, the prosecutor’s office said. Those detained include the suspected assailant, a 37-year-old Algerian man identified by prosecutors as Brahim A. The interior minister described him as an Islamic extremist with a schizophrenic profile. Two of the suspect's family members and a person who lodged him were also detained, the prosecutor's office said. French President Emmanuel Macron said the government has 'complete determination' to respond to the attack, which he blamed on 'Islamist terrorism.' France has been on high alert for extremist threats. The suspect repeatedly said, 'Allahu Akbar' — 'God is great' in Arabic — during the attack, the prosecutor said. He was armed with a knife and a screwdriver. The suspect arrived in France without papers in 2014 and was arrested and convicted of glorifying terrorism in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau told reporters Saturday night. Police experts had ″detected a schizophrenic profile″ in the suspect, he added. After several months in prison for that conviction, the suspect was confined to house arrest as authorities sought to expel him to Algeria. Retailleau criticized Algeria for resisting the return of criminals France is seeking to deport. The French government will convene a special meeting Wednesday about immigration in the wake of the attack, Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Sunday. They will notably study 19 countries 'where we have the most difficulty in returning people without papers,' Barrot said on Europe-1 radio.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-authorities-detained-4-people-after-stabbing-linked-to-islamic-extremism-/7985132.html	2025-02-23T08:06:38-08:00	
Hundreds of thousands attend the funeral of Hezbollah leader Nasrallah 5 months after his killing	BEIRUT — Hundreds of thousands of people packed into a stadium in Beirut and the streets outside Sunday for the funeral of Hezbollah's former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Nasrallah died after Israel's air force dropped more than 80 bombs on the militant group's main operations room in a southern suburb of the Lebanese capital. His death was a major blow for the Iran-backed militant group and political party that he had transformed into a potent force in the Middle East. Hezbollah is a U.S. designated terrorist group. Nasrallah was one of the group's founders and led it for more than 30 years, enjoying wide influence among Iran-backed groups in the region. He was widely respected in the so-called Iran-led axis of resistance that included Iraqi, Yemeni and Palestinian factions. Nasrallah also became an iconic figure in other parts of the Arab world after Hezbollah fought Israel to a draw in a brutal monthlong war in 2006, but the group's image in much of the region suffered after it intervened on the side of former President Bashar Assad in Syria's civil war. Hezbollah had called on its supporters to attend the funeral in large numbers in what appears to be a move to show that the group remains powerful after suffering major blows during a 14-month war with Israel that left many of its senior political and military officials dead. A Lebanese official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment estimated the crowd size at 450,000. 'This massive crowd confirms that Hezbollah is still the most popular party at the Lebanese level, and as a result, all the talk that Hezbollah is weak or degraded is out of place,' said Ali Fayyad, a lawmaker with the group's political wing, who attended the funeral. Sahar al-Attar, a mourner who traveled from Lebanon's Bekaa Valley for the funeral said,'We would have come even under bullets' to attend Nasrallah's burial. Nasrallah shared the funeral with his cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later. Nasrallah will be laid to rest later Sunday in Beirut while Safieddine will be buried in his hometown in southern Lebanon. Both had temporarily been buried in secret locations. As the coffins were paraded before the huge crowd, men riding on the platforms with them tossed flowers, while some in the crowd tossed clothing articles in the hope they would come in contact with the coffins, believing it would bless them. Outside of the stadium, giant screens were placed along the road leading to the airport, titling the funeral: 'We are committed to the covenant.' Senior Hezbollah official Ali Daamoush told reporters Saturday that about 800 prominent figures from 65 countries would attend the funeral in addition to thousands of individuals and activists from around the world. Iranian parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi were among the officials who arrived at the Lebanese capital's main sports stadium. Lebanon's parliament speaker and representatives of the president and prime minister were also in attendance. The funeral also drew non-official participants from outside of Lebanon, including some from Western countries. Irish activist Tara O'Grady waved the flag of her country and said that she came to Beirut 'to stand with the people of Lebanon and their resistance against the Zionist regime who are brutally continuing to bomb the south of Lebanon.' She likened Nasrallah to Irish early-20th century revolutionary Michael Collins. As O'Grady spoke with The Associated Press, four Israeli warplanes flew at low altitude over Beirut while Nasrallah's coffin was paraded into the stadium. The crowd chanted: 'Death to Israel' and 'at your service, Nasrallah.' Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that the fighter jets flying over the funeral 'send a clear message: Whoever threatens to annihilate Israel and strike Israel — that will be his end.' Hours before and during the funeral, the Israeli military also launched a series of strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. As part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal that ended the war with Israel on Nov. 27, Hezbollah is not supposed to have an armed presence along the border with Israel. The group was dealt another blow with the fall of the Assad family's five-decade rule in Syria in early December, which blocked a main route for the flow of weapons and money from Iran. Its rivals have been calling on it to lay down its weapons all over Lebanon and become a political faction. Nasrallah's successor, Hezbollah's current Secretary-General Naim Kassem, said in a televised speech played at the funeral that 'the resistance is still present and strong in numbers and weapons, and the inevitable victory is coming.' He was not at the stadium. Kassem added that 'Israel must withdraw from the areas it still occupies' in southern Lebanon, referring to five strategic border points where Israeli forces remain. 'We won't allow America to control our country,' he said. 'Israel will not take with politics what they did not take in the war.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-thousands-attend-the-funeral-of-hezbollah-leader-nasrallah-5-months-after-his-killing-/7985124.html	2025-02-23T07:53:26-08:00	
Congo's president says he'll create ‘unity government’ as violence spreads	KINSHASA — Congo's president says he is going to launch a unity government, as violence spreads across the country's east and pressure mounts over his handling of the crisis. On Saturday, in some of his first statements since M23 rebels captured major cities in eastern Congo, President Felix Tshisekedi, told a meeting of the Sacred Union of the Nation ruling coalition not to be distracted by internal quarrels. 'I lost the battle and not the war. I must reach out to everyone including the opposition. There will be a government of national unity,' said Tshisekedi. He didn’t give more details on what that would entail or when it would happen. M23 rebels — the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control and influence in eastern Congo — have swept through the region seizing key cities, killing some 3,000 people. In a lightning three-week offensive, the M23 took control of eastern Congo’s main city Goma and seized the second largest city, Bukavu. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, over 1,000 miles away. Rwanda has accused Congo of enlisting ethnic Hutu fighters responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus. M23 says it’s fighting to protect Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination and wants to transform Congo from a failed state to a modern one. Analysts have called those pretexts for Rwanda’s involvement. On Saturday, Tshisekedi paid tribute to soldiers who were killed and vowed to prop up the army. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-s-president-says-he-ll-create-unity-government-as-violence-spreads/7985125.html	2025-02-23T07:44:17-08:00	
Kremlin hails Putin-Trump dialogue as promising	Moscow — The Kremlin on Sunday hailed dialogue between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin — two 'extraordinary' presidents — as 'promising,' and vowed it would 'never' give up territory seized in eastern Ukraine. Trump broke with Western policy earlier this month by phoning Putin to discuss how to end the Ukraine conflict — a call hailed by Moscow as ending three years of isolation for the Kremlin leader since he launched his full-scale offensive in February 2022. Top Russian and U.S. officials then met in Saudi Arabia last week to discuss a 'restoration' of ties and start a discussion on a possible Ukraine ceasefire — all without the involvement of Kyiv or Europe. 'This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state TV on Sunday. 'That's promising,' he added. 'It is important that nothing prevents us from realizing the political will of the two heads of state.' Trump's overtures to Moscow have triggered alarm in Kyiv and across Europe. But it is unclear whether his moves will be able to bring Moscow and Kyiv closer to a truce. Peskov on Sunday ruled out any territorial concessions as part of a settlement. 'The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,' he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the offensive that were slammed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors. 'No one will ever sell off these territories. That's the most important thing.' 'God willed it' Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with 'the mission' to defend Russia. 'Fate willed it so, God willed it so, if I may say so. A mission as difficult as it is honorable — defending Russia — has been placed on our and your shoulders together,' he told servicemen who have fought in Ukraine. Russia was on Sunday marking Defender of the Fatherland Day — a holiday hailing soldiers and veterans — a day before the three-year anniversary of the start of its full-scale offensive. 'Today, at the risk of their lives and with courage, they are resolutely defending their homeland, national interests and Russia's future,' Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin. Moscow's army had overnight launched a record 267 attack drones at Ukraine, Kyiv's air force said. Among them, 138 were intercepted by air defense and 119 were 'lost.' Ukraine did not say what happened to the remaining 10 but a separate armed forces statement on Telegram said several regions, Kyiv included, had been 'hit.' AFP journalists in the Ukrainian capital heard air defense systems in operation throughout the night. 'Inappropriate remarks' Amid his outreach to Moscow, Trump has also verbally attacked Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy falsely claiming Kyiv started the war and that Zelensky was hugely unpopular at home. The bitter war of words has threatened to undermine Western support for Kyiv at a critical juncture in the conflict. Zelenskyy on Sunday called for the Western coalition that has been helping Kyiv fend off the Russian offensive for the last three years to hold strong. 'We must do our best to achieve a lasting and just peace for Ukraine. This is possible with the unity of all partners: we need the strength of the whole of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all those who want lasting peace,' Zelenskyy said on Telegram. Moscow has reveled in the spat between Trump and Zelensky. 'Zelenskyy makes inappropriate remarks addressed to the head of state. He does it repeatedly,' Peskov said Sunday. 'No president would tolerate that kind of treatment. So his [Trump's] reaction is completely quite understandable.' Scrambling to respond to Trump's dramatic policy reversal, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week to make the case for supporting Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kremlin-hails-putin-trump-dialogue-as-promising-/7985003.html	2025-02-23T04:58:01-08:00	
Russia signs memorandum to build port, oil refinery in Myanmar	Moscow — Myanmar and its close ally Russia signed a memorandum on investment cooperation in a special economic zone in Dawei, including construction of a port and an oil refinery, Russia's Ministry of Economic Development said on Sunday. The document was signed by the head of the Russian ministry, Maxim Reshetnikov, and Myanmar's minister for investment and foreign economic relations, Kan Zaw, during a visit of a Russian delegation to the Southeast Asian country. 'The text of the memorandum contains the basic parameters of several large infrastructure and energy projects that are being implemented jointly with Russian companies in Myanmar,' the Russian ministry cited Reshetnikov as saying in a statement. 'We are talking about projects to build a port, a coal-fired thermal power plant and an oil refinery.' He added that 'oil refining is still the most complex element,' and there was no final decision on construction of a refinery. 'As for the refinery — there is a desire of the Myanmar side to have a refinery. Our companies are still studying the economics of such a project, it is very complicated from the point of view of economic feasibility,' Interfax news agency cited Reshetnikov. According to the Russian ministry, the Dawei special economic zone is a 196 square-kilometer project in the Andaman Sea which is planned to house high-tech industrial zones and transport hubs, information technology zones and export processing zones. Russia has become Myanmar's closest ally since the military coup that overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected civilian government in February 2021. Moscow and Naypyidaw have been discussing a deeper energy cooperation, including Russia's participation in the construction of a gas pipeline to the Myanmar's main city Yangon. Russia has also had plans for a nuclear research reactor in the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-signs-memorandum-to-build-port-oil-refinery-in-myanmar-/7984996.html	2025-02-23T04:06:19-08:00	
Israel delays release of Palestinian prisoners, citing 'humiliating' handovers of hostages	TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel says the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is delayed 'until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies' at handovers of Israeli captives in Gaza. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office early Sunday came as vehicles apparently carrying prisoners left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in. The release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were released Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the Gaza ceasefire's first phase. Israel's announcement abruptly put the future of the truce into further doubt. The Palestinian Authority's commission for prisoners' affairs confirmed the delay 'until further notice.' The Associated Press video, recorded in the West Bank, showed prisoners' families, waiting outdoors in near-freezing weather, apparently dispersing. One woman was shown walking away in tears. The six were the last living hostages expected to be freed under the ceasefire's first phase, with a week remaining in the initial stage. Talks on the ceasefire's second phase are yet to start. The six included three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another taken while visiting family in southern Israel during the October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, that triggered the 16-month war in Gaza. The two others were held for a decade after entering Gaza on their own. Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were released together. Cohen's family and friends in Israel chanted 'Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!' and cheered. 'You're heroes,' Shem Tov told his parents as they later embraced, laughing and crying. 'You have no idea how much I dreamt of you.' His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 17 kilograms (37 pounds). Earlier Saturday, Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38, were freed. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. The Israeli-Austrian Shoham was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife and two children were freed in a 2023 exchange. Later, Israel's military said Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released. The Bedouin-Israeli entered Gaza in 2015. His family had told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia. Israel's government didn't respond to questions about the delay in releasing prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal, with spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanou accusing Netanyahu of 'deliberately stalling.' The hostage release followed a heartrending dispute when Hamas on Thursday handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted with her two young boys. The remains were determined to be those of an unnamed Palestinian woman. Netanyahu vowed revenge for 'a cruel and malicious violation.' Hamas suggested it was a mistake. Israeli forensic authorities confirmed a body handed over Friday was Bibas. Dr. Chen Kugel, head of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said they found no evidence Bibas and her children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as Hamas has claimed. Kugel did not give a cause. Difficult talks likely over the ceasefire's next phase The ceasefire deal has paused the deadliest and most devastating fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, but there are fears the war will resume. Negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase are likely to be more difficult. Hamas had said it will release four bodies next week, completing the truce's first phase. After that, Hamas will hold over 60 hostages — about half believed to be alive. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu, with the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, says he's committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 Hamas terrorists, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million population. The October 7, 2023, terrorist attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died in the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-delays-release-of-palestinian-prisoners-citing-humiliating-handovers-of-hostages-/7984992.html	2025-02-23T03:37:53-08:00	
Vatican: Ailing Pope Francis 'rested during a peaceful night'	ROME — Pope Francis, in critical condition with a complicated lung infection, rested well during a peaceful night following a respiratory crisis and blood transfusions, the Vatican said Sunday. Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni's one-line statement didn't mention if Francis was up or eating breakfast. 'The night passed quietly, the pope rested.' The brief update came after doctors said the 88-year-old pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was in critical condition. On Saturday morning, he suffered a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection. The pope received 'high flows' of oxygen to help him breathe. He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update. The Saturday statement also said that the pontiff 'continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday.' Doctors said the prognosis was 'reserved.' Doctors have said Francis’ condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease. Main threat facing pope is sepsis They have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. Saturday’s blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition called platelopenia or thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal. Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Francis, who has chronic lung disease and is prone to bronchitis in winter, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Speculation that Francis might resign Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious, alert, eating and working. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred. Parolin said such speculation seemed 'useless' when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican. 'On the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumors can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,' Parolin was quoted as saying. 'However, I don’t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven’t heard anything like that.' Holy Year celebrations continue Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Holy Year weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood. In his place, the Holy Year organizer was to celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second consecutive weekend, Francis is skipping his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it. 'Look, even though he’s not [physically] here, we know he’s here,' said Luis Arnaldo Lopez Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico, who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. 'He’s recovering, but he’s in our hearts and is accompanying us, because our prayers and his go together.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-ailing-pope-francis-rested-during-a-peaceful-night-/7984949.html	2025-02-23T00:58:10-08:00	
Encroaching desert threatens to swallow Mauritania's homes, history	CHINGUETTI, MAURITANIA — For centuries, poets, scholars and theologians have flocked to Chinguetti, a trans-Saharan trading post home to more than a dozen libraries containing thousands of manuscripts. But it now stands on the brink of oblivion. Shifting sands have long covered the ancient city's 8th-century core and are encroaching on neighborhoods at its current edge. Residents say the desert is their destiny. As the world's climate gets hotter and drier, sandstorms are more frequently depositing centimeters of dunes onto Chinguetti's streets and in people's homes, submerging some entirely. Tree-planting projects are trying to keep the invading sands at bay, but so far, they haven't eased the deep-rooted worries about the future. Chinguetti is one of four UNESCO World Heritage sites in Mauritania, a West African nation where only 0.5% of land is considered farmable. In Africa — the continent that contributes the least to fossil fuel emissions — only Somalia and Eswatini have experienced more climate change impacts, according to World Bank data. Mauritanians believe Chinguetti is among Islam's holiest cities. Its dry stone and mud mortar homes, mosques and libraries store some of West Africa's oldest quranic texts and manuscripts, covering topics ranging from law to mathematics. Community leader Melainine Med El Wely feels agonized over the stakes for residents and the history contained within Chinguetti's walls. It's like watching a natural disaster in slow motion, he said. 'It's a city surrounded by an ocean of sand that's advancing every minute,' El Wely, the president of the local Association for Participatory Oasis Management, said. 'There are places that I walk now that I remember being the roofs of houses when I was a kid.' He remembers that once when enough sand blew into his neighborhood to cover the palms used to make roofs, an unknowing camel walking through the neighborhood plunged into what was once someone's living room. Research suggests sand migration plays a significant role in desertification. Deserts, including the Sahara, are expanding at unprecedented rates and 'sand seas' are being reactivated, with blowing dunes transforming landscapes where vegetation once stood. 'What we used to think of as the worst case scenario five to 10 years ago is now actually looking like a more likely scenario than we had in mind,' said Andreas Baas, an earth scientist from King's College London who researches how winds and the way they blow sand are changing. More than three-quarters of the earth's land has become drier in recent decades, according to a 2024 United Nations report on desertification. The aridity has imperiled ability of plants, humans and animals to survive. It robs lands of the moisture needed to sustain life, kills crops and can cause sandstorms and wildfires. 'Human-caused climate change is the culprit; known for making the planet warmer, it is also making more and more land drier,' the U.N. report said. 'Aridity-related water scarcity is causing illness and death and spurring large-scale forced migration around the world.' Scientists and policymakers are mostly concerned about soils degrading in once-fertile regions that are gradually becoming wastelands, rather than areas deep in the Sahara Desert. Still, in Chinguetti, a changing climate is ushering in many of the consequences that officials have warned about. Trees are withering, wells are running dry and livelihoods are vanishing. Date farmers like 50-year-old Salima Ould Salem have found it increasingly difficult to nourish their palm trees, and now have to pipe in water from tanks and prune more thoroughly to make sure it's used efficiently. Salem's neighborhood used to be full of families, but they've gradually moved away. Sand now blocks the doorway to his home. It's buried those where some of his neighbors once lived. And a nearby guesthouse built by a Belgian investor decades ago is now half-submerged in a rippling copper-hued dune. Though many have departed, Salem remains, aware that each time a member of the community leaves, their home can no long serve as a bulwark and the rest of the community therefore becomes more likely to be swallowed by the desert. 'We prefer to stay here. If I leave, my place will disappear,' Salem said. Acacia, gum and palm trees once shielded the neighborhood from encroaching dunes, but they've gradually disappeared. The trees have either died of thirst or have been cut down by residents needing firewood or foliage for their herds to feed on. Sandstorms are not new but have become increasingly intrusive, each leaving inches or feet in the neighborhoods on the edge of the city, retired teacher Mohamed Lemine Bahane said. Residents use mules and carts to remove the sand because the old city's streets are too narrow to accommodate cars or bulldozers. When sand piles high enough, some build new walls atop existing structures. 'When you remove the vegetation, it gives the dunes a chance to become more active, because it's ultimately the vegetation that can hold down the sand so it doesn't blow too much,' Bahane said. Bahane has for years taken measurements of the sand deposits and rains and says that Chinguetti has received an annual average of 2.5 centimeters of rainfall over the past decade. As rainfall plummets, trees die, and more sand migrates into town. And with shorter acacia trees submerged in sand, some herders resort to cutting down date palm trees to feed their flocks, further disrupting the ecosystem and date farming economy. The sands also raise public health concerns for the community breathing in the dust, Bahane said. The solution, he believes, has to be planting more trees both in neighborhoods and along the perimeter of town. Such 'green belts' have been proposed on a continent-wide scale as Africa's 'Great Green Wall' as well as locally, in towns like Chinguetti. Mauritania's Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Agriculture as well as European-funded NGOs have floated projects to plant trees to insulate the city's libraries and manuscripts from the incoming desert. Though some have been replanted, there's little sign that it has contributed to stopping the desert in its tracks. It can take years for taproots to grow deep enough into the earth to access groundwater. 'We're convinced that desertification is our destiny. But thankfully, there are still people convinced that it can be resisted,' El Wely, the community leader, said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---mauritania-residents-say-the-desert-is-their-destiny-/7984232.html	2025-02-22T23:44:17-08:00	
Philippine village battles dengue by offering bounties for mosquitos — dead or alive	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos — dead or alive. The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection. At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected. A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal declogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle. 'There was an alarm,' Cernal told The Associated Press. 'I found a way.' Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said. Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases. As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents). 'This is a big help,' Labag said, smiling. 'I can buy coffee.' Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person's fluid levels is seen as critical. Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes. Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it's crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said. Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-village-battles-dengue-by-offering-bounties-for-mosquitos-dead-or-alive/7984215.html	2025-02-22T23:43:32-08:00	
Beauty market targets young at heart in aging Japan	TOKYO — Yoshiko Abe is about to turn 89, but that hasn't stopped her from going to the gym every day and trying the free-of-charge makeup course at her housing complex. 'It was really helpful,' she said, all smiles and glowing after putting on foundation and pink lipstick, something she hadn't done in years. Japan has the largest percentage of older citizens than any other country in the world. More than a quarter of Japan's population is 65 and older, at 36 million people. In about a decade, the ratio will be one in three. No wonder the young-at-heart, like Abe, is a growing target for Japan Inc. The market for older people is estimated to grow to more than 100 trillion yen ($650 billion) in size this year, according to a study by Mizuho Bank. And that business isn't just about remedies for sicknesses and old folks' homes but taps into solid consumerism. The growth of artificial intelligence and robotics also offers promise for such services and gadgetry. Akira Shimizu, professor of business at Keio University, calls them 'cool grandpas and cute grannies' who remain sensitive to trends, including the latest luxury and health products. 'They think about the clothing and makeup that express their style,' he said. From luxury cruises and 'oldies' rock concerts, companies are leveraging the fact that older people these days remain active, go out with friends and on dates, so they want to dress up and look good, said Shimizu. Maintaining one's looks is good physical exercise because it takes hand agility to open cosmetics tubes and draw eyebrows nicely, and massaging the face gets one's saliva glands going, according to Miwa Hiraku, the makeover class instructor from the Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido. Shiseido Co., which started out as a pharmacy in 1872, said that makeup is not just good for your physical well-being but also your soul. The company has been holding free makeup courses for older people across the country. 'Putting on makeup works as a switch to turn on your energy at the start of your day,' said Hiraku, who vows to wear makeup even at 100. 'It's not just about looking beautiful. It's about living a long healthy life.' Yoshihiko Hotta, 85, the only man in the class of about 30 people, didn't try the rouge but happily put on the hand cream and went along with all the exercise routines. While acknowledging he felt some effects of aging like sore legs, he declared with conviction: 'I don't think age is relevant.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/beauty-market-targets-young-at-heart-in-aging-japan/7982895.html	2025-02-22T23:42:51-08:00	
Mystical beliefs fuel Senegal's illegal big cat trade	NIOKOLO-KOBA NATIONAL PARK, SENEGAL — The morning sun slants through the canopy of Senegal's Niokolo-Koba National Park as Sgt. Abdou Diouf and his brigade of rangers march in single file, guns at the ready. They scan the brush for signs of poachers, but today, it seems, the only hunters are the lions themselves, their fresh tracks pressed into the sand. As the sun climbs, a guttural call reverberates across the forest. The rangers pause. 'Lions,' Diouf says. Spanning more than 9,000 square kilometers – double the size of Rhode Island – Niokolo-Koba is the last sanctuary in Senegal for lions, which are critically endangered in West Africa. But even here, they find little respite. Driven by deeply rooted beliefs in the mystical powers of animal skin talismans known as 'gris-gris,' the illegal trade of lion and leopard parts is growing, according to a new report by wild cat conservation group Panthera. Panthera's investigation found lion and leopard parts sold in 80% of markets surveyed, with 63% of artisans reporting increased sales in recent years. For Niokolo-Koba's lions, the impact has been devastating. Despite enhanced protections that doubled the population to around 35 since 2017, helping delist the park as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in danger, an unsustainable average of two cats are still lost to poachers each year. The only other place lions are found in West Africa is in the W-Arly-Pendjari Complex, a border region of Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger, and Panthera estimates there are fewer than 250 adults left in the region. The allure of the gris-gris The gris-gris, prescribed by influential religious leaders called marabouts, are crafted from bits of skin with written prayers or Quranic verses sewn inside. They are widely used across Senegal; police don them for protection, wrestlers for strength, politicians for clout. Average citizens wear them to ward off curses that other people may have put on them for a variety of reasons — matters of romance, perhaps, or jealousy at economic success. Gris-gris are rooted in traditional African faiths that believe vital powers in animals and nature may be unlocked — to harm, to heal, or to protect, said Dr. Cheikh Babou, a history professor and expert in West African Islam at the University of Pennsylvania. With Islam's arrival in West Africa in the eighth century, gris-gris became hybrid objects, melding Quranic verses with the perceived powers of animal parts. 'People started to drink the Quran, to wear the Quran – in the same way that they did with animals,' Babou said. Reverence for the lion makes it a special gris-gris At a market stall in Tambacounda, Ibrahim, a customer who asked that his last name be withheld because the trade of lion parts is illegal, wears several amulets around his waist. Made from hyena, honey badger, goat, fox, jackal, monkey, and lion, each serves a specific purpose. He began wearing them years ago after falling ill; someone had cast a spell on him, he said, so he went to a marabout who prescribed the gris-gris. 'Here in Africa people are very mean,' he said. 'If they see you succeed a little, they will go to the marabout. They don't want to see you in good health.' Traditional African societies are very egalitarian, Babou said – those with wealth are expected to share it. 'Those who don't share break the ethic of communalism. And when you do that, you become a witch.' A gris-gris can offer protection from those looking to retaliate. Among these protective talismans, lion parts hold particular allure. As the national emblem, the image of the lion adorns everything from the country's coat of arms to billboard advertisements, and it serves as namesake for the beloved national soccer team, the Lions of Teranga. 'You cannot prevent a Senegalese person from believing that a lion skin has some kind of power,' said Daouda Ngom, Senegal's minister of Environment and Ecological Transition. Smuggling networks are tough to dislodge This demand has given rise to a complex smuggling network that spans the continent. Likely sourced from East and Southern Africa, the skins travel by public bus and truck along clandestine routes through the Sahel region, evading checkpoints and border security on their journey into Senegal, according to Panthera's report. 'These are well-established networks,' said Paul Diedhiou, the director of Niokolo-Koba National Park. 'Dismantling them requires time, strategy and a lot of professionalism.' Between 2019 and 2024, authorities in Senegal confiscated some 40 lion and leopard skins, according to the Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement (EAGLE) Network, a wildlife law enforcement organization operating across Africa. During that same period, 40 people were arrested for trafficking skins and other parts such as teeth, claws, and skulls. 'These seizures represent only a fraction of the actual trade,' said Cécile Bloch, coordinator of EAGLE Senegal. 'Today, traffickers cut lion skins into thousands of pieces to cross borders more easily and avoid detection in local markets.' Since partnering with Niokolo-Koba in 2016, Panthera has helped strengthen security measures. The conservation group tripled the park's anti-poaching force from 20 to 60 agents, equipping them with vehicles and gear, while investing more than $7 million in infrastructure – including a ranger base with an airstrip, hundreds of camera traps, and new roads and bridges. Lions' fate may depend on convincing marabouts to change Yet the crisis' roots run deeper than poaching. At its heart are the marabouts whose gris-gris prescriptions drive the trade. Those involved often see no contradiction between their prescription or purchase of lion parts and their desire to protect the species, the Panthera report found. As one marabout, Cheikh Camara, put it in an interview with The Associated Press: 'I prescribe the gris-gris to help people get better. It's the poaching that's making the lions go extinct.' At the park's headquarters, the scale of the challenge is clear. A storeroom overflows with confiscated skins — leopards, lions, antelopes, even a crocodile. A rusting phalanx of seized firearms hangs on the wall. 'Sometimes the poachers fire at you,' said Diouf, the sergeant. 'It's very risky.' Such dangers are compounded by Senegal's toothless hunting and wildlife laws, which date to 1986. Recent arrests include a Burkinabe man found with leopard and lion parts who was sentenced to just one month in prison, while a Malian trafficker received the same penalty for smuggling leopard skins. One vendor told AP he can get a little over $3 for a small bit of lion skin that makes a single gris-gris. A belt can go for the equivalent of nearly $80, he said. The Panthera report said an entire lion skin can fetch the equivalent of $1,900 or more. 'The sentences are too short,' said Ndeye Seck, the head of litigation and armament for the parks department. 'We would like to see the hunting and protection of wildlife codes updated.' Ngom, the environment minister who assumed his role early last year, said pushing through tougher laws will be a priority for his team. But the battle to protect Senegal's lions is as much about culture as enforcement, and lasting change will require rethinking the role of gris-gris in modern Senegalese society, Babou said. 'Culture is very powerful,' he said. 'Until you can convince people that there are more effective tools to achieve your goals, then they will continue to believe in it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mystical-beliefs-fuel-senegal-s-illegal-big-cat-trade/7982878.html	2025-02-22T23:42:13-08:00	
Afghan women's radio station to resume broadcasts after Taliban say they're lifting suspension	An Afghan women's radio station will resume broadcasts after the Taliban suspended its operations, citing 'unauthorized provision' of content to an overseas TV channel and improperly using its license. Radio Begum launched on International Women's Day in March 2021, five months before the Taliban seized power amid the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops. The station's content is produced entirely by Afghan women. Its sister satellite channel, Begum TV, operates from France and broadcasts programs that cover the Afghan school curriculum from seventh to 12th grade. The Taliban have banned education for women and girls in the country beyond grade six. In a statement issued Saturday night, the Taliban's Information and Culture Ministry said Radio Begum had 'repeatedly requested' to restart operations and that the suspension was lifted after the station made commitments to authorities. The station pledged to conduct broadcasts 'in accordance with the principles of journalism and the regulations of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, and to avoid any violations in the future,' it added. The ministry did not elaborate what those principles and regulations were. Radio Begum was not immediately available for comment. Since their takeover, the Taliban have excluded women from education, many kinds of work, and public spaces. Journalists, especially women, have lost their jobs as the Taliban tighten their grip on the media. In the 2024 press freedom index from Reporters without Borders, Afghanistan ranks 178 out of 180 countries. The year before that it ranked 152. The Information Ministry did not initially identify the TV channel it alleged Radio Begum had been working with. But the Saturday statement mentioned collaboration with 'foreign sanctioned media outlets.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-women-s-radio-station-to-resume-broadcasts-after-taliban-say-they-re-lifting-suspension/7984936.html	2025-02-22T23:39:46-08:00	
Well-off Hong Kong daunted by record deficits	HONG KONG — Hong Kong is facing its toughest fiscal test in three decades following a painful run of mammoth deficits, with experts urging the government to make careful cuts as the economy wobbles. The Chinese finance hub last saw a string of deficits after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s -- but their scale was a fraction of the $32.4 billion shortfall in the 2020-21 fiscal year. Hong Kong has recorded annual deficits exceeding $20 billion in three of the past four years, according to official figures. The city's finance chief, Paul Chan, said Sunday that the deficits were caused by 'multiple internal and external challenges' and that a new budget unveiled on Wednesday will tightly control public spending. While Chan earlier predicted a return to surplus in 'three or so years,' a former government minister told AFP that the situation is 'not just due to economic cycles' spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. 'If you look at Hong Kong versus other economies in the region, for example Singapore, those other economies have done much better,' said Anthony Cheung, who oversaw transport and housing policies. Adding to the headache is the exodus of companies and high-paid workers as the city's international reputation took a hit after Beijing quelled pro-democracy protests and imposed a sweeping national security law in 2020. Singapore and Hong Kong suffered towering deficits in 2020 because of the pandemic, but the former has been able to keep spending relative to income in check as firms shift there from the Chinese city, helping it outperform its fiscal targets. The challenge for Hong Kong is not just to balance its books, but to find fiscal sustainability amid U.S.-China tensions and a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, Cheung said. 'In the past, we assumed that Hong Kong was geopolitically well-positioned. ... Now we have to be more careful about such presumptions.' Plunging land sales Hong Kong is required by its mini-constitution to 'strive to achieve a fiscal balance' -- a holdover from British colonial rule that kept the market mostly free from government intervention. After returning to China in 1997, it kept taxes low and refilled its coffers with the help of land-related revenue, selling land to developers with deep pockets. But last year Hong Kong collected just $2.5 billion that way, from a peak of $21.2 billion in 2018. '[Land-related revenue] by itself has contributed to the majority of the income decline,' said Yang Liu, a financial economist at the University of Hong Kong. 'We have a very inactive land market and declining housing prices. That's one reason that people [don't] trade, so there's no tax [income],' Liu told AFP. Hong Kong still has healthy cash reserves and low government debt compared with most economies around the world. But the prospect of three straight years in the red has fueled public debate on how to spend less. 'All the new initiatives will be under much stronger scrutiny, so [the government} will be a lot more disciplined, a lot more careful,' Liu said. In his upcoming budget speech, the finance chief is set to put the latest deficit at 'under HK$100 billion,' or $13 billion, adjusting for money raised from bond sales. There are calls to roll back a transport subsidy for those aged 60 to 64, which can grow into a major burden on the government as Hong Kong's population ages. Lawmaker Edmund Wong cautioned against pay cuts for civil servants, which he said may cause private-sector employers to follow suit, but urged the government to slim down. 'In the long term, we can greatly reduce the manpower which the government is employing now,' he told AFP. 'Welcoming' image The deficits could prompt Hong Kong to rethink how it makes money, though past discussions on expanding the tax base -- such as a goods and services tax -- went nowhere. The city's low ratio of debt to gross domestic product -- which the government last year put at no more than 13% -- means it can afford to issue bonds to fund huge undertakings, experts say. Officials have signaled they will push ahead with a massive infrastructure project in northern Hong Kong, while backing away from a separate plan to create artificial islands. As tensions flare between the United States and China, Hong Kong is seeking untapped growth potential in the Middle East and Southeast Asia that can translate to government revenue down the line. The city's economic fortunes are ultimately tied to how investors view the city as a regional and global hub, said Cheung, the former minister. 'We have to continue to showcase Hong Kong as a city that welcomes all kinds of views, all kinds of people, so long as they stay within the parameters of the national security legislation,' Cheung said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/well-off-hong-kong-daunted-by-record-deficits/7984933.html	2025-02-22T22:56:59-08:00	
Discontented Germany votes in an election with economy, migration and far-right strength in focus	BERLIN — German voters are choosing a new government in an election Sunday dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe's biggest economy, pressure to curb migration and growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe's alliance with the United States. The center-right opposition is favored to win, while polls point to the strongest result for a far-right party since World War II. Germany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It has been Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S. It will be central to shaping the continent's response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administration's confrontational foreign and trade policy. What are Germans voting for? More than 59 million people in the nation of 84 million are eligible to elect the 630 members of the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, who will take their seats under the glass dome of Berlin's landmark Reichstag building. Germany's electoral system rarely produces absolute majorities, and no party looks anywhere near one this time. It's expected that two or more parties will form a coalition, following potentially difficult negotiations that will take weeks or even months before the Bundestag elects the next chancellor. This election is taking place seven months before it was originally planned after center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting. There's widespread discontent and not much enthusiasm for any of the candidates. Who could take charge? Center-right opposition leader Friedrich Merz's Union bloc has consistently led polls, with 28-32% support in the most recent surveys, and Merz is favored to replace Scholz. Scholz's Social Democrats have been polling between 14% and 16%, which would be their worst postwar result in a national parliamentary election. The far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has been running in second place with around 20% of the vote — well above its previous best of 12.6% in a national election, from 2017 — and has fielded its first candidate for chancellor in Alice Weidel. But other parties say they won't work with it, a stance often known as the 'firewall.' The environmentalist Greens also are running for the top job, with outgoing Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, but have been polling a little behind Scholz's party. Merz has pledged 'stability instead of chaos' after Scholz's three-party coalition collapsed following long-running internal arguments, including over how to revitalize the economy. But it's unclear whether the conservative leader, if he wins, will be able to put together a stable government that does much better. Merz hopes for a two-party coalition but may end up needing a third partner to form a government. The realistic candidates to join a Merz government are Scholz's Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats — who were the smallest partner in Scholz's collapsed government and may not manage to stay in parliament. The Free Democrats and another small party are hovering are hovering at around 5% of the vote, the threshold to qualify for seats in parliament. If they do, there may be no majority for a two-party coalition. What are the main issues? The contenders have made contrasting proposals to turn around the German economy, which has shrunk for the past two years and hasn't managed real growth in much longer. That's going to be a central job for the new government. Migration moved to the forefront of the campaign in the past month following deadly attacks committed by immigrants. Merz vowed to bar people from entering the country without proper papers and to step up deportations if he is elected chancellor. He then brought a nonbinding motion calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany's borders. Parliament approved it by a narrow majority thanks to AfD votes — a first in postwar Germany. Rivals made Merz's attitude toward AfD, which generated protests, an issue. Scholz accused Merz of 'irresponsible gambling' and breaking a taboo. Merz has rejected those accusations, saying that he didn't and won't work with AfD. He has repeatedly and categorically said since that his party will 'never' do so. Mainstream parties have vowed to keep up support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. And after the Scholz government reached a NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, the next administration will have to find a way to keep that going — and likely expand it, in the face of U.S. demands — once a special 100 billion-euro ($105 billion) fund to modernize the military is used up in 2027.	https://www.voanews.com/a/discontented-germany-votes-in-an-election-with-economy-migration-and-far-right-strength-in-focus/7984932.html	2025-02-22T22:39:55-08:00	
New FBI Director Patel will also be named acting head of firearms agency, official says	WASHINGTON — New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department official said Saturday. Patel could be sworn in next week, the official said, putting Patel in charge of two of the Justice Department's largest agencies in an unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau that has long drawn the ire of conservatives. The Justice Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the move before it's announced publicly. White House officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening. Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate approval despite Democrats' concerns about the steadfast Trump ally's plans to radically overhaul the FBI. ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is responsible for enforcing the nation's laws around firearms, explosives and arson. Among other things, it's in charge of licensing federal firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations. The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News. The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF's top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was 'targeting gun owners.' Hicks, who spent more than 20 years as a Justice Department lawyer, said in a social media post that being ATF chief counsel was the 'highest honor' of her career. Conservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores. In an executive order earlier this month, President Donald Trump directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden administration around firearms 'to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.' Gun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a 'known gun rights extremist.' Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his confirmation as FBI director 'a major victory for gun owners and constitutional rights advocates nationwide.' The last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month. He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the politically fraught process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-fbi-director-patel-will-also-be-named-acting-head-of-firearms-agency-official-says/7984917.html	2025-02-22T20:01:31-08:00	
Israel delays release of Palestinian prisoners, citing 'humiliating' handovers of hostages	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — Israel says the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is delayed 'until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies' at handovers of Israeli captives in Gaza. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office early Sunday came as vehicles apparently carrying prisoners left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in. The release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were released Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the Gaza ceasefire's first phase. Israel's announcement abruptly put the future of the truce into further doubt. The Palestinian Authority's commission for prisoners' affairs confirmed the delay 'until further notice.' The Associated Press video, recorded in the West Bank, showed prisoners' families, waiting outdoors in near-freezing weather, apparently dispersing. One woman was shown walking away in tears. The six were the last living hostages expected to be freed under the ceasefire's first phase, with a week remaining in the initial stage. Talks on the ceasefire's second phase are yet to start. The six included three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another taken while visiting family in southern Israel during the October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, that triggered the 16-month war in Gaza. The two others were held for a decade after entering Gaza on their own. Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were released together. Cohen's family and friends in Israel chanted 'Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!' and cheered. 'You're heroes,' Shem Tov told his parents as they later embraced, laughing and crying. 'You have no idea how much I dreamt of you.' His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 17 kilograms (37 pounds). Earlier Saturday, Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38, were freed. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. The Israeli-Austrian Shoham was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife and two children were freed in a 2023 exchange. Later, Israel's military said Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released. The Bedouin-Israeli entered Gaza in 2015. His family had told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia. Accusations of 'stalling' Israel's government didn't respond to questions about the delay in releasing prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal, with spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanou accusing Netanyahu of 'deliberately stalling.' The hostage release followed a heartrending dispute when Hamas on Thursday handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted with her two young boys. The remains were determined to be those of an unnamed Palestinian woman. Netanyahu vowed revenge for 'a cruel and malicious violation.' Hamas suggested it was a mistake. Israeli forensic authorities confirmed a body handed over Friday was Bibas. Dr. Chen Kugel, head of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said they found no evidence Bibas and her children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as Hamas has claimed. Kugel did not give a cause. Difficult talks likely The ceasefire deal has paused the deadliest and most devastating fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, but there are fears the war will resume. Negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase are likely to be more difficult. Hamas had said it will release four bodies next week, completing the truce's first phase. After that, Hamas will hold over 60 hostages — about half believed to be alive. Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu, with the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, says he's committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 Hamas terrorists, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million population. The October 7, 2023, terrorist attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died in the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-delays-release-of-palestinian-prisoners-citing-humiliating-handovers-of-hostages-/7984903.html	2025-02-22T18:28:53-08:00	
Pakistan threatens to deport Afghans if US relocation timeline isn’t met	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has warned that thousands of Afghan nationals awaiting relocation and resettlement in the United States will be deported to Afghanistan if their cases are rejected or not processed on time. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar issued the warning during a television interview aired Saturday, noting that the U.S. has promised to relocate the Afghan community in question from Pakistan 'tentatively around September this year.' His office in Islamabad released the interview excerpts. 'If any refugee who was undertaken to be taken by another country after due process —no matter the timeline — if it doesn’t happen and the country refuses, then for us, that will be an illegal immigrant in Pakistan, and we might be forced to send such refugee back to [their] original country, which is Afghanistan,' Dar told Turkey’s TRT national broadcaster. However, the chief Pakistani diplomat expressed Islamabad’s willingness to resolve the issue with Washington, stating that his government is 'examining the situation and will negotiate [accordingly].' Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump halted refugee applications and travel plans until further notice to ensure that refugee entry into the United States aligns with its national interests. The decision has stranded around 45,000 Afghans prepared to fly out of Afghanistan and at least 15,000 qualified refugees currently in Pakistan, according to #AfghanEvac, a coalition that assists Afghans with their relocation and resettlement in the U.S. These individuals were part of Afghan families who fled their country following the Taliban insurgents’ retaking of power in 2021, primarily seeking refuge from potential retribution because of their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces during their nearly two-decade-long presence in Afghanistan. While about 80,000 of these Afghans have since been relocated from Pakistan, officials in Islamabad assert that around 40,000 remain in a state of limbo including around 15,000 in Pakistan destined for the United States. Since launching a crackdown on undocumented foreign migrants in September 2023, Pakistan has forcibly repatriated more than 825,000 undocumented Afghan refugees to their home country, according to the United Nations. The government has recently intensified its crackdown, targeting both documented and undocumented Afghan refugees. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered authorities last month to remove all Afghans from Islamabad and the adjoining city of Rawalpindi by Feb. 28 before arranging for deporting them to Afghanistan along with others subsequently. The targeted population encompasses over 2.5 million Afghans nationwide, comprising lawful refugees, documented economic migrants, and those without legal authorization to remain in Pakistan. Sharif’s directive stipulates March 31 as the deadline for the United States and other countries to process the cases of Afghans awaiting resettlements, thereby preventing their deportation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-threatens-to-deport-afghans-if-us-relocation-timeline-isn-t-met/7984905.html	2025-02-22T18:20:28-08:00	
Macron, Starmer to meet Trump, offer ideas for Ukraine security guarantees	LONDON/PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump's hardening stance toward Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict. The leaders of Europe's two nuclear powers, who will be traveling separately, are expected to try to persuade Trump not to rush into a ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and discuss military guarantees to Ukraine. Macron, who is trying to capitalize on a relationship with Trump built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal weakness to the United States' foes, including China and Iran. 'I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of President (Putin). It's not you, it's not what you're made of and it's not in your interests,' he said in an hourlong question and answer session on social media ahead of Monday's visit to the White House. The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump described as a 'dictator.' That has alarmed Kyiv's European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European politics. Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American University in Paris, said Trump's rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a major shock for the Europeans. 'They could not have expected that somehow within the United States would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would actually challenge Europe's voice in world affairs in such a stark and strong way,' he told Reuters. He said Macron believed he had a 'historic role to play' in going to Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on Ukraine. 'Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this visit is an entirely different matter,' he added. Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a 'temporary pause before Putin attacks again,' will be in Washington on Thursday. Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and Starmer had not 'done anything' to end the war. 'No meetings with Russia!' he said, although he described Macron as 'a friend of mine' and Starmer as 'a very nice guy.' However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to take on a bigger burden for European security. Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to persuade Trump to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials said. Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two diplomats said. They have also been supported in putting together an array of options by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and peacekeepers required, officials said. While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, center around providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said. Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe for international shipping, the official said. Part of the British and French talks center around the possibility of sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial. The options being discussed would center not on providing troops for the frontline or the 2,000-kilometer border which would remain secured by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats and the military official said. Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose a European presence in Ukraine. A French military official said there was little sense in talking numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European troops would also be involved. 'It's not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It's the ability to mobilize and the ability to arrange everything into a package of interoperability units,' the French official said. A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the 'high side.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-starmer-to-meet-trump-offer-ideas-for-ukraine-security-guarantees/7984899.html	2025-02-22T17:57:16-08:00	
Poland pays for Ukraine's Starlink subscription, says its deputy PM	WARSAW, POLAND — Poland said Saturday it has been paying for Ukraine's Starlink subscription and will continue to do so despite sources saying the United States could consider cutting Ukraine's access to the satellite internet system. U.S. negotiators pressing Kyiv for access to Ukraine's critical minerals have raised the possibility of cutting the country's access to Elon Musk's vital Starlink satellite internet system, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Starlink provides crucial internet connectivity to the war-torn country and its military. 'We pay and will continue to pay a subscription fee for satellite internet for Ukraine,' Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said in a post on Musk-owned social media platform X. 'I cannot imagine that someone could decide to terminate a business contract for a commercial service to which Poland is a party,' added Gawkowski, who is also Poland's digital affairs minister. SpaceX, which operates Starlink, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Ukrainian military officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Poland has delivered 20,000 Starlink units to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022, and has been funding their maintenance to support internet connectivity, according to information on the Polish presidency's website. President Andrzej Duda will meet Donald Trump later Saturday during a visit to the United States, amid a widening rift between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that has alarmed Kyiv's European allies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-pays-for-ukraine-s-starlink-subscription-says-its-deputy-pm/7984648.html	2025-02-22T17:43:12-08:00	
Musk orders US federal workers to describe what they did at work last week or get fired	WASHINGTON — Elon Musk, the billionaire head of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), threatened Saturday to fire any federal worker who fails to explain what work they have accomplished during the previous week. The threat, issued in a post on the social media site X, was made just hours after President Donald Trump posted on his own social media network Truth Social that DOGE should get more aggressive in its attempts to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. 'All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,' Musk posted on X. 'Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.' As of Saturday evening, emails were sent to employees at federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others with the subject line, 'What did you do last week?' The email, seen by Reuters, asks employees to reply to the email they have received with five bullet points summarizing 'what you accomplished at work last week' and copy their managers. The email sent from a human resources address gives employees until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday to respond. It is unclear what legal basis Musk has to terminate federal workers if they fail to respond to his request. Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the email Saturday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. However, most agency staff had been ordered not to perform any tasks since early this month, creating a conundrum. The agency is also under a temporary court order not to resume mass firings pending the outcome of legal proceedings. A spokesperson for DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The AFGE, the union representing federal employees, said in a statement it will challenge any 'unlawful terminations.' 'Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump administration have shown their utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people,' said AFGE National President Everett Kelley. The Trump administration's fast-paced and controversial process to reduce government spending by shrinking the federal workforce led by Musk and his young aides at the cost-cutting DOGE has led to haphazard firings that resulted in numerous mistakes and forced several agencies to quickly rehire vital employees, such as those working on nuclear safety, defense and power generation. The first wave of job cuts has targeted workers who are easier to fire, such as employees on the job for less than two years or those who have started new roles within an agency. The indiscriminate firings have led to DOGE terminating people whose jobs are not funded by taxpayers and have begun to anger people across the country who are concerned about a loss of services as well as the impact of federal job losses on local economies. Trump has repeatedly talked about Musk as the functional leader of DOGE, which is not a Cabinet-level department, but the White House said in a court filing earlier this month that Musk had no authority over DOGE and was not an employee of the program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-orders-us-federal-workers-to-describe-what-they-did-at-work-last-week-or-get-fired-/7984891.html	2025-02-22T17:21:48-08:00	
Officer killed after gunman takes hostages at Pennsylvania hospital	YORK, PENNSYLVANIA — A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital's intensive care unit Saturday and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said. Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer was injured in a fall. Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire. 'This is a huge loss to our community,' Barker said at a news conference following the shooting. 'It is absolutely clear, and beyond any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their action using deadly force.' Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for 'a medical purpose involving another individual' and he intentionally targeted the workers there. No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz. The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York Borough Police Department. 'We all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,' West York Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press. Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a 'hero award' in 2021 from Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving enforcement for the state of Colorado. 'I have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do,' his LinkedIn profile said. Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department there said in a statement. At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York Borough Police Department, Linda Shields dropped off roses Saturday and dabbed tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland. 'He was so young,' Shields said of Duarte. 'It makes no sense at all.' Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the attack on police and health care workers 'the act of a coward.' 'Let it not be lost on anyone the act of extraordinary bravery and courage by the health care workers here, by the law enforcement professionals … who ran toward danger to keep people safe,' Shapiro said. UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019 in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York Peppermint Patties in 1940. The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation's most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire’s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child’s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/officer-killed-after-gunman-takes-hostages-at-pennsylvania-hospital/7984890.html	2025-02-22T17:06:18-08:00	
Trump revels in mass federal firings, jeers at Biden before CPAC crowd	OXON HILL, MARYLAND — President Donald Trump said Saturday that 'nobody has ever seen anything' like his administration's sweeping effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of government. Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington, Trump said, 'We're going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come.' The president has spent the opening weeks of his administration arguing that voters in November gave him a mandate to overhaul government while cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border and to extend tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first administration. In a speech that lasted more than an hour, Trump predicted that the Republican Party would defy history, which has shown that a president's party typically struggles during midterm congressional elections. Of Republicans, he said, 'I don't think we've been at this level, maybe ever.' 'Nobody's ever seen anything like this, and nobody's ever seen four weeks like we had,' Trump said, likening his new administration's opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth. Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk to help carry out the firings; Musk vowed Saturday that more might be coming. 'Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,' Musk posted on X, which he owns. 'Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.' Trump also repeatedly said Saturday that he'd carry out harder-line immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed by his administration's mass federal firings. He announced that one agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for International Development, would have its Washington office taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials. 'The agency's name has been removed from its former building,' he said. The president also repeated his previous promises that his administration will scrutinize the country's gold depository at Fort Knox. 'Would anybody like to join us?' he said to cheers from the crowd. 'We want to see if the gold is still there.' 'Donald, don't get angry' But Trump also devoted large parts of his address to last year's presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris — his Election Day opponent. He also mentioned Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who ran for president in 2020. The president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him angry. 'I couldn't stand it,' Trump said, before cautioning himself, 'Donald, don't get angry.' He went on to use an expletive to describe what he thinks of Biden's handling of border security, despite noting that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul language. Trump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying 'I happen to like' him, while adding, 'we've been treated very unfairly by China and many other countries.' President meets with world leaders On the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over Russia's war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and Argentine President Javier Milei, who separately addressed the conference. Trump called Duda 'a fantastic man and a great friend of mine.' He noted that Milei was 'a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.' Duda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending fighting in Ukraine. Those meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is meeting Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a 'dictator' while falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday he acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor. Trump said during his speech, 'I'm dealing with President Zelenskyy. I'm dealing with President Putin' and added of fighting in Ukraine, 'It affects Europe. It doesn't really affect us.' About ending the war in Ukraine, Trump said Saturday, 'I think we're pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal.' Later, the president and first lady Melania Trump were hosting an evening reception and dinner at the White House for the National Governors Association, which was holding their own weekend meetings in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-revels-in-mass-federal-firings-jeers-at-biden-before-cpac-crowd-/7984872.html	2025-02-22T16:37:50-08:00	
6 dead, 78 injured after roof of Peru shopping mall collapses	LIMA, PERU — The collapse of a food court roof at a shopping mall in northwestern Peru killed six people and left at least 78 others injured, the defense minister said Saturday. The heavy iron roof at the Real Plaza Trujillo shopping mall, a city in the La Libertad region, fell Friday night on dozens of people who were at the site. Defense Minister Walter Astudillo said at a news conference that according to the information provided by local firefighters in La Libertad, five people died on site and a sixth at a hospital after the collapse. Astudillo also said that 30 injured people have already been discharged and 48 remain hospitalized. Three remained in critical condition. The minister expressed his condolences to the victims' families. Luis Roncal, head of the local fire department, confirmed that they 'did not find any signs of life' as they monitored with rescue dogs, but said that the search for survivors would continue with more than 100 firefighters and police officers searching through the debris. Dozens of families were in the food court of the shopping mall when the roof collapsed, according to local media reports. The Real Plaza shopping complex in Trujillo, the country's third-largest city, is located about 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of the capital Lima. 'There is a child trapped' under the roof's metal structures, said local government health official Anibal Morillo to broadcaster Panamericana. Interior Minister Juan Jose Santivanez estimated the collapsed roof area was 700 to 800 square meters. 'We need hydraulic cranes to lift part of the roof that has not yet been removed because it is so heavy and to continue rescue operations for those who may be trapped,' the minister told Canal N television channel. According to the Regional Emergency Operations Center, the collapse occurred at 8:41 p.m. local time but was reported about half an hour later. Some information in this report is from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-78-injured-after-roof-of-peru-shopping-mall-collapses/7984708.html	2025-02-22T16:11:18-08:00	
US, Uzbekistan reaffirm commitment to Central Asia security	WASHINGTON — As the Trump administration begins to engage with Central Asia, Uzbekistan has expressed eagerness to expand its strategic partnership, highlighting what it calls its 'enhanced' political dialogue on bilateral and regional issues and security cooperation, including its 'solid connection' with the Mississippi National Guard. The U.S. recently got back its seven Black Hawk helicopters from Uzbekistan that Afghan military pilots had flown there in 2021 while fleeing the Taliban. This transfer and other bilateral exchanges within the last month have underscored Tashkent's role as Washington's key partner in Central Asia, according to U.S. officials. However, analysts see the military relationship as largely transactional and shaped by geopolitical complexities and regional tensions. Talk between diplomats In a phone conversation on February 21 with Uzbek Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated U.S. support for the country's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, according to State Department's spokesperson Tammy Bruce. They discussed a joint effort through the C5+1 diplomatic platform, launched nearly a decade ago between Washington and five Central Asian republics. The Trump administration is interested in using this platform to support 'a more peaceful and prosperous Central Asia.' Saidov described his talk with Rubio as 'candid and productive,' aiming to expand the 'strategic partnership between our nations in all spheres without an exception. Building strong bridges between business communities, increasing trade volume in both directions, ensuring prosperous development in Central Asia.' Cooperation with Pentagon, ties with Mississippi Uzbek Ambassador Furqat Sidikov says his country's forces 'have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Mississippi National Guard in the best ways,' citing joint exercises and Pentagon-sponsored professional exchanges. 'We are a reliable partner of the United States in the region,' Sidikov said at a January 31 embassy reception, pointing to defense reforms and improvements in the Uzbek military's equipment. Mississippi National Guard Adjutant General Major General Bobby Ginn emphasized at the event that since 2012, the partnership has facilitated more than 170 engagements between U.S. and Uzbek soldiers, strengthening disaster response and readiness. 'Uzbekistan's commitment to regional stability and contributions to counterterrorism efforts and border security' demonstrate the power of its armed forced, Ginn said. Davis Florick, the Pentagon's acting principal director for Eurasia, also attending the reception, thanked Tashkent for 'storing' U.S. aircraft and diligently working with the U.S. toward the mutually beneficial solution. He confirmed that the seven Black Hawks were part of a fleet from Afghanistan that, according to multiple sources, included 24 helicopters, among them Mi-17s and UH-60s, and 22 fixed-wing aircraft, most of which were transferred to Uzbekistan last year. Another high-level Pentagon official, Rear Admiral Erin Osborne, speaking at the same gathering, praised Uzbekistan as a 'critical ally' that offered its airspace and an air base during the initial years of the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. The republic was also part of Pentagon's Northern Distribution Network, delivering nonmilitary goods to the international coalition fighting in the neighboring country. Osborne said that mutual trust and understanding were reflected in 'capacity-building initiatives and the sharing of intelligence to counter common threats.' The U.S., she added, is committed to working with Uzbekistan 'to ensure its stability and sovereignty, as well as the stability and sovereignty of the entire Central Asian region.' The Taliban and the Afghanistan factor Even though the transfer of the Black Hawks back to the U.S. was disclosed at the embassy event, Uzbek officials have been tight-lipped about this collaboration to avoid any tension with the Taliban, which has condemned the handovers as an infringement on Afghanistan's sovereignty. The Taliban's Defense Ministry issued a statement denouncing the transfer as 'unacceptable' and demanding the return of the aircraft. Eighteen U.S. aircraft also ended up in Tajikistan in 2021, but Washington and Dushanbe have yet to settle the matter. During a visit to the region in June 2022, U.S. Central Command commander General Michael Kurilla said the aircraft would not be returned to Afghanistan 'because they do not belong to the Taliban … Our hope is to be able to hand over some or all of the aircraft to the Tajik government.' Washington analysts view Uzbekistan as the most active U.S. military partner in the region, comparing it with the activities other republics in Central Asia have with their state partners, specifically Kazakhstan with Arizona, Tajikistan with Virginia, and Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan with Montana. Still, they characterize Tashkent-Washington security relationship as more transactional than strategic. 'The Uzbeks want training and equipment. What do we want from them? A reliable partner in the region,' a former U.S. official with deep experience in Central Asia told VOA. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity for professional reasons. The U.S. has trained Uzbek pilots to operate and maintain the transferred aircraft, but continued congressional funding — amounting to several million dollars — is crucial for sustained cooperation. 'There will be questions from Congress, of course,' the former official said. 'The primary justification so far has been that these assets would help counter extremists from Afghanistan.' Meanwhile, experts in Tashkent support Uzbekistan's cautious approach to the Taliban. As officials have said, Uzbekistan will engage with whoever governs Afghanistan. While it does not officially recognize the Taliban, the administration of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has forged stable diplomatic relations with Kabul, holds significant investment and business agreements with the country, and provides humanitarian aid to the Afghan people. Last summer, Uzbekistan opened a free economic zone in the city of Termez on the border with Afghanistan, inviting neighbors to foster entrepreneurial cooperation. U.S. interests and Central Asian security The U.S. maintains military cooperation agreements with each Central Asian republic, with plans reviewed annually and subject to funding approval. Despite intelligence-sharing efforts, there is no U.S.-Uzbekistan overflight agreement. Tashkent does not allow its territory to be used for strikes on neighboring soil, even against terrorist targets. 'The Trump administration may question this,' said the former U.S. official. 'It complicates the case for cooperation with Uzbekistan because they're centrally located, yet we must fly around them. It's hard to justify what we're getting in return.' For years, the U.S. has also supported regional border security initiatives. 'That's the big program,' the former U.S. official said, but added: 'How many terrorists have we stopped? How many have been disrupted, killed, or captured? Do we have those hard numbers? We are still in the nascent stages of setting up the program.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uzbekistan-reaffirm-commitment-to-central-asia-security/7984698.html	2025-02-22T15:38:35-08:00	
Hundreds of Congolese police join rebels in occupied city	Crowds of Congolese police officers who switched to the M23 rebel group sang and clapped in occupied Bukavu city on Saturday, preparing for retraining under the authority of the rebels who are intent on showing they plan to stick around and govern. The M23 rebels advanced a week ago into eastern Democratic Republic of Congo's second-largest city, which was rocked by looting and unrest as Congolese forces withdrew without a fight. The M23's capture of swaths of eastern Congo and valuable mineral deposits has fanned fears of a wider war and led the United Nations Security Council to demand unanimously Friday that it cease hostilities and withdraw. In Bukavu, there was no sign this call would be heeded. The assembled police, wearing brand new uniforms and black berets, were told they would leave for a few days of training and come back to support the M23 rebels. 'May you come back to us in good shape so that together we can continue to liberate our country,' said Police Commander Jackson Kamba. Around 1,800 police officers have surrendered and were going for retraining with 500 more due to do so, said Lawrence Kanyuka, a spokesperson for the AFC rebel alliance that includes the M23 group. The Congolese government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ongoing crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to escalate, with tensions involving the Congolese government, and the M23 rebel group. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. Several locals expressed skepticism. The M23's arrival in Bukavu 'has paralyzed the entire life of the whole area, even if some activities are resuming in different ways,' said resident Josue Kayeye. 'We cannot applaud anything done by force.' Congolese troops are under pressure on multiple fronts. The town of Minembwe in the mountains of South Kivu and its airfield were captured Friday by a Tutsi militia allegedly allied with the M23, a local official, a military source and a U.N. source said. A few days earlier, its leader, Colonel Makanika, was killed by a Congolese military drone. East African defense chiefs met in Nairobi, Kenya, on Friday to discuss the crisis. An internal report on the meeting, seen by Reuters, showed that the group noted that there was 'no clear picture of the situation on the ground' amid the escalation and M23's occupation of major cities and airports. The group emphasized the need for direct engagement between all parties to the conflict, according to the report. Congo has repeatedly refused to hold talks with M23. The ethnic Tutsi-led M23 is the latest in a string of groups to take up arms in the name of Tutsis in Congo. The M23 and neighboring Rwanda reject allegations from Congo that it is a Rwandan proxy bent on looting the east's reserves of gold and coltan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-congolese-police-join-rebels-in-occupied-city-/7984671.html	2025-02-22T13:49:33-08:00	
Cholera kills 58, sickens 1,300 over 3 days in Sudanese city	CAIRO — A cholera outbreak in a southern Sudanese city killed nearly 60 people and sickened about 1,300 others over the last three days, health authorities said Saturday. The outbreak in the southern city of Kosti was blamed mainly on contaminated drinking water after the city’s water plant stopped due to an attack by a notorious paramilitary group, the Health Ministry said. The group has been fighting the country’s military for about two years. The ministry said in a statement the disease killed 58 people and sickened 1,293 others between Thursday and Saturday. The ministry said it has taken a series of measures to fight the outbreak, including launching a vaccination campaign against cholera in the city. The disease killed more than 600 and sickened over 21,000 others between July and October last year. Cholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and could be fatal if not immediately treated, according to WHO. It’s transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cholera-kills-58-sickens-1-300-over-3-days-in-sudanese-city/7984615.html	2025-02-22T11:06:10-08:00	
1 dead, several police officers wounded in knife attack in France	STRASBOURG, FRANCE — One person died and two police officers were seriously injured in a knife attack in eastern France on Saturday that occurred during a demonstration, the local prosecutor said. Three more officers were lightly wounded in the attack in the city of Mulhouse, carried out by a 37-year-old suspect who is on a terror prevention watchlist, prosecutor Nicolas Heitz told AFP. The list, called FSPRT, compiles data from various authorities on people with the aim of preventing 'terrorist' radicalization. It was launched in 2015 following deadly attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo's offices and on a Jewish supermarket. The suspect attacked local police officers in Mulhouse shouting 'Allahu Akbar' ('God is greatest') Saturday afternoon, France’s national antiterror prosecutors’ unit PNAT said in a statement. A passerby was killed trying to intervene and help police, the prosecutor's office said. One of the seriously wounded police officers sustained an injury to the carotid artery, and the other to the thorax, Heitz said. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was expected to travel to the scene of the attack later Saturday. Police established a security parameter after the attack, which happened shortly before 4 p.m. local time during a demonstration in support of Congo. According to union sources, the suspect, born in Algeria, has been under judicial supervision and house arrest, and under an expulsion order from France. 'Horror has seized our city,' Mulhouse Mayor Michele Lutz said on Facebook. The incident was being investigated as a terror attack, she said, but 'this must obviously still be confirmed by the judiciary.' French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday that the deadly knife attack was 'Islamist terrorism,' after France's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office confirmed it was investigating the case. 'It is without any doubt an act of Islamist terrorism,' Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the annual French farm show, adding that the interior minister was on his way to Mulhouse. The suspect has been arrested, the prosecutor's office said.

Sudan's RSF, allied groups to sign charter to form parallel government	Sudan's Rapid Support Forces will sign a charter with allied political and armed groups on Saturday evening to establish a 'government of peace and unity' in territories it controls, signatories al-Hadi Idris and Ibrahim Mirghani told Reuters. The RSF has seized most of the western Darfur region and swathes of the Kordofan region in an almost-two-year war, but it is being pushed back from central Sudan by the Sudanese army, which has condemned the formation of a parallel government. Such a government, which already has drawn an expression of concern from the United Nations, is not expected to receive widespread recognition. Those affiliated with the government say its formation will be announced from inside the country. General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the paramilitary that has been accused of widespread abuses including genocide, was hit with sanctions by the United States earlier this year. The war, which erupted after disagreements between the RSF and the army over their integration during a transition toward democracy, has devastated the country, driving half the population into hunger. According to Idris, among the signatories to the charter and foundational constitution is powerful rebel leader Abdelaziz al-Hilu, who controls vast swathes of territory and troops in South Kordofan state and has long demanded that Sudan embrace secularism. Talks that began earlier this week were hosted in Kenya, drawing condemnation from Sudan and domestic criticism of Kenyan President William Ruto for plunging the country into a diplomatic melee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-rsf-allied-groups-to-sign-charter-to-form-parallel-government/7984593.html	2025-02-22T10:27:02-08:00	
New polio vaccination drive begins in Gaza	JABALIA, GAZA STRIP — A third mass polio vaccination campaign began in Gaza on Saturday, AFP journalists reported, with the aim of delivering the first dose to nearly 600,000 children across the Palestinian territory. Scores of children under the age of 10 received the dose at a mosque in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, where a blistering Israeli military assault last year reduced many buildings to rubble. The vaccination campaign involves multiple U.N. agencies, including the Israeli-boycotted U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees, or UNRWA, and comes at a time when Israel and Hamas are observing a ceasefire that has largely halted the fighting. The United States, United Kingdom and other Western nations designate Hamas as a terror group. The World Health Organization said the campaign aims to vaccinate more than 591,000 children by Feb. 26. 'Over 1,700 UNRWA team members will take part in this campaign,' UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X. 'This campaign follows a recent detection of polio in wastewater, putting the lives of children at risk.' The previous two drives were conducted in late 2024 after the highly contagious disease resurfaced in Gaza for the first time in over 20 years. After more than 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire. Even before the hostilities began, the territory had been struggling under an Israeli-imposed blockade for more than 15 years. Much of the water infrastructure has been destroyed, leaving sewage to stagnate in open pools near densely populated neighborhoods — conditions that contributed to the reemergence of the virus last autumn. The WHO reported on Feb. 19 that traces of poliovirus had again been detected in wastewater samples. Polio is highly contagious and can cause paralysis, primarily affecting children under the age of 5. The disease has been nearly eradicated worldwide. Hoping for a lasting truce, Bassam al-Haou, a resident of Jabalia, brought his daughters to receive the vaccine. 'I also hope for stability for our innocent children so they can remain safe from violence,' he told AFP. The war erupted following Hamas's unprecedented terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. A fragile ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-polio-vaccination-drive-begins-in-gaza/7984585.html	2025-02-22T10:15:59-08:00	
Malian army investigates deaths of civilians blamed on soldiers, Wagner group	BAMAKO, MALI — Mali's army said it is investigating soldiers who were accused by separatist Tuareg rebels of killing at least 24 civilians earlier this week. It is a rare probe of human rights abuses since the military took power in 2020. The Front for the Liberation of Azawad, the Tuareg independence movement in the north of the country, accused soldiers and Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group of intercepting two civilian transport vehicles bound for Algeria from Gao on Monday, and 'coldly executing' at least 24 people among the passengers. The general staff of the Malian armed forces, without referring to the killings, denounced the 'intoxicating campaigns' against the army Wednesday. On Friday, the authorities announced the opening of an investigation into the civilian deaths. Analysts say it's unlikely the investigation would fault the troops or the Russian mercenaries. 'The objective of the investigations is going to be more about countering the allegations against [the army] and Wagner, rather than trying to find any wrongdoing by the latter. The conclusion of the investigation is likely to say that those allegations are false,' said Rida Lyammouri, senior fellow at Policy Center for the New South, a Moroccan think tank. Mali has been in a crisis for more than a decade. In 2020, a military group, riding on popular discontent over attacks by armed jihadi groups, seized power in a coup that toppled the democratically elected president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malian-army-investigates-deaths-of-civilians-blamed-on-soldiers-wagner-group/7984534.html	2025-02-22T09:09:10-08:00	
France says gangster ‘The Fly’ was arrested in Romania	PARIS — Mohamed Amra, a French fugitive known as 'The Fly,' who was freed by gunmen in a brazen attack against a prison van in May, was arrested in Romania on Saturday, the French interior minister said. French police had launched a massive manhunt for the fugitive, whose escape resulted in the deaths of two prison guards and was seized upon by right-wing politicians as evidence that France had lost its grip on drug crime. Three officers were wounded in the attack, which was caught on CCTV and shocked France because of its extraordinary violence. France had tasked more than 300 investigators with finding Amra and had requested an Interpol red notice, hoping for foreign assistance. 'I congratulate all forces which made Mohamed Amra’s arrest in Romania today possible. A warm thank you to Romania for its decisive cooperation,' Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on X. Amra is a 30-year-old from northern France, according to the Paris prosecutor’s office. Police sources said he was involved in drug trafficking and accused of being a major drugs gangland figure. Amra has a long history of convictions for violent crimes that started when he was 15. He was also suspected of ordering hits while in prison. At the time of his escape, Amra was facing two fresh charges, one for attempted murder and another for participation in a gangland killing in the southern city of Marseille on the French Riviera, a hub for drug trafficking and gang violence. But despite the government labelling him 'public enemy number one,' and the deployment of massive means, Amra was not captured as quickly as the authorities had hoped. The Paris prosecutor’s office said he had been convicted of burglary by a court in Evreux on May 10 and was being held at the Val de Reuil prison until his escape on May 14. He had also been indicted by prosecutors in Marseille for a kidnapping that led to a death, it said. On Saturday, the government reacted with relief that the chase was over. 'After a manhunt lasting several months, Amra has been arrested, finally!' Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said on X. President Emmanuel Macron hailed Amra’s capture as 'a formidable success.' Some information in this report is from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-says-gangster-the-fly-was-arrested-in-romania/7984518.html	2025-02-22T08:47:51-08:00	
On eve of elections, Germany faces changing world situation	BERLIN — German politicians made a final scramble for votes Saturday on the eve of key elections in which conservatives hope to win despite the dramatic rise of the far right. Sunday's vote comes at a time of upheaval for Europe and its biggest economy as U.S. President Donald Trump has ended a united Western stance on the Ukraine conflict by reaching out to Russia. Trump's threats of a trade war spell more trouble ahead for Germany, after its economy has shrunk for the past two years, and as it also faces bitter social polarization on the flashpoint issues of immigration and security. Sunday's vote is being held more than half a year ahead of schedule after center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition collapsed in early November. The conservative CDU-CSU alliance, led by Friedrich Merz, has long had a strong lead in opinion polls at around 30%, double that of Scholz's SPD. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has been polling in second place at around 20%, boosted by anger over a spate of deadly knife attacks and car rammings blamed on migrants. Just 10 days before the election, an Afghan man was arrested for ploughing a car through a street rally in Munich, killing a 2-year-old child and her mother and wounding dozens. Germany was again shocked by a stabbing that badly wounded a 30-year-old Spanish man at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial on Friday, although police have not yet spoken about the suspected motive. Two major problems The AfD has had strong support from Trump's inner circle, with tech billionaire Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance speaking out in support of the party. With domestic tensions running high, two far-right demonstrations as well as a counter protest are expected to draw crowds in Berlin on Saturday. In a final TV debate with Scholz on Wednesday, the CDU's Merz called on Germans to give him a strong mandate to 'solve the country's two major problems: migration and the economy.' On Saturday afternoon, Merz will hold a final election rally in Munich alongside Markus Soeder, leader of the CSU, the CDU's sister party in the southern state of Bavaria. Scholz, speaking at his final campaign rally in Dortmund on Friday, stressed his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and defended Germany's commitment to free speech in a pushback against recent comments Vance made in a blistering speech at the Munich Security Conference. Scholz pledged that 'we won't leave Ukraine alone and decide things over their heads, and we will ensure that Ukraine is a country that can choose its own government.' Coalition complications Stephanus Remmert, an SPD supporter at Friday's rally, said he was 'still hopeful' about the election but regretted that some social, climate and economic issues had gotten short shrift during the campaign. 'I hope we don't slide too far to the right and that we can form a strong counterweight to America,' he said. In Berlin, 28-year-old Jonathan Winkler, a video editor, said he was planning to vote for the conservatives despite 'not being a big fan of Merz.' If the polls are correct, Merz will win but then need the support of at least one and possibly two other parties to form a government. The conservative leader has ruled out forming a ruling alliance with the AfD, which leaves his two most likely partners as the SPD and the Greens — who are polling at around 15% and 13% respectively. This would force them into a lengthy negotiating process to rebuild trust after a heated election campaign in which they clashed on migration and how to deal with the AfD, but also on fiscal policy questions. 'Forming a coalition is likely to be very difficult indeed,' said Jacob Ross, a researcher at the German Council on Foreign Relations. 'Nevertheless, it would be in Germany's interest to have people in place in Berlin who are capable of acting as quickly as possible.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-eve-of-elections-germany-faces-changing-world-situation/7984491.html	2025-02-22T08:19:00-08:00	
Trump urges Musk to be more aggressive in bid to shrink US government	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday urged billionaire Elon Musk to be more aggressive in his efforts to shrink the federal government despite the uproar over layoffs and deep spending cuts. 'Elon is doing a great job, but I would like to see him get more aggressive,' Trump posted all in uppercase letters on his Truth Social platform. 'Remember, we have a country to save, but ultimately, to make greater than ever before. MAGA!' Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — an entity created by Trump — has swept across federal government agencies, firing tens of thousands of federal government workers, from scientists to park rangers, mostly those on probation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-urges-musk-to-be-more-aggressive-in-bid-to-shrink-us-government/7984399.html	2025-02-22T06:16:03-08:00	
Pope’s doctors say sepsis could threaten his fight against pneumonia	ROME — The Vatican carried on with its Holy Year celebrations without the pope Saturday, as Pope Francis battled pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection that doctors say remains touch-and-go and will keep him hospitalized for at least another week. Francis slept well overnight, Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said in a brief early update Saturday. But doctors have warned that the main threat facing the 88-year-old Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope’s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope’s condition. 'He is not out of danger,' said his personal physician, Dr. Luigi Carbone. 'So, like all fragile patients, I say they are always on the golden scale: In other words, it takes very little to become unbalanced.' Francis, who has chronic lung disease, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed 'absolute rest' and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Carbone, who along with Francis' personal nurse, Massimiliano Strappetti, organized care for him at the Vatican, acknowledged he had insisted on staying at the Vatican to work even after he was sick 'because of institutional and private commitments.' He was cared for by a cardiologist and infectious specialist in addition to his personal medical team before being hospitalized. Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Rome’s Gemelli hospital, said the biggest threat facing Francis was that some of the germs that are currently located in his respiratory system pass into the bloodstream, causing sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and death. 'Sepsis, with his respiratory problems and his age, would be really difficult to get out of,' Alfieri told a press conference Friday at Gemelli. 'The English say, ‘knock on wood,’ we say ‘touch iron.’ Everyone touch what they want,' he said as he tapped the microphone. 'But this is the real risk in these cases: that these germs pass to the bloodstream.' 'He knows he's in danger,' Alfieri said. 'And he told us to relay that.' Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Jubilee weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood. In his place, the Holy Year organizer will celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second weekend in a row, Francis was expected to skip his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it. 'Look, even though he's not [physically] here, we know he's here,' said Luis Arnaldo Lopez Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. 'He's recovering, but he's in our hearts and is accompanying us because our prayers and his go together.' Beyond that, doctors have said that Francis' recovery will take time and that, regardless, he will have to live with his chronic respiratory problems back at the Vatican. 'He has to get over this infection, and we all hope he gets over it,' said Alfieri. 'But the fact is, all doors are open.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-s-doctors-say-sepsis-could-threaten-his-fight-against-pneumonia/7984382.html	2025-02-22T05:39:00-08:00	
Trump-Putin summit preparations are underway, Russia says	Preparations are underway for a face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin, Russia's deputy foreign minister said Saturday, marking a dramatic shift away from Western isolation of Moscow over its war in Ukraine. Speaking to Russian state media, Sergei Ryabkov said a possible Putin-Trump summit could involve broad talks on global issues, not just the war in Ukraine. 'The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations between our countries, finding ways to resolve the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them,' he said. But he said that efforts to organize such a meeting are at an early stage, and that making it happen will require 'the most intensive preparatory work.' Ryabkov said that U.S. and Russian envoys could meet 'within the next two weeks' to pave the way for further talks between senior officials. Russian and U.S. representatives on Tuesday agreed to start working toward ending the war in Ukraine and improving their diplomatic and economic ties, according to the two countries’ top diplomats, at a high-level meeting in Saudi Arabia that marked an extraordinary about-face in U.S. foreign policy under Trump. After the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the AP that the two sides agreed broadly to pursue three goals: to restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow; to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks; and to explore closer relations and economic cooperation. He stressed, however, that the talks — which were attended by his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian and U.S. officials — marked the beginning of a conversation, and that more work needs to be done. Lavrov, for his part, hailed the meeting as 'very useful.' No Ukrainian officials were present at the meeting, which came as the beleaguered country is slowly but steadily losing ground against more-numerous Russian troops, three years after Moscow launched an all-out invasion of its smaller neighbor. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not accept any outcome from the talks since Kyiv didn’t take part, and he postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for last Wednesday. European allies also have expressed concerns they are being sidelined.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-putin-summit-preparations-are-underway-russia-says/7984365.html	2025-02-22T05:22:44-08:00	
Vietnam’s railway drive raises risk of mismanagement, debt traps, analysts say	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — Analysts are pointing to management and funding issues for Vietnam’s planned north-south, high-speed rail initiative and express concerns over potential 'debt traps' and growing Chinese influence as Beijing funds a railway connecting the two countries. The comments come as Vietnam is expanding its infrastructure by building railways using Chinese and Vietnamese funding, projects that could help the country’s outlook in the long term. As part of the effort, Vietnam’s National Assembly on Feb. 19 gave near-unanimous approval to legislation allowing the country to use Chinese loans for a new $8.3 billion rail link from the port city of Haiphong to China. Nguyen Hong Minh, then the transport minister, announced Vietnam’s plans to use the Chinese loans for the 391-kilometer passenger and freight line from Lao Cai on the Chinese border and passing through Hanoi. 'Vietnam's current railway system is outdated, and the country needs a new system to support its economic development,' Minh, now the construction minister, said, adding that construction is expected to begin this year and be completed by 2030. The National Assembly vote followed its November approval of construction of a high-speed railway connecting Hanoi to the country's southern economic hub, Ho Chi Minh City. That project is Vietnam's most ambitious infrastructure initiative to date and is projected to cost Vietnam $67 billion. Authorities said construction should begin in 2027 and be completed by 2035. Ha Hoang Hop, chair of the Hanoi-based Think Tank Viet Know, told VOA on Feb. 17 that while both projects could modernize the country's transport network and improve its economy, 'public sentiment is cautious.' 'There have been several publicly funded railway and infrastructure projects in Vietnam that have led to public frustration due to delays, cost overruns and poor-quality outcomes,' Hop said. 'Public skepticism is also fueled by fears of debt traps associated with Chinese loans,' he said. Hop cited fear the construction of the high-speed rail project could be dogged by the country's 'historical issues with project management and corruption.' 'There is indeed concern that the north-south, high-speed rail could face similar challenges given the scale and complexity of the project,' Hop said. Mismanagement and corruption Albert Tan, associate professor at the Asian Institute of Management in Manila, told VOA on Feb. 18 that while Vietnam's railway modernization will improve the country's supply chain efficiency, the major problem is corruption. 'The corruption level in Vietnam is so high that when you have that amount of money that the Chinese are pumping in, I'm sure there will always be leakages,' he said. Tan said railway funds ending up in 'someone's pocket' have caused delays and cost overruns for Vietnam's two city Metro lines. In 2021, the Chinese-funded Cat Linh-Ha Dong Metro line began running in Hanoi, five years behind its originally planned opening. The first line of the Ho Chi Minh City Metro, primarily funded by Japan, opened in December 2024, six years behind schedule. Costs ballooned for both Metro lines while under construction and delayed payments to contractors slowed the process. 'Somehow the money doesn't go back to the contractor. Money goes somewhere to other stakeholders,' Tan said. For the north-south, high-speed rail, Hop said the country is planning to rely on domestic funding with capital likely to come in the form of 'government bonds, public investment and possibly some low-interest loans.' 'A $67 billion project will still be a significant challenge requiring careful financial management,' Hop said. Chinese influence Hanoi's decision to pursue domestic funding for its high-speed rail shows the country's drive to 'maintain strategic autonomy,' Hop said. As it looks to Chinese loans for another rail project, though, 'there remains a significant portion of the populace wary of increasing economic dependency on China,' he added. Tran Anh Quan, a Vietnamese social activist currently living in exile, told VOA on Feb. 18 he fears the Chinese-funded railway will leave Hanoi indebted to Beijing and could be a weak point if conflict were to break out between the countries. 'This is definitely a debt trap,' he said. 'Expanding the railway to China would be very dangerous if China attacked Vietnam.' Tan also shared concerns over the 'one-way' flow of money. He said the Chinese loans are likely to be paid to Chinese firms that will 'retain control over construction and maintenance, with little technology transfer to local engineers.' Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, told VOA that Chinese influence in the region is already 'massive.' He said Chinese funding for the Vietnamese railway is in line with Beijing's goal to expand its influence in Southeast Asia. The railway 'fits right into China’s efforts to link the Mekong region, and to connect them to China,' he wrote in an email. Kurlantzick said that in Vietnam's delicate balancing act between Washington and Beijing, China is taking the upper hand as he sees U.S. influence waning with the withdrawal of funding to Vietnam through USAID and weakening public diplomacy more broadly. 'China is by far the dominant economic power in Southeast Asia already, increasingly the dominant security power, and now, with the U.S. giving up its soft power in the region, China will increasingly bolster its soft power in the region, too, making it even more dominant,' Kurlantzick said. Minh Son To, a research assistant focused on Vietnamese and Chinese politics at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, told VOA February 20 Hanoi has looked to Laos with concern after a China-funded high-speed rail threw the country into an 'existential debt crisis.' Still, he said many are eager to see Vietnam develop. 'Any 'China' label is bound to evoke some concern, though I wouldn't overstate that,' he told VOA. 'Vietnamese know that they need development and infrastructure, regardless of where it comes from.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-railway-drive-raises-risk-of-mismanagement-debt-traps-analysts-say/7984359.html	2025-02-22T05:07:53-08:00	
As war rages, Ukraine’s politicians circle presidential ‘electric chair’	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been branded 'a dictator without elections,' but rivals are already circling for his job as expectations mount of a vote later this year. U.S. President Donald Trump’s broadside at Zelenskyy hit a sensitive spot. Presidential elections in Ukraine should have been held in March or April 2024. But they were not — due to Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukraine’s constitution bars elections during martial law, which was imposed by Kyiv just a day after the Kremlin launched its all-out war in February 2022. There are also major security concerns. Packed polling stations would make tempting targets for a Russian military that has repeatedly struck civilian targets, including schools, hospitals and apartment buildings. RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service found people in Kyiv opposed to the idea when it spoke to them on Feb. 20. 'We have Russian-occupied territory where people will not be able to vote and will not be able to make their own choice,' said one woman. 'Who can run a campaign in a time of war?' said another voter. The same day, some 130 Ukrainian civic groups issued a joint statement declaring the impossibility of holding elections under current circumstances. 'Only after the end of the war and the achievement of a stable peace … will it be possible to organize elections freely, fairly, democratically, and accessibly,' they wrote. Nevertheless, presidential hopefuls are already making what appear to be their first cautious moves. There’s expectation in the air that some kind of ceasefire or peace deal will emerge this year, making elections possible within a matter of months. Former President Petro Poroshenko has even given a date, Oct. 26, which he says was revealed by insiders in Zelenskyy’s office and which would coincide with other elections. 'According to the constitution, there should be parliamentary elections at the end of the year. Although they should have taken place two years ago. And at the end of October, we should have had local elections,' he said. Zelenskyy’s party denied any plans for Oct. 26. The president has said elections could take place this year if martial law is lifted — something that would be possible after a deal to stop the fighting. Pro-Russian figures have also started getting active. Yuriy Boyko, who came in fourth in the 2019 election, launched a TikTok campaign in December that echoed Kremlin talking points and earned him an invitation for questioning from Ukraine's Security Service. Sergey Lagondinsky, a member of the European Parliament for Germany’s Green Party who grew up in Russia in Soviet times, wrote recently: 'Putin hates Zelenskyy because he ruined his plans to subjugate Ukraine. And he dreams of getting a pro-Russian candidate after a grueling war.' But many analysts believe the aim of getting a pro-Kremlin puppet elected has little chance after three years of war in which Russian forces have killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. Still, when the election does come, it could be brutal. 'Everyone will be accusing each other of being at fault at the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion,' said Oleh Saakyan, co-founder of the National Platform for Resilience and Cohesion, a civic group. Speaking to Current Time, he predicted a battle of 'veterans against veterans, soldiers against soldiers.' 'The president’s seat right now is an electric chair,' he said. Zelenskyy’s hottest potential challenger has not made any public moves. In fact, he’s not even said he wants to run. Yet former army commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhniy is widely regarded as waiting in the wings from his current position as Ukraine’s ambassador in London. Opinion pollsters are already asking the public what they think — and Zaluzhniy has been coming out on top. But a lot can happen between now and any future polling day. Much will depend on what kind of diplomatic deal is struck, if any, to silence the guns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-war-rages-ukraine-s-politicians-circle-presidential-electric-chair-/7984328.html	2025-02-22T03:59:40-08:00	
2 more Israeli hostages released in Gaza following return of Bibas remains	Two more Israeli hostages were released Saturday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees as part of a ceasefire deal as a body returned from Gaza Friday was confirmed to be that of hostage Shiri Bibas. Tal Shoham, 40, who was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, and Avera Mengistu, 39, who crossed over into Gaza on his own around a decade ago, were handed over to the Red Cross early Saturday in the Gaza city of Rafah. Hundreds of people, including Hamas fighters carrying automatic weapons and wearing military fatigues, balaclavas and Hamas headbands, stood in a rain-soaked square in Rafah as the handover took place. In Tel Aviv, Israelis waving flags and carrying placards with pictures of the hostages watched the release via video and cheered as the two men were paraded on a makeshift stage surrounded by masked armed Hamas fighters. Four other hostages were due to be released later Saturday. Eliya Cohen, 27; Omer Shem Tov, 22; and Omer Wenkert, 23, were taken from a music festival during the Oct. 7, attack. Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, has been held since crossing into the Gaza Strip under unexplained circumstances around a decade ago. The six Israelis are expected to be the last living hostages to be freed during the first phase of the ceasefire. In exchange, Israel is set to release more than 600 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. Saturday’s hostage release followed the return late Friday of the remains of Shiri Bibas. Her body was supposed to be among three others, including two of her children, handed over by Hamas on Thursday. But the Israeli military said the female body was not hers, prompting a warning by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Hamas will 'pay the price' for failing to release Bibas’ remains as prescribed by the peace agreement with Israel. In a video statement, Netanyahu said, 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages — both living and dead — and ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement.' A statement released late Friday by the Bibas family said forensic analysis confirmed Shiri Babas’ remains. 'Last night, our Shiri was returned home,' the family said. Hamas said Bibas' remains appeared to have been mixed up with other human remains taken from rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit the place she was held. Israeli officials said forensic evidence indicated Shiri Bibas and her children were killed by Palestinian militants. Israel and Hamas are in the first phase of a ceasefire that began on Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. Hamas killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel and took about 250 people as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-israeli-hostages-released-in-gaza-following-return-of-bibas-remains/7984302.html	2025-02-22T00:54:26-08:00	
Sri Lanka's first elephant orphanage marks golden jubilee	PINNAWALA, SRI LANKA — Sri Lanka's main elephant orphanage marked its 50th anniversary Sunday with a feast of fruit for the 68 jumbos at the showpiece center, reputedly the world's first care home for destitute pachyderms. The Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage lavished pineapples, bananas, melons and cucumbers on its residents to celebrate the anniversary of their home, which is a major tourist attraction. A few officials and tourists invited to the low-key celebration were served milk rice and traditional sweets while four generations of elephants born in captivity frolicked in the nearby Maha Oya river. 'The first birth at this orphanage was in 1984, and since then there have been a total of 76,' said chief curator Sanjaya Ratnayake, as the elephants returned from their daily river bath. 'This has been a successful breeding program, and today we have four generations of elephants here, with the youngest 18 months old and the oldest 70 years,' he told AFP. The orphanage recorded its first twin birth in August 2021 — a rarity among Asian elephants — and both calves are doing well. Two years before the orphanage was formally established as a government institution in February 1975, five orphaned elephants were cared for at a smaller facility in the southern resort town of Bentota. 'Since the orphanage was set up at Pinnawala in 1975, in a coconut grove, the animals have had more space to roam, with good weather and plenty of food available in the surrounding area,' Ratnayake said. The home requires 14,500 kilos of coconut and palm tree leaves, along with other foliage, to satisfy the elephants' voracious appetites. It also buys tons of fruit and milk for the younger calves, who are adored by the foreign and local visitors to the orphanage, located about 90 kilometers (56 miles) east of the capital Colombo. It is also a major revenue generator for the state, earning millions of dollars a year in entrance fees. Visitors can watch the elephants from a distance or get up close and help scrub them during bath times. Tragic toll The facility lacked running water and electricity at its inception but things improved as it gained international fame in subsequent years, said retired senior mahout K.G. Sumanabanda, 65. 'I was also fortunate to be present when we had the first birth in captivity,' Sumanabanda told AFP, visiting the home for the jubilee celebrations. During his career spanning over three decades as a traditional elephant keeper, he trained more than 60 other mahouts and is still consulted by temples and individuals who own domesticated elephants. Twenty years ago, Sri Lankan authorities opened another elephant home in the south of the island to care for orphaned, abandoned or injured elephants and later return them back to the wild. While Pinnawala is seen by many as a success, Sri Lanka is also facing a major human-elephant conflict in areas bordering traditional wildlife sanctuaries. Deputy Minister of Environment Anton Jayakody told AFP on Sunday that 450 elephants and 150 people were killed in clashes in 2023, continuing an alarming trend of fatalities in the human-elephant conflict. The previous year saw 433 elephants and 145 people killed. Killing or harming elephants is a criminal offence in Sri Lanka, which has an estimated 7,000 wild elephants and where jumbos are considered a national treasure, partly due to their significance in Buddhist culture. But the massacre continues as desperate farmers face the brunt of elephants raiding their crops and destroying livelihoods. The minister was confident the new government could tackle the problem by preventing elephants from crossing into villages. 'We are planning to introduce multiple barriers — these may include electric fences, trenches, or other deterrents — to make it more difficult for wild elephants to stray into villages,' Jayakody told AFP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-feast-of-fruit-as-sri-lanka-s-first-elephant-orphanage-marks-golden-jubilee-/7982865.html	2025-02-22T00:30:27-08:00	
Ancient deity, pet, endangered species: Axolotl is Mexico's most beloved amphibian	MEXICO CITY — Legend has it the axolotl was not always an amphibian. Long before it became Mexico's most beloved salamander and efforts to prevent its extinction flourished, it was a sneaky god. 'It's an interesting little animal,' said Yanet Cruz, head of the Chinampaxochitl Museum in Mexico City. Its exhibitions focus on the axolotl and chinampas, the pre-Hispanic agricultural systems resembling floating gardens that still function in Xochimilco, a neighborhood on Mexico City's outskirts famed for its canals. 'Despite there being many varieties, the axolotl from the area is a symbol of identity for the native people,' said Cruz, who participated in activities hosted at the museum to celebrate 'Axolotl Day' in early February. While there are no official estimates of the current axolotl population, the species Ambystoma mexicanum — endemic to central Mexico — has been listed as 'critically endangered' by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 2019. And though biologists, historians and officials have led efforts to save the species and its habitat from extinction, a parallel, unexpected preservation phenomenon has emerged. Axolotl, which is also the plural form, attracted international attention after Minecraft added them to its game in 2021 and Mexicans went crazy about them that same year, following the Central Bank's initiative to print it on the 50-peso bill. 'That's when the 'axolotlmania' thrived,' Cruz said. All over Mexico, the peculiar, dragonlike amphibian can be spotted in murals, crafts and socks. Selected bakeries have caused a sensation with axolotl-like bites. Even a local brewery — 'Ajolote' in Spanish — took its name from the salamander to honor Mexican traditions. Before the Spaniards conquered Mexico-Tenochtitlan in the 16th century, axolotl may not have had archeological representations as did Tlaloc — god of rain in the Aztec worldview — or Coyolxauhqui — its lunar goddess — but it did appear in ancient Mesoamerican documents. In the Nahua myth of the Fifth Sun, pre-Hispanic god Nanahuatzin threw himself into a fire, reemerged as the sun and commanded fellow gods to replicate his sacrifice to bring movement to the world. All complied but Xolotl, a deity associated with the evening star, who fled. 'He was hunted down and killed,' said Arturo Montero, archaeologist of the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas. 'And from his death came a creature: axolotl.' According to Montero, the myth implies that, after a god's passing, its essence gets imprisoned in a mundane creature, subject to the cycles of life and death. Axolotl then carries within itself the Xolotl deity, and when the animal dies and its divine substance transits to the underworld, it later resurfaces to the earth and a new axolotl is born. 'Axolotl is the twin of maize, agave and water,' Montero said. Current fascination toward the axolotl and its rise to sacred status in pre-Hispanic times is hardly a coincidence. It was most likely sparked by its exceptional biological features, Montero said. Through the glass of a fish tank, where academic institutions preserve them and hatcheries put them up for sale, axolotl are hard to spot. Their skin is usually dark to mimic stones — though an albino, pinkish variety can be bred — and they can stay still for hours, buried in the muddy ground of their natural habitats or barely moving at the bottom of their tanks in captivity. Aside from their lungs, they breathe through their gills and skin, which allows them to adapt to their aquatic environment. And they can regenerate parts of its heart, spinal cord and brain. 'This species is quite peculiar,' said biologist Arturo Vergara, who supervises axolotl preservation efforts in various institutions and cares after specimens for sale at a hatchery in Mexico City. Depending on the species, color and size, the axolotl's prices at Ambystomania — where Vergara works — start at 200 pesos ($10 US). Specimens are available for sale when they reach 4 inches in length and are easy pets to look after, Vergara said. 'While they regularly have a 15-year life span [in captivity], we've had animals that have lived up to 20,' he added. 'They are very long-lived, though in their natural habitat they probably wouldn't last more than three or four years.' The species on display at the museum — one of 17 known varieties in Mexico — is endemic to lakes and canals that are currently polluted. A healthy population of axolotl would likely struggle to feed or reproduce. 'Just imagine the bottom of a canal in areas like Xochimilco, Tlahuac, Chalco, where there's an enormous quantity of microbes,' Vergara said. Under ideal conditions, an axolotl could heal itself from a snake or heron bite and survive the dry season buried in the mud. But a proper aquatic environment is needed for that to happen. 'Efforts to preserve axolotl go hand in hand with preserving the chinampas,' Cruz said at the museum, next to a display featuring salamander-shaped dolls. 'We work closely with the community to convince them that this is an important space.' In addition to being places where axolotl lay eggs, chinampas are areas where pre-Hispanic communities grew maize, chili, beans and zucchini, and some of Xochimilco's current population grow vegetables despite environmental threats. 'Many chinampas are dry and don't produce food anymore,' Cruz said. 'And where some chinampas used to be, one can now see soccer camps.' For her, like for Vergara, preserving the axolotl is not an end, but a means for saving the place where the amphibian came to be. 'This great system [chinampas] is all that's left from the lake city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, so I always tell our visitors that Xochimilco is a living archaeological zone,' Cruz said. 'If we, as citizens, don't take care of what's ours, it will be lost.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ancient-deity-pet-endangered-species-axolotl-is-mexico-s-most-beloved-amphibian-/7982877.html	2025-02-22T00:29:39-08:00

Amid rising worldwide populism, America's premier conservative conference goes global	WASHINGTON — This week, thousands of conservative politicians, activists and influencers convened outside Washington for the Conservative Political Action Conference, the premier annual gathering of the American right. The four-day event, hosted by the American Conservative Union since 1974, features U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, among other high-profile speakers from around the world. Dubbed the 'Woodstock for conservatives,' CPAC was once the go-to event for conservative Republicans and presidential hopefuls, with its presidential straw poll serving as a barometer of grassroots support. However, Trump's political rise in recent years has transformed it into a platform for populism. Driven by the rise of populist movements globally, the conference has ventured overseas in the past decade. It launched its first international conference in Japan in 2017, expanded to Australia, Brazil and South Korea in 2019, then added Hungary, Mexico and Israel in 2022. Argentina joined the fold last year following the election of populist President Javier Milei. The international conferences, CPAC says, serve to 'unite conservatives from all over the world, strengthen the movement, and challenge globalism.' They are also used for public outreach, recruitment and mobilization, according to a recent paper on CPAC by Grant A. Silverman, a research assistant at George Washington University in Washington. CPAC's growing international outreach mirrors a recent surge in far-right populism worldwide. Last year's foreign speakers included Presidents Nayib Bukele of El Salvador and Javier Milei of Argentina, as well as Prime Minister Victor Orbán of Hungary. Here's a look at some of the foreign speakers for this year's CPAC and what they're saying: Javier Milei, Argentine president Milei, wielding a chain saw, electrified the CPAC crowd Thursday when he shared the stage with billionaire Elon Musk and presented Musk, Trump's cost-cutting czar, with his signature campaign prop. 'This is the chain saw of bureaucracy,' Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, shouted, waving the tool. As head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk, who made his first CPAC appearance, is spearheading the Trump administration's massive governmentwide cost-cutting efforts. This marks Milei's third CPAC appearance. The self-styled 'anarcho-capitalist' campaigned in 2023 on shrinking Argentina's government, often brandishing a chain saw at rallies. At last year's Washington conference, he vowed to eliminate unnecessary government agencies, declaring, 'We will not surrender until we make Argentina great again!' Speaking at CPAC Argentina in December, Milei declared that the 'new winds of freedom are sweeping through the world' and called on allies to fight against 'lefties.' 'We must stand together, establishing channels of cooperation throughout the world,' he told the crowd. Jair Bolsonaro, former president of Brazil Brazil's former right-wing president is a CPAC regular. After Bolsonaro lost a reelection bid in 2022, his supporters stormed federal government buildings in an alleged attempt to seize power. Banned from seeking office until 2030, Bolsonaro faces charges of plotting a coup. His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, organizes CPAC Brazil. At last year's conference in Balneario Camboriu, the elder Bolsonaro joined Milei and other right-wing politicians from Latin America to hail conservatism's global rise and expressed hope for Trump's return to office. For his part, Milei used the platform to denounce socialism, saying it restricts liberties and breeds corruption. Robert Fico, prime minister of Slovakia Robert Fico makes his CPAC debut this year. Though he leads a left-wing populist party, he has drawn controversy for his attacks on journalists, immigrants and LGBTQ+ people. In October, he called journalists 'bloody bastards' and threatened new media restrictions. An opponent of same-sex marriage, he has called adoption by gay couples a 'perversion.' During the Ukraine conflict, Fico has opposed European sanctions on Moscow and echoed Moscow's messaging, drawing comparisons to Hungary's pro-Kremlin prime minister. In May, he survived an assassination attempt by a gunman opposed to his stance against military assistance to Ukraine. Mateusz Morawiecki, former Polish prime minister After speaking at CPAC Hungary last year, Morawiecki makes his first U.S. appearance this year. He served as prime minister from 2017 to 2023 and is now a leading figure in the opposition Law and Justice Party. Despite his party's strong support for Ukraine, Morawiecki maintains close ties with Hungary's Orban and Spain's Santiago Abascal, leader of the conservative Vox political party. Abascal is an invited speaker at CPAC. Immigration is a unifying issue for Europe's right-wing populists. At last year's Hungary conference, Morawiecki called Orban his friend and credited his tough response to Europe's 2015 migration crisis with preventing 'chaos' in Europe. Liz Truss, former British prime minister The former Conservative Party leader and prime minister made her second CPAC appearance in a row Wednesday. Calling Britain a 'failed state' ruled by a socialist government, she called for a Trump-style MAGA movement to save it. 'We want a Trump revolution in Britain,' she said to applause, praising Trump's second presidency as 'the golden age of America.' Blaming Britain's decline on unelected bureaucrats, she urged the dismantlement of the 'deep state,' a favorite theme among conference attendees. 'We want Elon and his nerd army of muskrats examining the British deep state,' Truss said. Truss served just 49 days as prime minister and lost her Parliament seat last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-rising-worldwide-populism-america-s-premier-conservative-conference-goes-global/7984267.html	2025-02-21T21:14:46-08:00	
Israel prepares to receive 6 more hostages as fragile ceasefire appears to hold	Israel prepared Saturday to receive six more hostages, the latest exchange to take place under a fragile ceasefire that was threatened this week by the return of a misidentified body. Four of the hostages set to be released Saturday at 8:30 a.m. were taken by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, during its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Another two have been held since long before the war, entering Gaza separately under unexplained circumstances around a decade ago. In exchange, Israel is set to release more than 600 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. The latest exchange is set to take place despite Israeli allegations that hostage Shiri Bibas’ body was not returned to Israel as promised on Thursday. Hamas said that Bibas' remains appeared to have been mixed up with other human remains taken from rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit the place she was held. It said it had handed over Biabas’ body to the Red Cross on Friday. The Red Cross confirmed receiving human remains and said it had transferred them to Israeli authorities. Israeli officials said the remains were taken to a forensics lab for testing. Earlier Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas will 'pay the price' for failing to release the body of Bibas as prescribed by the peace agreement with Israel. In a video statement, Netanyahu said 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages — both living and dead — and ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement.' The bodies of three Israeli hostages and the body of a fourth, unidentified woman, were returned to Israel on Thursday in the latest release under the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Those released Thursday included the youngest captives — infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas. The body of their mother, Shiri Bibas, was also supposed to be released. But the Israeli military said the female body was not Bibas. The body does not belong to any other hostage and remains unidentified, the military said. The Israeli military accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement. 'This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is obliged under the agreement to return four deceased hostages,' the military said in a statement. The Bibas family was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video of the abduction showed Shiri Bibas swaddling the boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. Hamas has said the boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023. Israel never confirmed that claim. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, was also released Thursday. Israel and Hamas are in the first phase of a ceasefire that began on Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. Hamas killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel and took about 250 people as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million.

In CPAC remarks, White House national security adviser pledges crackdown on Mexican cartels	Politicians, media personalities and conservative activists gathered outside Washington on Friday for the second day of a conference featuring a range of political allies of President Donald Trump. Speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) heralded the Trump administration’s first month in office, with dozens of executive orders that have proposed sweeping changes to a wide range of government policies and positions on international issues. Mike Waltz, the president's national security adviser, told the CPAC audience Friday that the Trump administration’s efforts to end the Ukraine war are certain to include U.S. investments in Ukraine’s mineral assets as part of a plan to recoup some funding for Ukraine’s defense. Earlier this week, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected a proposal that would grant American companies 50% ownership of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, but Waltz on Friday said the Ukrainian leader 'is going to sign' a revised U.S. offer. Waltz also said the Trump administration plans to 'unleash holy hell' on drug cartels. On Wednesday, the State Department designated several Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups. Journalist-turned-politician Kari Lake, whom Trump said in December he would like to see lead Voice of America, spoke about what she sees as the president’s wins in his first month in office, and her views on legacy media. 'Watching what President Trump has accomplished and done in one month is so incredible,' Lake said, referring to actions by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and the State Department to search for corruption and curtail spending, including by ending foreign aid funding. A former TV journalist in Arizona for nearly 30 years, Lake spoke of how she quit journalism because of what she felt was disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. 'We're still surrounded by too many fake journalists out there,' Lake said, adding that she believes the 'purpose of the mainstream media is no longer to inform us, it's to manipulate us.' She criticized Associated Press reporting on government officials and independent bodies who validated the results of the 2020 election, saying, 'They still pretend the 2020 election was the most secure election in all of history.' Lake also said that she is honored that Trump named her to lead VOA, and said she will focus the news agency on producing 'accurate and honest reporting.' 'VOA has been telling America's story to the world for 83 years this Monday. Sometimes the coverage has been incredible and sometimes it's been pitiful,' Lake said. 'We are fighting an information war, and there's no better weapon than the truth, and I believe VOA could be that weapon.' Among those who have called for the network to be cut is Musk. 'We won't become Trump TV,' she said, 'but it sure as hell will not be ‘TDS TV.’ You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, '60 minutes,' The Washington Post and The New York Times.' Trump is expected to address the CPAC gathering on Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-cpac-remarks-white-house-national-security-adviser-pledges-crackdown-on-mexican-cartels/7984247.html	2025-02-21T18:51:49-08:00

UN Security Council demands rebels withdraw from captured Congolese cities	united nations — The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Friday demanding that the M23 rebels in eastern Congo immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from territories they have seized. The council also threatened sanctions on those who prolong the conflict. France, which drafted the text, said it sends a clear message that there is no military solution to the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. 'The priority is to reach an effective, unconditional and immediate ceasefire agreement,' Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said. 'A restoration of dialogue is urgent, with support from mediation at the regional level. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC needs to be respected.' The resolution also calls on the Rwanda Defense Forces to cease their support 'to the M23 and immediately withdraw from DRC territory without preconditions.' Council members accuse the Rwandan Defense Forces of 'direct support' of the M23. Rwanda has repeatedly denied allegations that it supports the rebels. The Security Council also strongly urged the the DRC and Rwanda 'to return without preconditions to diplomatic talks as a matter of urgency' and to implement their existing commitments under two regional mediations known as the Luanda and Nairobi processes. Land grab Thousands of Rwandan-backed M23 rebels continue to seize territory in the mineral-rich eastern part of the DRC with little resistance from the national army. Since mid-December, they have focused on the provinces of North and South Kivu, seizing North Kivu's capital, Goma, in late January and moving to South Kivu's capital, Bukavu, on February 14. The rebels have also taken control of other important towns, including Masisi, Sake and Nyabibwe, and have established 'parallel administrations' in some of the territories they control. On Friday, the head of the U.N. mission in the eastern DRC said the rebels appear to have their sights set on the capital, Kinshasa. 'Very public declarations and statements by AFC/M23, clearly repeated over time and including last week, show that the intent is to go up to Kinshasa,' Bintou Keita, the U.N. special representative of the secretary-general in the DRC, told reporters in a video briefing from Kinshasa. 'It is our understanding, looking at what is going on in North Kivu, but also the onward push towards South Kivu, and we understand they are pushing a bit further to Tanganyika.' Rwanda alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or the FDLR, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. 'We believe that any outcome that doesn't take Rwanda's security concerns seriously will not offer a sustainable solution to the conflict,' said Rwandan Ambassador Ernest Rwamucyo. 'The security challenges posed by FDLR and its splinter groups are of very serious concern for Rwanda. DRC must be held accountable for its continued preservation of FDLR, embedding it in its army, equipping the FDLR with sophisticated weapons and using it as an ally and fighting force.' In its resolution, the council condemned 'support provided by DRC military forces to specific armed groups, in particular the FDLR,' calling for it to stop. The council also urged the parties to rapidly implement 'the harmonized plan for the neutralization' of the FDLR and the 'disengagement of forces from the territory of the DRC.' Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been caught up in the fighting. The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that it needs $40.4 million to assist 275,000 internally displaced people in eastern DRC and to support a potential influx of 258,000 refugees and returnees going to neighboring countries. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. Congolese Ambassador Zenon Ngay Mukongo welcomed the council's action but said it came late, after weeks of repeated appeals from his government. 'In this particular case, the council's paralysis gave free rein to the illegal occupation of DRC territory by the Rwandan Defense Forces and their supporters in the AFC/M23,' he said, 'in the knowledge that every further day of inaction compromises regional and international peace and security, only strengthens the aggressor, and undermines the United Nations' credibility.' On Thursday, the United States unilaterally imposed sanctions on a senior Rwandan official and a spokesperson for a coalition of armed groups that includes the M23 for fueling violence in the eastern DRC. 'We applaud similar actions taken by other member states aimed at compelling Rwanda to return to the negotiating table and bring this violence to an end,' U.S. envoy Dorothy Shea said. Sierra Leone's envoy offered a lesson to the parties from his country's 11-year civil war in the 1990s. Ambassador Michael Kanu said that at some point the parties realized the conflict would not end on the battlefield and that dialogue was the only viable path to sustainable peace. 'We had to talk with each other in good faith and commit to signing a peace agreement with the necessary political will,' Kanu said. 'Talking to adversaries is hard. Perhaps a taboo for some. But we do not make peace with friends, but with adversaries.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-demands-rebels-withdraw-from-captured-congolese-cities/7984216.html	2025-02-21T17:39:27-08:00	
Trump fires chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump abruptly fired Air Force General CQ Brown as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Friday, sidelining a history-making fighter pilot and respected officer as part of a campaign to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity in the ranks. The ouster of Brown, only the second Black general to serve as chairman, is sure to send shock waves through the Pentagon. His 16 months in the job had been consumed with the war in Ukraine and the expanded conflict in the Middle East. 'I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family,' Trump posted on social media. Trump said he was nominating Air Force Lieutenant General Dan 'Razin' Caine to be the next chairman. Trump acted despite support for Brown among key members of Congress and a seemingly friendly meeting with him in mid-December, when the two were seated next to each other for a time at the Army-Navy football game. Brown had been meeting regularly with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who took over the top Pentagon job just four weeks ago.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-fires-chairman-of-joint-chiefs-of-staff-/7984199.html	2025-02-21T17:01:47-08:00	
AP sues White House officials over denial of access	WASHINGTON — The Associated Press filed a lawsuit against three White House officials on Friday after the news agency was barred from some of U.S. President Donald Trump's events. The AP, in the suit filed in a federal court in Washington, said the denial of access violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and of the press. The White House began blocking AP journalists from the Oval Office 10 days ago over the news agency's refusal to follow Trump's executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the 'Gulf of America.' The ban on AP reporters was later extended to Air Force One. The news group said it was bringing the suit against three Trump administration officials to 'vindicate its rights to the editorial independence guaranteed by the United States Constitution.' 'The White House has ordered The Associated Press to use certain words in its coverage or else face an indefinite denial of access,' the AP said. 'The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,' it said. 'The Constitution does not allow the government to control speech. Allowing such government control and retaliation to stand is a threat to every American's freedom.' The suit names as defendants White House chief of staff Susan Wiles and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich, as well as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. 'We'll see them in court,' Leavitt said during an appearance Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. 'We feel we are in the right. We are going to ensure that truth and accuracy is present at that White House every single day,' she said. In its style guide, the AP noted that the Gulf of Mexico has 'carried that name for more than 400 years.' 'The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen,' it said. 'As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.' Trump called the AP a 'radical left organization' on Thursday and said the new Gulf of America name is 'something that we feel strongly about.' His leveraging of press access underscores the Republican president's long-standing animosity toward traditional news outlets, which he accuses of bias against him. The White House Correspondents' Association has called AP's exclusion from Trump events outrageous. The 180-year-old news agency has long been a pillar of U.S. journalism and provides news to print, TV and radio outlets across the United States and around the world. Voice of America subscribes to The Associated Press, which provides video, audio and written content.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ap-sues-white-house-officials-over-denial-of-access-/7984165.html	2025-02-21T16:19:02-08:00	
Pope's condition not life-threatening, but his life is still in danger, doctors say	Pope Francis' medical team said Friday that his medical condition was not life-threatening, but that the pontiff was not out of danger. 'If the question is, 'Is he out of danger?' the answer is, 'No,' ' Sergio Alfieri, the head of the team of doctors at Rome's Gemelli Hospital taking care of the pope, said. 'But if you then ask us if, at this moment, his life is in danger, the answer is [also], 'No.'' The doctors said Francis was in good spirits and had maintained his sense of humor. Alfieri said when he greeted the pope Friday in the pope's hospital suite as 'Holy Father,' the pope returned the greeting with 'Holy Son.' Francis, the leader of the world's Roman Catholics, was admitted to the hospital last week after a case of bronchitis worsened. At the hospital, he was diagnosed with double pneumonia and a complex bacterial, viral and fungal infection, and doctors placed Francis on a strengthened drug therapy. Francis also has been receiving supplements of oxygen when needed, his doctors said Friday. Alfieri said Francis was not on a ventilator. Alfieri said there was a possibility that germs from Francis' respiratory tract could enter his bloodstream, causing sepsis, but there was currently no evidence that it had happened. Sepsis is a complication of an infection that can lead to organ failure and death. The 88-year-old pontiff has been able to get out of bed and do some work, according to his doctors. They said Francis would remain in the hospital 'at least' through next week. With his hospitalization, there has been speculation about Francis stepping down from his duties as head of the Roman Catholic Church, a post he has held since 2013. His immediate predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, was the first pope in 600 years to resign. In a recent memoir, Francis addressed the possibility of his own resignation if he became incapacitated. He said such a move would be a 'distant possibility,' justified only if he were facing 'a serious physical impediment.' However, in 2022, Francis confirmed he wrote a resignation letter not long after becoming pope. He said it was written in case medical issues prevented him from executing his papal duties. The Catholic faithful around the world have been encouraged to pray for Francis' rapid recovery. On Friday in the Philippines, a hourlong prayer was held for Francis at the Manila Cathedral. Francis celebrated Mass in a Manila park in 2015, drawing a record-breaking crowd of 6 million, according to official estimates. Saturday is the Feast of the Chair of St. Peter, a day commemorating the authority Jesus gave to the pope. Catholics are set to gather outside Gemelli Hospital to pray for Francis' health, according to the Catholic News Agency. Some information for this article came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-s-condition-not-life-threatening-but-his-life-is-still-in-danger-doctors-say/7983943.html	2025-02-21T15:39:19-08:00	
N. Koreans' high casualties in Ukraine blamed on inexperience	washington — North Korean troops that joined Moscow's forces about four months ago in Russia's border region of Kursk are estimated to have suffered considerable casualties in the war against Ukraine, which analysts attribute to their lack of front-line combat experience. Numbers from different sources vary, but more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers are believed to have died or been injured while fighting Ukrainian forces. The South Korean National Intelligence Service cited the figure in mid-January, breaking it down to at least 300 killed and another 2,700 wounded. In an interview published Monday by South Korea's Chosun Daily, Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine's military intelligence, said North Korean troops had suffered about 4,000 casualties. That would be one-third of the 12,000 North Korean soldiers who the U.S. in December estimated had been deployed to the Kursk region. A peace deal is being pushed by the Trump administration to end the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Frontal assaults 'The North Korean military personnel fighting in the Kursk region are being used for frontal assaults without much military support such as artillery and armor and drones, against some of the very best Ukrainian forces,' said Bruce Bennett, senior defense researcher at the Rand Corporation. 'Many of the North Korean forces used by the Russians were trained to be special forces intended to penetrate into the enemy rear and operate there,' he said. 'Their North Korean training was not for frontal assaults, and they appear to not have been trained in Russia very well for such tactics, especially given the evolution of warfare to involve drones and other factors.' If the Russians are using North Korean special operations forces as light infantry units, then 'they are wasting their soldiers' lives' because they are not using the soldiers' special operations training, said David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy. If the Ukrainian forces are 'employing effective combined arms maneuver with integrated fire support, they will inflict tremendous damage against frontal assaults,' he said. Another reason for high casualties among North Korean troops could be 'communications problems if they are working under the command of Russian forces,' Maxwell said. 'The language challenge hinders interoperability and the ability of the Russians to provide support' to the North Koreans. Many of the North Korean troops deployed to Russia are reportedly from the regime's elite special forces unit known as the 11th Corps of the Korean People's Army, also known as the Storm Corps. Headquartered in Tokchon, North Korea, the Storm Corps is trained to infiltrate and sabotage enemy operations and assassinate targets. North Korea began sending troops to Russia in October. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the time that if the forces entered the war, it would be 'a very, very serious issue' affecting not only Europe but also the Indo-Pacific region. The deployment of North Korean troops, in addition to the munitions the country had been sending to Russia since October 2023, represented an escalation of military ties between Pyongyang and Moscow and a dangerous expansion of Russia's war, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said in October. The same month, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun described North Korean troops as 'mere cannon fodder mercenaries' for Russia's 'illegal war of aggression.' Russia has been using so-called meat-grinder tactics to fight Ukraine. The strategy involves mobilizing a large number of troops in a concentrated area of combat to bombard the enemy and break through its defenses. The attackers often suffer a high number of casualties. Escalation of conflict Ukrainian forces first reported encountering North Korean units on Nov. 5 in the Kursk region. Shortly afterward, Russia, reportedly using meat-grinder tactics, suffered a record number of casualties for the month. Russia suffered more than 2,000 casualties on Nov. 28 alone, which helped raise the average daily Russian casualties for the month to a new high of 1,523, according to the Institute for the Study of War, citing an analysis from the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense. Adding to the casualties are the lethal World War I-style combat tactics, such as heavy artillery bombardments and trench warfare, that have made a comeback in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Russians and North Koreans 'are fighting in this horrible, almost World War I-style combat, where all sides, including the Ukrainians, are taking huge casualties' with 'tons of artillery' and 'missiles and rockets and tanks,' said Bruce Bechtol, a professor focusing on East Asia and international security at Angelo State University in Texas. Since the start of the war, Russia is estimated to have incurred more than 860,000 casualties, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported Friday. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and about 380,000 had been injured over that same period. Bechtol, a former intelligence officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency, said North Korean and Russian casualties could have been 'exaggerated,' and it might not be possible to assess exact figures, even after the war ends. In October, neither Moscow nor Pyongyang denied the possibility of North Korean troop deployment to Russia, nor did either fully acknowledge that North Korean soldiers were fighting Ukrainian forces.

Los Angeles mayor ousts fire chief for response to deadly fires	LOS ANGELES — Six weeks after the most destructive wildfire in city history, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass ousted the city's fire chief Friday amid a public rift over preparations for a potential fire and finger-pointing between the chief and City Hall over responsibility for the devastation. Bass said in a statement that she is removing Chief Kristin Crowley immediately. 'Bringing new leadership to the Fire Department is what our city needs,' Bass said in a statement. 'We know that 1,000 firefighters that could have been on duty on the morning the fires broke out were instead sent home on Chief Crowley's watch,' Bass disclosed. She added that the chief refused a request to prepare an 'after-action report' on the fires, which she called a necessary step in the investigation. The Palisades Fire began during heavy winds Jan. 7, destroying or damaging nearly 8,000 homes, businesses and other structures and killing at least 12 people in the Los Angeles neighborhood. Another wind-whipped fire started the same day in suburban Altadena, a community to the east, killing at least 17 people and destroying or damaging more than 10,000 homes and other buildings. Bass has been facing criticism for being in Africa as part of a presidential delegation on the day the fires started, even though weather reports had warned of dangerous fire conditions in the days before she left. In televised interviews this week, Bass acknowledged she made a mistake by leaving the city. But she inferred she wasn't aware of the looming danger when she flew around the globe to attend the inauguration of Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama. She faulted Crowley for failing to alert her to the potentially explosive fire conditions. Crowley has publicly criticized the city for budget cuts that she said made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs. Crowley was named fire chief in 2022 by Bass' predecessor at a time when the department was in turmoil over allegations of rampant harassment, hazing and discrimination. She worked for the city fire department for more than 25 years and held nearly every role, including fire marshal, engineer and battalion chief.	https://www.voanews.com/a/los-angeles-mayor-ousts-fire-chief-for-response-to-deadly-fires/7983872.html	2025-02-21T14:14:58-08:00	
Thousands fly to Lebanon for funeral of Hezbollah's slain leader	BEIRUT — Nearly five months after Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike, thousands of supporters of the longtime leader of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group have flown into Beirut for his funeral on Sunday. Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27 when Israel's air force dropped more than 80 bombs on Hezbollah's main operations room in southern Beirut. It was the biggest and most consequential of Israel's targeted killings in years. The death of Nasrallah, one of the Iran-backed Shiite group's founders and the organization’s leader of more than 30 years, was a huge blow to the group he had transformed into a potent force in the Middle East. Hezbollah, which the United States and some of its allies have designated a terrorist organization, has suffered significant losses in the latest war with Israel, including the killing of several of its most senior military and political figures. Nasrallah's cousin and successor, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb a few days later, will be laid to rest in his hometown in southern Lebanon. The two had temporarily been buried in secret locations. Hezbollah earlier this month announced plans for their official funerals. Crowds are expected to gather Sunday at Beirut's main sports stadium for a funeral ceremony before Nasrallah's interment. Flights from Iraq, where Hezbollah has a huge following among Iraqi Shiites, have been full for days. According to an Iraqi Transportation Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the flights, up to 6,000 people have flown to Beirut recently. Nasrallah, idolized by his supporters and with large followings among the Shiites and the Islamic world, also held the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric's lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. However, Lebanese authorities revoked permission for a passenger plane from Iran, leaving dozens who had wanted to attend the funeral stranded in Tehran and triggering protests by Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon. The ban came after the Israeli army accused Iran of smuggling cash to Hezbollah by way of civilian flights, leading some in Lebanon to allege that their government had caved in the face of a threat from Israel. Some of those who were expected to fly in from Iran were now coming to Lebanon via Iraq. Also, members of Iran-backed groups in the region also were traveling to Beirut to attend Nasrallah's funeral. Kazim al-Fartousi, spokesperson for the Iran-backed Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada group in Iraq, arrived on Friday. He said Nasrallah was 'the father, commander and the book that we read every day to learn about freedom.' Republican U.S. Representative Joe Wilson criticized Lebanese politicians who were planning to attend the funeral. 'Any Lebanese politician who attends the funeral of the murderous terrorist Hasan Nasrallah is standing with the Iranian Regime,' Wilson said on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-fly-to-lebanon-for-funeral-of-hezbollah-s-slain-leader/7983886.html	2025-02-21T14:01:18-08:00	
Man wounded in stabbing at Berlin's Holocaust memorial	berlin — A man was seriously injured in a stabbing at Berlin's Holocaust memorial, police said Friday evening, two days before a watershed national election. Police said they did not know the identity or motive of the male attacker, who was still at large. The investigation was continuing. Video of the scene showed emergency vehicles and heavily armored police lined along one side of the memorial site, a vast field of grey concrete pillars. The memorial is across a street from the U.S. Embassy. 'An as yet unidentified male suspect attacked a person standing here, who was so seriously injured that he had to be taken by the fire brigade to hospital for emergency treatment,' police spokesperson Florian Nath said. The attack occurred around 6 p.m. (1700 GMT). The victim's life was not in danger, and he was being prepared for surgery, Nath said. He added that police did not believe there was any imminent danger to the public. The monument, one of the German capital's most sacred sites, commemorates the 6 million Jews murdered by Adolf Hitler's Nazis during World War II, one of the darkest episodes in human history and a continuing focus of German historical atonement. The area surrounding the monument was sealed off. The national election campaign, in which polls suggest a far-right party could come in second place for the first time in nine decades, has been marred by a series of high-profile attacks. One of those was a stabbing blamed on an Afghan immigrant, which prompted a fraught debate on immigration. Earlier on Friday, an 18-year-old ethnic Chechen was arrested on suspicion of planning an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Berlin, Bild newspaper reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-wounded-in-stabbing-at-berlin-s-holocaust-memorial/7983855.html	2025-02-21T13:36:28-08:00	
Thousands rally in Slovakia to mark the 2018 slayings of an investigative journalist and his fiancee	BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA — Thousands rallied across Slovakia on Friday to mark the seventh anniversary of the slayings of an investigative journalist and his fiancee. The rallies are part of a wave of protests against the pro-Russia policies of populist Prime Minister Robert Fico. People in Slovakia's capital, Bratislava, observed a minute of silence to honor Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova, both age 27. They were shot to death at their home in the town of Velka Maca, east of Bratislava, on Feb. 21, 2018. The killings prompted major street protests unseen since the 1989 anti-communist Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia. The ensuing political crisis led to the collapse of a coalition government headed by Fico. Kuciak had been investigating possible government corruption, among other issues, when he was killed. People applauded the parents of Kuciak and the mother of Kusnirova, who greeted them from the stage. 'I believe that our common fight will be successful,' said Jozef Kuciak, the father of Jan. Marian Kocner, a businessman who had been accused of masterminding the killings, has been acquitted twice. Prosecutors have said they believe Kocner paid the convicted triggerman to carry it out and appealed. The current anti-government protests are the biggest demonstrations since the 2018 slayings. They are fueled by Fico's recent trip to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a rare visit to the Kremlin by a European Union leader since Moscow's all-out invasion of Ukraine began almost three years ago and his recent remarks that Slovakia might leave the 27-nation EU and NATO. 'We've had enough of Fico,' people chanted. The crowds at rallies in 47 towns and cities at home and 16 abroad, according to organizers, demanded Fico's resignation. About 10,000 protesters chanted 'Resign, resign,' at Freedom Square in Bratislava. Fico's views on Russia have sharply differed from the European mainstream. He returned to power last year after his leftist party Smer (Direction) won a parliamentary election in 2023. He has since ended Slovakia's military aid for Ukraine, criticized EU sanctions on Russia and vowed to block Ukraine from joining NATO. He declared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as an enemy after Ukraine halted on Russian gas supplies to Slovakia and some other European customers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-rally-in-slovakia-to-mark-the-2018-slayings-of-an-investigative-journalist-and-his-fiancee-/7983798.html	2025-02-21T12:42:53-08:00	
Nearly 100 cases of measles reported in Texas, New Mexico	The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 90 cases across seven counties, the state health department posted online Friday, and 16 people are hospitalized. In neighboring eastern New Mexico, the measles case count is up to nine, though state public health officials said Thursday there's still no evidence this outbreak is connected to the one in Texas. The West Texas cases are concentrated in eight counties in West Texas. Texas state health department data shows that most of the cases are among people younger than 18. Twenty-six cases are in kids younger than 4 and 51 are in kids 5-17 years old. Ten adults have measles, and three cases are pending an age determination. The Ector County Health Department told the Odessa American its case was in a child too young to be vaccinated. State health officials have said this outbreak is Texas' largest in nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week that cases have been concentrated in a 'close-knit, undervaccinated' Mennonite community — especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled. In New Mexico, all of the cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas. The state health department has said people may have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church, hospital and a pharmacy in Hobbs, New Mexico. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. The vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year. There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation. In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called 'herd immunity.' But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn't include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported. Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinics and screening efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots. New Mexico health officials are also hosting several vaccination clinics in Hobbs next week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nearly-100-cases-of-measles-reported-in-texas-new-mexico/7983785.html	2025-02-21T12:31:09-08:00	
US states push back against possible election security changes	WASHINGTON — Moves by U.S. President Donald Trump to potentially gut programs aimed at supporting election security are not sitting well with key state election officials, who are now asking the Trump administration to reconsider. The National Association of Secretaries of State sent a letter Friday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warning that changes to the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency could endanger future elections. 'Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,' according to the letter, signed by NASS president, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and NASS president-elect, Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson. 'CISA’s prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats,' they added. NASS is a bipartisan group that represents chief election officials from nearly 40 U.S. states. Simon is a Democrat. Watson is a Republican. The letter says that while U.S. elections 'firmly remain a state and local responsibility,' several initiatives from CISA have provided valuable services and allowed for the sharing of critical information for states that choose to participate. It lists cybersecurity services, physical security assessments, information through the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), classified and unclassified intelligence briefings and on-the-ground incident response services as among the programs that NASS members would like to continue. VOA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security about the letter but has not received a response. CISA was formally created in 2018, charged with protecting the country’s critical infrastructure. It has also served as a lead agency on election security. DHS officials announced a review of the agency earlier this month citing what they described as a need for CISA 'to refocus on its mission.' 'The agency is undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and mal-information,' said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. According to DHS, as of mid-February, more than 130 CISA employees had been placed on administrative leave. NASS expressed hope some of the election related programs can be preserved, offering to meet with DHS officials, including Noem. '[We] respect your authority to reassess existing priorities, structures, staffing, and missions,' the NASS letter said. 'We favor continuity of the core resources above and welcome the opportunity as Chief Election Officials to discuss any potential changes or impacts to election security-related services before making a final decision.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-states-push-back-against-possible-election-security-changes-/7983778.html	2025-02-21T12:26:54-08:00	
White House official expects Ukraine to accept mineral deal	President Donald Trump's national security adviser said Friday that he expected Ukraine to accept and sign a proposed deal that would include U.S. investments in its mineral assets to help recoup some U.S. defense funding. The Trump administration had proposed the rare earth mineral deal as part of the larger negotiation toward ending the war in Ukraine. Mike Waltz's comments followed reports that the Trump administration presented Kyiv with a revised version of a minerals agreement after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the initial proposal. Speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington, Waltz said: 'Well, look, here's the bottom line: President Zelenskyy is going to sign that deal. And you will see that in the very short term. And that is good for Ukraine.' Those comments came following a sharp exchange between Trump and Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president, responding to Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine started its war with Russia, said the U.S. president was living in a Russian-influenced 'disinformation space.' Trump countered on his Truth Social platform, calling Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections.' On Friday, Trump referenced his indirect exchanges with Zelenskyy while speaking to a gathering of the Republican State Governors Association at the White House. The president described having 'very good talks with [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin,' and 'not such good talks with Ukraine.' He mentioned how Ukraine talks 'tough' but does not have a lot of bargaining chips. Trump sent Keith Kellogg, his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, to Kyiv for meetings with Zelenskyy on Thursday. Comments following that meeting indicated the relationship had been smoothed over. On his X social media account, Zelenskyy had nothing but positive things to say. 'My meeting with General Kellogg was one that restores hope, and we need strong agreements with the U.S. — agreements that will truly work,' Zelenskyy said. 'I have instructed my team to work quickly and very sensibly.' 'We all need peace — Ukraine, Europe, America and the entire world,' Zelenskyy added. Kellogg, from his X account, reposted Zelenskyy’s comments, and stated, 'Extensive and positive discussions with [Zelenskyy], the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war, and his talented national security team.' Much of the tension this past week involved talks on Ukraine between a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. No Ukrainian or European representatives were present. Rubio later noted that the meeting did not involve any fine points of the deal. Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms that could be more favorable to Moscow. Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine's internationally recognized territory. U.S. Vice President JD Vance told the CPAC meeting Thursday that Trump 'wants the killing to stop' in Ukraine and that 'peace is in the interest of the American people.' Vance said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, 'We're on the cusp of peace.' He did not mention Ukraine's role in settling the conflict, although U.S. officials have said Kyiv and Moscow will both be involved in the settlement and will have to make concessions to achieve peace. European leaders have responded to Trump's recent remarks about Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if the fighting ends.

Suspect found guilty of attempted murder in author Salman Rushdie attack	MAYVILLE, NEW YORK — A New Jersey man was convicted Friday of attempted murder for stabbing author Salman Rushdie multiple times on a New York lecture stage in 2022. Jurors, who deliberated for less than two hours, also found Hadi Matar, 27, guilty of assault for wounding a man who was on stage with Rushdie at the time. Matar ran onto the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where Rushdie was about to speak on Aug. 12, 2022, and stabbed him more than a dozen times before a live audience. The attack left the 77-year-old prizewinning novelist blind in one eye. Rushdie was the key witness during seven days of testimony, describing in graphic detail his life-threatening injuries and long and painful recovery. Matar, sitting at the defense table, looked down but had no obvious reaction when the jury delivered the verdict. As he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs, he quietly uttered, 'Free Palestine,' echoing comments he has frequently made while entering and leaving the trial. His public defender, Nathaniel Barone, said Matar was disappointed but also well-prepared for the verdict. District Attorney Jason Schmidt played a slow-motion video of the attack for the jury Friday during his closing argument, pointing out the assailant as he emerged from the audience, walked up a staircase to the stage and broke into a run toward Rushdie. 'I want you to look at the unprovoked nature of this attack,' Schmidt said. 'I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack. There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted.' Assistant public defender Andrew Brautigan told the jury that prosecutors have not proved that Matar intended to kill Rushdie. The distinction is important for an attempted-murder conviction. 'You will agree something bad happened to Mr. Rushdie, but you don't know what Mr. Matar's conscious objective was,' Brautigan said. Matar had knives with him but no gun or bomb, his attorneys have said previously. And in response to testimony that the injuries were life-threatening, they have noted that Rushdie's heart and lungs were uninjured. Schmidt said while it's not possible to read Matar's mind, 'it's foreseeable that if you're going to stab someone 10 or 15 times about the face and neck, it's going to result in a fatality.' Schmidt reminded jurors about the testimony of a trauma surgeon, who said Rushdie's injuries would have been fatal without quick treatment. He also slowed down video showing Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. Rushdie raises his arms and rises from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them. Rushdie is seen flailing on the ground, waving a hand covered in bright red blood. Schmidt freezes on a frame showing Rushdie, his face also bloodied, as he's surrounded by people. 'We've shown you intent,' Schmidt said. The recordings also picked up the gasps and screams from audience members who had been seated to hear Rushdie speak with City of Asylum Pittsburgh founder Henry Reese about keeping writers safe. Reese suffered a gash to his forehead, leading to the assault charge against Matar. The judge set sentencing for April 23. Matar could receive up to 25 years in prison.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-found-guilty-of-attempted-murder-in-author-salman-rushdie-attack-/7983754.html	2025-02-21T12:12:46-08:00

UN Security Council weighs calling on Rwanda to pull troops from Congo	UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations Security Council will vote Friday to call on Rwanda's military to stop supporting the M23 rebel group in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and immediately withdraw all troops from Congolese territory 'without preconditions.' The M23 has captured the two largest cities in eastern Congo and stoked fears of a wider war. Rwanda denies allegations from Congo and the U.N. that it supports the M23 with arms and troops. It says it is defending itself against Hutu militias which it accuses of fighting alongside the Congolese military. The French-drafted U.N. resolution 'strongly condemns the ongoing offensive and advances of the M23 in North-Kivu and South Kivu with the support of Rwanda Defense Forces (RDF)' and demands that M23 immediately stop its hostilities and withdraw. A council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Russia, China, Britain or France to be adopted. Several diplomats said it is expected to pass. Congo says Rwanda has used the M23 rebels as a proxy to loot its minerals such as gold and coltan, used in smartphones and computers. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on a Rwandan minister and a senior rebel for their alleged role in the conflict. The text also condemns support by Congolese troops 'to specific armed groups, in particular the FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda], and calls for the cessation of such support and for the urgent implementation of commitments to neutralize the group.' Rwanda accuses Congo of fighting alongside the FDLR. The Congolese military has vowed to arrest soldiers who cooperate with the FDLR, but the government has continued to use FDLR fighters as proxies, U.N. experts said in December. The M23 vows to defend Tutsi interests, particularly against ethnic Hutu militias such as the FDLR. The FDLR was founded by Hutus who fled Rwanda after participating in the 1994 genocide that killed close to 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The U.N. draft resolution urges the DRC and Rwanda to return to diplomatic talks to achieve a lasting peaceful resolution. The escalation of a decade-old insurgency has killed several peacekeepers with the U.N. force in Congo, known as MONUSCO. The draft U.N. resolution warns that 'attacks against peacekeepers may constitute war crimes and that planning, directing, sponsoring or participating in attacks against MONUSCO peacekeepers constitutes a basis for sanctions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-weighs-calling-on-rwanda-to-pull-troops-from-congo/7983635.html	2025-02-21T11:56:58-08:00	
Lack of consensus' as G20 meets amid turbulent times	JOHANNESBURG — The two-day Group of 20 foreign ministers meeting wrapped up in Johannesburg on Friday. Aimed at addressing global problems, the talks between the world’s wealthiest countries instead underscored the fault lines in the current geopolitical climate. Despite the warm welcome foreign dignitaries received at the meeting in Johannesburg, hosted by current G20 president South Africa, tensions were apparent before the event even got underway. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced earlier this month he was boycotting the meeting, citing what he called the 'anti-Americanism' on the agenda. These topics included climate change and equality for developing nations. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the discord head on in his opening speech, saying the world was under threat from rising intolerance and wars. 'Yet there is a lack of consensus among major powers, including the G20, on how to respond to these issues of global significance,' Ramaphosa said. Even a planned group photo fell through, though no official explanation was given for its last-minute cancellation. Steven Gruzd, an analyst at the South African Institute of International Affairs, spoke about the challenges the meeting presented. 'South Africa’s had a very difficult job of getting countries that are ideologically very far apart around the same table,' he said. South Africa has been under fire from the new U.S. administration, which accuses the government of land grabs, an accusation South Africa strongly denies. President Donald Trump recently cut financial assistance to the country over the allegations. Washington sent U.S. Embassy Charge d’Affaires Dana Brown in Rubio’s place. The embassy declined VOA’s request for an interview. But there were statements of support for South Africa leading the G20 from several European foreign ministers. Russia and China also sent their top envoys. In his remarks at the meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed his support for South Africa’s G20 presidency. He also noted that, 'the current international landscape is marked by transformation and turbulence.' He added, China will 'work with all parties' on world peace, security and multilateralism. One topic that dominated at the meeting was Ukraine. The foreign ministers gathered days after Trump upended U.S. policy on the war, suggesting Ukraine was to blame for Russia’s 2022 invasion and labeling one-time U.S. ally Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a 'dictator.' Retired U.S. diplomat Brooks Spector said, 'Now that President Trump has effectively ended the general Western consensus on Ukraine, it’s obviously fallen to the European nations to be the primary source of support for Ukraine and its president and in fact its struggle against Russia.' The E.U. has indeed rallied in support of Zelenskyy after Trump’s comments. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, speaking on the sidelines of the meeting, voiced his concerns. 'A capitulation of Ukraine today would set a terrible example for every country in the world that would be under the threat of predation by its bigger neighbor,' he said. 'Is this the world in which we want to live?' However, in his closing remarks South African foreign minister Ronald Lamola put a positive spin on things, saying the meeting had been an overall success and delegates had held 'productive' talks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lack-of-consensus-as-g20-meets-amid-turbulent-times-/7983605.html	2025-02-21T11:54:32-08:00	
Judge cancels New York City mayor’s trial, keeps corruption charges intact	NEW YORK — A federal judge on Friday canceled the corruption trial of New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The judge also appointed counsel to advise him on how to handle the Justice Department's controversial request to drop charges against the Democrat. Judge Dale E. Ho's written order means he won't decide before mid-March whether to grant the dismissal of the case against the mayor of the nation's largest city. At a hearing Wednesday, Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove cited an executive order by President Donald Trump outlining his criminal justice priorities as he defended the request to drop charges. Adams confirmed at the hearing that he accepted that charges could later be reinstated. Critics suggest that the mayor would be required to carry out Trump's plans to round up New Yorkers who are in the country illegally if he wanted to remain free from prosecution. The request is 'virtually unreviewable in this courtroom,' Bove argued. Adams was indicted in September and accused of accepting more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. He faces multiple challengers in June's Democratic primary. He has pleaded not guilty and has insisted on his innocence. On Friday, the judge said he'd appointed Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general and acting U.S. attorney general, as amicus curiae to present arguments on the government's request to throw out the charges. Ho said he wanted all parties and Clement to address the legal standard for dismissing charges, whether a court may consider materials beyond the motion itself and under what circumstances additional procedural steps and further inquiry would be necessary. He also said he wants to know under what circumstances dismissal can occur without the ability to reinstate charges or with the ability to reinstate charges. He scheduled briefs to be filed by March 7 and, if necessary, oral arguments to occur on March 14. Late Thursday, three former U.S. attorneys — from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — submitted a letter urging Ho to 'hear from parties other than the government and the defendant in deciding about the appropriate next steps.' Adams will not be required to attend future hearings, the judge said. That could help mitigate some political damage for Adams as he could avoid being hauled back to court for hearings while he tries to convince the public that the case isn't distracting him from running the city. Adams has sought to project calm as questions over his independence have sparked a political crisis in his administration. This week, four of his top deputies resigned and Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that she had for now decided against removing Adams from office but would instead propose legislation to enhance state oversight of City Hall as a way to reestablish trust with New Yorkers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-cancels-new-york-city-mayor-s-trial-keeps-corruption-charges-intact/7983729.html	2025-02-21T11:53:10-08:00	
German police arrest Russian man over attack plot	BERLIN — German police said Friday they have arrested an 18-year-old Russian man on suspicion of planning a 'politically motivated' attack in Berlin, two days before national elections. The man was detained late Thursday in the state of Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin, police and prosecutors said in a statement. Authorities did not provide further details about the attack plot, but the Tagesspiegel newspaper reported the suspect was Chechen and is believed to have been planning an attack on the Israeli Embassy. The Israeli Embassy could not be reached for comment outside of business hours, while state prosecutors and the Russian Embassy did not immediately respond to written requests for comment from Reuters. German newspaper Bild reported Friday that the investigation had been the result of a tip-off from a foreign intelligence agency. It said the suspect had been trying to leave the country via Berlin's BER airport when he was detained. Riot police and specialist officers were involved in making the arrest, which came after that tip-off, officials said. 'No further details as to the background and motive can be given for the moment to protect the investigation,' they added. The man appeared in court Friday and was remanded in custody. German authorities are on high alert ahead of Sunday's federal elections. Some material in this report is from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-police-arrest-russian-man-over-attack-plot/7983573.html	2025-02-21T10:37:55-08:00	
US Treasury’s Bessent, China’s He trade economic complaints in call	WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent traded policy complaints with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng on Friday, with Bessent telling Beijing to do more to curb fentanyl trafficking and rebalance its economy, and He voicing concerns about President Donald Trump’s new tariffs, the two governments said. The top economic officials from the world’s two largest economies agreed to keep up communications, the Treasury said in a readout of the introductory video call. 'Secretary Bessent expressed serious concerns about the PRC’s counternarcotics efforts, economic imbalances, and unfair policies, and stressed the Administration’s commitment to pursue trade and economic policies that protect the American economy, the American worker, and our national security,' the Treasury said, using the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. Earlier, Chinese state media reported that He expressed concerns to Bessent over U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions on China during the call. The two sides had an 'in-depth' exchange of views on important issues in China-U.S. economic relations, and both agreed to keep communicating on matters of mutual concern, according to a readout released by Chinese state media. He, the lead China-U.S. trade negotiator on the Chinese side, and Bessent recognized the importance of bilateral economic and trade relations, the readout said. More tariffs China and the United States are seeking to manage their relationship as they stand on the precipice of a renewed trade war. Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all Chinese goods in early February, citing China's failure to stanch fentanyl trafficking. Beijing retaliated by imposing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. imports, including energy and farm equipment, and put several companies, including Google, on notice for possible sanctions. Trump has also planned further reciprocal tariffs for all countries that tax U.S. imports, a move that is likely to further escalate global trade tensions. During his election campaign, Trump threatened 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports. Trump said earlier this week he expected Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the U.S., without giving a timeline for such a trip. Bessent said on Thursday he would tell his Chinese counterpart that China needed to rebalance its economy and rely more on domestic consumption for growth and less on investment and exports. 'They are suppressing the consumer in favor of the business community,' Bessent told Bloomberg Television. Similar arguments The U.S. had a $295.4 billion goods trade deficit with China in 2024, down from a peak of $418.2 billion in 2018, the year Trump began imposing new tariffs on some $370 billion of Chinese imports. But last year’s deficit rose $16.3 billion from 2023 as Chinese exporters rushed to beat a new round of Trump tariffs. Bessent’s predecessor, former Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, met several times with He in recent years and lodged similar complaints about China’s state-led economic policies. She argued during a trip to China last year that those policies were leading to excess production capacity that was threatening the viability of firms in the U.S. and other market economies, a warning that laid the groundwork for former President Joe Biden’s steep tariff hikes on electric vehicles, semiconductors and solar products. He and other Chinese officials never accepted U.S. excess capacity assertions, arguing that China’s EV and other key industries are simply more competitive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-s-bessent-china-s-he-trade-economic-complaints-in-call/7983523.html	2025-02-21T10:19:03-08:00

Four scenarios for securing peace in Ukraine	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for a peaceful resolution to Russia’s now three-year war in Ukraine. VOA examined several approaches floated by think tanks recently aimed at achieving a lasting peace to the war. Maximum pressure strategy A plan by the Center for European Policy Analysis, or CEPA, titled 'How to Win: A Seven-Point Plan for Sustainable Peace in Ukraine,' calls for 'a maximum pressure strategy to bring Russia to the negotiating table in good faith.' It proposes that the U.S. and its allies: 'Should provide immediate materiel support to Ukraine without caveats, aiming to wear down Russia’s military and thereby improve Ukraine’s negotiating position.' 'Should increase sanctions on Russian financial institutions and energy sector entities, release frozen Russian assets to support Ukrainian defense and reconstruction and enact secondary sanctions to intensify economic pressure not only on Russia but also on the authoritarian regimes of China, Iran, and North Korea.' CEPA says that 'Ukraine and Europe' must be included in any peace talks with Russia, that the U.S. should support 'a European-led coalition of the willing' to enforce any 'ceasefire line with an international force,' and that 'European allies must make consistent and as rapid as possible progress toward Ukraine’s accession to the European Union.' One of the report’s authors, Catherine Sendak, CEPA’s director for transatlantic defense and security, told VOA’s Ukrainian service that the United States should enter talks with Russia only having 'equipped Ukraine with the strongest possible means' and using its toughest 'diplomatic tools.' She added that the issue of Ukraine’s possible membership in NATO should not be included in talks with Russia. 'To discuss that with a non-NATO member … I don’t believe it is advantageous to any negotiation,' Sendak said, noting that it would give Russia 'veto power, if you will, over … choosing members to join the alliance or not.' Negotiating tactics Josh Rudolph, a German Marshall Fund senior fellow and head of its Transatlantic Democracy Working Group, worked on Russian and Ukrainian policy at the National Security Council during the first Trump administration. Last month, he offered policy recommendations to the current Trump administration on ending the Ukraine conflict. Among them: 'Approach [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from a position of strength. Whereas Putin looked tough and capable at the outset of Trump’s first term, his blunder in Ukraine has left him diminished. … As the dominant partner in this relationship, Trump, not Putin, can set negotiating terms.' 'Know when to walk away. A critical moment in the negotiations will come when Putin refuses to make major concessions. Trump must be prepared to walk away.' 'Combine sanctions with lower oil and gas prices. The best way to make Putin to see that pressing on in Ukraine would spell disaster for his rule is to pressure Russia financially. … Harnessing his warmer relationship with Saudi Arabia than [former President Joe] Biden enjoyed, Trump should flood the fossil fuel market, which would make the sanctions sustainable, starve Russia’s war machine, and generate political stability risks in Moscow.' Rudolph also recommended arming Ukraine 'to the hilt'; giving it 'all $300 billion of Russia’s frozen assets'; making Europe 'pay more for weapons' and provide 100,000 troops as 'peacekeepers'; enabling 'American companies to rebuild Ukraine'; and inviting Ukraine to join NATO should Putin refuse to accept 'reasonable' peace deal terms. Rudolph told VOA that Trump could convince those in the U.S. now skeptical of continuing to arm Ukraine that doing so as part of a peace deal would benefit American workers. '[H]e tells them, OK, now we’ve got a good deal, it’s secured by rare earth [minerals], it has ended the war, and in order to hold it together, we’re going to need to provide a continued stream of good old American-made weapons, which by the way, create all of these American jobs and facilities and factories across red states.' Touting economic benefits In a report titled 'Dollars and Sense: America’s Interest in a Ukrainian Victory,' Elaine McCusker, Frederick W. Kagan and Richard Sims of the American Enterprise Institute looked at the cost of ending support for Ukraine, concluding that this would lead to Ukraine’s defeat and Russia’s advance farther into Europe, forcing the U.S. to surge its presence in Europe. Among the report’s conclusions: 'Supporting Ukraine to victory against Russia is in the best interest of the United States.' 'A world in which Russia prevails would be more dangerous and more expensive for America — requiring an estimated increase of $808 billion in defense spending over five years.' 'Alternatively, an increased and accelerated multinational commitment to Ukraine and the conclusion of the war in the near term would result in a vibrant and free Ukraine with a newly modernized and battle-tested military and a thriving industrial base, which would help stabilize Europe.' In an interview with VOA, Frederick Kagan said a Russian victory in Ukraine would be a victory for Iran, China and North Korea, encouraging adventurism in their respective regions, and allow Russia to rebuild its army by obtaining additional human and material resources within Ukraine. A Russian takeover of Ukraine would send a wave of refugees into Europe, further destabilizing the continent, Kagan said. 'They’ve committed atrocities on the Ukrainian population in the areas they occupy. I would expect that would get worse the further west the Russians move and the more they move into the hardest traditional anti-Russian, pro-Western areas of western Ukraine. The horrors will be unspeakable,' he predicted. He said surged assistance to Ukraine would turn it into a bulwark for European peace and security — a country with a battle-tested army and rapidly developing military industry — thereby allowing the U.S. to focus on other regions. Middle road approach The Heritage Foundation’s 'Project 2025 Presidential Transition Project' includes policy recommendations concerning the Russia-Ukraine war. It noted that the American conservative movement is split over Ukraine — one side supports Kyiv, the other favors walking away — and offered a middle road. Among Project 2025’s recommendations: 'With respect to Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military aid (while European allies address Ukraine’s economic needs); and have a clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.' 'Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland. The conflict has severely weakened Putin’s military strength and provided a boost to NATO unity and its importance to European nations.' 'The next conservative president has a generational opportunity to bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions within the movement and chart a new path forward that recognizes Communist China as the defining threat to U.S. interests in the 21st century.' James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation who is responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, told VOA that it is in the U.S. interest to have a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself. 'For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself, and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine’s occupied by Russia. Now, having said that, are we … way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is ‘absolutely.’' In July, VOA published an interview with retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, serving as Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, that focused on his vision of ending the war in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-scenarios-for-securing-peace-in-ukraine/7983483.html	2025-02-21T09:51:15-08:00	
Motivations, ambitions of Congo’s M23 rebels unclear, analysts say	NAIROBI — A Rwandan government minister and the spokesperson of the M23 rebel group were sanctioned Thursday by the United States for alleged involvement in the recent conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. This comes after M23 fighters on Feb. 16 marched unopposed through Bukavu, three weeks after taking over Goma — eastern Congo’s biggest city. The recent advances made by the group were not surprising, as the DRC, the United Nations and many foreign governments say the fighters are heavily armed and supported by Rwanda, a country with a strong military force, analysts told VOA. Sasha Lezhnev, senior policy adviser at The Sentry, a Washington NGO, who specializes in U.S.-Africa policy on human rights and conflict, cited numerous United Nations investigative reports over the last three years showing that Rwanda is arming and supporting the M23. 'The latest report in December stated that Rwanda had three to four thousand of its own troops in the DRC,' Lezhnev said. While Rwanda denies the allegations, Lezhnev said this crisis would have been preventable if the outside world had not recently taken its eyes off the situation. 'They [Rwanda] started rearming and reorganizing the M23 about four years ago and, back in 2023, the United States brokered an intelligence-sharing agreement and even sanctioned some Rwandan generals for supporting the M23,' Lezhnev said. 'Then Rwanda basically responded, promoting the generals and continuing to escalate the situation, as well as the DRC reneging on its promise to stop arming and supporting the FDLR.' Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame accuses the DRC of backing FDLR — the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a Congo-based, mainly Hutu rebel group that includes some fighters who were involved in Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. The Tutsi-led M23, short for the March 23 Movement, first seized control of Goma in 2012. The group was pushed back the next year by the Congolese army, some of its regional allies, and special operations forces of the U.N. Stabilization Mission in the DRC. The group has been among more than 130 armed groups operating in the eastern DRC, mainly in the North and South Kivu provinces, vying for control of valuable and abundant mineral wealth including gold, diamonds, uranium and copper, as well as coltan and cobalt, major components in batteries used in electric cars, cellphones and other electronics. Claude Gatebuke, a Rwandan genocide survivor and coauthor of the book Survivors Uncensored, said Rwanda is not the only backer of the M23. 'It’s Rwanda and Uganda under the leadership of Paul Kagame and Yoweri Museveni who are invading Congo to provide access to Congo resources to ... mostly Western multinationals. This is all well documented,' Gatebuke said. Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, based in Washington, called the situation confusing. 'Uganda has troops in DRC that are fighting conjointly with the Congolese, against the ADF, the Allied Democratic Forces, an Islamist Ugandan group based in that part of the country,' Dizolele said. 'It’s confusing in the sense that on one level, Ugandans are collaborating with the government of DRC ... and on other hand, they’ve been reported to be engaged in this instabilization [instability], as well.' Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni recently said he is ready to assist with peace initiatives in the DRC. M23 leaders have said they plan to go all the way to Kinshasa. 'We ... do not know fully what they want, so it’s gone anywhere from, ‘Are they only trying to hold part of the Kivus and surrounding areas and set some kind of domination there?’ Or are they willing to go to Kinshasa?' Dizolele said. Gatebuke added: 'For sure they are trying to carve off the Kivus. The problem that they have, they would’ve been able to do this a long time ago had it not been for the Congolese not wanting to be in separate countries. … So, they are going to try to keep that area by force for as long as they can ... set up their own government and pretty much try to run a parallel country inside of the [DR] Congo.' A statement posted Feb. 17 on X by the M23 reiterated the group’s call for a direct and sincere dialogue with the DRC government. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference last week, DRC President Felix Tshisekedi criticized the outside world for not taking action against Rwanda in light of the escalating violence in his country. On Thursday, a Rwandan government minister and the spokesperson of the M23 rebel group were sanctioned by the United States for their alleged involvement in the recent escalation. In response, Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told VOA the recent sanctions are unjustified. 'This kind of punitive measures cannot contribute toward peace and stability in our region,' Nduhungirehe said. The government also says the country’s only aim is a secure border and that for the last three years, the conflict has involved hostile forces — including Congolese armed forces and FDLR — that have not been sanctioned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/motivations-ambitions-of-congo-s-m23-rebels-unclear-analysts-say/7983473.html	2025-02-21T09:25:59-08:00	
Rubio highlights emerging terror threat in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late Thursday there are ungoverned regions in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan that provide opportunities for extremist groups to operate. The comments came in an interview with former CBS correspondent Catherine Herridge on X, where Rubio was asked if intelligence indicates that al-Qaida and Islamic State had set up safe havens in Afghanistan, posing a threat comparable to the one preceding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 'I wouldn’t say it’s the pre-9/11 landscape, but I think anytime you have governing spaces that are contested that you don’t have a government that has full control of every part of their territory, it creates the opportunity for these groups,' Rubio said. 'The difference between today and 10 years ago is that we don’t have American elements on the ground to target and go after them,' the top U.S. diplomat noted. Rubio added that in some cases, the Taliban has been cooperative when 'told that ISIS or al-Qaida is operating in this part of your country' and to go after them. Not so much in other cases, he said. 'So, I would say that I wouldn’t compare it to pre-9/11, but it’s certainly far more uncertain — and it’s not just limited to Afghanistan,' Rubio said. The Taliban did not immediately respond to Rubio’s remarks, but they have persistently claimed to be in control of the entire country and rejected that any foreign terrorist organizations are on Afghan soil. Rubio’s comments came just days after the United Nations reported that al-Qaida operatives continued to find shelter across Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban's intelligence agency. 'The Taliban maintained a permissive environment allowing al-Qaida to consolidate, with the presence of safe houses and training camps scattered across Afghanistan,' read the report. It also described an Afghan-based Islamic State affiliate, the Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K, as 'the greatest extra-regional terrorist threat.' The U.N. assessment highlighted that in addition to attacks on Taliban authorities and Afghan religious minorities, IS-K supporters conducted strikes as far away as Europe, and that the group 'was actively seeking to recruit from among Central Asian states' bordering Afghanistan. The Taliban militarily swept back to power in August 2021 when the then-Afghan government collapsed as all U.S.-led NATO allied troops withdrew from the country after a nearly two-decade-long presence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-highlights-emerging-terror-threat-in-afghanistan/7983365.html	2025-02-21T08:03:28-08:00	
Half-billion people attend Hindu festival in India	MUMBAI, INDIA — Even for the world’s most-populous nation, the scale of a Hindu religious festival being held in India’s northern city of Prayagraj since mid-January is staggering. Surpassing previous numbers, the Maha Kumbh Mela that wraps up Wednesday has drawn more than half a billion devotees in the last six weeks, according to officials. The government of Uttar Pradesh, where the festival is being held, claims that this year's event is the largest congregation in human history for a religious, cultural and social event. Those who have taken a holy dip in waters that Hindus believe cleanses them of their sins and helps attain salvation include ordinary devotees from all walks of life, billionaires, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, politicians and Bollywood stars. Others went to simply witness the mesmerizing panorama of the religious spectacle that unfolds along the confluence of two rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna, where Hindus believe a third, mythical river also exists. Among the first rush of pilgrims to attend the Kumbh Mela when it began last month was Deepinderr Singh Bindra, a resident of Gurugram in North India. 'It was the accumulation of my spiritual journey following my visit to several Hindu pilgrim sites in the last few years,' he said. He took an early morning dip on three consecutive days and 'found it a surreal, deeply satisfying experience.' The pull of the Maha or great Kumbh Mela, which is held every 12 years, became even greater for many devotees because this year’s event was considered special — it coincided with an alignment of the planets and stars that occurs once in 144 years. The festival was marred by a stampede on Jan. 29 that killed 30 pilgrims who were trampled amid the rush to take part in the bathing on a day considered particularly auspicious. That tragedy, however, failed to dampen the fervor as millions continued to pour into the vast temporary tented township that covers a stretch of 4,000 hectares, or 40 square kilometers, along the banks of the river. The tented township includes roads, hospitals, toilets and free community kitchens run by volunteers. A platform made of sandbags stretches along the Ganges riverbank for devotees to take part in the ritual immersion. But for many like Mumbai resident Nikhil Shirodkar, joining the festival was not just about the dip in the river but a once-in-a-lifetime experience that offered a chance for a connection with age-old Hindu traditions. 'I went more as a spiritual seeker and not with the belief that the dip cleanses one’s sins,' he said. He spent three days sleeping on the floor like an ascetic and helping serve meals to people. 'It was an eye opener. Everybody was reaching out to each other. On the roadside some would be serving tea, others biscuits, to the pilgrims who kept pouring in. It had an impact on my outlook,' Shirodkar said. Others, especially overseas visitors, were drawn to it by a sense of curiosity. Twenty-one-year-old Lucinda Pernell, who had come from Australia to India to attend a yoga camp, decided to attend after learning from her photographer friend about the festival’s immense scale. 'It was overwhelming because there were just so many people, which a Westerner like me has never seen. But I found it amazing. It was a kind of organized chaos, but what I will take back with me is that people respected each other. There was a sense of belief,' she said, recalling the experience. On one of the days that she was there, considered an especially auspicious day, an estimated 35 million took a dip in the waters in Prayagraj — that’s more people than the population of Australia. She visited the camp for Naga sadhus, the ash-smeared, often naked Hindu ascetics, who armed with tridents lead the religious spectacle. It’s one of the most dramatic sights of the festival. At this year’s festival, the sacred coexisted with high technology, as underwater drones and artificial intelligence systems were used to monitor the crowds and improve safety. The Kumbh Mela also reflected the growing synergy between religion and politics since Prime Minister Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata party came to power 10 years ago, according to political analyst Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay. Giant billboards of Modi stood high at the festival site. 'The open, publicized participation of top political leaders at a religious festival is not something you witnessed in the past,' he said, pointing out that lines between religion and the state have been increasingly blurred. Besides Modi, who took a dip in the river, the Uttar Pradesh state government, led by a Hindu monk, held a Cabinet meeting at the site of the festival. Reasserting a Hindu cultural identity has been part of the BJP’s agenda. Under the rule of the country’s erstwhile Mughal rulers, the city where it took place was earlier known as Allahabad. It was renamed Prayagraj in 2018 by the BJP state government in a bid to restore its identity as a Hindu pilgrimage center. Mukhopadhyay also pointed out that the elaborate facilities built for the festival at a cost of over $8 billion, included upscale accommodations, airport and railway expansions and new roads. 'With facilities like air-conditioned tents and roads, the rich and upper middle classes no longer had to trek for miles as devotees did in earlier days. So for many of them, attending the Kumbh transitioned from a purely religious pilgrimage into a social talking point,' he said. Questions have been raised about the water in which the devotees immerse themselves. A report by the federal government’s Central Pollution Control Board earlier this month said that there were high levels of contamination in a key bathing place. But the Uttar Pradesh state government rejected the report, saying authorities were continuously monitoring water in the rivers to maintain its quality. At last count provided by the state government, 550 million had attended the festival. With five more days to go until it culminates on Wednesday, which is considered another auspicious day, those numbers will rise. Among those who plan to travel to Prayagraj on that day is Bindra, the resident of Gurugram. 'I will be going again to take another dip,' he said. 'It is a calling for me.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/half-billion-people-attend-hindu-festival-in-india/7983298.html	2025-02-21T07:39:41-08:00	
Russian region holding Ukrainian Prisoners of War as ‘bargaining chip’	RFE/RL — Iya Rashevskaya was told her husband — a member of the country’s armed forces – had gone missing in the frontline in the eastern Donetsk region, in April 2023. The news of Serhiy Skotarenko’s disappearance came just a month after he had joined the military, having given up his job abroad. Rashevskaya soon found out that her husband, a native of Ukraine’s southeastern Zaporizhzhya region, was alive and being held captive in Chechnya along with several other Ukrainian prisoners of war. A Ukrainian soldier who was released in a prisoner swap in June 2023 told Rashevskaya that he and Skotarenko had been held in the same jail in Chechnya. Rashevskaya recalls getting an unexpected, brief video call from her husband in August 2023. 'My husband asked about me and our children. He also asked me to help him to return home, saying we were his only hope,' Rashevskaya said. 'He looked awful, he has lost a lot of weight.' Ukrainian captives in Chechnya 'were being held in a basement and survived on instant noodles, bread, and water,' according to Rashevskaya. Ukrainian authorities estimate that more than 150 Ukrainian POWs are currently being held in Chechnya, a Russian region ruled by authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov says the soldiers were captured by Chechen military units fighting alongside other Russian forces in Ukraine. But Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs has claimed that Chechnya also often 'buys' Ukrainian captives from various Russian military units to use them as a bargaining chip in negotiations. RFE/RL cannot independently verify the claim. Some of the Ukrainian captives were exchanged with Chechen fighters seized by Ukrainian forces. Kadyrov, a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has sent thousands of Chechen fighters to Ukraine since the invasion began three years ago. In December 2024, Kadyrov threatened to use Ukrainian captives as human shields to protect strategically important buildings in Grozny from Ukrainian drone attacks. He said he would place them on the rooftops of buildings. He made the statement after Ukrainian drones reportedly hit a police campus in the Chechen capital. In January 2024, Kadyrov offered to release 20 Ukrainian captives in exchange for the removal of U.S. sanctions against his relatives and horses. Kadyrov, 48, and several of his family members, including his mother, Aymani Kadyrova, have been sanctioned by the United States and the European Union in recent years. Kadyrova, 71, is the head of the Kadyrov Foundation, which runs reeducation programs for Ukrainian children abducted by Russian forces from occupied territories. Washington imposed sanctions on Kadyrova and the Foundation in August 2023. Kadyrov was sanctioned by Washington in 2017 and 2020 over accusations of human rights abuses. PR campaign for Kadyrov Chechen human rights lawyer Abubakar Yangulbaev says Kadyrov directly controls any prisoner swaps involving the Ukrainians captives in Chechnya. 'While the Chechens fighting in Ukraine are part of Russian troops, Chechnya also has its own interests. It’s important for Kadyrov to secure the release of the Chechens captured in Ukraine to protect his own reputation before his people, whom he constantly calls to go to fight in Ukraine,' Yangulbaev told RFE/RL. 'It is a PR campaign for Kadyrov,' he added. Chechnya has never released the exact number or Ukrainian POWs it holds. According to Maria Klimik, a reporter for the Ukraine-based monitor, Media Initiative for Human Rights, in some cases the Ukrainian and Chechen sides have swapped captured soldiers 'informally' in the battlefields in Ukraine without involving a third party. Klimik told RFE/RL that Ukrainian POWs in Chechnya are usually held in dark, windowless basements of buildings – presumably police stations. Prisoners sleep on utility shelves as there are no beds in the basements, Klimik said citing accounts of former POWs. RFE/RL cannot independently verify the claims. In his New Year address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that 3,956 Ukrainian soldiers had been freed in prisoners’ exchanges between Kyiv and Moscow since the beginning of the invasion. There has been no public mention of any direct prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Chechnya, as the families of the captives in Grozny call for their release.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-region-holding-ukrainian-prisoners-of-war-as-bargaining-chip-/7983230.html	2025-02-21T06:11:06-08:00	
Netanyahu: Hamas will 'pay the price' for not returning body of Israeli hostage	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday Hamas will 'pay the price' for failing to release the body of hostage Shiri Babas, according to the peace agreement with Israel. 'We will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages -- both living and dead -- and ensure Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement,' Netanyahu said in a video statement. 'Not only did they abduct the father, Yarden Bibas, the young mother, Shiri, and their two small infants in an unimaginably cynical manner, but they also failed to return Shiri to her small children, the little angels, and instead placed the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin,' he said. Hamas said Friday Shiri Babas’ remains appeared to have been mixed with other human remains from rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit the place she was held, the Reuter News Agency reported. The bodies of three Israeli hostages and the body of a fourth, unidentified woman, were returned to Israel on Thursday in the latest release under a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group Hamas. Hundreds of people gathered in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where Hamas handed over four black coffins to the Red Cross, which took them away in a convoy and delivered them to the Israeli military. An Israeli procession passed through areas where people gathered on the side of the road holding Israeli flags. The bodies arrived several hours later at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to confirm their identities. Those released Thursday included the youngest captives – infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas. The body of their mother, Shiri Bibas, was also supposed to be released. But on Friday, local time, the Israeli military said the female body was not Shiri Bibas. The body does not belong to any other hostage and remains unidentified, the military said. The Israeli military accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement. 'This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is obliged under the agreement to return four deceased hostages,' the military said in a statement. Israel’s United Nations representative Danny Danon also condemned Hamas for returning an unidentified body. 'Hamas returned an unidentified body, as if it were a worthless shipment. This is a new low, an evil and cruelty with no parallel,' Danon said in a statement. The Bibas family was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video of the abduction showed Shiri Bibas swaddling the boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. Hamas has said the boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, was also released on Thursdsay. 'We received with deep sorrow the official and bitter news confirming the identification of our beloved Oded's body,' the Lifshitz family said in a statement released by a group representing family members of those taken hostage on Oct. 7, 2023. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on X that the hearts of the entire nation 'lie in tatters.' 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness,' Herzog said. 'Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday would be 'a day of grief' for his nation. Hundreds of people gathered in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where Hamas handed over four black coffins to the Red Cross, which took them away in a convoy and delivered them to the Israeli military. An Israeli procession passed through areas where people gathered on the side of the road holding Israeli flags. The bodies arrived several hours later at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to confirm their identities. Before transferring the four coffins to the Red Cross, Hamas had them displayed on a stage at the handover site along with flags and banners. One of the banners accused Netanyahu of being a war criminal and said Israeli airstrikes killed the hostages. The United Nations criticized what it called the 'abhorrent and cruel' staging of the event, with U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk saying Thursday the remains need to be respected. 'Under international law, any handover of the remains of deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' Türk said in a statement. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has facilitated the hostage and prisoner releases so far, also had called for handovers of bodies 'to be done privately out of utmost respect for the deceased and those left grieving.' On Saturday, six living hostages are set to be released in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians detained by Israeli forces in Gaza during the war. Israel and Hamas are in the process of implementing the first phase of a ceasefire that began on Jan. 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. A Hamas spokesperson on Thursday accused Netanyahu of 'procrastinating regarding the second phrase,' saying the group was 'ready to engage.' A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the remaining hostages may be released together during the next phase of the truce. 'We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,' senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told the news agency. Hamas is believed to be holding 66 more captives, about half of them living. The group has said it will release the remaining hostages only in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-hamas-will-pay-the-price-for-not-returning-body-of-israeli-hostage-/7983003.html	2025-02-21T01:42:42-08:00	
Commercial airlines warned as Chinese navy holds live-fire exercises off Australia	SYDNEY — Airlines modified flight paths between Australia and New Zealand on Friday after China notified Australia that the People's Liberation Army Navy would hold live-fire exercises off the New South Wales coast in international waters, a rare event. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters on Friday afternoon that the time period for the Chinese navy exercises had expired, and it was unclear if live fire had been used by the Chinese navy. 'China issued, in accordance with practice, an alert that it would be conducting these activities, including the potential use of live fire. It's outside of Australia's exclusive economic zone,' he said, indicating it was at least 370 kilometers offshore. 'According to defense, there has been no imminent risk of danger to any Australian assets or New Zealand assets, and that's why this notification occurs,' he added. A People's Liberation Army Navy frigate, cruiser and replenishment vessel last week entered Australia's maritime approaches, and traveled down Australia's east coast this week, monitored by the navies and air forces of Australia and New Zealand. Airlines were contacted by Australia's air traffic control agency on Friday warning them of reports of live fire where the Chinese navy task group was operating, the agency and Australian officials said. 'The Civil Aviation Authority and Airservices Australia are aware of reports of live firing in international waters,' air traffic control agency Airservices Australia said in a statement. 'As a precaution, we have advised airlines with flights planned in the area,' it added. Qantas and its low-cost arm Jetstar were monitoring the airspace and temporarily adjusted some flights across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Air New Zealand said it had modified flight paths as needed to avoid the area, with no impact to its operations, while Virgin Australia was following instructions from Airservices Australia. Albanese said he had contacted New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon about the matter. 'The chief of the defense force has advised that it's not clear whether there was any actual live fire used in this area, but it is consistent with international law,' Albanese said. Foreign Minister Penny Wong would raise the matter with her Chinese counterpart in South Africa, where they are attending the G20 foreign ministers meeting, he added. Wong said the live fire was 'an evolving situation.' 'We do have concerns about the transparency associated with this and the notice, and I certainly will be having a discussion with (China's) Foreign Minister Wang about that,' she said in an ABC television interview Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/commercial-airlines-warned-as-chinese-navy-holds-live-fire-exercises-off-australia/7982998.html	2025-02-21T01:15:09-08:00	
US tax agency fires 6,000 amid federal government downsizing	A tearful executive at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service told staffers on Thursday that about 6,000 employees would be fired, a person familiar with the matter said, in a move that would eliminate roughly 6% of the agency's workforce in the midst of the busy tax-filing season. The cuts are part of President Donald Trump's sweeping downsizing effort that has targeted bank regulators, forest workers, rocket scientists and tens of thousands of other government employees. The effort is being led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, Trump's biggest campaign donor. Musk was on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, when Argentine President Javier Milei, known for wielding a chain saw to illustrate his drastic policies slashing government spending, handed him one. 'This is the chain saw for bureaucracy,' said Musk, holding the power tool aloft as a stage prop to symbolize the drastic slashing of government jobs. Labor unions have sued to try to stop the mass firings, under which tens of thousands of federal workers have been told they no longer have a job, but a federal judge in Washington on Thursday ruled that they can continue for now. Christy Armstrong, IRS director of talent acquisition, teared up as she told employees on a phone call that about 6,000 of their colleagues would be laid off and encouraged them to support each other, a worker who was on the call said. 'She was pretty emotional,' the worker said. The layoffs are expected to total 6,700, according to a person familiar with the matter, and largely target workers at the agency hired as part of an expansion under Democratic President Joe Biden, who had sought to expand enforcement efforts on wealthy taxpayers. Republicans have opposed the expansion, arguing that it would lead to harassment of ordinary Americans. The tax agency now employs roughly 100,000 people, compared with 80,000 before Biden took office in 2021. Independent budget analysts had estimated that the staff expansion under Biden would work to boost government revenue and help narrow trillion-dollar budget deficits. 'This will ensure that the IRS is not going after the wealthy and is only an agency that's really focused on the low income,' said University of Pittsburgh tax law professor, Philip Hackney, a former IRS lawyer. 'It's a travesty.' Those fired include revenue agents, customer-service workers, specialists who hear appeals of tax disputes, and IT workers, and impact employees across all 50 states, sources said. The IRS did not respond to a request for comment. The IRS has taken a more careful approach to downsizing than other agencies, given that it is in the middle of the tax-filing season. The agency expects to process more than 140 million individual returns by the April 15 filing deadline and will retain several thousand workers deemed critical for that task, one source said. The Trump administration's federal layoffs have focused on workers across the government who are new to their positions and have fewer protections than longer-tenured employees. Meanwhile, the Trump White House is also preparing to dissolve the leadership of the U.S. Postal Service and absorb the independent agency into the Commerce Department, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Waiting for dismissal email At the IRS's Kansas City office, probationary workers found all functions had been disabled on their computers except email, which would deliver their dismissal notices, said Shannon Ellis, a local union leader. 'What the American people really need to understand is that the funds that are collected through the Internal Revenue Service, they fund so many programs that we use every day in our society,' Ellis told Reuters. The White House has not said how many of the nation's 2.3 million civil-service workers it wants to fire and has given no numbers on the mass layoffs. Roughly 75,000 took a buyout offer last week. The campaign has delighted Republicans for culling a federal workforce they view as bloated, corrupt and insufficiently loyal to Trump, while also taking aim at government agencies that regulate big business -- including those that oversee Musk's companies SpaceX, Tesla and Neuralink. The small unit within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that regulates the kind of autonomous cars that Musk says are the future of Tesla is losing nearly half of its staff, the Post reported on Thursday. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team has also canceled contracts worth about $8.5 billion involving foreign aid, diversity training and other initiatives opposed by Trump. Both men have set a goal of cutting at least $1 trillion from the $6.7 trillion federal budget, though Trump has said he will not touch popular benefits programs that make up roughly one-third of that total. Democratic critics have said Trump is exceeding his constitutional authority and hacking away at popular and critical government programs at the expense of legions of middle-class families. Most Americans worry the cost-cutting could hurt government services, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday. Some agencies have struggled to comply with the rapid-fire directives Trump has issued since taking office a month ago. Workers who oversee U.S. nuclear weapons were fired and then recalled, while medicines and food exports have been stranded in warehouses by Trump's freeze on foreign aid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-tax-agency-fires-6-000-amid-federal-government-downsizing/7982991.html	2025-02-21T00:57:35-08:00	
Costa Rica and Honduras join Panama as stopovers for foreign deportees	SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA — A group of families and children hailing from Uzbekistan, China, Afghanistan, Russia and more countries climbed down the stairs of an airplane in Costa Rica's capital Thursday, the first flight of deportees from other nations Costa Rica agreed to hold in detention facilities for the Trump administration while it organized the return back to their countries. The flight of 135 deportees, half of them minors, added Costa Rica to a growing list of Latin American nations to serve as a stopover for migrants as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to step up deportations. While Costa Rica joins Panama in holding deportees from mostly Asian origin until their repatriation can be arranged or they can seek protection somewhere, Honduras on Thursday also facilitated a handoff of deportees between the U.S. and Venezuela from a flight coming from Guantanamo Bay. The migrants arriving in Costa Rica will be bused to a rural holding facility near the Panama border, where they will be detained up to six weeks and be flown back to their countries of origin, said Omer Badilla, Costa Rica’s deputy minister of the interior and police. The U.S. government will cover the costs. The arrangement is part of a deal the Trump administration struck with Costa Rica during U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit earlier this month. It comes as Trump has pressured countries across the region to help facilitate deportations at times under the threat of steep tariffs or sanctions. Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves told reporters Wednesday that his country is helping its 'economically powerful brother from the north.' Similar agreements have been reached with other Latin American nations, but the concept of using third countries as deportation layovers has drawn strong criticism from human rights advocates. Beyond the conditions of their detention in Costa Rica, concerns revolve around international protections for asylum seekers and whether these deportees will be appropriately screened before being returned to their countries or sent to yet another country. Panama this week became the first such country to accept 299 deportees from other nations, with the government holding them in hotel rooms guarded by police. About one-third of those who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were sent to a remote camp in Darien province bordering Colombia on Wednesday. The rest were awaiting commercial flights back home. 'We’ve thrown out the possibility of a hotel, precisely to avoid a situation similar to that in Panama,' Badilla, the Costa Rican official, told The Associated Press. Honduras said Thursday it also acted as a brief stopover for a deportation flight of Venezuelans coming from Guantanamo Bay in what it described as a 'humanitarian bridge' since there are no direct flights between the United States and Venezuela. A U.S. flight carrying 170 Venezuelans landed Thursday in a joint U.S.-Honduran military base in central Honduras, and within hours were transferred to a Venezuelan aircraft. An official with Honduras’ foreign ministry said this was not a routine arrangement, but that the Central American nation remains open to facilitating more transfers between the two adversaries. Badilla said that Thursday's deportation flight from San Diego is largely made up of families, including 65 children, two pregnant women and an elderly woman. He said Costa Rica was told by the Trump administration that most of the deportees have agreed to voluntarily return to their countries. If they refuse, Costa Rica is open to offering deportees refuge or will work with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, IOM, to facilitate travel to another third country. 'Costa Rica is a country that guarantees human rights,' he said. 'We are going to guarantee that they are returned to safe countries. We cannot leave that to chance because of an ethical and moral commitment of our country.' In the meantime, migrants will be detained in the border facility, where they will be accompanied by U.N. officials, the Red Cross and other aid-focused government entities to 'guarantee their rights,' Badilla said. The facility being used to hold migrants, a former factory, has faced criticisms for its conditions in the past. During a visit by the AP in October 2023, migrants were fenced off in cramped facilities and said they felt like 'prisoners.' Many slept in tents on the ground, where some said liquid from portable toilets leaked. Badilla said that facilities have since been improved, but the government has denied journalists access to the building. The facility will also be processing a 'reverse flow' of migrants from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador that previously sought asylum in the U.S. and now want to return home. Badilla said Costa Rica has seen between 50 and 75 migrants headed south entering the country a day. IOM said in a statement to the AP that 'we do not have direct involvement in the detention or restriction of movement of individuals' and that it was providing humanitarian support and supporting voluntary returns to their countries and 'identifying safe alternatives for others.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/costa-rica-and-honduras-join-panama-as-stopovers-for-foreign-deportees-/7982987.html	2025-02-21T00:43:08-08:00	
China's military says it drove away Philippine aircraft near Spratly Islands	BEIJING — China's military said it warned and drove away three Philippine aircraft that 'illegally intruded' into the airspace near the Spratly Islands on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Philippine Embassy in Beijing on the Chinese military's statement issued on Friday. China's Southern Theatre Command accused the Philippine side of attempting to 'peddle its illegal claims' through provocation and warned that the 'clumsy maneuver is doomed to failure.' China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, putting it at odds with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. A 2016 arbitration ruling invalidated China's expansive claim, but Beijing does not recognize the decision. On Thursday, the Philippines said its coast guard and fisheries bureau had jointly carried out a maritime domain awareness flight over the Kalayaan Islands, the Philippine name for Spratly Islands. The mission was to assert the Philippines' sovereignty, sovereign rights, and maritime jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea, it said. More than 50 Chinese maritime militia vessels and a Chinese coast guard ship were spotted during the exercise. It was not immediately clear if that mission, which deployed two aircraft, was the one Chinese military said it responded to. The latest confrontation comes after Philippine coast guard accused the Chinese navy of performing dangerous flight maneuvers earlier this week when it flew close to a government aircraft patrolling the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Beijing disputed that account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-military-says-it-drove-away-philippine-aircraft-near-spratly-islands/7982985.html	2025-02-21T00:30:33-08:00	
South Korea's ousted PM says he tried to stop martial law decree	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's ousted premier said on Thursday that he had opposed suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law, testifying for the first time at his former boss's impeachment trial about the events of a night that threw the country into turmoil. Han Duck-soo was impeached by parliament as acting president and prime minister in December over alleged obstruction of the trial that could formally remove Yoon from office for his martial law decree. He appeared before that trial for the first time on Thursday, telling Seoul's Constitutional Court he had 'expressed my opposition' to Yoon's decision to suspend civilian rule on the night of Dec. 3. Han said he and most of his fellow cabinet members 'believed such a declaration would put South Korea in serious difficulty' and that he recalled them 'being concerned and trying to dissuade it.' The court said later on Thursday the final hearing will be held on the 25th. The judges will then deliberate behind closed doors, with elections required within 60 days if Yoon is removed. Yoon walked out of the court just five minutes after proceedings began on Thursday, according to a pool report. His lawyer Yoon Kap-keun told reporters the ousted president felt it was 'inappropriate' for him to sit in the same court room with Han 'or for the president to watch the prime minister testify.' 'It is not good for the nation's prestige,' his lawyer quoted Yoon as saying. Yoon returned later to hear the testimony of former senior intelligence official Hong Jang-won, seen as a key figure in the decision to declare martial law. Hong has claimed to be in possession of a memo containing a list of names of individuals Yoon ordered arrested during the night of the martial law declaration, including the leaders of the opposition and Yoon's own ruling party. 'I will do my best to recount everything as I remember it,' Hong told reporters before the hearing. Court footage showed Yoon shouting at Hong, accusing him of plotting his impeachment. Given the opportunity to speak by one of the court's eight judges, Yoon acknowledged that it was 'unnecessary and wrong' to try to track the locations of politicians on the night of the decree but also said he was doing it simply to 'monitor movements' and not to 'arrest' them. The head of South Korea's National Police Agency, who is also on trial on insurrection charges related to the martial law decree, is another witness. Courting controversy The impeachment hearing was Yoon's second of the day. He also appeared in court in the morning to answer charges of insurrection, becoming South Korea's first sitting president to stand trial in a criminal case. The 64-year-old former prosecutor has been behind bars since he was arrested last month on those charges, for which he could be sentenced to life in prison -- or face the death penalty -- if convicted. Yoon attended that hearing but did not speak, an AFP journalist in the packed courtroom said. Prosecutors have accused the suspended president of being the 'ringleader of an insurrection.' They argued on Thursday against releasing him, saying he could try to 'influence or persuade those involved in the case.' Yoon's lawyer Kim Hong-il condemned the 'illegal probe,' telling the court the 'investigating body has no jurisdiction.' 'The declaration of martial law was not intended to paralyze the state,' Kim said. Instead, he said, it was meant to 'alert the public to the national crisis caused by the legislative dictatorship of the dominant opposition party, which had crippled the administration.' Much of Yoon's impeachment trial has centered on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war. The crisis has plunged South Korea into months of political turmoil with protests, two impeachments and a surge of online disinformation. Yoon also sent a message rallying his supporters on Thursday, urging 'the older and established generations to work together with the younger generation.' 'If that happens, I will be able to swiftly return to my duties and lead South Korea with the power of generational integration,' Yoon said, according to his lawyers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-ousted-pm-says-he-tried-to-stop-martial-law-decree/7982981.html	2025-02-21T00:18:34-08:00	
South Korea requests exclusion from US plan to increase tariffs	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean officials have asked the Trump administration to exclude their country from U.S. plans to impose aggressive tariffs on trade partners, emphasizing that Seoul is already applying low duties on American products under the free trade agreement between the two nations. South Korea’s government on Friday said Deputy Trade Minister Park Jong-won made the request while traveling to Washington this week for meetings with unspecified officials from the White House, the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The South Korean Trade Ministry didn’t say what Park heard from the Americans. Park cited how South Korean companies were contributing to the U.S. economy through large-scale business investments and noted that the country was already imposing low duties on free trade partners such as the United States. He called for South Korea to be excluded from U.S. plans to establish reciprocal tariffs with trade partners and raise duties for imported steel and aluminum, the ministry said. South Korea’s top economic think tank this month slashed its growth forecast for the country’s economy for the second time since November, expressing concern about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s expanding tariffs and other measures aimed at resetting global trade. The state-run Korea Development Institute projected the national economy to grow by 1.6% in 2025, which was 0.4 percentage points lower than its previous estimate. The group’s economists assessed that Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs won’t likely have a major impact on South Korea’s economy, as those products account for less than 1% of its exports to the U.S. However, they expressed concern that possible increases in U.S. duties for semiconductors and cars would hurt the country’s trade-dependent economy more. South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, on Friday called a meeting with trade and foreign policy officials to discuss the potential impact of Trump’s trade measures, including reciprocal tariffs and possible product-specific duties for semiconductors, cars and pharmaceuticals. Choi, who is also South Korea’s finance minister, instructed officials to examine how other major economies, including the European Union, Japan and China, are responding to Trump’s trade policies, and try harder to effectively communicate South Korea’s position to U.S. officials. South Korea’s trade surplus with the U.S. reached $55.7 billion in 2024. According to the South Korean trade ministry, the country’s tariff rates on U.S. manufacturing imports is around zero percent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-requests-exclusion-from-us-plan-to-increase-tariffs/7982973.html	2025-02-20T23:45:09-08:00	
Philippine police arrest more than 450 in raid on alleged 'Chinese-run' scam center	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Philippine police arrested more than 450 people in a raid on an allegedly Chinese-run offshore gaming operator in Manila, the country's anti-organized crime commission has said. Initial interrogations suggested the suburban site had been operating as a scam center, targeting victims in China and India with sports betting and investment schemes, the commission said after the Thursday raid, which saw 137 Chinese nationals detained. 'We arrested around five Chinese bosses,' commission chief Gilberto Cruz told AFP on Friday, adding they faced potential trafficking charges. Banned by President Ferdinand Marcos last year, Philippine online gaming operators, or POGOs, are said to be used as cover by organized crime groups for human trafficking, money laundering, online fraud, kidnappings and even murder. 'This raid proves that the previous POGO workers are still trying to continue their scamming activities despite the ban,' Cruz said. He previously told AFP that about 21,000 Chinese nationals have continued to operate smaller-scale scam operations in the country since the online gaming ban. International concern has grown in recent years over similar scam operations in other Asian nations that are often staffed by trafficking victims tricked or coerced into promoting bogus cryptocurrency investments and other cons. President Marcos has put POGOs at the center of recent campaign messaging in the run-up to May mid-term elections, framing predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's alleged tolerance of the sites as evidence of a too-cozy relationship with China. Thursday's raid is the latest in a series of busts this year, including one in January that saw some 400 foreigners arrested in the capital, including many Chinese nationals. The Washington-based think tank United States Institute of Peace said in a May 2024 report that online scammers target millions of victims around the world and rake in annual revenues of $64 billion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-police-arrest-more-than-450-in-raid-on-alleged-chinese-run-scam-center/7982967.html	2025-02-20T23:32:08-08:00	
Netanyahu orders 'intensive' West Bank operations after Israel bus blasts	JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday ordered an 'intensive operation against centers of terrorism' in the occupied West Bank, his office said, after three buses exploded in central Israel without causing any reported injuries. Three devices detonated on buses in the city of Bat Yam on Thursday evening and two others were being defused, according to police, with Israel's defense minister accusing 'Palestinian terrorist' groups of being behind the blasts. Netanyahu's office said on social media early Friday that he had completed a security assessment with top officials, ordering fresh counterterrorism operations as well as stepped up security in Israeli cities. 'The Prime Minister has ordered the IDF (military) to carry out an intensive operation against centers of terrorism in Judea and Samaria,' Netanyahu's office said on X, using the biblical term for the West Bank. 'The Prime Minister also ordered the Israel Police and the ISA (internal security agency) to increase preventative activity against additional attacks in Israeli cities,' he added. A large number of police were deployed to search for suspects after the 'suspected terror attack,' the police force said in a statement. 'Police bomb disposal units are scanning for additional suspicious objects. We urge the public to avoid the areas and remain alert for any suspicious items,' it added. Tzvika Brot, the mayor of Bat Yam, said in a video statement that there were 'no injured in these incidents.' Security forces and bomb disposal units were seen by an AFP journalist as they inspected the remains of destroyed buses. Israeli media said that bus drivers countrywide had been asked to stop and inspect their vehicles for additional explosive devices. 'Intensify' West Bank raids A police commander from central Israel, Haim Sargarof, said in a televised briefing that the devices used to set off the blasts were similar to those found in the West Bank. Separately, Defense Minister Israel Katz said he ordered the military to 'intensify operations to thwart terrorism' in West Bank refugee camps, particularly Tulkarem. The military has been carrying out near-daily raids in West Bank cities and camps for several weeks now targeting Palestinian militants. Multiple Palestinian civilians have also been killed in the raids, while Israeli security forces have destroyed homes and infrastructure. The military operation has displaced more than 40,000 Palestinians, according to the United Nations. Violence in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has escalated since the October 2023 outbreak of war in the Gaza Strip. At least 897 Palestinians including militants have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since the Gaza war began, according to an AFP tally based on figures provided by the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah. At least 32 Israelis, including some soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or confrontations during Israeli operations in the West Bank over the same period, according to official Israeli figures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-orders-intensive-west-bank-operations-after-israel-bus-blasts/7982955.html	2025-02-20T23:08:35-08:00

US Senate Republicans push to pass border bill without Trump tax cuts	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday began a debate on a Republican bill to advance President Donald Trump's priorities on immigration, energy and defense, even after he urged lawmakers to scrap the effort in favor of a House of Representatives bill that would also include trillions of dollars in tax cuts. Trump this week came down firmly in favor of House Republicans' plan for a single sweeping bill. Backers of that plan fear that passing an immigration bill first could diminish their chances of extending $4.5 trillion in tax cuts in the House, where Republicans hold a narrow and fractious 218-215 majority. Senate Republicans said they would nonetheless push ahead with their narrower plan and address tax cuts in a later bill. They are seeking to bypass Democratic opposition in that chamber and secure an early legislative win for Trump. Democrats lack the votes to stop the bill but have vowed to fight it as long as possible, accusing Republicans of shortchanging American families to benefit the wealthy with tax breaks. 'We're going to be here all night,' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer proclaimed just before voting on amendments that began Thursday evening. Schumer introduced the first amendment, which seeks to prohibit tax cuts for those earning more than $1 billion. Republicans blocked the amendment. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine put the Senate on notice that he alone was seeking debate on about two dozen amendments ranging from middle-class tax cuts to measures protecting federal workers from termination and social safety net programs from cuts. Republican Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said earlier in the evening that there was an urgent need to beef up border security and the U.S. military. He argued that the higher spending ordered in the legislation would be 'offset with $342 billion in cuts in other parts of the government.' In a rarely used Senate process known as a 'vote-a-rama,' amendments can be offered until both parties agree to stop. Normally, the two parties agree upon a narrow set of amendments for debate in the full Senate on legislation. Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage over Democrats in the Senate, were expected to defeat scores of opposition amendments. Both chambers of Congress need to pass the same budget resolution to unlock the parliamentary tool that would enable Republicans to enact Trump's legislative agenda in a way that circumvents Democratic opposition and the Senate filibuster. Democrats made use of this maneuver in the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency, when they held majorities in both chambers of Congress. The Senate's bill, which leaves the issue of Trump's desired extension of his 2017 tax cuts to a later date, could serve as a backup in case the House Republicans cannot agree on how to pay for the tax cuts in their bill without slashing funding for popular safety net programs like Medicaid and Social Security or potentially adding to the country's $36 trillion debt. The Senate measure, a $340 billion fiscal 2025 budget resolution, would boost spending by $85 billion a year for four years to fund tighter border security, Trump's deportation of immigrants in the country illegally, energy deregulation, and an increase in military spending. The House budget resolution includes those same priorities along with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, while seeking to cover the cost through $2 trillion in spending cuts and accelerated economic growth based mainly on the tax and energy policy changes it would usher in.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-republicans-push-to-pass-border-bill-without-trump-tax-cuts-/7982905.html	2025-02-20T19:03:43-08:00

Mexico’s president calls for constitutional reform to protect nation's sovereignty	Mexico’s president said Thursday that she would propose constitutional reforms to protect her country’s sovereignty, after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump designated eight Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. 'The Mexican people will not accept under any circumstances interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that could be harmful to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the nation,' President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday in her morning press conference. Some in Mexico fear that the Trump administration’s designation of the drug cartels as terrorist organizations could be the first step to U.S. military action within Mexico, something Trump proposed during his presidential election campaign. On Thursday, the names of the cartels were published in the U.S. Federal Register, carrying out one of Trump’s Jan. 20 executive orders. The Mexican president said the U.S. did not consult with her government before making the designations, which are usually reserved for terrorist groups with political goals, not groups looking to make financial gains. Sheinbaum said that any foreign investigations or prosecutions conducted by foreign agents on Mexican soil could not move forward without the authorization by and collaboration with the Mexican government. 'What we want to make clear in the face of this designation is that we do not negotiate sovereignty,' Sheinbaum said. 'This cannot be an opportunity for the United States to invade our sovereignty.' Laws passed under Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, restricted the independence and movements of foreign agents in Mexico. Sheinbaum now wants those laws written into Mexico’s constitution. Sheinbaum also wants an addition to the constitution that would apply the stiffest penalties possible to people engaged in the manufacturing, smuggling and distribution of guns. This has long been a point of contention between Mexico and the U.S., as Mexico is flooded with guns from U.S. shops and manufacturers.

US flies Venezuelan migrants from Guantanamo to Honduras	The U.S. government flew 177 Venezuelan migrants from Guantanamo Bay to Honduras on Thursday, from where they are set to be transferred on to Venezuela, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security said. Earlier on Thursday, the Honduran government said about 170 Venezuelan migrants were set to arrive in the Central American nation from the United States, before being transported immediately back to Venezuela. The transfer of the migrants would take place at Soto Cano, a joint U.S.-Honduras military air base, the Honduran government said. Venezuela requested the repatriation of the citizens who it said were unjustly taken to Guantanamo naval base, Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said in a statement posted on Telegram, adding they would be flown from Honduras by Venezuelan airline Conviasa. The arrival in Venezuela is expected Thursday evening local time. Lawyers representing at least half a dozen of the deportees said they learned about the deportations on Thursday afternoon. The deportations come after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit last week seeking access to dozens of migrants flown to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to an attorney. The deportees included 126 people with criminal charges or convictions, 80 of whom were allegedly affiliated with Tren de Aragua, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said, adding that 51 had no criminal record. There are no migrant detainees left at Guantanamo after Thursday’s deportations, the spokesperson said. The U.S. has designated Tren de Aragua a global terrorist organization along with other organized crime groups, as President Donald Trump steps up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-flies-venezuelan-migrants-from-guantanamo-to-honduras/7982890.html	2025-02-20T17:54:54-08:00	
Trump order challenges independence of FCC, other agencies	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump this week signed an executive order intended to expand the White House’s authority over various independent regulatory agencies that Congress set up to be shielded from direct White House control, including the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The order, signed Tuesday, would require independent agencies to submit proposed regulations to the White House for review. The order also would require agencies to consult with the White House on their 'policies and priorities' and 'strategic plans.' 'These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people,' the order said. The executive order, titled 'Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies,' is expected to face challenges in court, according to legal experts. The move came as the president has worked to consolidate power within the executive branch, including by removing more than a dozen inspectors general who provided oversight at various government agencies. In addition to the FCC, agencies that would be affected by the new order include the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FCC does not directly regulate major news networks, but it does evaluate the actions of broadcasting stations around the U.S. that hold FCC licenses to use public airwaves. Former FCC chairs told VOA that the move would be a significant change for the FCC. 'It makes an independent agency that was created to be independent like an agency in the executive branch,' said Tom Wheeler, who served as FCC chairman under former President Barack Obama. Reed Hundt, who served as FCC chairman under former President Bill Clinton, agreed that the order would mark a departure from the agency’s nearly 100-year history. 'For 90 years, the governmental idea was that the president should not be regulating the media,' Hundt told VOA. Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican who served as an FCC commissioner under Clinton, told VOA that the order 'would have a major effect on rulemaking' at the FCC. He added that other areas, like enforcement, might not be affected. Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez told VOA that she was concerned by the order. 'Our informed decision-making is meant to be consistent with our technical expertise, not subject to political pressure,' Gomez told VOA in an emailed statement. Gomez added that Congress already provides oversight over the FCC. 'Efforts to expand executive influence on the FCC will only further diminish our standing as a stable, independent and expert-driven regulatory body,' said Gomez, who has served as a commissioner since 2023. Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, as well as Commissioners Geoffrey Starks and Nathan Simington, did not immediately reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment on the order. Carr and Simington are Republicans, Starks is a Democrat. Kim Zarkin, a professor of communication at Westminster University in Utah who has researched the FCC for three decades, said she thought it was important for the FCC and other independent agencies to remain as nonpolitical as possible. Even though commissioners at agencies such as the FCC are nominated by the president, 'there was always this expectation that these were meant to be nonpolitical,' Zarkin told VOA. 'They were meant to bring in expertise.' Zarkin, who has written two books on the FCC, said time will tell whether the order has any material impact on how the FCC and other agencies operate. Trump’s executive order comes amid concerns that the FCC is being weaponized to intimidate broadcasters through investigations, according to Democratic FCC commissioners and media law experts. The FCC is currently investigating broadcasters, including NPR, PBS, CBS and NBC. The FCC is investigating whether NPR and PBS member stations violated FCC rules on airing commercial ads. Both broadcasters deny wrongdoing. The CBS inquiry pertains to whether the broadcaster doctored an October '60 Minutes' interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. That interview is also at the center of a $10 billion lawsuit from Trump. CBS denied wrongdoing when Trump filed the lawsuit. Earlier this month, CBS published the interview’s unedited transcripts, which showed '60 Minutes' and 'Face the Nation' used slightly different parts of the same answer from Harris, which is common journalistic practice. The NBC investigation is into the company’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Democratic FCC commissioners and media law experts have expressed concern about the investigations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-order-challenges-independence-of-fcc-other-agencies/7982860.html	2025-02-20T17:16:01-08:00	
Pope Francis' health condition is stable, Vatican says	Pope Francis 'had a restful night,' and Thursday morning 'got out of bed and had breakfast in an armchair,' the Vatican said in a statement. Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital last week with bronchitis, which then developed into double pneumonia. Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said Thursday that the pope now has focal pneumonia with limited areas of infection in the lungs. Bruni said Francis is breathing on his own, and his heart is stable. An earlier statement Thursday reported the pope's clinical condition as 'stable,' and his blood tests had shown 'a slight improvement, particularly in the inflammatory indices.' Wednesday evening, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited the pope for 20 minutes in the hospital's special papal suite. 'We joked as always,' the prime minister said in a statement afterward. 'He hasn't lost his proverbial sense of humor.' Francis, whose birth name is Jorge Mario Bergoglio, has been the head of the Roman Catholic Church since 2013, when his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, resigned from the papacy. In a recent memoir, Francis addressed the possibility of his own resignation if he became incapacitated. He said such a move would be a 'distant possibility,' justified only if facing 'a serious physical impediment.' 'We are all worried about the pope,' Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, head of the Italian Bishops’ Conference, told Agence France-Presse. Zuppi said, however, that the reports about Francis eating and greeting people are good indications that 'we are on the right path to a full recovery, which we hope will happen soon.' Speaking at a Vatican news conference about a Mediterranean youth peace initiative, Cardinal Juan Jose Omella Omella of Barcelona compared the papacy to a train to give reassurances that the work of the papacy will continue, even with Francis' hospitalization. 'Popes change, we bishops change, priests in parishes change, communities change, but the train continues being on the move,' the cardinal said. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-health-condition-is-stable-vatican-says-/7982824.html	2025-02-20T17:00:09-08:00	
US State Department tweaks online fact sheet on China	WASHINGTON — PRC is out. China is in. That is among the significant modifications to the U.S. State Department’s online fact sheet on China, which drops the country’s official name, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), in favor of just China. Former President Joe Biden’s administration routinely referenced the Beijing government with the PRC abbreviation. Since former President Richard Nixon normalized relations with Beijing — ending recognition of the government in Taipei, the United States has maintained diplomatic ties with the communist-run government on the mainland while reducing the relationship with Taiwan — officially known as the Republic of China — to unofficial but friendly. 'Taipei should take solace in the fact that the change in the term [from PRC to China] does not represent a policy change in the United States. The fact of the matter is that the U.S. still has its ‘One China' policy, and under that policy, it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and robust unofficial relations with Taipei,' Russell Hsiao, Global Taiwan Institute executive director, told VOA. 'Since 1979, Washington has recognized the government in Beijing of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, so the change in term is essentially a different way of presenting the same set of facts, all of which haven't changed,' Hsiao said. China considers Taiwan a rogue province. Nationalist forces, backed by the United States and commanded by Chiang Kai-shek, fled the mainland for Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communist forces led by Mao Zedong. Chiang became Taiwan’s relatively benign dictator until his death in 1975. Mao ruled over the mainland as a rigid authoritarian until his death a year after Chiang died. Washington continues to provide Taipei with weapons and has left the question ambiguous as to whether the United States would use its military to defend the island if Taiwan were to be attacked. The Taiwan Relations Act commits the United States to help Taiwan defend itself, but the final decision on military intervention would rest with the president and Congress. Language changes last week by the State Department eliminated a reference to Washington not supporting Taiwan independence, but left intact was content noting that the United States opposes 'unilateral changes to the status quo' by either side of the Taiwan Strait. A significant change to the State Department’s web page on China, however, is the deletion of content on cooperating with allies on China-related issues and on helping Beijing with cultural matters and environmental protections. Instead, there is new language focusing on the U.S.-China trade relationship, noting the difficulty for American businesses to operate in China and that the Chinese economy is 'one of the most restrictive investment climates in the world.' Yet another shift in tone, in line with rhetoric used by President Donald Trump’s administration, is reflected by frequent references to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The party is directly accused of trying to 'manipulate and subvert' United Nations organizations and other international bodies and seeking to 'groom and install CCP members in leadership and other positions' in such groups. In the newly edited fact sheet, the CCP is also blamed for 'malicious cyber activity against U.S. government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks.' The document now notes the United States is dedicated to countering these activities 'to help protect American citizens, businesses and industries.' 'These moves reflect an overall sense in Washington and within the Trump administration that engagement with China has failed and a tougher approach is warranted,' Rorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA. 'This mood has been building — particularly in Congress — for years, and a change of emphasis is no surprise. However, swapping out PRC for China reflects a deeper and more dangerous narrative that attacks the CCP’s legitimacy as the governing authority of China. I expect this will be viewed with grave concern by Beijing and raised at the highest levels in the coming days and weeks,' added Daniels. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, responding during Thursday’s regular press briefing, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the website changes. The State Department’s actions 'misrepresent the facts, attack China’s foreign policy and peddle the so-called China-U.S. strategic competition. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose it,' Guo said. The changes come after Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China. The president said he was taking the action because Beijing’s government has failed to stop the flow into the United States of the illicit opioid fentanyl. Trump has also announced he intends to put in place further retaliatory tariffs on all trading partners that limit access for U.S. goods into their markets.

Trump administration reduces deportation protections for 521,000 Haitians	WASHINGTON — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday cut the duration of deportation protections and work permits for 521,000 Haitians covered by the Temporary Protected Status program so that they will expire in August, a Homeland Security Department spokesperson said. The decision reverses a Biden administration move last year to extend the protections through February 2026, the spokesperson said, saying the extension was unjustified. President Donald Trump, a Republican, tried to end most enrollment in the TPS program during his 2017-2021 presidency but was blocked by federal courts. Noem earlier this month revoked a Biden-era TPS extension for some 600,000 Venezuelans and terminated the status for half of them, whose protections and access to work permits expire in April. Trump falsely said during a September 2024 debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets, sparking fear of retaliation among Haitians in the city. Trump said a month later that if elected he would revoke TPS for Haitians and deport them. Noem will now need to decide whether to terminate the status for Haitians. 'President Trump and I are returning TPS to its original status: temporary,' she said in a statement. More than 1 million people, more than half of them children, are now displaced within Haiti where gang violence continues unabated despite the start of a United Nations-backed security mission last year, U.N. data published in January showed. Haiti has lacked elected representatives since 2023 and has not held elections since 2016. The country's capital is almost entirely controlled by armed gangs, and leaders have said security must first be established to hold a free and fair vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-cuts-duration-of-deportation-protections-for-521-000-haitians/7982521.html	2025-02-20T15:01:19-08:00	
EU official meets with Trump counterparts to resolve tariff threats	WASHINGTON — Hoping to head off a potential trade conflict, a top European Union official stressed the importance of active engagement and fairness in trade during a four-hour meeting with Trump administration officials. 'The top objective as it was presented to us yesterday by our American partners is reciprocity,' Maros Sefcovic, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, told reporters at a Thursday briefing. Sefcovic met on Wednesday with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump's nominee to be the U.S. trade representative. Trump has thrown the decades long partnership between the U.S. and Europe into turmoil by pledging to charge higher taxes on imports from Europe that he says would match the tariffs faced by American products. But Trump's plan for fair tariffs would also include the value added tax — which is akin to a sales tax — charged in Europe that could drastically push up import taxes and potentially trigger a broader trade conflict if the EU imposed retaliatory measures. A broader trade war risks both an economic slowdown and higher inflation that could create financial challenges for millions of families and potentially hurt political support for Trump, as voters in 2024's election specifically wanted him to lower price pressures. Trump also has proposed separate sectoral tariffs on autos, pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips, in addition to having already imposed 25% steel and aluminum tariffs with no avenues to provide exceptions or exemptions. Additionally, the U.S. president also has tariffs ready on Mexico and Canada over his claims that more should be done on illegal immigration and drug smuggling, though he suspended those tariffs for 30 days for ongoing talks. The import taxes that could potentially harm the U.S. auto sector and other industries could potentially begin in March. At Thursday's White House news briefing, Hassett said that he and Lutnick had talks with a Mexican delegation about resolving the issues. 'We want trade to be fair,' Hassett said. The EU official tried in his conversation with White House officials to equate the value added tax as similar to a sales tax as its paid by the final consumer, but he said that the issue had not been resolved. Sefcovic also said they discussed the industrial overcapacity of China, particularly in steel, and that the U.S. and EU should work together to tackle that problem, instead of targeting each other. He stressed that the meeting ended with a focus on looking for ways to 'generate positive momentum,' adding that the EU would like to 'see where we can, like, move first and fast, because I really would like to avoid the pain of measures and countermeasures.' The EU official said it was critical to establish a personal relationship with his U.S. counterparts. 'I’m glad that it happened and that we could have such an intense meeting,' he said. 'Now, I think we will both be thinking how to keep the momentum going on and how to hopefully avoid I would say, the pain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-official-meets-with-trump-counterparts-to-resolve-tariff-threats-/7982535.html	2025-02-20T14:51:00-08:00

European shipyards sustain Russia's Arctic gas trade	london — European shipyards are providing vital servicing contracts to vessels carrying Russian liquefied natural gas, sustaining a trade that Kyiv says is funding the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. Meanwhile, a new analysis of the latest trade data shows that imports of Russian LNG to the EU rose last year, bucking the overall trend of declining imports from the rest of the world. A fleet of 15 specialized Arc7 tankers carry Russian LNG from its source on the Yamal Peninsula, high in the Russian arctic, to import terminals in Europe and beyond. The vessels are designed to smash through the arctic ice, allowing Moscow to ship its lucrative LNG year-round. The demanding conditions mean that the tankers require regular repairs. Satellite tracking data show 14 of the vessels are being serviced at two European ports: the Damen shipyard in Brest, France, and the Fayard A/S shipyard near Odense, Denmark. 'The European shipyards … are pretty much right along the natural export-import route that they're going along anyway. So, it's pretty convenient to stop there for a week or 10 days to do the hull maintenance, repainting, et cetera. For Russia, if those European shipyards would be off limits, the operation would definitely peter out over several years as the vessels would become more and more unusable,' said Malte Humpert, a senior fellow at The Arctic Institute and an expert on LNG shipping. Western expertise Western expertise appears crucial in keeping the tankers operational. A single Arc7 vessel, the Christophe de Margerie, is subject to Western sanctions and can no longer call at European shipyards. Attempts to repair the ship in China appear to have failed, and it is currently out of action. Even if other servicing facilities were found, the LNG trade might not be profitable, Humpert said. 'A large part of the economics is to have the shipyards very close to where you offload the gas. The operating costs are up to $100,000 per day for those vessels. So if suddenly you lose a journey from Europe to China, that's several weeks. If you lose weeks and weeks, that's millions of dollars you lose in terms of operating costs,' he told VOA via Zoom. There is no suggestion that the European shipyards – Damen in France and Fayard A/S in Denmark – have broken any EU sanctions. Damen told Britain’s Financial Times that no further servicing of the Arc7 tankers was planned 'for the coming period.' Fayard declined to comment. Imports rise The servicing is being carried out despite European pledges to stop buying Russian energy, following Moscow’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv says the profits fund the Kremlin’s war. Before 2022, Russia supplied about 40% of Europe’s gas. Most European countries no longer receive Russian gas via pipelines after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement with Moscow at the beginning of the year. It’s a different story for liquefied natural gas transported by sea. A new analysis shows LNG imports from Russia rose by 18% last year, bucking the overall trend of declining imports from the rest of the world. Market forces Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, who co-wrote the European LNG Tracker report for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said market forces dictate LNG trade patterns. 'The main suppliers decreased their exports to Europe: the U.S., Qatar. But we saw an increase in Russian LNG. So then we started thinking: What's going on? What is happening there?' 'Yamal [in Russia] has contracts with certain companies in Europe, so we see lots of companies involved in all this trade. The issue is that [the European Union] could say something, but these are commercial agreements. These are private companies. It's just business. ... They will try to secure LNG where it's best for them,' Jaller-Makarewicz told VOA via Zoom. For some European countries, that business is worth more than the aid they’re sending to Ukraine, Humpert said. 'Spain imported $2.5 billion of LNG from Russia last year, and they spent $500 million in military aid,' he said, adding that many of the tankers carrying Russian LNG are owned and insured by European companies. 'If the EU were to sanction them, then that definitely cuts into European companies' profits and there’s definitely losses. I mean, that’s always what you have to weigh up, right? Sanctions do cause economic harm,' he said. EU ban The EU so far has stopped short of banning Russian LNG imports. Officials told Reuters last month that the bloc wants to secure alternatives before taking any measures against Moscow. 'First you have to have a deal, because otherwise you will be left without gas from Russia and without the U.S.,' an unnamed EU diplomat told Reuters. European pledges to cut down on Russian energy imports are being undermined by the LNG trade, said analyst Jaller-Makarewicz. While some LNG importers are tied to long-term contracts, 'around 30% are done on spot rates,' she said. 'In 2022, Europe said, 'We definitely need to stop our dependency on Russian gas as a whole.' LNG from Russia was not a major factor at that moment; it was the gas coming via pipeline. So then why are we still buying on spot rates that are not really based on LNG long-term contracts?' she asked. An EU ban on the transshipment of Russian LNG to countries outside the bloc is due to come into force later this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-shipyards-sustain-russia-s-arctic-gas-trade-/7982453.html	2025-02-20T13:55:17-08:00

Trump loyalist Kash Patel takes helm of FBI	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration's makeover of the United States' national security and law enforcement agencies took a major step forward Thursday, with Senate lawmakers voting 51-49 to confirm Kash Patel as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The vote puts Patel at the helm of the country's premier law enforcement agency, where he has promised to lead an overhaul of the bureau at a time when critics of President Donald Trump have accused the administration of leading a purge to end the bureau's tradition of independence and align the bureau with Trump's priorities. Two Republicans — Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski — voted with Democrats against Patel's confirmation. But support from the rest of the Senate Republican delegation gave Patel a slim victory, with many hailing the new FBI director as an agent of change. 'The FBI has lost trust among the American people in recent years. Much of that stems from a perception that politics has infected the FBI's important work,' said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, ahead of Thursday's vote. 'We need all law enforcement working together and focused on the real threats facing our country,' Thune said. 'I look forward to working with Mr. Patel to restore the integrity of the FBI and get it focused on its critical mission.' Other Republicans have echoed similar sentiments. 'The FBI has been infected by political bias and weaponized against the American people,' said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley before advancing Patel's nomination to the full Senate earlier this month, noting 'Mr. Patel knows it, Mr. Patel exposed it, and Mr. Patel was targeted.' 'The American people are sick and tired of two tiers of access, two tiers of treatment, and two tiers of justice,' said Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, also speaking earlier this month on the need for Patel to head the FBI. Patel is a former public defender and federal prosecutor who previously served as a Trump national security adviser and at the Pentagon. In a statement announcing Patel's nomination in November, Trump praised him as having 'played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability and the Constitution.' Democrats, however, have repeatedly questioned Patel's qualifications and integrity, accusing him of describing some of the prosecuted, Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol rioters as 'political prisoners,' and of calling for the prosecution of Trump opponents. And citing whistleblowers, they have accused Patel of lying to lawmakers about knowledge of efforts at the FBI to force out officials and agents who were assigned to investigate the Capitol Hill riot. 'He is unprepared and unqualified. He has an enemies list. He has these foreign entanglements,' said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, rallying against Patel's confirmation in front of FBI headquarters in Washington before Thursday's vote. 'To Republicans who may vote for Kash Patel, this vote will haunt you,' he said. 'You will rue the day of this vote.' Democrat Peter Welch, also speaking in front of FBI headquarters, called Patel 'a crown jewel' in what he described as a 'lawless rampage' by Trump. 'He's an instrument of Donald Trump's effort to destroy the Justice Department and the FBI so that he is absolutely and completely not only above the law, but beyond the law,' Welch said. Patel, during his confirmation hearing last month, rejected accusations he has an enemies list or that he will seek retribution against Trump's opponents or enemies. 'I have no interest nor desire and will not, if confirmed, go backwards,' Patel told lawmakers. 'There will be no politicization at the FBI. There will be no retributive actions taken by the FBI.' 'The only thing that will matter if I'm confirmed as a director of the FBI is a de-weaponized, de-politicized system of law enforcement completely devoted to rigorous obedience to the Constitution and a singular standard of justice,' he said. The FBI director is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a term not to exceed 10 years.

Israel reports several bus explosions; no injuries reported	Israeli police on Thursday reported a series of explosions on buses in central Israel in what they said appeared to be a militant attack. No injuries were reported. Police forces rushed to the scene in Bat Yam, a Tel Aviv suburb, as they searched for suspects. Police said bomb disposal units were searching for additional bombs. Police spokesman Asi Aharoni told Channel 13 TV that explosives were found on two other buses. He called on the public to be alert and report any suspicious objects to authorities. Police said the Shin Bet internal security agency was taking over the investigation. The explosions took place just hours after Hamas released the bodies of four Israeli hostages held in Gaza — the first of eight hostages that Israel believes are dead and to be returned during the current phase of the ceasefire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-reports-several-bus-explosions-no-injuries-reported/7982435.html	2025-02-20T13:17:31-08:00	
Somali government says attacks on bases repulsed, 130 militants killed	Officials in Somalia say 130 militants were killed Thursday as Somali National Army troops 'repulsed' attacks on four government military bases in the center of the country. VOA Somali was not able to immediately confirm the death toll from the fighting, which took place in an area where government forces have clashed repeatedly with al-Shabab in recent days. In a statement, Somalia's Ministry of Information said that militants used explosives to attack the bases in the Middle Shabelle region. 'Al-Shabab suffered a heavy defeat and our brave heroes are actively pursuing the remaining militants. Somalia will never falter in its fight against terrorism,' the ministry said. The statement said government forces also recovered weapons from the defeated militant fighters. For the last couple of weeks, Somali government forces, supported by local clan militias, have carried out operations aimed at securing rural villages along the Shabelle River that were recently liberated from al-Shabab. General Ibrahim Mumin, the commander of the 3rd division of the Somali National Army, told VOA Somali that Thursday’s al-Shabab attacks 'failed' as government troops fought off the militants. Mumin said defensive barriers erected by the soldiers in anticipation of al-Shabab attacks prevented the explosives from penetrating the military bases. Neither the information ministry nor the commander provided casualty totals for government forces, but a local resident told VOA at least five soldiers were killed and more than 10 others injured. In separate clashes on Thursday, at least 20 Islamic State militants were killed, and dozens were injured in Somalia’s northeastern Puntland region, according to officials. Puntland police commissioner Brigadier General Mumin Abdi Shire told VOA that Islamic state militants suffered heavy casualties. 'Our brave men carried out military operations around the villages of Dhasaq and Dandamale near the Togga Jacel area of the Cal Miskaad mountains, killing at least 20 militants. All of them foreigners,' Shire said. Al-Shabab has been fighting Somali governments since 2007 to impose its strict brand of Islamic law on the country. In the northeast, Puntland began a major offensive against Islamic State in December and claims to have since killed nearly 200 Islamic State fighters, dozens of them foreign fighters, and captured villages and bases in the mountainous area controlled by IS. This month, U.S. warplanes twice targeted the Islamic State affiliate in the area, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold. Among those killed was Ahmed Maeleninine, an Omani-born leader of Islamic State, officials of the Puntland region said last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-government-says-attacks-on-bases-repulsed-130-militants-killed/7982300.html	2025-02-20T11:56:18-08:00	
McConnell, longest-serving US senator, to retire in early 2027	U.S. Senator and former Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Thursday, on his 83rd birthday, that he will not seek reelection when his current term ends in early 2027. First elected in 1984, McConnell made the announcement from the Senate floor. 'Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate. Every day in between, I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business here,' he said. 'Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.' McConnell will retire as the longest-serving senator in U.S. history and the longest-serving Senate leader from any party. He has led the Republicans since 2007 both as majority and minority leader before giving up the position to Senator John Thune last year. McConnell’s storied political career saw him guide the Senate chamber through a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, presidential impeachment trials and fierce political fights. In recent years, McConnell had a series of health scares, including two separate incidents in which he froze while talking to reporters. He blamed those incidents on a previous concussion. In his comments Thursday, McConnell said he decided last year that he would not run for reelection. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mcconnell-longest-serving-us-senator-to-retire-in-early-2027/7982278.html	2025-02-20T11:51:04-08:00	
Azerbaijan suspends BBC	Azerbaijan’s government has ordered the suspension of the Azerbaijani operation of BBC News, the British news agency confirmed Thursday. In a statement, the BBC said it had made the 'reluctant decision' to close its office in the country after receiving a verbal instruction from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 'We deeply regret this restrictive move against press freedom, which will hinder our ability to report to and from Azerbaijan for our audiences inside and outside the country,' a BBC spokesperson said in a statement. The suspension comes after Azerbaijani state-run media last week reported that the Azerbaijani government wanted to reduce the number of BBC staff working in the country to one. The BBC said it has received nothing in writing about the suspension from the Azerbaijani government. While the news agency seeks clarification, its team of journalists in the country have stopped their journalistic activities, according to the BBC. Neither Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry nor its Washington embassy immediately responded to VOA’s emails seeking comment. The BBC has operated in Azerbaijan since 1994. The news agency says its Azerbaijani service reached an average of 1 million people every week. The BBC suspension marks the continuation of a harsh crackdown on independent media that the Azerbaijani government has engaged in for years. Azerbaijan is among the worst jailers of journalists in the world. As of last week, at least 23 journalists were jailed in the former Soviet country in retaliation for their work, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Many of the journalists jailed in Azerbaijan are accused of foreign currency smuggling, which media watchdogs have rejected as a sham charge. Among those jailed is Farid Mehralizada, an economist and journalist with the Azerbaijani Service of VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Jailed since May 2024, Mehralizada faces charges of conspiring to smuggle foreign currency and 'illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery.' He and his employer reject the charges, which carry a combined sentence of up to 12 years behind bars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijan-suspends-bbc/7982159.html	2025-02-20T10:28:32-08:00	
US envoy Kellogg, Zelenskyy talk in Kyiv	U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg met in Kyiv Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but there was no immediate word on whether they had eased U.S.-Ukrainian relations after U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelenskyy traded barbs this week over Russia’s three-year war against Ukraine. Kellogg said upon arriving in the Ukrainian capital that he was there to listen to Zelenskyy’s views after officials in Kyiv voiced their anger at being excluded this week when the top U.S. and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia to lay the groundwork for talks to end the fighting. After Kellogg met with Zelenskyy, the two men were expected to hold a news conference, but the Ukrainian side said the Americans asked that it be called off, and it was. Trump and Zelenskyy assailed each other this week. The U.S. president, echoing Russian attacks, called Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections,' while Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian-influenced 'disinformation space' when the U.S. leader indicated that Ukraine started the war. It was Moscow that invaded its neighbor three years ago next week. Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms more favorable to Moscow. Russia currently controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory. U.S. Vice President JD Vance told a gathering of conservative activists outside Washington on Thursday that Trump 'wants the killing to stop' in Ukraine and that 'peace is in the interest of the American people.' He said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, 'We’re on the cusp of peace.' Vance did not mention Ukraine’s role in settling the conflict, although U.S. officials have said Kyiv and Moscow will both be involved in the settlement and have to make concessions to achieve peace. European leaders have responded to Trump's recent remarks about Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if the fighting ends. The Kremlin says the plan is a major cause for concern, but Zelenskyy and NATO have welcomed it. 'It is vital that ... Russia will never again try to take one more square kilometer of Ukrainian land,' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said, adding that a peace pact would have to entail robust security guarantees for Ukraine. 'While there is much that still needs to be decided, there is no question that Europe has a vital role to play in securing peace in Ukraine,' he told reporters in Bratislava. In a string of comments on his Truth Social platform this week, Trump accused Zelenskyy of refusing to hold elections in Ukraine, which had been scheduled for April 2024 but were delayed after Russia invaded in 2022. Trump disparaged Zelenskyy as 'a modestly successful comedian' and said, 'The only thing he was good at was playing [former U.S. President Joe] Biden 'like a fiddle'' for more U.S. military assistance.' 'I love Ukraine,' Trump said, 'but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died — And so it continues.' Earlier, Trump had scoffed at Zelenskyy's complaint about not being invited to the Tuesday talks in Riyadh headed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 'Today I heard, 'Well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years,' Trump said of Ukraine's leaders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-kellogg-zelenskyy-talk-in-kyiv/7982134.html	2025-02-20T10:23:34-08:00	
Creating inclusive Syrian government could help lift sanctions, UN envoy says	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Creating an inclusive government in Syria in coming weeks will help determine whether Western sanctions are lifted as the country rebuilds after the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad, the U.N. special envoy to Syria said Thursday. 'What I'm hoping is that with a truly new inclusive government in place on the 1st of March, this will help us in lifting sanctions' imposed on Syria by Western countries during Assad's rule, Geir Pedersen told The Associated Press in an interview during a visit to Damascus. After Assad was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its 'salvation government' that had ruled in northwestern Syria. The country's de facto authorities said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria's interim president after a meeting of most of the country's former rebel factions. In recent weeks, a committee has been holding meetings in different parts of Syria in preparation for a national dialogue conference to chart the country's political future, the date of which has not yet been announced. Pedersen said that in his first meeting with al-Sharaa in December, al-Sharaa had insisted that the interim government would rule for only three months, although Pedersen warned him the timeline was tight. 'I think the important thing is not whether it is three months or not, but it is whether they will deliver on what they have said all along, that this is going to be an inclusive process where all Syrians will be included,' Pedersen said. The U.S. and European countries have not lifted sanctions that were imposed on the Syrian government under Assad's rule, which the new authorities have said is handicapping their ability to rebuild the country after nearly 14 years of civil war and restore essential services like state electricity. Officials from some Western countries have said they want to see if the interim rulers will follow through on their promises of inclusive governance and protecting minorities. Organizers of the national dialogue have said the conference will include all segments of Syrian society except for Assad loyalists and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led force in the northeast that has so far refused to dissolve and be absorbed into the new national army. The SDF is currently in negotiations with the central government, and Pedersen said he hopes to see a 'political solution' to the impasse. Pedersen said he is also concerned about a security vacuum following the disbanding of the former national army and security services by the country's new rulers. 'It's very important that the new structures of the state are coming in place quickly and that there is an offer to those who are no longer in service of the army or the security services, that there are other job opportunities and that people do not feel that they are excluded from the future of Syria,' he said. The U.N. envoy said he also remains concerned about Israel's incursions into Syrian territory since the fall of Assad. The Israeli army has seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria and has also made forays beyond the buffer zone. The U.N. has said that Israel is violating the agreement. Israeli officials have said they took the action to protect Israel's security and that their presence would be temporary. Pedersen said the security concerns are being addressed and 'there is really, in my opinion, no argument for why the Israelis should be staying.' 'The solution is very simple. The Israelis need to withdraw,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/creating-inclusive-syrian-government-could-help-lift-sanctions-un-envoy-says/7982063.html	2025-02-20T09:31:16-08:00	
Former Spanish football chief guilty of sexual harassment	Spain’s High Court in Madrid on Thursday found former Spanish football federation chief Luis Rubiales guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent following the 2023 Women's World Cup final. The court fined the 47-year-old Rubiales $10,400, and he was ordered to stay at least 200 meters from Hermoso and refrain from communication with her for at least one year. Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 2½ years. Rubiales was cleared of charges of coercion. Prosecutors alleged he and three other male Spanish federation members and former women's team coach Jorge Vilda had pressured Hermoso into supporting Rubiales’ claim that the kiss had been consensual. They all were acquitted. The two-week trial was carried live on Spanish television and had been highly anticipated. Rubiales kissed Spanish women’s team member Hermoso on the lips during the awards ceremony in Sydney, Australia, after Spain beat England 1-0 in the Women’s World Cup final in August 2023. The incident sparked outrage within and outside Spain, marring the victory celebration, with many, including government ministers, players and coaches, demanding his resignation. International football’s governing body, FIFA, opened disciplinary proceedings against him. Rubiales, who had been football federation chief since 2018, initially dismissed the kiss as a 'peck' but gave in to pressure and resigned in September 2023 after an investigation began. A recent reform of the Spanish penal code classified a nonconsensual kiss as sexual assault. Following the verdict, Spain's equality minister, Ana Redondo, told the Reuters news service, the court’s decision proves their law is a good one. 'It is a law that protects women against aggression,' Redondo said. 'Consent, and this is the important thing, is the cornerstone of every relationship.'

In remote town in western Ukraine, all young men are gone	Makiv, a small town in western Ukraine, is grappling with the absence of men. Many have either fled, are fighting, or have died fighting the Russian invasion. It’s a common problem in many towns and villages in Ukraine. The war has worsened the country’s ongoing decline in population. Those left behind fear for Ukraine’s future as they struggle to rebuild their lives.

Trump signs order aimed at ending benefits for some immigrants	SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order aimed at ending federal benefits for people in the country illegally, the White House said Wednesday, his latest in a blizzard of moves to crack down on immigration. The White House said the order seeks to end 'all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens,' but it was not clear which benefits will be targeted. People in the country illegally generally do not qualify except for emergency medical care. Children are entitled to a free K-12 public education regardless of immigration status under a 1982 Supreme Court ruling. The order notes that a 1996 welfare overhaul denies most public benefits to people in the country illegally but says that law has been gradually undermined. 'Over the last 4 years, in particular, the prior administration repeatedly undercut the goals of that law, resulting in the improper expenditure of significant taxpayer resources.' Trump's words appear directed at former President Joe Biden's extensive use of parole authority to allow people in the country temporarily, including more than 900,000 through an online appointment app called CBP One used at border crossings with Mexico and more than 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who flew to the United States at their own expense with a financial sponsor. Trump immediately ended both programs. Biden also granted parole to nearly 300,000 people from Ukraine and Afghanistan. People granted parole for at least a year are considered 'qualified noncitizens,' making them eligible for some income-based benefits, but only after five years. They include Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Some states have shortened the five-year wait. Trump's order appears to have other targets, some already subjects of earlier edicts and Justice Department lawsuits. It directs all departments and agencies to identify federal benefit spending that is inconsistent with the 1996 welfare law. It also seeks to ensure that state and local governments are not using federal funds for policies that support 'sanctuary' policies or encourage illegal immigration. Trump signed 10 executive orders on immigration on his first day in office. They included ending automatic citizenship for people born in the United States and asylum at the southern border. The birthright citizenship order has been temporarily halted in court.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-aimed-at-ending-benefits-for-some-immigrants/7981983.html	2025-02-20T08:35:36-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon makes 2 court appearances	Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared in two Seoul courtrooms Thursday, first to hear criminal insurrection charges and then to face a Constitutional Court impeachment trial, both in connection with his short-lived, Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Yoon was taken by motorcade from the Seoul Detention Center, where he is being held, to the Central District Court for the preliminary hearing on the insurrection charges prosecutors filed last month. In that hearing, Yoon’s lawyers argued that his declaration of martial law was not intended to paralyze the state, but to 'alert the public to the national crisis caused by the legislative dictatorship of the dominant opposition party, which had crippled the administration.' The lawyers also asked for Yoon’s release from detention, although it was unclear when the court would rule on that request. Yoon next traveled to the Constitutional Court for the tenth and final scheduled hearing in the trial over validity of his impeachment for declaring martial law. In Yoon’s first appearance at that trial, the court heard testimony from Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was also impeached by National Assembly lawmakers for his role in the early December declaration. Yoon briefly left the courtroom during Han’s testimony, with Yoon’s lawyers explaining they felt it was inappropriate for the two to be seen together. Han told the court that while he shared Yoon’s views on the liberal opposition, he and the rest of the cabinet disagreed with the president’s declaration of martial law and even tried to dissuade him. To his knowledge, the prime minister added, none of the cabinet members supported the action. The Constitutional Court is reviewing parliament’s Dec. 14 vote to impeach Yoon and will decide whether to permanently remove him from office or reinstate him. The court is considering if Yoon violated the constitution while Yoon and his lawyers have argued that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break a political deadlock. If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days. The court is expected to deliver its ruling in early or mid-March. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-makes-2-court-appearances/7981971.html	2025-02-20T08:12:23-08:00	
Ivory Coast takes control of last remaining French base	ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST — Ivory Coast officially took control of the last remaining French military base in the country Thursday as most French forces departed from countries across West Africa. Some 80 French troops will stay in the country to advise and train the Ivorian military, Tene Birahima Ouattara, the Ivorian defense and state minister, said at a news conference with the French minister of the armed forces. 'The world is changing and changing fast,' Ouattara said. 'It's clear that our defense relationship also had to evolve and be based more on future prospects in the face of the realities of threats and those of a world that has become complex in terms of security, and not on a defense relationship inspired by the past. 'France is transforming its presence. France is not disappearing,' he said. Ivory Coast's announcement follows that of other leaders across West Africa, where the French military is being asked to leave. Analysts have described the requests as part of a broader structural transformation in the region's engagement with Paris amid growing local sentiments against France, especially in coup-hit countries. French troops who have long been on the ground have in recent years been kicked out of several West African countries, including Niger, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Chad, considered France's most stable and loyal partner in Africa. France has now been asked to leave more than 70% of African countries where it had a troop presence since ending its colonial rule. The French remain only in Djibouti, with 1,500 soldiers, and Gabon, with 350 troops. After expelling French troops, military leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have moved closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel who have been accused of abuses against civilians. However, the security situation has worsened in those countries, with increasing numbers of extremist attacks and civilian deaths from armed groups and government forces. The French government has been making efforts to revive its waning political and military influence on the continent by devising a new military strategy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ivory-coast-takes-control-of-last-remaining-french-base/7981876.html	2025-02-20T07:10:42-08:00	
Hamas releases bodies of 4 Israeli hostages, including youngest	The bodies of four Israelis held hostage in Gaza returned to Israel on Thursday in the latest release under a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group Hamas. Hundreds of people gathered in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis where Hamas handed over four black coffins to the Red Cross, which carried them away in a convoy and delivered them to the Israeli military. An Israeli procession passed through areas where people gathered on the side of the road holding Israeli flags, and the bodies arrived several hours later at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv to confirm their identities. Those released Thursday included the youngest captives – infant Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was kidnapped, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel Bibas – and their mother, Shiri Bibas. They were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Video of the abduction showed Shiri Bibas swaddling the boys in a blanket and being whisked away by armed men. The boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023, according to Hamas. Their father, Yarden Bibas, was kidnapped separately and returned alive earlier this month. The body of fellow Nir Oz resident Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted from his home, was also released. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on X that the hearts of the entire nation 'lie in tatters.' 'On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness,' Herzog said. 'Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday would be 'a day of grief' for his nation. Before transferring the four coffins to the Red Cross, Hamas had them displayed on a stage at the handover site along with flags and banners. One of the banners accused Netanyahu of being a war criminal and said Israeli airstrikes killed the hostages. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said Thursday the remains need to be respected. 'Under international law, any handover of the remains of deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,' Türk said in a statement. On Saturday, six living hostages are set to be released in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians detained by Israeli forces in Gaza during the war. Israel and Hamas are in the process of implementing the first phase of a ceasefire that began on January 19. Talks on the second phase are scheduled to begin this week, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the remaining hostages may be released together during the next phase of the truce. 'We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,' senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told the news agency. Hamas is believed to be holding 66 more captives, about half of them living. The group has said it will release the remaining hostages only in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas in Gaza. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half of the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals, while eight were rescued in military operations. Israel's air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million.

North Korea rights groups face collapse amid US funding halt	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The vast majority of human rights groups focused on North Korea face an existential crisis after receiving notices from the U.S. government that their grant funds have been frozen, according to several sources among the predominantly Seoul-based NGOs. The National Endowment for Democracy, or NED, established by Congress to strengthen democratic institutions globally, and the State Department’s Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Bureau, which provide most of the groups’ funding, sent the notices over the last several weeks, according to documents reviewed by VOA. The freeze threatens to devastate an already fragile collection of North Korea human rights groups, potentially wiping out vital sources of advocacy and research on one of the world’s most closed and repressive states, which has a population of 25 million. Hanna Song, executive director of the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights, told VOA her organization, like many others in Seoul, is now in 'survival mode' because of the funding freeze. 'I just really don’t know how many will be able to survive,' said Song, whose organization works directly with North Koreans who have fled the North and has long been a key repository of data on Pyongyang’s abuses. Trump policy shift The funding freeze is part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s broader push to reshape the federal bureaucracy and realign taxpayer spending with his 'America First' agenda, in coordination with billionaire businessman Elon Musk. The NED has been repeatedly attacked by Musk, who has called it a 'scam' and an 'evil organization [that] needs to be dissolved.' In a message sent last week to several North Korea-focused human rights organizations, the NED said it has 'unfortunately been unable to access our previously approved funds' and 'may not be able to provide additional payments to your organization.' 'Once you run out of money, consider your NED grant agreement suspended,' the message added. Meanwhile, a January 24 notice from the State Department bureau ordered organizations receiving grants to immediately stop all work, even if already funded. The bureau has reportedly fired dozens of contractors and is also subject to a Trump executive order suspending foreign aid for 90 days. Although aid could theoretically resume, the pause has already had devastating consequences for many North Korea advocacy groups. Survival mode Song’s Seoul-based center, whose mission includes providing psychosocial support to North Korean defectors, has had to postpone counseling sessions while they look for new funding, Song said. 'It’s just absolutely destroying groups working on North Korea,' said Sokeel Park, South Korea country director at Liberty in North Korea, which helps North Korean defectors escape and resettle. 'It’s by far the biggest crisis facing NGOs working on this issue since the start of the movement in the 1990s,' he said in an interview. Although the group does not receive direct U.S. government funding, Park said other organizations have been forced to reduce salaries, furlough staff, or halt projects midstream. The freeze threatens a broad range of activities, including support for North Koreans who have fled, efforts to transmit information into and out of the country, and raising global awareness of its abuses. The crisis comes at a time when gaining insight into North Korea is more challenging than ever. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, strict border controls have made escapes rare and slowed the flow of information, leaving the outside world with extremely little insight into the reclusive country. This isolation has coincided with a decline in global attention to North Korea more generally, which has made it harder for organizations to diversify their funding sources, activists say. Seoul’s inconsistency While South Korea, a wealthy democracy bordering the North, might seem like a natural alternative source of funds, it has failed to consistently support North Korea-focused NGOs, mainly because the issue is politically sensitive in Seoul. Conservative governments, which take a harder line on the North, often condemn its human rights abuses and provide more backing for civil society groups. In contrast, left-leaning governments tend to focus on improving ties with Pyongyang, favoring humanitarian aid directly to the North Korean government in the hope that better relations will eventually lead to improved human rights. South Korea’s inconsistency on the issue is unfortunate, Lee Jung-hoon, former South Korean ambassador for North Korean human rights under conservative President Park Geun-hye told VOA. 'In fact, we should be the ones providing funding to American NGOs working on North Korea… we should be at the forefront of this,' Lee, now a dean and professor of international relations at Seoul’s Yonsei University, said. After taking office in 2022, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol pledged to improve North Korea’s 'horrendous' human rights situation. However, in December, Yoon unexpectedly declared martial law to combat what he called 'anti-state forces,' leading to his impeachment and possible removal from office. With Yoon’s future uncertain, the left-leaning Democratic Party is seen as the favorite to reclaim the presidency. Such political volatility has made many NGOs hesitant to accept South Korean government funding, fearing it could be easily withdrawn. As a result, many organizations have felt compelled to rely on U.S. government funding – primarily from NED and the State Department. With that money now frozen, many groups are scrambling to fill the gaps by seeking support from European governments and major private donors, Park said. North Korea-focused groups, though, are competing with countless global causes for limited funds. Song said no one wants to be in a position where they’re saying North Korea is a more important issue events in Myanmar or Syria, 'But it’s gotten to the point where it’s just survival mode.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-rights-groups-face-collapse-amid-us-funding-halt/7981751.html	2025-02-20T05:09:06-08:00	
Students lead 'Dark Indonesia' protests against budget cuts	YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia — Thousands of students staged 'Dark Indonesia' protests in cities across the country on Thursday against budget cuts and other policies of President Prabowo Subianto, fearing they will undermine social support systems and their futures. Clad in black, about a thousand placard-carrying students in the major city of Yogyakarta marched through a busy thoroughfare, yelling out demands for change, four months after Prabowo took office following a landslide election win. There were protests in other cities, including the capital Jakarta, and Medan on Sumatra island. 'Dark Indonesia' has gained traction on social media to represent concerns about the cuts. Another popular trend, 'Just Escape First', sees people sharing advice on how to escape to work and live overseas. Herianto, a student leader in Jakarta, said students are protesting cuts in the education sector after Prabowo ordered a cost-cutting drive to free up around $19 billion that can be used to fund his policies, including a school lunch plan. 'Indonesia is dark because there are many policies that aren't clear to our society,' said Herianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. 'The cuts are designed to plug a hole in the free meal program expenses. Education is one of the things that could be impacted. Students are so angry.' Speaking at the protest in Jakarta on Thursday, state secretariat minister Prasetyo Hadi said the government had received the students' demands and would study them. Prabowo's office has said the funding changes would not affect the education sector and teacher welfare, but with ministries cutting back a wide range of spending there are concerns that it could disrupt government services. The students were also demonstrating against the military's move into civilian roles and a lack of subsidized cooking gas. Prabowo remains broadly popular across the sprawling country, with his approval rating near 80% in surveys conducted by independent pollsters, including one last month by research firm Indikator Politik Indonesia. Indikator executive director Burhanuddin Muhtadi told Reuters Prabowo's popularity could dip as the policies were rolled out, when the country's middle class had shrunk. 'If the government does not respond well to this issue, there can be anxiety from the middle class and could lower its popularity,' he said. The demonstrations were the biggest since last August, before Prabowo took office, when the parliament shelved plans to revise election laws after thousands of protesters took to the streets, setting fires and facing down tear gas and water cannon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/students-lead-dark-indonesia-protests-against-budget-cuts/7981720.html	2025-02-20T04:37:18-08:00	
Rwanda says DRC criticism of Arsenal, Bayern and PSG deals threatens regional peace	London — Rwanda on Thursday described recent criticism of its Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain football sponsorship deals by the Democratic Republic of Congo’s foreign minister as a threat to regional peace and stability. Earlier this month, DRC's foreign minister, Therese Kayikwamba Wagner, urged the three prominent European clubs to end their 'blood-stained' sponsorship agreements with 'Visit Rwanda,' questioning the morality of such partnerships while fighting raged in eastern Congo. Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have seized key parts of eastern DR Congo in recent weeks, in what is the gravest escalation in more than a decade of a long-running conflict rooted in the spillover into Congo of Rwanda's 1994 genocide and the struggle for control of Congo's vast mineral resources. 'The Government of Rwanda rejects recent attempts by the Democratic Republic of Congo to undermine Rwanda’s international partnerships through misinformation and political pressure,' Rwanda Development Board, which oversees the deals, said in a statement on Thursday. 'These efforts not only misrepresent the truth but also threaten the foundations of regional peace, stability, and economic cooperation that we have worked tirelessly to build.' Congo's foreign affairs minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on WhatsApp. The fighting in eastern Congo has led to human rights violations including summary executions, the bombing of displacement camps, reports of gang rape and other sexual violence, according to the United Nations. Rwanda says it is defending itself, accusing Congo's military of joining forces with ethnic Hutu-led militias bent on slaughtering Tutsis in Congo and threatening Rwanda, where Hutus targeted Tutsis in a 1994 genocide and some of them later fled to Congo. 'Visit Rwanda' began their sponsorship of Arsenal in 2018, with the latest deal reported to be worth more than $12 million per year. Bayern Munich signed a five-year football development and tourism promotion partnership with Rwanda in 2023, while 'Visit Rwanda' has been a sponsor of PSG since 2019. Reuters previously contacted the three clubs about the sponsorship deals but none replied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-says-drc-criticism-of-arsenal-bayern-and-psg-deals-threatens-regional-peace/7981705.html	2025-02-20T04:23:01-08:00	
Taliban withdraw Afghanistan from International Criminal Court	Islamabad — Afghanistan's radical Taliban leaders on Thursday rejected the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) over their country, declaring as ‘unlawful’ the decision in 2003 by their predecessors to join the Hague-based court’s founding treaty. The decision follows the ICC chief prosecutor’s announcement last month, seeking arrest warrants for the reclusive Taliban supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, and a close associate, accusing them both of being 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' The Taliban militarily regained power in August 2021, succeeding the internationally recognized government in Kabul, which collapsed alongside the withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO troops after nearly two decades in Afghanistan. The Taliban, now governing as the Islamic Emirate, have imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia, placing sweeping restrictions on freedom of speech and women’s access to education and public roles in society. No country has recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government primarily over their harsh treatment of Afghan women and girls. 'As an entity that upholds the religious and national values of the Afghan people within the framework of Islamic Sharia, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan does not recognize any obligation to the Rome Statute or the institution referred to as the ‘International Criminal Court,'' the Taliban stated in an English-language declaration. It accused the ICC of political bias and failing to take any 'substantive measures against the war crimes perpetrated in Afghanistan by occupying forces and their allies.' 'Given that many of the world's major powers are not signatories to this 'court,' it is unwarranted for a nation such as Afghanistan, which has historically endured foreign occupation and colonial subjugation, to be bound by its jurisdiction,' the Taliban asserted. In October 2001, Western forces led by the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, overthrowing the then-Taliban government for sheltering al-Qaida leaders held responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States that occurred in September of that year. In February 2003, the Washington-backed successive government in Kabul formally deposited its instrument of accession to the Rome Statute, which founded the ICC, thereby granting the court jurisdiction over crimes committed within its territory or by Afghan nationals. 'In light of the aforementioned considerations, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan formally asserts that it does not recognize any legal obligation under the Rome Statute and deems the previous administration’s accession to this statute to be devoid of legal validity,' said Thursday’s Taliban statement. Karim Khan, the ICC prosecutor, stated in his January 23 announcement that his decision to seek arrest warrants for Akhundzada and Taliban chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, was based on a thorough investigation and evidence collected into their alleged crimes against humanity. The ICC is mandated to rule on the world’s worst offenses, such as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court has no police force and relies on 125 member states to execute its arrest warrants. Akhundzada seldom leaves his office in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar and rules the country through religious decrees. He has banned girls’ education beyond the sixth grade and prohibited women from most public as well as private sector employment, among other restrictions on their rights. In a speech he delivered in Kandahar last week, the Taliban chief again dismissed criticism of his governance, asserting that it was rooted in divine commands. A government spokesperson quoted Akhundzada as stating that 'every decree he issues is based on consultation with scholars and derived from the Quran and Hadith [sayings of Islam’s prophet] and represents commands of Allah.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-withdraw-afghanistan-from-international-criminal-court/7981683.html	2025-02-20T03:58:54-08:00	
Indian police seize books by Islamic scholar in Kashmir	Srinagar, India — Indian police in disputed Kashmir have raided dozens of bookshops and seized hundreds of copies of books by an Islamic scholar, sparking angry reactions by Muslim leaders. Police said searches were based on 'credible intelligence regarding the clandestine sale and distribution of literature promoting the ideology of a banned organization.' Officers did not name the author but store owners said they had seized literature by the late Abul Ala Maududi, founder of the Islamist political party Jamaat-e-Islami. Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947, and both claim the Himalayan territory in full. Rebel groups, demanding Kashmir's freedom or its merger with Pakistan, have been fighting Indian forces for decades, with tens of thousands killed in the conflict. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government banned the Kashmir branch of Jamaat-e-Islami in 2019 as an 'unlawful association.' New Delhi renewed the ban last year for what it said were 'activities against the security, integrity and sovereignty' of the nation. Plainclothes officers began raids in the main city of Srinagar on Saturday, before launching book seizures in other towns across the Muslim-majority region. 'They (police) came and took away all the copies of books authored by Abul Ala Maududi, saying these books were banned,' a bookshop owner in Srinagar, who asked not to be identified, told AFP. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said it was 'the latest step in a series of measures to crush dissent and to intimidate the local people.' 'They must be given freedom to read the books of their choice,' spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said. Police said the searches were conducted 'to prevent the circulation of banned literature linked to Jamaat-e-Islami.' 'These books were found to be in violation of legal regulations, and strict action is being taken against those found in possession of such material,' police said in a statement. The raids sparked anger among supporters of the party. 'The seized books promote good moral values and responsible citizenship,' said Shamim Ahmed Thokar. Umar Farooq, Kashmir's chief cleric and a prominent leader advocating for the right to self-determination, condemned the police action. 'Cracking down on Islamic literature and seizing them from bookstores is ridiculous,' Farooq said in a statement, pointing out that the literature was available online. 'Policing thought by seizing books is absurd -- to say the least -- in the time of access to all information on virtual highways,' he said. Critics and many residents of Kashmir say civil liberties were drastically curtailed after Modi's government imposed direct rule in 2019 by scrapping Kashmir's constitutionally enshrined partial autonomy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-police-seize-books-by-islamic-scholar-in-kashmir/7981662.html	2025-02-20T03:32:55-08:00	
EU approves $960 million in German aid for Infineon chips plant	BRUSSELS — The European Commission said Thursday it had approved 920 million-euro of German state aid, or $960 million, to Infineon Technologies for the construction of a new semiconductor manufacturing plant in Dresden. The measure will allow Infineon to complete the MEGAFAB-DD project, which will be able to produce a wide range of different types of computer chips, the Commission said. Chipmakers across the globe are pouring billions of dollars into new plants, as they take advantage of generous subsidies from the United States and the EU to keep the West ahead of China in developing cutting-edge semiconductor technology. The European Commission has earmarked 15 billion euros for public and private semiconductor projects by 2030. 'This new manufacturing plant will bring flexible production capacity to the EU and thereby strengthen Europe's security of supply, resilience and technological autonomy in semiconductor technologies, in line with the objectives set out in the European Chips Act,' the Commission said in a statement. The Commission said the plant -- which is slated to reach full capacity in 2031 -- will be a front-end facility, covering wafer processing, testing and separation, adding that its chips will be used in industrial, automotive and consumer applications. The aid will take the form of a direct grant of up to 920 million euros to Infineon to support its overall investment, amounting to 3.5 billion euros. Infineon, Germany’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, which was spun off from Siemens 25 years ago, has said the plant will be the largest single investment in its history. Infineon has agreed with the EU to ensure the project will bring wider positive effects to the EU semiconductor value chain and invest in the research and development of the next generation of chips in Europe, the Commission said. It will also contribute to crisis preparedness by committing to implement priority-rated orders in the case of a supply shortage, in line with the European Chips Act.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-approves-960-million-in-german-aid-for-infineon-chips-plant/7981638.html	2025-02-20T02:49:18-08:00	
China's sprawling rail projects around Asia	TOKYO — Vietnam approved plans on Wednesday for a multibillion-dollar railway with China, boosting links between the two communist countries. Around the region, China has been financing railways under its Belt and Road Initiative, which funds infrastructure projects globally but has come under fire with a number of plans stalled or mired in controversy. Here are some of the key installments in Asia's China-backed railway network: Indonesia: Southeast Asia first Indonesia launched Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in October 2023, after years of delays. The $7 billion China-backed project links the capital Jakarta to the city of Bandung in 45 minutes -- slashing the journey by about two hours. Built by a joint venture of four Indonesian state companies and Beijing's China Railway International Co, it was initially set to cost less than $5 billion and be completed by 2019. But construction challenges and the pandemic led to delays and surging expenses. Indonesia's then-president Joko Widodo nevertheless hailed its opening as a symbol of modernization. Laos: On the move Laos unveiled its $6 billion Chinese-built railroad in 2021, bringing hopes of an economic boost despite backlash after thousands of farmers had to be evicted to make way for construction. The 414-kilometer route connects the Chinese city of Kunming to Laotian capital Vientiane, with plans for the high-speed line to ultimately reach Singapore. Infrastructure-poor Laos, a reclusive communist country of about 7.4 million people, previously had only four kilometers of railway tracks. It was hoped that the railway would boost the Southeast Asian country's ailing tourism industry, which struggled to rebound from the pandemic. But experts also raised concerns over whether cash-strapped Laos -- where public debt made up 116% of GDP in 2023 -- would ever be able to pay back Beijing. Thailand: Full steam ahead After long delays, Thailand is pressing ahead with a Chinese-backed high-speed line set to partially open in 2028. The $5.4 billion project aims to expand the connection to Kunming, running to Bangkok via Laos by 2032. Thailand already has nearly 5,000 kilometers of railway but the sluggish, run-down network has long driven people to favor road travel -- despite extremely high accident rates. When the new railroad is fully complete, Chinese-made trains will run from Bangkok to Nong Khai, on the border with Laos, at up to 250 kph. Unlike Laos, Thailand signed a deal to cover project expenditures itself and has pitched it as a way to boost the economy through trade with China. China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan: Bridge to Europe Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov inaugurated construction in December of a railway linking China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, with hopes it will serve as a supply route to Europe. 'This route will ensure supply of goods from China to Kyrgyzstan and then onto Central Asia' and nearby countries 'including Turkey' and 'even to the European Union,' he said. The project, which Kyrgyz authorities estimate could cost up to $8 billion, includes construction through mountains and in areas of permafrost, where the ground never fully thaws. Vietnam: Link to manufacturing hubs Vietnam this week approved an $8 billion railroad running from its largest northern port city to China. The line will operate through some of Vietnam's key manufacturing hubs, home to Samsung, Foxconn and Pegatron factories, many of which rely on components from China. Another yet-to-be-approved line to China would connect Hanoi to Lang Son province, traveling through more areas packed with manufacturing facilities. Malaysia: Back on track Malaysia has revived construction of a nearly $17 billion railroad to carry passengers and freight between shipping ports on its east and west coasts. The China-backed, 665-kilometer project was originally launched in 2011 under ex-leader Najib Razak but shelved due to a dispute about payments. After blowing past several deadlines and budgets, it now looks set to be operational by 2027. Pakistan, Myanmar, Philippines: Stalled In Pakistan, a railway linking southwestern Gwadar Port with China's northwestern Xinjiang province has long been on the cards but has yet to materialize. If the project moves ahead, a 2023 Chinese study estimated an eyewatering price tag of $58 billion. In coup-hit Myanmar, talks on building a railway from Mandalay to China's Yunnan province appear to have stalled. And in the Philippines, plans for China to fund three railways flopped after Manila backed out of talks in 2023 as the South China Sea dispute heated up.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-sprawling-rail-projects-around-asia/7981628.html	2025-02-20T02:33:29-08:00	
China says it’s 'doing its best' to push for tariff negotiations with EU	BEIJING — China has been 'doing its best' to push for negotiations with the European Union over its tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, a commerce ministry spokesperson said on Thursday, almost four months after the punitive import curbs took effect. The bloc voted to increase the tariffs to as much as 45.3% in October after the European Commission -- which oversees EU trade policy -- launched an anti-subsidy probe into whether Chinese firms benefited from preferential grants and financing as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices. 'China has been doing its best to push for negotiations with the EU,' He Yadong said. 'It is hoped that the EU will take notice of the call from industry and promote bilateral investment cooperation through dialogue and consultation.' China launched its own probes last year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products. He told reporters China's anti-dumping probe into Europe's pork products and anti-subsidy investigation into the 27-strong bloc's dairy trade were still ongoing, when asked how the cases were progressing. 'We will conduct the investigation in an open and transparent manner in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations and World Trade Organization rules,' he added. China's commerce ministry in December decided to extend its anti-dumping investigation into EU brandy imports by three months to April 5.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-s-doing-its-best-to-push-for-tariff-negotiations-with-eu/7981611.html	2025-02-20T01:50:34-08:00	
Crews in Ukraine’s Odesa region work to restore power after Russian attacks	Tens of thousands of people remained without power Thursday in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa as a result of several days of Russian aerial attacks. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that crews were working to restore electricity service, and had brought 40,000 customers back online, with another 49,000 still without power. Russian attacks continued Thursday in multiple parts of Ukraine, including in the central region of Cherkasy where Governor Ihor Taburets said air defenses shot down 14 Russian drones. Taburets said on Telegram there was damage to a business and a power line, but no casualties. Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim reported the military shot down a drone over his region. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed four Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Russia-occupied Crimea and one over Bryansk. Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-in-ukraine-s-odesa-region-work-to-restore-power-after-russian-attacks/7981587.html	2025-02-20T00:03:52-08:00	
North Korea criticizes US over AUKUS nuclear submarine deal	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean state media on Thursday criticized the United States for a nuclear submarine deal with Australia under the AUKUS partnership signed in 2021, calling it a 'threat to regional peace.' A commentary carried by KCNA said Washington should be wary of consequences for what it said were nuclear alliances, naming AUKUS and the trilateral cooperation with South Korea and Japan. Australia just made its first $500 million payment to the U.S. under the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal. Under AUKUS, Australia will pay the United States $3 billion to boost the capacity of the U.S. submarine industry, and Washington will sell several Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia in the early 2030s. The KCNA commentary also argued the U.S. sees North Korea as an obstacle to its establishment of hegemony in the region and said nuclear states will not sit idly by, referring to itself. North Korea has been criticizing the trilateral military cooperation between South Korea, Japan and the U.S. and has called the relationship 'the Asian version of NATO.' South Korea's defense ministry on Thursday said that a joint air drill was held with the U.S. with at least one B-1B strategic bomber taking part. The drill was to show extended deterrent capabilities by the United States in response to threats from North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the ministry said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-criticizes-us-over-aukus-nuclear-submarine-deal/7981578.html	2025-02-19T23:06:47-08:00

VOA Uzbek: Kazakh officials voice support for US-Russia talks	Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has praised the recent U.S.-Russia talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. 'This is a good initiative; it is also beneficial for Kazakhstan,' he said. 'We will try to support it as much as possible.' Tokayev's comments are the first official response from Central Asia to the talks, which sparked serious international debate. Central Asia has been officially neutral in the Ukrainian war and has been largely silent on the three-year-old conflict.

Trump expects visit from Chinese President Xi without giving timeline	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE/ WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expected Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the United States, without giving a timeline for his trip. Trump made the remarks to reporters on Air Force One and said 'it's possible' for the U.S. and China to have a new trade deal. A conversation or interaction between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a potential easing or delay of trade tariffs. 'We'll have, ultimately, President Xi, we will have everybody coming (to the U.S.),' Trump said, while also speaking about other leaders potentially visiting the United States. Xi last travelled to the U.S. in November 2023, in his fifth visit to the country as Chinese president, for a summit with then U.S. President Joe Biden, resulting in agreements to resume military-to-military communications and curb fentanyl production. Trump and Xi had spoken just before Trump took office on January 20 and discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he was talking to China about TikTok as the United States seeks to broker a sale of the popular app owned by Chinese parent firm ByteDance. Trump said last week he had spoken to Xi since taking office as well, but did not offer details on the topics of that conversation. China's foreign ministry did not directly comment on Trump's remarks that day and instead referred reporters to their 'scheduled' call before Trump took office. Washington and Beijing have had tense relations for years over differences ranging from trade and tariffs and cybersecurity, and TikTok, Taiwan, Hong Kong, human rights and the origins of COVID-19. Trump also again told reporters he could make a deal with Russia over the war in Ukraine. 'We can make a deal with Russia to stop the killing,' Trump said, adding he thought the Russians wanted to see the war end. 'I think they have the cards a little bit because they've taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards,' Trump said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-expects-visit-from-chinese-president-xi-without-giving-timeline/7981566.html	2025-02-19T22:42:27-08:00	
Native American activist Leonard Peltier, freed from prison, welcomed on reservation	BELCOURT, NORTH DAKOTA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was defiant toward the government but grateful for his supporters as they welcomed him home to North Dakota on Wednesday, a day after his release from a Florida prison where he had been serving a life sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents. Peltier, 80, grew emotional as he addressed about 500 people who gathered at the festive event that included food, a drum circle and dancers at a center in Belcourt. The small town is just south of the Canadian border on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians' reservation. 'I'm so proud of the showing and support you've given me,' Peltier said. 'I've got a hard time keeping myself from crying. A strong warrior can't be up crying in front of his people.' Before leaving office, former President Joe Biden commuted Peltier's life sentence to home confinement, leading to his release Tuesday from the Coleman penitentiary. Peltier was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences stemming from a 1975 confrontation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed, and while Peltier acknowledged firing shots during the confrontation, he denied being the person whose shots killed the men. Native Americans widely believe he was a political prisoner who was wrongly convicted because he fought for Indigenous rights as a member of the American Indian Movement. For years, many in law enforcement argued against freeing Peltier. Current and former FBI agents disputed his claims of innocence. As Biden considered his options as his term ended, former FBI Director Christopher Wray sent the president a letter in which he called Peltier 'a remorseless killer' who should remain in prison. In a statement about the commutation, Biden said numerous individuals and groups supported releasing Peltier due to the time he spent in prison, his age and his leadership role among Native Americans. For decades, Peltier has maintained he was innocent of the murder charges, and he said Wednesday: 'I spent 49 years straight in prison for something I didn't do.' Peltier said he went into prison a young man and emerged far older at age 80. During all that time, Peltier said he tried to keep Native American issues in the forefront of his activism, and he thanked tribes across the nation for their decades of support. 'From day one, from the first hour I was arrested, Indian people came to my rescue, from all over the country,' Peltier said. Tribal leaders presented Peltier with an eagle feather staff that supporters had carried to Washington and other places as they campaigned for his release, and a traditional star quilt that Peltier draped over his shoulder. Nick Tilsen, an Oglala Lakota and founder of the NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group, paid tribute to Peltier and his generation of American Indian Movement leaders for standing up 'against the most powerful government in the world. And they instilled that pride back into our people. They instilled that fight back into our people.' 'All around the world, Leonard Peltier's name will be remembered as a warrior, as a warrior who outlasted one of the strongest governments in the world, and came out victorious.' Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribal Chair Jamie Azure said the welcome shown by hundreds of people at the event was a testament to what he means to the tribe and other Native Americans. 'What I think you can see from the turnout here today, it means a lot to a lot of people on a lot of different levels to see Mr. Peltier come back to his homeland, to just be home,' Azure said. As tribal member Denise Lajimodiere said, 'It's a big day. A day of celebration.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/native-american-activist-leonard-peltier-freed-from-prison-welcomed-on-reservation-/7981521.html	2025-02-19T22:39:31-08:00	
Rights groups: Iran executed 975 people in 'horrifying' 2024 escalation	PARIS — Iran executed at least 975 people last year in a 'horrifying escalation' of its use of capital punishment, two human rights groups said on Thursday. Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) and French group Together Against the Death Penalty (ECPM) said the figure was the highest since IHR began recording executions in Iran in 2008. The figure 'reveals a horrifying escalation in the use of the death penalty by the Islamic republic in 2024,' they said in a joint report, accusing Iran of using the death penalty as a 'central tool of political oppression.' 'These executions are part of the Islamic republic's war against its own people to maintain its grip on power,' IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said. 'Five people were executed on average every single day in the last three months of the year as the threat of war between Iran and Israel escalated.' Last year's figure represented a 17% increase on the 834 executions recorded in 2023, the report said. Of the 975 people executed, four people were hanged in public and 31 were women, also the highest figure for the past 17 years. Executions over protests Human rights groups, who say that Iran is the world's most prolific executioner after China, accuse the authorities of using the death penalty to sow fear among the public, particularly after nationwide protests broke out in 2022. Capital punishment remains a key pillar of the sharia-based judicial system established after the 1979 revolution ousted the Western-backed shah. Crimes punishable by death include murder, rape and drugs offenses but also more vaguely worded charges like 'corruption on earth' and 'rebellion' which activists say are used against dissidents. In recent years, executions have been carried out by hanging, mostly in prison yards but occasionally in public, though other methods remain on the statute books. Two of last year's executions were in connection with the nationwide protests that erupted in September 2022 after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian-Kurdish woman arrested for an alleged breach of Iran's mandatory dress code. Mohammad Ghobadlu, 23, was executed in January 2024 on charges of killing a police officer with a car during a protest in October 2022. Human rights groups have charged that his trial was deeply flawed, with judges ignoring evidence presented by the defense that he suffered from bipolar disorder. Gholamreza Rasaei, 34, was executed in secret in August on charges of killing a Revolutionary Guard during a 2022 protest. Activists said his confession had been obtained by torture. The rights groups said there was evidence Iran might have carried out more executions last year that they were unable to confirm for their report. They said there were reports of an additional 39 executions in 2024 that they had been unable to corroborate through second sources. Already this year, Iran has carried out at least 121 executions, according to IHR's count.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-groups-iran-executed-975-people-in-horrifying-2024-escalation/7981559.html	2025-02-19T22:31:09-08:00	
Australia, Papua New Guinea vow to strike defense treaty	SYDNEY — Australia said Thursday it will strike a defense treaty with Papua New Guinea, bolstering ties with a Pacific state that has been courted persistently by China. The historically close Pacific nations said in a joint statement they were committed to negotiating the treaty to deepen integration of their forces and make it easier to offer security support. 'This will enable our two defense forces to walk down a pathway of increasing integration and increasing interoperability,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said. 'We live in a world which is increasingly strategically complex,' he told reporters at a press conference with his Papua New Guinea counterpart. 'It is really important that we are working with our closest friends, but in this case, we are working with family and that is very much how we see our relationship with Papua New Guinea.' Few details were given on the future treaty, which would build on an overarching security agreement signed between the two countries in 2023. Papua New Guinea Defense Minister Billy Joseph said the treaty was important 'with the geopolitics and all the different contests that are going on.' 'We have consciously made a decision to choose who should be our friends as far as security is concerned,' he said. Papua New Guinea has many friends but it counts Australia as 'very close,' Joseph said. Perched less than 200 kilometers from Australia's northernmost border, Papua New Guinea is the largest and most populous state in Melanesia. Australia has been signing security deals, dishing out aid funding and ramping up diplomatic visits to cement its influence in the South Pacific, while China renews its efforts to woo island nations in the region. Over the past decade, China has committed billions of dollars to Pacific nations, funding hospitals, sports stadiums, roads and other public works. It is an approach that appears to be paying dividends. Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Nauru have all severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in recent years in favor of China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-papua-new-guinea-vow-to-strike-defense-treaty/7981558.html	2025-02-19T22:25:05-08:00	
Stax Music Academy's teen students mark 25th anniversary, Black History Month with concert	MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE — The Memphis music studio where some of America’s most recognizable songs were recorded decades ago is now a museum. But next door, trumpets blare, drums boom, and singers craft the soulful sounds of Stax Records’ biggest hits. At Stax Music Academy, young musicians rehearse the unmistakable intro to 'Theme from Shaft,' the Isaac Hayes tour de force that won an Oscar in 1972 and tantalizes listeners with its pulsating bass line, crisp hi-hat and funky guitar. There's an air of professionalism among the students as their teacher hands out sheets of music and words of wisdom. 'Here we go. Read the ink that’s on the paper. From the top, one, two, ready and …,' says Sam Franklin IV, the academy's music director. When they finish, Franklin says, 'Hey y’all, that was good.' Under the guidance of Franklin and other instructors, the students are practicing for three concerts in Memphis, Tennessee, on Friday to celebrate Black History Month and the academy's 25th anniversary. Created in 2000, the academy is an after-school program for teens that teaches them to sing, dance and play instruments. Some pay nothing to attend. The academy has graduated more than 4,000 students since it started in the working-class neighborhood of Soulsville, where Stax Records produced soul and R&B classics in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 2008, every high school senior has been accepted to a college or university, many on full scholarships. The academy has performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, the Kennedy Center in Washington, and in Europe and Australia. Students take pride and joy in continuing the legacy of the influential record company, where Otis Redding cut '(Sittin’ On) the Dock of the Bay,' Sam and Dave worked on 'Soul Man,' and The Staple Singers made 'Respect Yourself.' Other mainstays of the Stax catalog include Booker T. and the MGs, Rufus and Carla Thomas, Wilson Pickett and Johnnie Taylor. Before it went bankrupt in 1975, Stax Records helped develop the raw, emotional Memphis Sound, driven by tight horn and rhythm sections, and strong-voiced singers. Some Stax songs were energetic and raucous, others smooth and sexy. Stax Records no longer churns out chart-topping music, although it still has a program for songwriters. The building has been converted into the Stax Museum of American Soul Music. The Stax Music Academy group practicing on a rainy January evening includes both Black and white players. Before the work begins, some students joke around and dance in the hallway outside the rehearsal room, which boasts a high ceiling and a whiteboard with musical notes written on it. In a separate room, vocalists clap for each other as they take turns singing for their instructors. 'It’s so fun,' said Tatiyana Clark, a 17-year-old singer who joined the academy in 2023. 'I’ve been in places where we would have the same interest in music, but nothing is like the connection that I have here. Honestly, it’s a different level of friendship, when you have the exact same feelings towards music, the same experiences — almost.' Stax began online Black History Month presentations in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous programs have included specific themes, with this year's being the U.S. labor movement and how it involved and affected Black people, including work training, entrepreneurship and unionization. But this year's show is a series of in-person concerts at a downtown Memphis venue where attendees will hear Sam and Dave's 'Hold On, I'm Comin'', Arthur Conley's 'Sweet Soul Music,' and 'Cause I Love You,' by the father and daughter duet of Rufus and Carla Thomas. A companion study guide includes lessons and activities highlighting key figures and events that shaped labor policies and standards. 'It’s all about the message for me,' said Johnathan Cole, an 18-year-old singer and songwriter. 'It feels good because with the world going crazy right now, everybody just needs a little bit of love, happiness and music. That’s what Stax Music Academy has always been about: love, music, creativity.' When the labor and civil rights movements were striving for racial equality and social justice, Booker T. and the MGs churned out 'Green Onions' and other toe-tapping instrumental songs, with Black men at organ and drums — Booker T. Jones and Al Jackson Jr. — and white players on lead and bass guitar — Steve Cropper and Donald 'Duck' Dunn. 'I would describe Stax as ‘change,'' said Johnathan McKinnie, a 16-year-old piano and organ player. 'It drastically changed how music was formed … It was definitely an advocate for civil rights.' In the vocalists' rehearsal room, the group is perfecting Eddie Floyd's song about luck and love, 'Knock on Wood.' 'It’s like thunder, and lightning, the way you love me is frightening … better knock, knock, knock on wood,' three vocalists sing in harmony. 'Breathe. You’re not breathing,'' one instructor tells a student, who smiles and nods. The exchange exemplifies the spirit of cooperation and dedication that permeates the academy. Pasley Thompson, a 17-year-old singer and songwriter, calls the academy 'an escape from the every day.' 'Being able to be in a space with people that get you on a creative level, and on a personal level, because we’re around each other all the time, it’s a really great feeling to have,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stax-music-academy-s-teen-students-mark-25th-anniversary-black-history-month-with-concert-/7981556.html	2025-02-19T22:17:54-08:00	
Trump, Vance among speakers at gathering of conservatives	Conservative leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and politicians from Argentina, Britain, Poland and Italy, are among those set to address a three-day meeting of conservatives outside of Washington beginning Thursday. U.S. Vice President JD Vance leads off the Conservative Political Action Conference, with other sessions Thursday set to include discussions of cryptocurrency and Middle East peace, and a panel featuring relatives of hostages being held in Gaza. The CPAC conference helped Trump emerge as a figure in conservative politics and one which he addressed every year during his prior term in office. He used an address last year at the conference to pledge that a victory in the November presidential election would bring 'judgment day' for 'the liars and cheaters and fraudsters and censors and imposters who have commandeered our government.' In addition to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Thursday’s agenda also includes remarks from former British Prime Minister Liz Truss and Balazs Orban, the political director for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Santiago Abascal, head of the far-right Spanish political party Vox is set to address the event Thursday, as is British lawmaker Nigel Farage and former Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Later conference speakers include Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, Argentina’s President Javier Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
