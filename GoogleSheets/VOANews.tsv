Turkey assists with evacuations of foreign nationals from Syria	Ankara/Washington — Turkey is helping several countries that want to ensure the safe departure of their citizens from Syria after rebels captured Damascus and toppled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government last week. According to Turkish diplomatic sources who spoke to VOA Turkish on the condition of anonymity, Turkey's foreign and defense ministries are coordinating the evacuations of third-country nationals from Syria with the logistical support of Turkish ground forces. Turkish diplomatic sources also emphasized that the assistance to third-country nationals who want to leave Syria is being provided discreetly to prevent security risks such as hostage-taking. Turkey was less secretive about its assistance in evacuating third-country nationals from Lebanon during the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in October. In that operation, Turkish Foreign Ministry sources said, Ankara had helped 2,120 foreign citizens from 21 countries, including the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, to reach their destinations by air via Turkey as of October 16. In both evacuations, sources from Turkey's Ministry of National Defense told VOA Turkish, they provided necessary military vehicles and personnel support. The Turkish operation has been especially important because Damascus International Airport has been closed since Sunday, shortly after Assad fled the country. 'God willing, the airport will reopen as quickly as possible because we are going to work flat out,' airport director Anis Fallough told Agence France-Presse, without giving a precise time frame. An AFP correspondent saw armed rebel fighters deployed around the airport. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, in phone conversations with his counterparts, talked about evacuating foreign nationals through Turkey without disclosing the countries, diplomatic sources who were familiar with the talks told VOA Turkish. Pakistan, Italy Pakistan and Italy were among the countries that discussed the safety of their citizens with Turkey. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry posted on X that Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar had discussed the matter in a phone call with Fidan on December 8. In 2012, Italy cut diplomatic ties with Syria 'to reiterate the firmest condemnation of the unacceptable violence perpetrated by the Syrian regime against its citizens.' Italy resumed its diplomatic presence in Syria in July by appointing Stefano Ravagnan as an ambassador. Ravagnan began his post on November 20. In a press conference last Sunday, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani announced that Syrian rebels had entered the Italian ambassador's residence but had not harmed Ravagnan or his security staff. According to Tajani, about 300 Italian citizens are in Syria, and the embassy is ready to help them leave the country if they want. However, Tajani said that as of December 8, there were no evacuation requests other than from a group of 15 Italians who crossed into Lebanon overnight last weekend. US citizens in Syria The United States has suspended its diplomatic presence in Syria since February 2012. The Czech Republic has served as U.S. protecting power in the country since then. However, according to a State Department security alert on Tuesday, the Czech Republic is unable to assist the U.S. citizens in Syria at this time. 'We have been in contact with U.S. citizens who have enrolled in STEP or contacted us directly,' a State Department spokesperson said Wednesday in a statement to VOA Turkish, using the acronym for a traveler enrollment program that enables the State Department to contact them in case of emergency. 'Not all are seeking assistance to depart. With suspended embassy operations in Syria, it is difficult to provide an accurate number,' the statement said. The State Department spokesman also said that U.S. embassies in Syria’s neighboring countries are providing consular assistance to U.S. citizens who are able to depart. 'We are working with our partners to communicate U.S. citizen requests to cross into neighboring countries,' the statement said. UN presence Turkish diplomatic sources also said that Turkey provides logistical and security support to U.N. teams in Syria when necessary. The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it continues delivering humanitarian aid in Syria, even though the situation is 'highly volatile and uncertain, including determining which groups are in control.' 'The volatile security situation has forced the U.N. to suspend many lifesaving operations and reduce its footprint on the ground, but UNHCR and the U.N. are determined to remain here and provide services to all vulnerable Syrians in need of humanitarian support,' UNHCR Turkey spokesperson Selin Unal told VOA Turkish on Tuesday. Unal emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety of civilians, civilian infrastructure and humanitarian workers so the U.N. can continue its programs at full capacity.

Democracy tested in Eastern Europe amid accusations of Russian meddling	LONDON — This year saw a battle for influence in eastern Europe between the West and Russia as elections were held in several states that were once under Soviet rule. Moscow is widely accused of meddling in European democracy amid tensions that have run high since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Georgia In April, tens of thousands of Georgians staged demonstrations in Tbilisi against the government’s so-called 'foreign agent' law, which requires all organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register and submit to detailed investigations. The legislation was dubbed the 'Russian law' by its opponents, after similar laws long used by President Vladimir Putin’s government to silence political opposition and free media. The protests evolved into a battle for Georgia’s future: to be aligned with the West or with Russia. It is a fight that continues to this day on the streets of Tbilisi. Georgia’s opposition parties pinned their hopes on ousting the government in the October general election; however, the ruling Georgian Dream party won with more than 53% of the vote. Election monitors accused Georgian Dream of overseeing widespread vote rigging, including 'ballot box stuffing, physical assault on observers attempting to report on violations, observer and media removal from polling stations, tearing up of observers' complaints, intimidation of voters inside and outside polling stations,' according to the head of the European Parliament monitoring delegation, Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White. Georgian Dream insisted it won a fair election. The government suspended accession talks with the European Union. The United States in turn suspended its strategic partnership with Georgia. Many Georgians fear their hopes of a future tied to the West are being lost. Protesters returned to the streets in November, demanding another vote. 'I just want us to look towards Europe and not back to the hole where we just got out,' said student Salome Bakhtadze. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze was unrepentant. 'We are absolutely committed to fully neutralizing the radical opposition,' he said at a press conference on December 6. Moldova Moldova, another former Soviet republic, held a bitterly fought presidential election in October. Despite widespread evidence of meddling by Moscow, which it denied, pro-European incumbent Maia Sandu won the November second-round vote after Moldovans voted by a thin margin to embed the desire for EU membership in the nation’s constitution. 'Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy,' she said after her victory. Romania In neighboring Romania, far-right candidate Calin Georgescu, who opposes Western aid for Ukraine, scored a shock first-round win in November’s presidential election with 23% of the vote. Polls taken ahead of the vote suggested support for Georgescu was in the single digits. Romania’s top court annulled the result after security services uncovered an alleged disinformation campaign to promote Georgescu on social media, which was widely blamed on Russia. Moscow again denied meddling in the vote. 'This candidate’s campaign was supported by a state foreign to Romania’s interests,' Romania’s incumbent president, Klaus Iohannis, said in a televised address on December 6. The country has yet to choose a new date for an election rerun. Election interference Russia is conducting a campaign of interference in European democracy — but the picture is complex, argues Costin Ciobanu, a political analyst at Aarhus University in Denmark. 'There is evidence that Russia tried to use its tools to favor Georgescu, but we don't know yet whether there was a direct coordination between the Georgescu campaign and Russia,' Ciobanu told VOA. 'Russia is exploiting vulnerabilities within our democracies. They are leveraging the way in which social networks function in today's democracies. But I would not say that all that is happening within our societies, that all the grievances and fury that we see is a result of Russia leveraging its hybrid warfare techniques.' 'I would always emphasize the local vulnerabilities, the fact that sometimes you have this kind of gap between the elite and the population. And sometimes Russia is just trying to make those gaps wider,' Ciobanu said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-democracy-tested-in-2024-amid-accusations-of-russian-meddling/7897977.html	2024-12-11T15:38:42-08:00

No Iranian drone 'mothership' off the United States, Pentagon says	WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Wednesday flatly dismissed claims by a U.S. lawmaker that Iran might be launching drones over New Jersey from a 'mothership' off the East Coast. 'There is no truth to that,' said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh. 'There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States and there's no so-called 'mothership' launching drones towards the United States.' Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew, whose district in New Jersey includes Atlantic City, said he had uncovered what appeared to be an Iranian plot. 'What we’ve uncovered is alarming — drones flying in from the direction of the ocean, possibly linked to a missing Iranian mothership,' he said on social media platform X. The lawmaker also made the claims on Fox News. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it began receiving reports of drone activity near Morris County, New Jersey, on Nov. 18. The FAA has barred drone flights over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. Last week, the FBI and New Jersey State Police asked the public to report any information related to the recent sightings of possible drones flying in several areas along the Raritan River. 'Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,' the FBI said. The Pentagon said an initial assessment had shown the drones were not from another country and that the U.S. military had not shot them down because they did not pose a threat to any military installations. 'We have no evidence that these activities are coming from a foreign entity or the work of an adversary,' Singh said. 'We're going to continue to monitor what is happening. But, you know, at no point were our installations threatened when this activity was occurring.' Still, the latest drone sightings are a reminder of the growing concern about a proliferation of drone technology and the potential security considerations, given that drones can carry surveillance technology or even explosives. At a press conference, House of Representatives Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries was asked about the lack of information about the drones. 'We need a greater degree of transparency from law enforcement authorities, and we will make sure that happens in the days and weeks to come,' Jeffries said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-iranian-drone-mothership-off-the-united-states-pentagon-says/7898051.html	2024-12-11T15:14:12-08:00	
Syrian rebel commander: Assad lieutenants will be hunted down	The main commander of the Syrian fighters who deposed strongman Bashar al-Assad said Wednesday that anyone involved in the torture and killing of people Assad detained during his iron-fisted rule would be hunted down, with pardons out of the question. 'We will pursue them in Syria, and we ask countries to hand over those who fled so we can achieve justice,' Abu Mohammed al-Jolani said in a statement published on the Syrian state TV's Telegram channel. Jolani’s vow to extract revenge against Assad’s lieutenants of torture and death came as the world is watching to see if Syria's new rulers can stabilize the country after civil war fought for nearly 14 years along sectarian and ethnic lines has left it in shambles. Mohammed al-Bashir, the man installed by Jolani's fighters to lead an interim administration through March 1, pleaded with millions of refugees to return home, create unity and provide basic services. But rebuilding is a daunting proposition with little funding on hand. 'In the coffers, there are only Syrian pounds worth little or nothing. One U.S. dollar buys 35,000 of our coins,' Bashir told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. 'We have no foreign currency, and as for loans and bonds, we are still collecting data. So yes, financially we are very bad,' said Bashir, who previously ran a small rebel-led administration in a pocket of northwestern Syria. But Bashir said the Islamist-led alliance that ousted Assad will guarantee the rights of all religious groups. 'Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria,' Bashir said. More than 500,000 people were killed in the war, with more than half the population forced to flee their homes. About 6 million Syrians sought refuge abroad. Bashir pleaded with those who fled the violence to return home. In his interview with Corriere della Sera, he said, 'Syria is now a free country that has earned its pride and dignity. Come back.' Foreign officials are warily engaging with the former rebels, part of the former al-Qaida affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which remains designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and others. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the new government must 'uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, 'It's our duty to do everything to support different Syrian leaders in order to make sure that they come together, they are able to guarantee a smooth transition.' But the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the security situation in Syria remains volatile. The agency said it has found more than 50 minefields over the past 10 days, which is curtailing the movement of civilians and impeding the delivery of goods and services. Meanwhile, Russia, which had supported Assad’s fight against the rebels and now has granted him asylum, said Wednesday it is closely monitoring the situation in Syria and is in contact with 'those who are currently controlling the situation.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted Russia’s need to ensure the security of its diplomatic facilities and its military bases in Syria, where Russian troops were based for years supporting the Syrian military in the country’s civil war. Assad’s fall also dealt a blow to Iran’s interests in the region, cutting off a land delivery route for weapons to the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, as well as territory in which Iranian militias could operate. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday rejected the idea of a weakened Iranian network in the region, which includes its support of Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, militias in Iraq and Houthi militants in Yemen. Khamenei also said what happened in Syria was the result of a U.S.-Israeli plan, and that a 'neighboring state' of Syria played a role in Assad’s ouster. He did not name the neighboring country, but Turkey, which borders Syria, was a main supporter of groups that opposed Assad. As Syrians work to establish the future of their country, Pope Francis said Wednesday he hoped for a political solution that promotes 'the stability and unity of the country.' 'I pray ... that the Syrian people may live in peace and security in their beloved land and the different religions may walk together in friendship and mutual respect for the good of that nation afflicted by so many years of war,' he said.

EU imposes new sanctions on Russia	European Union ambassadors have agreed to a new raft of sanctions against Russia because of its war on Ukraine, mainly targeting Russia’s massive shadow fleet of ships, the EU’s Hungarian presidency said Wednesday. The Associated Press reports the new sanctions are directed at some 50 'routinely decrepit' ships that Russia uses to avoid restrictions on transporting oil and fuel. 'I welcome the adoption of our 15th package of sanctions, targeting in particular Russia's shadow fleet,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. The sanctions, which are expected to be formally adopted by the EU on Monday, will add additional entities and individuals to the current list. Details about the new list of sanctions will be revealed when they are published in the EU’s legal journal. The current roster of sanctions imposed against Russia by the 27-member European bloc names more than 2,000 individuals and entities. The sanctions have included travel bans and the freezing of assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his associates, as well as several Russian lawmakers. The EU initiated the sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. Some information for this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-imposes-new-sanctions-on-russia/7898060.html	2024-12-11T14:51:11-08:00	
US judge orders CIA analyst accused of Israel-Iran leak held pending trial	ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — A CIA analyst charged with leaking top-secret details ahead of a planned Israeli attack on Iran earlier this year will remain jailed pending trial, a judge ordered Wednesday. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles overruled a magistrate who said last week that Asif Rahman, 34, of Vienna, Virginia, could be free on restrictions while he awaited trial on charges of disclosing national defense information. The fight over Rahman's detention revealed additional details about the government's investigation of the leak and the analyst who allegedly disclosed the classified documents in October on the Telegram messaging app. At Wednesday's detention hearing, prosecutor Troy Edwards said Rahman was motivated by ideology, though he did not discuss what that ideology might be. In fact, he said the conclusion that Rahman's motive was ideological was essentially the result of the process of elimination, noting that Rahman comes from a wealthy family and has access to a multimillion-dollar family trust, and therefore wouldn't have a financial incentive. Edwards also highlighted eight pages of notes found on Rahman when he was arrested last month in Cambodia, where he worked at the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh. Those notes included two separate 'to-do' lists, one of which was largely blocks of apparently encrypted text along with an unencrypted sentence pertaining to U.S. missile capabilities. Edwards said investigators have not yet been able to decipher the encryption. A separate, unencrypted to-do list included categories labeled 'contingencies' and 'run,' Edwards said. Official court documents are vague about what was leaked, but details discussed in open court made clear that the material references an October disclosure of documents from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, noting that Israel was moving military assets into place to conduct a military strike on Iran after Iran launched its own missile attack on Israel on October 1. Israel ended up carrying out an attack on Iran's air defense systems and missile manufacturing facilities in late October. In court papers, the government said the leak caused Israel to delay its attack plans. Edwards said the volatile nature of the Middle East made the leak exceptionally dangerous. 'It is hard to overstate what other circumstances present graver risks of danger to human life than unilaterally deciding' to transmit information related to plans for 'kinetic military action between two countries,' prosecutors wrote in court papers. Rahman's attorney, Amy Jeffress, cited anonymous sources in news articles who have downplayed the leak's significance. Jeffress said the to-do list included the word 'run' because Rahman is an avid jogger. She also said it's rare for defendants facing similar charges to be detained pending trial. Rahman was born in California and moved with his family when he was a child to Cincinnati, where he was a high school valedictorian, according to court papers submitted by his lawyer. He went to Yale University and graduated in three years. He and his wife now live in the D.C. metro area, along with his parents. His father, Muhit Rahman, who was prepared to serve as his son's custodian pretrial if he had been released, attended Wednesday's hearing along with numerous family members and friends in support. Rahman made his initial court appearance last month in Guam. Jeffress said after Wednesday's hearing that she intended to appeal the detention order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-orders-cia-analyst-accused-of-israel-iran-leak-held-pending-trial-/7898068.html	2024-12-11T14:32:23-08:00	
Arizona sues Saudi firm over 'excessive' groundwater pumping, saying it's a public nuisance	PHOENIX, Arizona — Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced Wednesday she's suing a Saudi Arabian agribusiness for allegedly violating a public nuisance law, contending that its groundwater pumping threatens the public health, safety and infrastructure of local communities in a rural western county. The complaint filed in Maricopa County Superior Court alleges that the pumping at a Fondomonte Arizona, LLC. alfalfa farm has had widespread effects in the Ranegras Plain Basin of La Paz County, harming everyone who depends on basin water by drawing down supplies, drying up wells and causing the ground to crack and sink in some areas. The lawsuit is the latest action by Arizona against foreign companies that use huge amounts of groundwater to grow thirsty forage crops for export because of climate challenges in other countries. Rural Arizona is especially attractive to international businesses because it has no groundwater pumping regulations. The lawsuit alleges that since 2014, Fondomonte has extracted huge amounts that accelerated depletion of the basin's aquifer. The Associated Press called and emailed Fondomonte Arizona, a subsidiary of Saudi Dairy giant Almarai Co., seeking a response to the lawsuit Wednesday. Its lawyers have previously said that the company legally leased and purchased land in the U.S. and spent millions on infrastructure improvements. Years of drought have increased pressure on water users across the West, particularly in states like Arizona, which relies heavily on the dwindling Colorado River. The drought has also made groundwater — long used by farmers and rural residents without restriction — even more important for users across the state. Mayes' lawsuit alleges that Fondomonte's actions are a public nuisance under a state statute that prohibits activity that injures health, obstructs property use or interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by a community. Mayes called the company's groundwater pumping 'unsustainable' and said it caused 'devastating consequences' for people in the area. 'Arizona law is clear: No company has the right to endanger an entire community's health and safety for its own gain,' she said. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the company from further groundwater pumping it says is 'excessive' and require that an abatement fund be established. Arizona officials have been targeting Fondomonte for more than a year over its use of groundwater to grow forage crops, by not renewing or canceling the company's leases in Butler Valley in western Arizona. Some residents there had complained that the company's pumping was threatening their wells.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arizona-sues-saudi-firm-over-excessive-groundwater-pumping-saying-it-s-a-public-nuisance-/7898047.html	2024-12-11T14:08:13-08:00	
California's Malibu remains under threat of flames, thousands evacuated	MALIBU, CALIFORNIA — A fire continued to spread Wednesday in Malibu, a posh Californian city popular with celebrities, where thousands of people were evacuated as firefighters battled wind-fanned flames to save threatened homes. About 4,000 acres and at least seven properties, authorities said, have gone up in smoke since the Franklin Fire broke out Monday night on the hills above Pepperdine University. As of Wednesday morning, firefighters had contained the fire by 7%, firefighters said. The fire's intensity has decreased to the east and north, but the flames have strengthened to the west overnight, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Wednesday, warning that the area is not out of danger. 'Weather conditions, including strong winds and low humidity, will be closely monitored today as they play a key role in the evolution of the fire,' he told reporters. The resulting red alert should be maintained for a good part of the day, estimates the local official. About 20,000 people were under evacuation orders or alerts Tuesday asking them to prepare to evacuate, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Among the evacuees was former movie star Dick Van Dyke, 99, best known for his role in Mary Poppins (1964): 'Arlene [his wife] and I have safely evacuated our animals, except for one cat that escaped as we were leaving. We pray that he will survive and that our community will survive these terrible fires,' he wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. More than 1,500 firefighters are battling the blaze, supported by a fleet of water-bombing aircraft. After two rainy winters that gave it a relative respite, California is experiencing a very active fire season this year. In July through August, the state suffered the fourth largest fire in its history. Scientists believe that increasingly intense heat waves and droughts are fueling forest fires and are consequences of climate change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-s-malibu-remains-under-threat-of-flames-thousands-evacuated/7898035.html	2024-12-11T14:04:55-08:00	
Biden says healthy women help US prosperity as he highlights White House initiative	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he was 'so proud' that a women's health research initiative he launched last year at his wife's urging has already invested nearly $1 billion because a healthy female population improves U.S. prosperity. 'That's a fact,' he said in closing remarks at the first White House Conference on Women's Health Research. 'We haven't gotten that through to the other team yet,' Biden said, referencing President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration. Trump's three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court from his first term as president voted to overturn a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. Democrats campaigned on reproductive rights and women's health issues in this year's elections. Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump's transition team, said the president-elect would keep his promise to improve health in the U.S. 'President Trump campaigned on making America healthy again for ALL Americans including men, women, and children, and he will deliver on that promise,' Leavitt said in an email. Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied, officials have said. First lady Jill Biden has said she brought the idea for the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research to the president after Maria Shriver, herself a women's health advocate and member of the influential Kennedy political family, brought it to her. The first lady told the researchers, advocates, and business and philanthropic leaders attending the conference that she would keep pressing the issue. 'My work doesn't stop in January when Joe and I leave this house,' she said. 'I will keep building alliances, like the ones that brought us here today, and I will keep pushing for funding for innovative research.' Jill Biden said the U.S. economy loses about $1.8 billion in working time every year because of how menopause affects women. And she is interested in learning more about extreme morning sickness during pregnancy. 'I heard this a couple weeks ago and I was particularly interested because my own granddaughter was going through the same thing, because we're going to be great-grandparents,' Jill Biden said. Granddaughter Naomi Biden Neal and her husband, Peter Neal, are expecting their first child. Since its launch, the women's health research initiative has attracted nearly $1 billion in federal funding, including from the Defense Department and National Institutes of Health. 'In one year, everybody in this room kicked butt,' Shriver said at the conference. 'Not until the Bidens did anyone ever think to make women's health and research a priority for the federal government, so let that sink in.' President Biden closed the conference with a nod to the influence of his wife, who, after her remarks, sat in the front row beside their daughter, Ashley Biden, who runs a women's shelter in Philadelphia. 'You stepped up, kid,' Biden told the first lady. Then he told the audience, 'In case you wonder, when she speaks, I listen.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-says-healthy-women-help-us-prosperity-as-he-highlights-white-house-initiative/7898040.html	2024-12-11T13:55:49-08:00

Azerbaijani rights defender receives US human rights award in absentia	Rufat Safarov, a prominent human rights defender from Azerbaijan, was one of the recipients of the U.S. secretary of state’s 2024 Human Rights Defender Award. He did not attend Tuesday's ceremony in Washington, because he'd been arrested December 3, hours after visiting the U.S. Embassy in Baku to receive his visa to travel to the United States. During the ceremony, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, pointing to the empty chair reserved for Safarov, called for his immediate release. 'Now, one chair, as you will have noted, is empty on this stage. ... It belongs to Rufat Safarov, the Azerbaijani human rights defender that I spoke of just a few moments ago,' he said. 'The government of Azerbaijan should release Rufat — and release him immediately — as well as all the other journalists, human rights defenders, political opponents and others that are unjustly detained.' At the end of the ceremony, Blinken presented awards to human rights defenders from Bolivia, Colombia, Eswatini, Ghana, Kuwait, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan, and he posed for a photo with them. Later, Blinken approached the empty seat reserved for Safarov and took a commemorative photo with his award. Blinken issued another statement Wednesday calling on the Azerbaijani government to release Safarov, as well as others unjustly detained for their work in the field of human rights. 'The United States is deeply concerned not only by these detentions, but by the increasing crackdown on civil society and media in Azerbaijan,' the statement read. Safarov, a former prosecutor who heads the Defense Line human rights organization, issued a statement expressing his gratitude for the award. 'Unfortunately, Baku arrested me in order to prevent me from personally receiving that award and to punish me for my human rights advocacy,' he said in the statement sent to VOA from prison. Safarov said he was proud of his work defending universal values as a human rights activist 'despite all the slander and pressure' from the government. 'In fact, I have accepted my arrest as a reward from the government for human rights advocacy. Human rights are not an internal affair of any country. İt is a universal concept. 'Without human rights, not only the state, but even the society cannot exist. I call on everyone to stand in solidarity in the defense of human rights,' the statement read. Last week, Safarov was charged with fraud and hooliganism and put on four months of pretrial detention. Azerbaijan's Ministry of Internal Affairs told VOA that Safarov's detention was related to a conflict between him and an individual over a land purchase, an allegation he denied. Safarov was previously sentenced to jail for bribery in 2016 and served three years before being pardoned by President Ilham Aliyev. His arrest coincides with a new crackdown in Azerbaijan following a recent climate change conference held November 11-22 in Baku. The arrests prompted Western concerns about the state of human rights in the country. In his statement Wednesday, Blinken called on Azerbaijani authorities to end the crackdown on civil society and the media. 'We urge the government of Azerbaijan to release those unjustly detained for their advocacy on behalf of human rights, cease its crackdown on civil society, respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all, and fulfill the commitments it made when it joined the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,' Blinken said.

Arrest warrant for Guatemalan journalist viewed as retaliatory	WASHINGTON — A court in Guatemala City has issued an arrest warrant in absentia for a prominent investigative journalist known for his reporting on governmental and judicial corruption in the country. Juan Luis Font, director and host of the daily radio talk show 'ConCriterio' and a co-founder of El Periodico newspaper in Guatemala, is accused of collusion and bribery, charges he denies. The journalist, who lives in exile in France, told VOA he expected that a warrant would be issued because of his stories on corruption. 'They speak about me laundering money. They speak about me being bribed. And they have not been able to build up any of these cases. Instead, they have proceeded with these accusations against me,' he said. Watchdogs say the Justice Department in Guatemala often uses the threat of legal action to silence critical voices. The press freedom environment in the country is 'dire,' according to the free expression group Fundamedios, which said journalists have difficulty bringing corruption cases to light because they are frequently prosecuted. The Guatemala Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment. Font said he has been vocal about allegations of corruption in the judiciary. 'I am not a person who is going to be well-seen by the people in power,' he said. Guatemala experienced years of corruption before electing current President Bernardo Arevalo, who ran on an anti-corruption platform in 2023. There are 'serious problems' with the independence of the Guatemalan judiciary, according to a 2023 State Department country report. The report found inefficiency, corruption and 'manipulation of justice' within the justice system, and many who are arrested are denied fair, public trials. Judicial harassment of journalists has also been on the rise, according to the watchdog group Reporters Without Borders. 'The Justice Department is still in the hands of people who really want to silence all the critical voices, all the people who do investigations, and the people who bring to light what's happening in Guatemala,' Dagmar Thiel, U.S. CEO of Fundamedios, told VOA. 'And Juan Luis is one of the strongest critical voices in Guatemala.' Font is one of the most well-known journalists in Guatemala, according to Thiel. He co-founded El Periodico with Jose Ruben Zamora, who spent more than two years in prison in what watchdogs say was retaliatory action. Zamora is currently under house arrest after an appeals court overturned a conviction on money laundering charges in October. Zamora’s son, Jose Carlos, told VOA that Guatemalan Attorney General Consuelo Porras and special prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche have led an 'assault' on press freedom. 'This group fabricates cases and issues unlawful rulings to silence journalists exposing corruption,' Jose Carlos wrote to VOA. The case against Font has been condemned by international groups. The National Press Club in Washington demanded an end to the harassment that Font and other Guatemalan journalists experience. Cases like these highlight the 'animosity Guatemala's judicial authorities have for independent and critical journalism,' club president Emily Wilkins said in a statement Tuesday. 'Journalism is not a crime, and Font is not a criminal.' Font told VOA that one of the accusations against him is 'bribing' an anti-corruption judge named Erika Aifan, who fled Guatemala in 2022. The alleged bribe, he said, is a 'Person of the Year' award that Font presented to her on 'ConCriterio.' 'It’s absolutely nuts,' Font said. 'They said I granted her a payment in the form of an honor two years before I knew I would even need her help.' Font is one of around 20 Guatemalan journalists now in exile who fled Guatemala to avoid legal retaliation, Thiel of Fundamedios said. In France, Font is still running his radio show. 'I did the right thing by leaving my country two years ago, and I have been well,' he said. 'I’m sleeping peacefully, because I'm sure that they're not going to be able to put me in jail the next morning.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/arrest-warrant-for-guatemalan-journalist-viewed-as-retaliatory/7897897.html	2024-12-11T12:42:37-08:00	
Gun found on suspect in killing of US insurance CEO matches shell casings at scene, police say	ALTOONA, PENNSYLVANIA — The gun found on the suspect in the killing of United Healthcare's CEO matched shell casings found at the site of the shooting, New York City's police commissioner said Wednesday. Suspect Luigi Mangione's fingerprints also matched a water bottle and a protein bar wrapper that police found near the scene and say the gunman purchased at a nearby coffee shop while awaiting his target, Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at an unrelated news conference. Mangione, 26, was charged with murder in the shooting last week in midtown Manhattan of Brian Thompson, who led the United States' largest medical insurance company. Authorities have said that writings found in Mangione's possession hinted at a hatred of corporate greed. They've recovered a spiral notebook that Mangione kept, along with a three-page handwritten letter found when he was arrested, a law enforcement official said Wednesday. Police have not disclosed what was in the notebook. The letter, found when Mangione was arrested Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, teased the possibility that clues to the attack — 'some straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it' — could be found in the notebook, the law enforcement official said. The official wasn't authorized to disclose information about the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Kenny told CBS New York that the motive might have been related to an accident that sent Mangione to an emergency room on July 4, 2023. A law enforcement bulletin obtained by the AP earlier this week said the letter expressed anger with what Mangione called 'parasitic' health insurance companies and a disdain for corporate greed and power. The prep school and Ivy League graduate wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world and that profits of major corporations continue to rise while life expectancy doesn't, according to the bulletin. In his first public words since his arrest, Mangione emerged from a patrol car Tuesday shouting about an 'insult to the intelligence of the American people' while deputies pushed him into a courthouse. Mangione remained jailed without bail in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with gun and forgery offenses. Manhattan prosecutors were working to bring Mangione to New York. At a brief hearing Tuesday in Pennsylvania, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey said Mangione will not waive extradition and instead wants a hearing on the issue. 'You can't rush to judgment in this case or any case,' Dickey said afterward. 'He's presumed innocent. Let's not forget that.' Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City, after a McDonald's customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said. New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the suspected shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs. Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4 as he walked alone to a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. From surveillance video, New York investigators determined the shooter quickly fled the city, likely by bus. His movements afterward are unclear, but authorities believe he took steps to stay off the radar. Prosecutors said at his Pennsylvania hearing Tuesday that when arrested, he had bags for his cellphone and laptop that prevent such devices from transmitting signals that authorities can use to track them. Mangione, a grandson of a well-known Maryland real estate developer and philanthropist, had a graduate degree in computer science and worked for a time at a car-buying website. During the first half of 2022, he bunked at a 'co-living' space in Hawaii, where those who knew him said he suffered from severe and sometimes debilitating back pain. His relatives have said in a statement that they are was 'shocked and devastated' at his arrest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gun-found-on-suspect-in-killing-of-us-insurance-ceo-matches-shell-casings-at-scene-police-say-/7897916.html	2024-12-11T12:39:51-08:00

Wisconsin kayaker who faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe has willingly returned to US	GREEN LAKE, WISCONSIN — A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning and left his wife and three children and was believed to have been in Eastern Europe willingly returned to the U.S. after roughly four months and is in custody, a sheriff said Wednesday. Ryan Borgwardt 'came back on his own' because of his family, Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll said during a brief news conference. 'We can stand here feeling relieved,' Podoll said. Borgwardt, 45, landed Tuesday and was being held at the county jail pending an afternoon court appearance. The sheriff said his office has recommended a number of charges, including obstruction. A message seeking information on potential charges was not immediately returned by the county prosecutor. Last month, Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with authorities on Nov. 11 after disappearing for three months but hadn't committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were 'pulling at his heartstrings' to come home. Podoll declined to say specifically where Borgwardt has been since he disappeared and deflected a question about any conversations that may have persuaded him to return. 'That's going to be up to him someday. We're not going to release that. ... We brought a dad back on his own,' Podoll said. Podoll declined to discuss the details of Borgwardt's return trip, other than to say 'he got on an airplane and landed in the U.S.' and turned himself in at the Green Lake County Justice Center on Tuesday. Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because of 'personal matters,' the sheriff said in November. He told them that in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from his home in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked that lake because it's the deepest in Wisconsin. After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles (110 kilometers) through the night to Madison. From there, he said he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane. An analysis of a laptop — it was not clear whose — revealed a digital trail that shows Borgwardt had planned to head to Europe and tried to mislead investigators. The laptop's hard drive had been replaced and the browsers had been cleared on the day Borgwardt disappeared, Podoll said in a news release in November. Investigators found passport photos, inquiries about moving funds to foreign banks and communication with a woman from Uzbekistan. They also discovered that Borgwardt also took out a $375,000 life insurance policy in January. Law enforcement personnel made contact with Borgwardt on Nov. 11. He sent them a video of himself wearing an orange T-shirt and not smiling. He said in the video that he was in his apartment and briefly panned the camera but mostly showed just a door and bare walls. He did not say where he was. The sheriff's office has said the search for Borgwardt's body, which lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that Borgwardt told authorities that he didn't expect the search to last more than two weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wisconsin-kayaker-who-faked-his-death-and-fled-to-eastern-europe-has-willingly-returned-to-us-/7897861.html	2024-12-11T12:30:39-08:00	
US: Russia could target Ukraine again with new missile	A U.S. intelligence assessment has concluded that Russia could launch another of its experimental hypersonic ballistic missiles against Ukraine in the coming days, although Washington does not consider it to be decisive in the nearly three-year war, a U.S. official said Wednesday. Russia first fired the Oreshnik missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Nov. 21, in what President Vladimir Putin characterized as a response to Ukraine's first use of long-range U.S. and British missiles to strike deeper into Russian territory with Western permission. 'We assess that the Oreshnik is not a game-changer on the battlefield, but rather just another attempt by Russia to terrorize Ukraine, which will fail,' the U.S. official told reporters. There was no immediate response from Russia. Putin has previously said Russia may fire the Oreshnik missile again, possibly to target 'decision-making centers' in Kyiv, if Ukraine keeps attacking Russia with long-range Western weapons. Russia's defense ministry said that Ukraine had attacked a military airfield in the southern Russian city of Taganrog on Wednesday morning with six of the U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles and promised retaliation. It said all six had been intercepted, but that falling missile debris had caused some injuries. The Russian leader has claimed that the Oreshnik is impossible to intercept and that it has destructive power comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead. Some Western experts have said the novel feature of the Oreshnik is that it carries multiple warheads capable of simultaneously striking different targets — something usually associated with longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles. A surveillance camera video of the strike three weeks ago showed huge fireballs piercing the darkness and slamming into the ground at astonishing speed. Within hours of Ukraine’s attack on the Russian military facility, Putin took the rare step of speaking on national TV to boast about the new, hypersonic missile. He warned the West that its next use could be against Ukraine's NATO allies, which allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Nonetheless, the U.S. official downplayed the usefulness of the missiles, calling them 'experimental' in nature and said that 'Russia likely possesses only a handful' of them. The official also said the weapon has a smaller warhead than other missiles Russia has deployed in Ukraine. The United States says it is sending more air defense systems to Ukraine even as Russia gains territory in eastern Ukraine six weeks ahead of Donald Trump becoming the U.S. president again. Trump has been a skeptic of continuing U.S. support for Ukraine. Trump has said he will end the war before he takes office but has not said how. He has pointedly refused to say he wants Ukraine to win the war, leaving Washington's long-term military support for Ukraine in question. Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris over the weekend. Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Tuesday that a rescue operation was 'currently under way' in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, following a Russian missile strike that killed three people and injured 18 others. Zelenskyy added that Ukraine does not have enough air defense systems to protect it from Russian missiles. 'But our partners do have these systems. We repeat, again and again, that air defense systems should save lives, not collect dust in storage bases,' he said. Separately, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday that Ukraine-Russia peace talks could begin 'in the winter,' a timeline that coincides with Poland taking over the rotating presidency of the European Union on January 1. Tusk offered few details about where, when or even who would be involved in the negotiations, but he told his Cabinet he hoped the 'end effect' of the EU's negotiations would result in peace for Ukraine. Tusk, however, indicated that Poland, which has been a staunch supporter of neighboring Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country in February 2022, will be a major participant in the talks. 'I really want Poland to be the country that will not only be present but will set the tone for these decisions that are to bring us security and secure Polish interests,' the prime minister said. Separately, France’s Macron is expected to meet with Tusk Thursday in Warsaw to discuss Ukraine. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-russia-could-target-ukraine-again-with-new-missile/7897874.html	2024-12-11T12:28:35-08:00	
FBI Director Wray says he plans to resign at end of Biden's term in January	Washington — FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday he intends to resign at the end of President Joe Biden's term in January, an announcement that came a week and a half after President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate loyalist Kash Patel for the job. At a town hall meeting with the bureau workforce, Wray said he would be stepping down 'after weeks of careful thought.' Wray's intended resignation is not unexpected considering that Trump had picked Patel for the role in his new administration. Wray had previously been named by Trump and began the 10-year term — a length meant to insulate the agency from the political influence of changing administrations — in 2017, after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey. Trump had telegraphed his anger with Wray on multiple occasions, including after Wray's congressional testimony in September. But the soft-spoken director rarely seemed to go out of his way to publicly confront the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-director-wray-says-he-plans-to-resign-at-end-of-biden-s-term-in-january/7897887.html	2024-12-11T11:41:05-08:00	
US security officials meet with lawmakers about mysterious drone flights	U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials in New Jersey huddled with state and local lawmakers Wednesday to discuss the recent spate of drone sightings throughout the state. Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month and have raised growing concern among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified. Most, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists. The number of sightings has increased in recent days, although officials say many of the objects seen may have been planes rather than drones. It's also possible that a single drone has been reported more than once. Governor Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don't appear to threaten public safety. The FBI has been investigating and has asked residents to share any videos, photos or other information they may have. Many municipal lawmakers have called for more restrictions on who is entitled to fly the unmanned devices. At least one state lawmaker proposed a temporary ban on drone flights in the state. 'This is something we're taking deadly seriously. I don't blame people for being frustrated,' Murphy said earlier this week. Details about Wednesday's meeting were not immediately disclosed. A spokesperson for the Democratic governor said he was not attending. Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, whose district includes parts of the state where the drones have been reported, said he and other legislators met with Homeland Security and state police officials for about 90 minutes at a state police facility in West Trenton. Peterson said DHS officials were generous with their time but appeared dismissive of some concerns, saying not all the sightings reported have been confirmed to involve drones. Who or what is behind the flying objects? Where are they coming from? What are they doing? 'My understanding is they have no clue,' Peterson said. A message seeking comment on Peterson's remarks was left with the Department of Homeland Security. Most of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas and some were recently reported flying over a large reservoir in Clinton. Sightings also have been reported in neighboring states, including the New York City area, and over Pennsylvania's Delaware County and Philadelphia. James Edwards of Succasunna, New Jersey, said he has seen a few drones flying over his neighborhood since last month. 'It raises concern mainly because there's so much that's unknown,' Edwards said Wednesday. 'There are lots of people spouting off about various conspiracies that they believe are in play here, but that only adds fuel to the fire unnecessarily. We need to wait and see what is really happening here, not let fear of the unknown overtake us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-security-officials-meet-with-lawmakers-about-mysterious-drone-flights/7897847.html	2024-12-11T11:37:51-08:00	
Zimbabwe aims to end HIV/AIDS as public health threat by 2030	MARONDERA, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwean health officials said Tuesday they aim to eliminate HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, crediting the United States with making such progress possible through aid and support. U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe Pamela Tremont and officials from PEPFAR and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention toured the HIV services area at Marondera Hospital, located some 70 kilometers east of Harare, the Zimbabwe capital, where HIV/AIDS once sickened thousands. Speaking to journalists afterward, Dr. Delight Madoro, a district medical officer in Mashonaland East province, said PEPFAR — or the U.S. Presidential Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — enabled Zimbabwe to combat the epidemic with strategies such as blood-based self-testing and PrEP, which stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. 'And after maybe you test positive, there are staff and support ... at the facilities to help link you to other HIV services,' Madoro said. 'There is a lot that is happening on the ground in terms of [the] fight against HIV through the support that we are getting from PEPFAR,' he continued. 'And in terms of human resources, we’re getting more staff. This means our clients are going to have more time with clinicians, so that we become thorough, and we get thorough with our treatment. 'So, in a nutshell, I can say the support that we have been getting from PEPFAR is of paramount importance,' he said. Tremont said the U.S. was committed to help fight the HIV epidemic in Zimbabwe. 'We’ve made huge progress since 2006,' she said. 'The number of deaths from HIV has fallen 80%, and that is something I think we should all be very proud of.' Tremont mentioned that the U.S. provided antiretroviral treatments and many health care workers at clinics and hospitals around Zimbabwe. 'It’s great to see all that in action today and to see the dedication and stubbornness of the health care workers reaching down to those HIV patients who are scared and reluctant to undertake treatment,' she said. 'Thank you to the health care workers. You are our heroes in all this.' Haddi Cham, the Centers for Disease Control’s Zimbabwe HIV services branch chief, said the PEPFAR program made the HIV facility at Marondera Hospital possible. 'We have been supporting this facility for many, many years now, and we are really grateful for the collaboration with all the key stakeholders. Through that strong collaboration, we are able to realize these results,' Cham said. Zimbabwe is one of the countries hit hardest by HIV/AIDS, especially before 1999, when authorities introduced an AIDS levy — a 3% tax on income and business profits that is used by the National AIDS Council for programs to combat the spread of the pandemic. Data indicate the prevalence of HIV among adults ages 15 to 49 in Zimbabwe declined from 12.7% in 2019 to 10.5% in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-aims-to-end-hiv-aids-as-public-health-threat-by-2030/7897816.html	2024-12-11T11:26:52-08:00

Wife of journalist killed in Cambodia says she feared for his safety	The wife of Chhoeung Chheng, an environmental journalist killed in Cambodia, says she had warned him against investigating illegal logging at night. Chhoeung had been working to uncover deforestation in Siem Reap province when he was shot on December 4. The 63-year-old journalist died from his injuries at a hospital on December 7. His wife, Cheav Chab, 53, told VOA’s Khmer service that Chhoeung had been dedicated to journalism, with a career spanning over a decade. But she worried about his work for the news website Kampuchea Aphiwat on illegal activity in their region. 'I warned him not to investigate forests at night, as those involved in deforestation don't take kindly to us,' she said. She is now seeking justice for her husband's killing, telling VOA, 'I don't want his death to be in vain.' Moeun Ny, a journalist and friend of Chhoeung, told VOA that the pair worked together to expose deforestation. 'We aimed to prevent further forest loss,' said Moeun. 'We always reported logging activities to the authorities.' Moeun believes their reporting made them a target for those involved in deforestation. The Ministry of Information said a suspected gunman has been arrested and is under investigation. The ministry spokesperson, Tep Asnarith, said the ministry is taking the incident seriously and reiterated the government's commitment to protecting press freedom as enshrined in the Cambodian Constitution. Nop Vy, the executive director of the media association CamboJA, said the case underscores the threats to journalists in Cambodia, particularly those covering environmental issues. He called for a thorough investigation into Chheung's case, and incidents involving other media workers. Nop added that punishing those responsible is crucial to ending harassment of journalists. Authorities looking into attacks on media should 'speed up the investigations effectively and transparently to conclude the investigations and bring perpetrators to prosecute,' he told VOA. The media watchdog Reporters Without Borders in a statement also emphasized the need to secure justice in such cases. 'This murder is appalling and demands a strong response,' the watchdog said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wife-of-journalist-killed-in-cambodia-says-she-feared-for-his-safety/7897716.html	2024-12-11T10:44:53-08:00	
Israel urges action to protect Syria’s Kurds	WASHINGTON — Israeli government officials have intensified calls to protect Syria’s Kurds as they face armed groups backed by Turkey following the sudden collapse of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. An 11-day rebel offensive, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, resulted in the capture of the capital, Damascus, and other strategic cities in northwest and central Syria. Now, an operation led by Turkish-backed factions is aimed at dislodging Kurdish forces from parts of Aleppo province, including the town of Manbij. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, have been a major U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State terror group. The partnership led to the liberation of most territory once controlled by Islamic State in Syria. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said Monday that Turkish-backed attacks on Syria’s Kurds must be stopped. 'It’s a commitment of the international community towards those who fought bravely against ISIS,' Sa’ar said during a press briefing in Jerusalem. 'It’s also a commitment for the future of Syria, because the Kurds are a stabilizing force in this country.' The top Israeli diplomat said they were discussing this issue with the United States and other countries. Since the ouster of the Assad regime, the Israeli military said it has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, targeting weapons stockpiles across the country. Israeli officials said the airstrikes were aimed at preventing strategic weapons from falling into the wrong hands amid the ongoing chaos. Israel has also deployed ground troops beyond a demilitarized buffer zone between the two countries. Israeli officials described these measures as temporary, pending a resolution of the political situation in Syria. The Turkish government, a main backer of the Syrian rebels, views the SDF as an extension of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. Washington, however, makes a clear distinction between the two Kurdish groups. Salih Muslim, a senior Kurdish politician with the Democratic Union Party, the de facto ruling party in northeast Syria, welcomed the recent statements by Israeli officials expressing support for the Kurds, describing the position as a positive and encouraging step. 'Undoubtedly, any force that defends our rights is welcomed,' he said in an interview posted Tuesday on X by a London-based journalist. 'Israel’s stance is correct; they have seen our actions and understand that we have never denied the existence of the Jewish people in the Middle East. It is encouraging to see those who recognize our pain and suffering. ... Beyond verbal support, we await practical measures,' Muslim said. Michael Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said these mutual statements are welcome and build confidence. 'But when the Kurds are under fire by the Turkish army and their militias, no one has time for the courtship,' he told VOA. 'The two sides need a shotgun wedding, or else it will simply be too late. Kurds need Israeli weapons, not words.' The group battling SDF fighters in northern Syria is the Syrian National Army, or SNA, which is not the official Syrian armed forces but rather an umbrella organization for Turkish-backed militias. The SNA previously participated in offensives against Kurdish forces in 2018 and 2019. While the fighting in Manbij appears to have paused following a U.S.-brokered ceasefire early Wednesday, attacks continue elsewhere in the region, said Mazloum Abdi, the top SDF commander. The ceasefire in Manbij is intended to allow SDF fighters to withdraw from the city, which has been captured by the SNA, Abdi said in a statement. Militias backed by Turkey appear intent in their efforts to drive Kurds from their homes, said Seth Frantzman, a Jerusalem-based adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'Israel has influence with the U.S. and should use it to make sure Ankara stops its attacks,' he told VOA. Israel and Syria don’t have diplomatic ties. Under Syrian law, any interaction with Israel by a Syrian citizen or group is considered high treason. Additionally, the topic of Israel remains a taboo in Syrian society. However, Kurds in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East generally hold a more positive view of Israel. Experts warn that recent Israeli statements could potentially harm the Kurds if not backed by concrete actions. 'Arabs and Muslims in Syria and elsewhere in the region already view the Kurds with suspicion on this issue. The popular and official narrative in many societies across the region portrays the Kurds as a ‘second Israel,’' John Saleh, an analyst of Kurdish affairs, told VOA. 'So, if Israel has a plan to support the Kurds, it should execute right away,' Saleh said. 'Otherwise, the consequences for the Kurds of this perceived association with Israel could be severe under the new Islamist regime in Damascus.' Saleh added that Turkey could also use this as a pretext to further mobilize Islamist militias against Kurdish civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-urges-action-to-protect-syria-s-kurds-/7897681.html	2024-12-11T09:58:05-08:00	
Botswana’s president promises to restore Bushmen rights after yearslong delay in burial	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswana’s new president has promised to restore some rights, which were taken away from the Bushmen, an indigenous tribe of hunters and gatherers found across southern Africa. This week, the government allowed the tribe to bury Pitseng Gaoberekwe who died in December 2021 on the group’s ancestral land, ending a drawn-out impasse. The courts had barred the family from burying Gaoberekwe in his ancestral home in the vast and arid Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR), from which most of his relatives were forcibly removed to protect the wildlife zone. International tribal rights advocacy group Survival International has argued the Bushmen were pushed out of the game reserve because there are diamonds in the area. The previous government denied those allegations, saying it wanted the Bushmen to move closer to modern amenities and life. Before Gaoberekwe’s burial Tuesday, President Duma Boko, who took power six weeks ago, promised to restore the Bushmen’s rights, including allowing them to resume hunting wild animals. Boko, a former opposition leader, is a human rights lawyer who represented the tribe in court against the state before he became Botswana’s president. Itumeleng Johanne, an officer at local human rights advocacy group Ditshwanelo, said the new government is on the right track and should do more to protect minority groups. 'We, therefore, note with appreciation that finally the body of Mr. Pitseng Gaoberekwe, which has been in a mortuary for over two years, will be laid to rest. His family will be able to lay him to rest on his ancestral land with dignity to which he had, hitherto been denied by our courts,' Johanne said. Survival International has been involved in legal battles against the Botswana government, notably against the group’s eviction from the CKGR in 2006. 'This is an incredibly significant moment for the new government,' said U.K.-based Jonathan Mazower, Survival International communications director. 'The fact that the new president in one of his first acts in office has done this — that he has signaled that it is important for him and his administration — I think that will give a lot of people hope, especially the Bushmen who fought so long for their right to return to the Central Kalahari Game Reserve and especially for their rights to bury their elders on their ancestral land.' Mazower said better days could lie ahead for the tribe under Boko’s administration. 'No one would have ever imagined that the President of Botswana will be the very lawyer who helped them (Bushmen) in court in the long legal battle to return to their ancestral land and to live there once more,' Mazower said. 'For many of them and for some of us who supported them from the outside, it is a historic event and one that signals, hopefully, better days ahead.' There are more than 100,000 Bushmen spread across southern Africa, but most live under pressure from area governments to abandon their traditional lives of hunting wild animals and gathering wild plants and roots.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-president-promises-to-restore-bushmen-rights-after-yearslong-delay-in-burial/7897607.html	2024-12-11T08:58:51-08:00	
Blinken faces critics in Congress who say Afghanistan withdrawal 'lit the world on fire'	washington — Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to face questions for the last time about some of the darkest moments of Joe Biden's presidency: the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The hearing comes at the twilight of Blinken's diplomatic career, with only weeks left before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, and at the end of the chairmanship of Representative Michael McCaul, who will no longer lead the committee in the next Congress. It's the capstone to nearly four years of animosity between the two men over the end of America's longest war. 'This catastrophic event was the beginning of a failed foreign policy that lit the world on fire,' McCaul, a Texas Republican, said in his opening statement. 'I welcome your testimony today and hope you use this opportunity to take accountability for the disastrous withdrawal.' Blinken was expected to defend the decision to withdraw U.S. troops in August 2021. He said previously that the Biden administration was 'severely constrained' by Trump's decisions and those of previous presidents. His long-awaited testimony comes months after House Republicans issued a scathing report on their investigation into the withdrawal, blaming the disastrous end on Biden's administration. They downplayed Trump's role in the failures even though he had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban. The Republican-led review laid out the final months of military and civilian failures, following Trump's February 2020 withdrawal deal, that allowed America's fundamentalist Taliban enemy to sweep through and conquer all of the country even before the last U.S. officials flew out on Aug. 30, 2021. The chaotic exit left behind many American citizens, Afghan battlefield allies, women activists and others at risk from the Taliban. Previous investigations and analyses have pointed to a systemic failure spanning the last four presidential administrations and concluded that Biden and Trump share the heaviest blame.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-faces-critics-in-congress-who-say-afghanistan-withdrawal-lit-the-world-on-fire-/7897591.html	2024-12-11T08:42:00-08:00	
FIFA names Saudi Arabia as 2034 World Cup host	ZURICH — FIFA has confirmed Saudi Arabia as host of the 2034 World Cup in men's soccer. The Saudi bid was the only candidate and was acclaimed by the applause of more than 200 FIFA member federations. They took part remotely in an online meeting hosted in Zurich on Wednesday by the soccer body's president, Gianni Infantino. The decision was combined with approving the only candidate to host the 2030 World Cup. Spain, Portugal and Morocco will co-host in a six-nation project, with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay each getting one of the 104 games. The South American connection will mark the centenary of Uruguay hosting the first World Cup in 1930. The decision announced Wednesday completes a mostly opaque 15-month bid process that FIFA president Gianni Infantino helped steer toward Saudi Arabia without a rival candidate, without taking questions, and which human rights groups warn will put the lives of migrant workers at risk. FIFA and Saudi officials say hosting the 2034 tournament can accelerate change, including more freedoms and rights for women. It will kick off a decade of scrutiny on Saudi labor laws and treatment of workers mostly from South Asia needed to help build and upgrade 15 stadiums, plus hotels and transport networks ahead of the 104-game tournament. One of the stadiums is planned to be 350 meters above the ground in Neom — a futuristic city that does not yet exist — and another named for the crown prince is designed to be atop a 200-meter cliff near Riyadh. During the bid campaign, FIFA has accepted limited scrutiny of Saudi Arabia's human rights record, which was widely criticized this year at the United Nations. The kingdom plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on projects related to the World Cup as part of the crown prince's sweeping Vision 2030 project, which aims to modernize Saudi society and economy. At its core is spending on sports by the $900 billion sovereign wealth operation, the Public Investment Fund, which he oversees. Critics have called it 'sportswashing' of the kingdom's reputation. The prince, known as MBS, has built close working ties to Infantino since 2017 — aligning with the organizer of sport's most-watched event rather than directly confronting the established system as it did with the disruptive LIV Golf project. The result for Saudi Arabia and FIFA has been smooth progress toward the win Wednesday with limited pushback from soccer officials, although some from women international players. The steady flow of Saudi cash into international soccer is set to increase. FIFA created a new and higher World Cup sponsor category for state oil firm Aramco, and Saudi funding is set to underwrite the 2025 Club World Cup in the United States, which is a pet project for Infantino.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fifa-names-saudi-arabia-as-2034-world-cup-host/7897559.html	2024-12-11T08:23:41-08:00	
Taliban minister from Haqqani network assassinated in Kabul	ISLAMABAD — A bomb blast Wednesday in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed the Taliban’s minister of refugees and repatriation, Khalil-Ur-Rahman Haqqani, and at least four associates. Taliban sources said that the afternoon 'suicide' bombing occurred within the ministry building in the Afghan capital as Haqqani was exiting his office. Several other individuals were reportedly injured. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the assassination of the minister, which marks one of the most significant attacks on hardline Taliban leaders since they returned to power in August 2021. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed the 'martyrdom' of Haqqani in the attack he blamed on 'Khawarij,' a term the de facto rulers use to refer to Islamic State-Khorasan or IS-K, an Afghanistan-based Islamic State affiliate. Mujahid did not provide further details about the incident, nor did he mention other casualties or the nature of the attack. 'This reprehensible act of cowardice, culminating in his martyrdom at the hands of the Khawarij [outsiders], will neither diminish the resolve of Muslims nor succeed in undermining the resilience of our robust Sharia-based governance,' he stated. The slain minister was responsible for overseeing the repatriation and resettlement of Afghan refugees, primarily those being sent back from neighboring Pakistan and Iran. The United States’ Rewards for Justice website listed Haqqani as a global terrorist and offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to his apprehension. 'Khalil has conducted operations for the Taliban on orders from his nephew, Sirajuddin Haqqani,' and 'has also acted on behalf of al-Qa’ida (AQ) and has been linked to AQ terrorist operations,' according to the Rewards for Justice site. The elder Haqqani was considered a key member of the Haqqani network, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization headed by his nephew, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who serves as the de facto Taliban interior minister. He has a $10 million bounty on his head for his alleged terrorist activities. Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the attack, saying his government was in contact with Kabul to ascertain further details. 'We are deeply shocked at the death of Acting Afghan Minister Khalil ur Rehman Haqqani and loss of precious lives as a result of a terrorist attack in the Afghan Refugee Ministry in Kabul today,' Dar said on the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-minister-from-haqqani-network-assassinated-in-kabul/7897515.html	2024-12-11T07:50:33-08:00	
Doctors Without Borders resumes some activities in Haiti's capital	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — Medical charity Doctors Without Borders said Wednesday it would partially resume its activities in Haiti's violence-wracked capital, Port-au-Prince, less than a month after suspending its operations over threats to its staff. Haiti has suffered from decades of instability, but the situation escalated in February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in Port-au-Prince to overthrow then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry. Gangs currently control 80% of the city, where Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, said the medical needs are 'immense.' 'MSF is now resuming activities thanks to a constructive dialogue with key stakeholders and involvement by the authorities to ensure respect for our teams and our medical mission,' the nongovernmental organization said in a statement. But the group said it would not resume patient transports, as 'the risk for our teams and patients remains high, particularly in ambulances.' Three MSF-run hospitals and a clinic in the greater Port-au-Prince metropolitan area will reopen, but the Turgeau hospital will remain closed, due to the issue with patient transports, it said. MSF suspended operations on November 19 over what it said was 'violence and threats from police,' after two patients were shot dead. 'These past three weeks have been especially painful,' Jean-Marc Biquet, MSF's head of mission in Haiti, said in a statement. 'Despite the commitments made by the authorities, the risks remain high, and our ability to continue our work in Haiti is uncertain as we move ahead,' he said. 'We call on all parties to respect our medical and humanitarian mission so that we can respond to medical needs to the full extent of our capacity.' Nearly 200 people were killed in brutal violence in Port-au-Prince last weekend, reportedly orchestrated against voodoo practitioners. The government has condemned the massacre as 'unbearable cruelty.' The latest killings bring the death toll this year in Haiti to around 5,000 people, according to the United Nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doctors-without-borders-resumes-some-activities-in-haiti-s-capital/7897508.html	2024-12-11T07:43:30-08:00

Blinken travels to Mideast as Syria navigates post-Assad path	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Jordan and Turkey Wednesday to rally regional countries around an aligned vision for Syria's future following the ousting of longtime authoritarian ruler Bashar al-Assad. Blinken will travel to Aqaba, Jordan, and Ankara, Turkey, and meet leaders to discuss developments in Syria, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon and across the region, said the U.S. State Department. A spokesperson said Blinken aims to secure consensus among regional leaders on key principles for Syria’s post-Assad transition. He said these include full respect for minority rights, the facilitation of humanitarian aid, the prevention of Syria becoming a haven for terrorism or a threat to its neighbors, and the securing and safe destruction of chemical or biological weapons stockpiles. Blinken has said that the United States will recognize a Syrian government that upholds those principles. The spokesperson said that in Aqaba, Blinken will meet with senior Jordanian officials to discuss bilateral issues, highlight the U.S.-Jordan strategic partnership, and reaffirm U.S. support for regional stability. In Ankara, Blinken will engage with senior Turkish officials to strengthen bilateral cooperation on shared priorities, including counterterrorism and regional stability, with NATO ally Turkey. On Tuesday, Blinken held talks with counterparts from Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt, where he reiterated the need for a Syrian-led transition. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, will hold an emergency session to address the situation in Syria. The OPCW — the implementing body for the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention — said it is monitoring Syria with 'special attention' to chemical weapons sites and has reminded the country of its duty to declare and destroy all banned weapons. The U.S. State Department said it will await the session's outcome to determine the next steps. Also, U.S. President Joe Biden will join leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in a virtual summit on Friday to discuss Syria and other pressing issues in the Middle East. Last Sunday, Syrian rebel groups toppled the Assad regime after a swift offensive of under two weeks, ending a decadeslong reign of brutal oppression. While many Syrians celebrate Assad's departure, uncertainty looms over the nation's future. The Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the dominant faction among opposition forces, is rapidly consolidating power. At the same time, foreign actors are vying for influence with the nascent government or seeking to limit its potential as a security threat. Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war claimed 500,000 lives and displaced half of its 23 million prewar population. Millions of Syrians fled to neighboring countries such as Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon, with many continuing their journey to Europe in search of safety.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-travels-to-mideast-as-syria-navigates-post-assad-path/7897415.html	2024-12-11T06:46:50-08:00	
Chad military frees abducted Cameroonians, while troops deployed to secure border	Yaounde, Cameroon — Chad's military says it has deployed several hundred troops along the border with Cameroon to stop rebels from abducting civilians after armed men kidnapped a dozen Cameroonians, including a popular traditional ruler this week. Chad’s military has freed the kidnap victims but says troops need civilian help to stop a wave of local intercommunal violence. The latest wave of violence between the Moussey and Massa communities erupted in border areas late last month. Officials in Cameroon say that since then, several hundred civilians have been reluctant to return to the Gobo district, located along the central African state's northern border with Chad. Many civilians have fled to safer towns and villages. Forty-three-year-old cattle rancher Timothe Woundai is one of the displaced civilians. He said he, his wife and three children found refuge the Gobo district village of Yakreo. Woundai said tensions degenerated into ongoing violence after a member of the Moussey community was killed and had his goats stolen. He said Moussey community members launched attacks on their Massa community neighbors using weapons including guns, machetes and bow and arrows to kill civilians. He said Moussey community members also accuse Massa community members of regularly stealing cattle. Military officials in Cameroon say at least five people have been killed and scores wounded amid the violence between the two communities. Both communities say about 13 people have died so far, with several dozen houses torched. When the conflict began, civilians said Voutsou Tairia, the traditional ruler of Bougoudoum village, and a dozen civilians were abducted and taken to Chad. Chadian officials say Voutsou was rescued from captivity by government troops, flown to Cameroon in a Chadian military helicopter and handed to Cameroon’s military and government officials this week. Authorities in Chad have provided no details about where and how the traditional ruler and the others were rescued. Officials say Voutsou and the freed civilians were given free medical care. Abdelkerim Seid Bauche is governor of Mayo-Kebbi East, an administrative region in Chad. He said Chad deployed troops on its side of the border Wednesday to stop rebels and armed gangs from abducting civilians and crossing with weapons into Mayo-Kebbi East. Abdelkerim said after handing Voutsou to Cameroon officials he is launching a fervent appeal to civilians on both sides of the Chad-Cameroon border to help restore peace by reporting armed men and strangers hiding among civilians in towns and villages to government troops and administrative officials. Abdelkerim added that Chad is very concerned about the ongoing violence because weapons are illegally circulating across the porous border and can be used by armed gangs to destabilize communities. Meanwhile, Midjiyawa Bakari, the governor of Cameroon's Far North Region, said troops have also been deployed on the Cameroon side of the border to make sure that armed gangs and criminals escaping Chad's military onslaught do not find safety on Cameroon’s territory. He said armed men responsible for the fresh wave of violence along the border will be punished. Accusations of cattle stealing and violence have plagued relations between the Massa and Moussey communities for years. Cameroon says President Paul Biya has dispatched a delegation to negotiate peace between the two communities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-military-frees-abducted-cameroonians-while-troops-deployed-to-secure-border/7897417.html	2024-12-11T06:34:08-08:00	
Biden approves national security memo on China, Iran, North Korea and Russia ahead of Trump's return	Washington — President Joe Biden has approved a new national security memorandum ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House that could serve as a road map for the incoming administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation among China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House said Wednesday. Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it deals with the tightening relationships involving America's most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two senior administration officials. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the classified memorandum would not be made public because of the sensitivity of some of its findings. The document includes four broad recommendations: improving U.S. government interagency cooperation, speeding up the sharing of information with allies about the four adversaries, calibrating the U.S. government's use of sanctions and other economic tools for maximum effectiveness, and bolstering preparation to manage simultaneous crises involving the adversaries. The U.S. for many years has been concerned about cooperation among the four countries. Coordination has accelerated between the countries in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The officials noted that as Russia has become more isolated by much of the world, Moscow has turned to Iran for drones and missiles. From North Korea, the Russians have received artillery, missiles and even thousands of troops that have traveled to help the Russians try to repel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. China, meanwhile, has supported Russia with dual use components that help keep its military industrial base afloat. In return, Russia has sent fighter jets to Iran and assisted Tehran as it looks to bolster its missile defense and space technology. North Korea has received from Russia much-needed fuel and funding to help build out its manufacturing and military capabilities. The officials added that Russia has 'de facto accepted North Korea as a nuclear weapon state.' China, meanwhile, is benefiting from Russian know-how, with the two countries working together to deepen their military technical cooperation. The two nations are also conducting joint patrols in the Arctic region. Biden and Trump have sharply different worldviews, but officials in both the incoming and outgoing administrations said they have sought to coordinate on national security issues during the transition. One of the officials said that the Biden White House memo 'isn't trying to box (the Trump administration) in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.' The official said the document is intended to help the next administration build 'capacity' as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-approves-national-security-memo-on-china-iran-north-korea-and-russia-ahead-of-trump-s-return/7897334.html	2024-12-11T05:37:39-08:00	
Russia monitoring situation in Syria, highlights need to protect its military bases	Russia said Wednesday it is closely monitoring the situation in Syria and is in contact with 'those who are currently controlling the situation.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted Russia’s need to ensure the security of its diplomatic facilities and its military bases in Syria, where Russian troops were based for years supporting the Syrian military in the country’s civil war. Peskov’s comments came days after Syrian rebels moved into Damascus and forced President Bashar al-Assad from power. Assad fled to Russia, where Russian officials said he was granted asylum. Assad’s fall also dealt a blow to Iran’s interests in the region, cutting off a land delivery route for weapons to the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon as well as territory in which Iranian militias could operate. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday rejected the idea of weakened Iranian network in the region, which includes its support of Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, militias in Iraq and Houthi militants in Yemen. Khamenei also said what happened in Syria was the result of a U.S.-Israeli plan, and that a 'neighboring state' of Syria played a role in Assad’s ouster. He did not name the neighboring country, but Turkey, which borders Syria, was a main supporter of groups that opposed Assad. As Syrians work to establish the future of their country, Pope Francis said Wednesday he hoped for a political solution that promotes 'the stability and unity of the country.' 'I pray... that the Syrian people may live in peace and security in their beloved land and the different religions may walk together in friendship and mutual respect for the good of that nation afflicted by so many years of war,' the pope said. A day after announcing he had been selected to lead an interim government, Mohammed al-Bashir called on Syrians who fled the country to return home. In an interview with Italy’s Corriere della Sera, Bashir said bringing back millions of Syrian refugees was an early goal, and that their talents and experience 'will allow the country to flourish.' There are about 5 million Syrian refugees living in neighboring countries, according to the United Nations. U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen cautioned at a Tuesday briefing against rushing to bring refugees home, describing the humanitarian situation in Syria as 'disastrous' and the economy as 'collapsed.' Some information for this report was provided by from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-monitoring-situation-in-syria-highlights-need-to-protect-its-military-bases/7897240.html	2024-12-11T04:15:22-08:00	
Officials: Fighting breaks out between Somalia's Jubbaland region and federal government	MOGADISHU/GAROWE, Somalia — Fighting erupted on Wednesday between Somalia's semi-autonomous Jubbaland region and federal government forces after Jubbaland held an election against the advice of authorities in Mogadishu, officials said. The clashes will raise concerns that internal rivalries are diverting attention from the fight against the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group just as the mandate of an African Union peacekeeping force expires. 'This morning, federal forces from Mogadishu in Ras Kamboni, using drones, attacked Jubbaland forces,' Adan Ahmed Haji, assistant security minister of Jubbaland, told a press conference in the regional capital Kismayu. Somalia's Defense Minister Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur said the Jubbaland forces initiated the clashes. 'Early this morning (Wednesday), Jubbaland forces attacked the Somali federal military troops that were deployed in Lower Jubba to take bases withdrawn from by ATMIS,' he said in a statement. In late November, Jubbaland - which borders Kenya and Ethiopia and is one of Somalia's five semi-autonomous states - re-elected regional president Ahmed Mohamed Islam Madobe to a third term. The national government in Mogadishu, led by President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, opposed the election, saying it was held without federal involvement. As the election dispute escalated, the federal government issued an arrest warrant for Madobe, while Jubbaland issued a reciprocal one for President Mohamud. Major Aden Nur, a federal army officer in Mogadishu, said Wednesday's fighting was in an area 20 km from Ras Kamboni, a town where federal troops have increased their numbers since the election. 'So far federal forces captured four technical (gun-mounted pickup) vehicles from Jubbaland forces. Fighting is going on far from Ras Kamboni. There are casualties on both sides but no exact figure,' Nur told Reuters. In the wider fight against al Shabaab, the mandate of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) expires in less than three weeks and no agreement has been reached on which countries will contribute to the follow-on peacekeeping mission or how it will be financed. Jubbaland is seen as the breadbasket of Somalia and Kismayu is an important port. Its shoreline delineates a contested maritime zone, with potential oil and gas deposits. In 2021, Kenya rejected a U.N. court ruling that decided mostly in favor of Somalia in the row but said it would pursue a diplomatic solution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/officials-fighting-breaks-out-between-somalia-s-jubbaland-region-and-federal-government/7897185.html	2024-12-11T03:17:30-08:00	
Syrian former prisoners speak out on Assad regime's collapse	As Syrians danced in the streets over President Bashar al-Assad's fall from power, Anwar Etnesh drove his car into the dense traffic clogging the route from his hometown Daraa north to Damascus. Hordes of Syrians like Etnesh were heading to Syria's capital to celebrate the end of the Assad family's rule. But Etnesh was on a mission to find his 55-year-old cousin, whom Assad soldiers arrested in Daraa 13 years ago during anti-government protests. He was never seen or heard from again. Since Assad fled to Russia, according to Russian state media, the militias who overthrew his rule, led by former al-Qaida affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, have been freeing thousands of prisoners. 'I don't know if he's alive,' Etnesh relayed to VOA Mandarin by video call from Damascus. 'I went to the mosque at 7 a.m. and then have been from prison to prison to prison searching. Nine prisons so far. I don't even know what prison he's in.' He is one of the estimated nearly 137,000 Syrians whom rights groups say disappeared into military prisons during the civil war. The Britain-based Syrian Network for Human Rights says Syrian government interrogators have tortured more than 15,000 prisoners to death since 2011. 'What was our crime?' Basheer Mansour, who spoke to VOA Mandarin by phone messaging application and email, is one of the lucky prisoners who survived. He said that in 2011, regime soldiers opened fire on him and his university friends as they attempted to deliver critical medicine and food to Daraa residents living under a government siege. Mansour said two friends were shot to death beside him. He and other survivors were forced into trucks, blindfolded, beaten and corralled into a small toilet space where he said they were held captive and tortured with brutal beatings and sleep deprivation that left some prisoners dead. 'They used an electric rod in my abdominal area and whipped my head,' Mansour said. 'They removed fingernails and burned my body with cigarettes. I wished I would die just to get rid of the torment. They did many things I cannot to this day talk about. What was our crime?' The most extreme torture, said Mansour, was inflicted by hospital staff in a Damascus-area military prison, where he was admitted after suffering severe wounds inflicted during torture. He said he was blindfolded and handcuffed throughout his 10-day hospital stay. 'The last day at the hospital they removed the handcuffs from my hands and feet and asked me to move my legs,' Mansour recalled. 'I tried to move my legs and hands but couldn't. I couldn't move a single part of my body. I started to cry … and begged them to kill me because I did not want to live paralyzed. They took everything from me and stole my life and my future.' Soon after, his captors phoned his father to come get him, he said. 'Now we can go back' Today Mansour uses a wheelchair and lives in North Carolina, where he works at the airport and studies computer programming. He is closely following events unfolding in Syria. 'My family is scattered around the world,' he told VOA Mandarin. 'Some are in Germany, some in Holland, some in France and in Kuwait. I haven't seen them for 11 years. I would love to go back to Syria just to gather with them and see them. I'm happy the regime is gone. Now we can go back to Syria.' But returning to Syria may not be easy. The conglomerate of militias led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham on Tuesday announced an interim prime minister but have not yet made public their detailed plans for governance of Syria. Meanwhile, inside the country, locals — including those like Etnesh who are still looking for imprisoned relatives — are enjoying the new reality — a Syria without rule by Assad. 'I'm in shock. This is a dream. The regime is over. There aren't any Syrian troops anywhere. People are crying, they're happy. … It's disbelief,' Etnesh said. 'And we're all waiting for news of relatives. Most Syrians have someone they know in prison.' As of midday Monday in Damascus, Etnesh had not received any word on his cousin. He told VOA Mandarin he'll search for another week before returning home to Daraa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-former-prisoners-speak-out-on-assad-regime-s-collapse/7896676.html	2024-12-11T01:45:07-08:00

UN General Assembly considers resolution calling for immediate Gaza ceasefire	The U.N. General Assembly is set to consider a draft resolution Wednesday calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as well as the release of all hostages still being held by militants. The meeting comes weeks after the United States voted against a similar measure at the U.N. Security Council. The General Assembly has previously approved a ceasefire call, but its resolutions are non-binding, unlike the Security Council. The draft under consideration also demands that Palestinian civilians in Gaza be given immediate access to aid necessary to survival, including unhindered access for humanitarian deliveries throughout the Gaza Strip. U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Tuesday that aid to northern Gaza has been largely blocked for two months, leaving 65,000 to 75,000 Palestinians without access to food, water, electricity or health care. Israeli forces carried out airstrikes in northern and central Gaza on Wednesday that Palestinian health officials said killed at least 26 people. At least 19 of the dead were killed in a strike that hit a house in Beit Lahiya, the officials said. Another airstrike hit a house in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, killing at least seven people. Hamas set off the war with its October 2023 attack on southern Israel during which the militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,700 people, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The conflict sparked fighting at the Israel-Lebanon border as Hamas ally Hezbollah launched cross-border attacks on northern Israel. The two sides carried out low-scale attacks for months before the conflict erupted in September with Israeli ground operations in southern Lebanon and airstrikes that killed a number of Hezbollah leaders. A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has been in place since late November. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, United Kingdom and other Western countries. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-general-assembly-considers-resolution-calling-for-immediate-gaza-ceasefire/7897131.html	2024-12-11T01:21:23-08:00	
Atmospheric river and potential bomb cyclone bring chaotic winter weather to East Coast	PORTLAND, Maine — The U.S. East Coast was beginning a whiplash-inducing stretch of weather on Wednesday that was rainy, windy and potentially dangerous, due in part to an atmospheric river and developing bomb cyclone. Places like western Maine could see freezing rain, downpours, unseasonably high temperatures and damaging winds — all in the span of a day, said Derek Schroeter, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. The heavy rain and fierce winds will last until Wednesday night in many areas, and flooding is possible in some locales, forecasters said. Utilities were also gearing up for potential power outages from damage caused by winds that could exceed 97 kph in some areas. One of the key factors driving the weather is an atmospheric river, which is a long band of water vapor that can transport moisture from the tropics to more northern areas, said Schroeter, who's based in Gray, Maine. The storm has the ability to hit New England hard because it could tap moisture from the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the U.S. Southeast, and transport it to places like Maine. The state was preparing for a 'multifaceted storm' that could bring two to three inches of rainfall in some areas, Schroeter said. Similar conditions had been possible elsewhere from Tuesday night to Wednesday night. 'We're looking at the risk of slick travel (Tuesday night) with the freezing rain,' Schroeter said, 'and we are going to be watching for the potential for flash flooding and sharp rises on streams as temperatures rise into the 50s (10-15 Celsius).' Forecasters also said the storm had the potential to include a process that meteorologists call bombogenesis, or a 'bomb cyclone.' That is the rapid intensification of a cyclone in a short period of time, and it has the ability to bring severe rainfall. Parts of the Northeast were already preparing for bad weather. In Maine, some schools operated on a delay on Tuesday, which began with a few inches of snow. A flood watch for Vermont runs from Wednesday afternoon to Thursday morning. The city of Montpelier, Vermont, was advising residents to prepare for mild flooding in the area and to elevate items in basements and low areas that are prone to flooding. The city said Tuesday that it has been in contact with the National Weather Service and Vermont Dam Safety and 'will be actively monitoring the river levels as this storm passes through.' Ski resorts around the Northeast were preparing visitors for a potentially messy day on Wednesday. Stratton Mountain Resort, in southern Vermont, posted on its website that patrons 'make sure to pack your Gore-Tex gear because it’s going to be a wet one.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/atmospheric-river-and-potential-bomb-cyclone-bring-chaotic-winter-weather-to-east-coast-/7897121.html	2024-12-11T00:44:36-08:00	
Hundreds of arrests and mysterious beatings as Georgia cracks down on pro-EU protests	TBILISI, Georgia — Seventy-five-year-old Marina Terishvili's teenage son Mamuka was shot dead at a nationalist rally in Georgia in 1992. Now her other son, Giorgi, has been arrested for his role in protests against perceived Russian influence in their homeland. Seven police cars pulled up at her house in the capital Tbilisi on Friday and took Giorgi, a 52-year-old taxi driver, into custody, she said. He was placed in pre-trial detention for two months for 'participating in group violence' according to a rights group and local media, and faces up to six years in prison if convicted, part of a broad crackdown on demonstrators who have clashed nightly with police for almost two weeks. The Georgian Young Lawyers' Association rights group said he had not yet entered a plea and Marina Terishvili said she did not know why he had been detained. 'I can't deny that he went to the rallies, because he has a brother who died on Feb. 2, 1992, and he went there in honor of his soul,' Marina said, adding that Giorgi could not tolerate the idea that his younger brother had died in vain. Mamuka was 17 when he was killed during the brief civil war that followed Georgia's 1991 exit from the Soviet Union, which ended 200 years of rule by Russia. Giorgi is among more than 400 people who authorities and rights groups say have been arrested during protests against government moves to delay the South Caucasus country's longstanding bid to join the European Union. Around 30 face criminal charges, mostly relating to allegations of 'group violence' aimed at overthrowing the government. Among those jailed are two leaders of the country's pro-EU opposition. Rights groups say the crackdown is without recent precedent in Georgia, a country that had been seen as among the most pro-Western and democratic of the Soviet Union's successor states. Fireworks Some protesters have thrown fireworks and other projectiles at police, arguing that they are defending themselves against tear-gas and baton attacks. The interior ministry said on Monday that more than 150 police officers have been injured. The Georgian Dream party, which officials say won elections in October the opposition says were tainted by fraud, provoked widespread anger in the country of 3.7 million when it announced last month that it was suspending EU accession talks until 2028. Georgian Dream says it favors a pragmatic policy with Russia, which backs two regions which split from Georgia after it left the Soviet Union. The party says its aim is to safeguard peace amid the war in Ukraine, which has been shattered by Russian invading forces since early 2022. Western countries have condemned the crackdown, and the EU's ambassador to Georgia said on Monday that it merits sanctions. Georgia's ombudsman Levan Ioseliani, an ex-opposition politician appointed by Georgian Dream, said on Tuesday that his office has visited 327 detainees, of whom 225 said they were mistreated and 157 had visible injuries. Police reported finding fireworks and items for making petrol bombs at two opposition party headquarters. Both parties said the items had been planted. At a briefing on Monday, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze called the parties' premises a 'hotbed of violence' and said their attempt to seize power had failed. Masked men in black Gangs of masked men in black have begun attacking opposition politicians, activists and some journalists in recent days. Opposition supporters refer to the gangs as 'titushky,' a Ukrainian word for thugs who attacked opponents of a pro-Russian government before that country's 2014 Maidan revolution which drove the president to flee to Moscow. Two journalists from a pro-opposition television channel suffered visible head injuries in an attack on Dec. 7 captured in their live broadcast from a protest. The same day, Koba Khabazi, a prominent member of the Coalition for Change opposition party, was left with extensive head injuries after being attacked inside the building that houses his party's headquarters. CCTV footage obtained by Reuters shows around 15 black-clad men entering the building and confronting Khabazi, who they push down a staircase, before punching and kicking him in the head as he lies on the ground, motionless. Speaking to Reuters two days later, Khabazi, a 57-year-old former lawmaker, blamed the Georgian government for the attack. 'Of course, the government is behind this,' said Khabazi, his head still swathed in bandages. 'This government is built on violence.' Georgian authorities have said they are not involved in the attacks, and condemn them. Ruling party officials have suggested they are carried out by the opposition to frame Georgian Dream.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-arrests-and-mysterious-beatings-as-georgia-cracks-down-on-pro-eu-protests/7897114.html	2024-12-11T00:37:02-08:00	
Human trafficking rises sharply after dropping during pandemic, UN says	VIENNA — Human trafficking has risen sharply due to conflicts, climate-induced disasters and global crises, according to a United Nations report published on Wednesday. In 2022, the latest year for which data is widely available, the number of known victims worldwide rose to 25% above 2019's pre-pandemic levels, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's Global Report on Trafficking in Persons said. A sharp fall in 2020 had largely disappeared by the following year. 'Criminals are increasingly trafficking people into forced labor, including to coerce them into running sophisticated online scams and cyberfraud, while women and girls face the risk of sexual exploitation and gender-based violence,' the report said, adding that organized crime was mainly responsible. Children accounted for 38% of detected victims, compared to 35% for figures for 2020 which formed the basis of the previous report. The latest report showed adult women remain the largest group of victims, representing 39% of cases, followed by men at 23%, girls at 22% and boys at 16%. The most common reason by far for women and girls being trafficked was sexual exploitation at 60% or more, followed by forced labor. For men, it was forced labor and for boys, it was forced labor and 'other purposes' in roughly equal measure. Those other purposes include forced criminality and forced begging. The report said the growing number of boys identified as victims of trafficking could be linked to rising numbers of unaccompanied minors arriving in Europe and North America. The region of origin that accounted for the largest number of victims was sub-Saharan Africa with 26%, though there are many different trafficking routes. While improved detection could account for the growing numbers, the report said it was likely a combination of that and more trafficking in general. The biggest increases in cases detected were in sub-Saharan Africa, North America and the 'western and southern Europe' region, according to the report, with migration influxes being a significant factor in the latter two.	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-trafficking-rises-sharply-after-dropping-during-pandemic-un-says/7897104.html	2024-12-11T00:26:55-08:00	
BHP, Rio Tinto face sexual harassment class actions in Australia	Melbourne, Australia — Global mining giants BHP Group and Rio Tinto are facing class actions alleging widespread and systemic sexual harassment at Australian mine sites, law firm JGA Saddler said on Wednesday. JGA Saddler said women who spoke out about the harassment were allegedly discriminated against by the miners and that it expects 'thousands of female workers' at the two companies to join the class actions. BHP issued a statement on Wednesday saying it apologized to anyone who has ever experienced any form of harassment at BHP. 'Sexual harassment has no place in our workplaces or indeed anywhere. We are committed to providing a safe and respectful workplace for everyone,' said BHP. A Rio Tinto spokesman said the miner was aware that a claim had been filed in the Federal Court on Wednesday. 'We treat all such claims with the utmost seriousness. We do not tolerate any form of sexual harassment or sex-based harassment. We take all concerns about workplace safety, culture and breaches of our values, or our code of conduct extremely seriously,' the spokesman said. In 2022, a Western Australia state government review into abuse at mining sites found unsafe working conditions for women in the industry, who had to frequently deal with sexual harassment and sexual assault. 'BHP and Rio Tinto have sent female staff to these sites knowing there was a high risk of personal danger, and then punished them with demotion, dismissal or discrimination when they reported it,' JGA Saddler lawyer Joshua Aylward said in a statement. The class actions are being funded by litigation financier Omni Bridgeway. The lead applicant in the class action against Rio Tinto, who JGA Saddler said has requested to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, alleged she suffered sexual harassment on a weekly basis while working as a security guard on Rio Tinto’s Australian sites. 'I was sent unsolicited sexually explicit messages, videos and pictures from a colleague including pictures and videos of him masturbating in his on-site room. Rio Tinto allowed him to resign but after my complaint I was overlooked for opportunities to upskill,' she said in a statement detailing her allegations. The lead BHP applicant, who requested anonymity for the same reason, listed incidents of harassment in a statement and said she was often afraid to report the abuse. 'There have been times I haven’t reported an incident for fear of what might happen to my career, my job and my personal safety,' she said. The class actions were previously reported by the country's national broadcaster, the ABC.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bhp-rio-tinto-face-sexual-harassment-class-actions-in-australia/7897102.html	2024-12-11T00:22:03-08:00

Russian officials report damage from Ukrainian air attacks in Bryansk, Rostov	Russian officials said Wednesday that Ukrainian aerial attacks caused damage in two regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram that a drone attack caused a fire at a factory that was later extinguished. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed 14 Ukrainian aerial drones launched in overnight attacks. In the Rostov region, acting governor Yuri Slyusar said Wednesday a missile attack damaged an industrial facility and more than a dozen cars at the port of Taganrog. Slyusar said on Telegram that preliminary information indicated no one was hurt in the attack. In Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia Governor Ivan Fedorov said Wednesday the death toll from a Russian missile strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia a day earlier had risen to six people, with another 22 wounded. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the attack that his government was talking with allies about getting additional air defense aid.

Sudan again tops International Rescue Committee crises watchlist	UNITED NATIONS — Sudan - for the second year in a row - topped a 2025 watchlist of global humanitarian crises released Wednesday by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) aid organization, followed by Gaza and the West Bank, Myanmar, Syria and South Sudan. The New York-based IRC began the watchlist more than 15 years ago as an internal planning tool to prepare for the year ahead, but chief executive David Miliband said it now also served as a call to action globally. The report said 305.1 million people around the world are in humanitarian need - up from 77.9 million in 2015 - and that the 20 countries on the IRC watchlist account for 82% of them. Miliband described the numbers as 'crushing.' 'There are more resources to do more good for more people than at any time in history. This makes it all the more bewildering that the gap between humanitarian need and humanitarian funding is also greater than ever,' he wrote in the watchlist report. The report said the humanitarian crisis in Sudan was the largest since records began and that the country accounts for 10% of all people in humanitarian need, despite being home to just 1% of the global population. War erupted in April 2023 from a power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, and triggered the world's largest displacement crisis. The remaining 15 countries on the IRC watchlist are: Lebanon, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Mali, Somalia, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, Ukraine and Yemen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-again-tops-international-rescue-committee-crises-watchlist/7897060.html	2024-12-10T22:27:25-08:00	
Myanmar's economy to shrink as floods compound crisis, says World Bank	Myanmar's economy is expected to shrink by 1% in the current fiscal year, the World Bank said Wednesday, sharply downgrading its economic forecast as severe floods compounded the challenges facing the conflict-torn country. In June, the bank had projected Myanmar's economy would grow 1% during the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2025, but warned of increasing poverty and escalating violence. The country of 55 million people has been in turmoil since 2021 when the military seized power from the elected civilian government triggering a nationwide protest movement that evolved into an armed rebellion against the junta. The coup abruptly ended a decade of tentative democratic and economic reform in Myanmar, with Western investors pulling out of the country and sanctions disrupting trade. 'The level and intensity of armed conflict remains high, severely affecting lives and livelihoods, disrupting production and supply chains, and heightening uncertainty around the economic outlook,' the World Bank said in its report released on Wednesday. The bank said multiple sectors of the economy were struggling, and that agricultural production was likely to drop as a result of Typhoon Yagi, which struck in September and caused widespread flooding. 'The manufacturing and services sectors are projected to contract slightly, given persistent shortages of raw materials, imported inputs and electricity, weak domestic demand, and the ongoing impacts of conflict and economic uncertainty,' it said. A junta spokesman did not respond to a call from Reuters seeking comment. About 25% of Myanmar's population is experiencing acute food insecurity due to inflation and supply shortages exacerbated by the war, the World Bank said. It said inflation was expected to remain at 26% in annual average terms this fiscal year, slightly lower than 27.5% in 2023-24. The expanding civil war, where a coalition of new armed groups and established ethnic armies have beaten back the well-armed junta, has now engulfed more than half of Myanmar's 330 townships and forced 3.5 million people from their homes, according to the report. 'Even assuming no further escalation in conflict, growth is expected to remain subdued the following year,' the World Bank said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-economy-to-shrink-as-floods-compound-crisis-says-world-bank/7897046.html	2024-12-10T21:24:28-08:00	
Ex-defense chief in South Korea tried to kill himself after being arrested over martial law case	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s previous Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun was stopped from attempting suicide while in detention over last week's martial law, officials said, as police were reported to be raiding President Yoon Suk Yeol’s office Wednesday in their intensifying investigation. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party also plans to submit a new motion to impeach Yoon for his Dec. 3 declaration that imposed martial law. Yoon’s ill-conceived power grab has paralyzed South Korean politics, frozen its foreign policy, and rattled financial markets, greatly reducing his chances of completing his five-year term and casting a turbulent shadow over one of Asia’s most robust democracies. Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers Wednesday that Kim tried to kill himself at a detention center in Seoul. He said that Kim's suicide attempt failed after center officials stopped him and that he is in a stable condition now. At the same parliament committee meeting, Justice Minister Park Sung Jae confirmed Kim's failed suicide attempt. Kim was arrested earlier Wednesday after a Seoul court approved a warrant for him on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. Kim became the first person formally arrested over the Dec. 3 martial law decree. Later in the day, National Police Agency Commissioner General Cho Ji Ho and Kim Bong-sik, head of the metropolitan police agency of the capital, Seoul, were detained over their actions during martial law. They are being investigated for their roles in deploying police forces to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting to lift Yoon’s martial law decree. South Korean police also searched Yoon's office Wednesday over his martial law decree, Yonhap news agency reported. Other South Korean media also carried similar reports. but Yoon's office and police have not immediately confirmed the search. The country’s main law enforcement institutions are focusing on finding whether Yoon and others involved in imposing martial law committed the crime of rebellion. Yoon survived an impeachment attempt last Saturday when the ruling party boycotted the vote, but the Democratic Party is aiming to put the new motion to a vote on Saturday. After last week’s impeachment motion fell through, the leader of Yoon’s conservative party pledged to arrange his stable exit from power, saying the party will coordinate with Cabinet members over state affairs and that Yoon will be sidelined from duties during a transition to an early election. However, the plans have been widely criticized as unrealistic and unconstitutional. The constitution explicitly states that impeachment is the sole method for suspending presidential powers and that the authority to command the military rests solely with the president. The Defense Ministry said this week that Yoon remains in charge of the country’s military forces. The Assembly was also encircled by heavily armed troops, which military commanders say were deployed on the orders of the former defense minister. But enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoon’s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the Assembly’s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim’s instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon’s martial law order. Kwak said Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to 'quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.' Kwak said he discussed Yoon’s order with the commander at the scene and that they concluded there was nothing that could be done, ruling out the possibility of threatening the lawmakers by shooting blanks or cutting off electricity. At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the military’s counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the country’s spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeo’s command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the president’s order. Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If he is dismissed from office, a new presidential election would be required. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' and South Korea wasn’t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesn’t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,' a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has had near-constant friction with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which introduced motions to impeach some of his top officials and launched a political offensive over scandals involving Yoon and his wife. On Wednesday, North Korea’s state news agency for the first time reported about the political turmoil and street protests triggered by Yoon’s martial law decree. The report mostly attempted to explain the South Korean events though it used its typical abusive language like calling Yoon 'a traitor' and his military 'gangsters.' Many experts say North Korea is sensitive to the domestic spread of news on massive anti-government protests in foreign countries because its own people have no official access to international news and could be affected by such events.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-defense-chief-in-south-korea-tried-to-kill-himself-after-being-arrested-over-martial-law-case/7897028.html	2024-12-10T20:03:06-08:00	
White House wants Syrian-led process for new government after Assad’s ouster	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration says it is in touch with all rebel groups in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad and wants the process of forming a new government to be led by Syrians. White House national security communications adviser John Kirby spoke with VOA Turkish’s White House correspondent Begum Donmez Ersoz and said whatever governance comes out of the process, Washington wants to make sure it meets the aspirations of the Syrian people. Kirby says it’s too soon to tell whether Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Sunni Islamic al-Qaida offshoot that the United States has designated a terror group, and its leader, Mohammed al-Golani, have undergone an ideological transformation. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: Did Israel give the United States prior notification of their strikes on the Golan Heights and their deeper push into Syria? John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser: I’m going to let the Israelis speak to their operations, and I'm not going to speculate about what they're doing. I would just tell you that they certainly have the right to self-defense. We recognize that they see threats across that border as things unfold in Syria, and they've taken some actions. ... We, too, share a concern that the Israelis have over chemical weapons and the possibility of stockpiles in Syria and the potential use ... so we're in constant communication with the Israelis about what they're doing, and that will continue. VOA: Does the U.S. believe that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has undergone an ideological transformation? Kirby: I think it's too soon to tell. Mr. al-Golani is saying the right things about inclusiveness, about not being interested in persecuting either minorities or other groups. But I think, you know, we have to wait and see what they actually do in terms of trying to establish good governance. ... They are still a designated terrorist group. ... Whatever kind of governance comes out of this, we want to make sure it meets the aspirations of the Syrian people, that they have a vote and a voice in their future. So, we want it to be a Syrian-led process, and the United States will continue to support that kind of process. VOA: There is a concern in Turkey about the potential of an independent Kurdish state in northern Syria. How will the United States mitigate Turkey’s concerns? Kirby: They have legitimate concerns in terms of the safety and security of people inside Turkey. I know right now, Syria is kind of coming to the fore because of the news over the weekend, but it's not as if we haven't continually, over the last four years, had conversations with the Turks about their concerns along that border. And quite frankly, sharing with them our concerns about what we're trying to do against ISIS, partnering with the Syrian Democratic Forces. So, where those two levels of concerns overlap, or maybe conflict, we have the ability and have executed the ability to have conversations with the Turks to try to sort all this out. VOA: The United States is talking to Turkey for information on the whereabouts of journalist Austin Tice. Can you share more on those talks? Kirby: I won't get into the details of the discussions. ... We're still trying to get more context and information about Austin — where he is, what condition he might be in. We obviously talked to the Turks about this ... but we also talked to other counterparts in the region. Those conversations are ongoing. As the president said on Sunday, we want to see him back home with his family where he belongs, and we'll continue to have the level of engagement in the region to see if we can bring about that outcome. VOA: President-elect Donald Trump has signaled a hands-off approach in Syria. What would be the danger of that for U.S. interests in the region? Kirby: Well, we'll let Mr. Trump speak to his plans when he comes into office. We believe there are two things keenly in America's national security interest. Number 1 is the transition, peaceful transition, to legitimate governance in Syria that is a Syrian-led process. ... The second thing that's very much in our national security interest is making sure that ISIS cannot regenerate the capabilities like it had in 2014 and cannot exploit the current uncertainty in Syria to their own advantage. VOA: Syria was an important playground for Iran and the Shia Crescent. That has been broken now. Do you think Iran's ambitions over the Middle East are over? Kirby: I think only [the] supreme leader can answer that particular question. ... As Iran wakes up and looks at the region, it is different, and their axis of resistance has been broken in many, many places. ... And they, too, have been weakened as a military and as a capability, just in terms of, for instance, air defense. ... That said, I can't tell you that, as we look at the world today, that we see Iran giving up on their hegemonic ambitions in the region. They certainly are not as capable of executing those visions and that ambition, but I haven't seen anything that would indicate that that they're turning a blind eye to trying to pursue those kinds of ambitions. VOA: Would the United States accept a hard-line government under HTS in Syria that would contain Iran, as Golani alluded to in his speech? Kirby: What we want to see in terms of governance in Syria is governance that is seen as credible and legitimate, that is sustainable, that meets the aspirations of the Syrian people, and that is the result, the product, of a Syrian-led process to get them to that point. I think it's too soon to know exactly how it's all going to unfold, and we're watching this real, real close.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-wants-syrian-led-process-for-new-government-after-assad-s-ouster-/7897018.html	2024-12-10T19:07:50-08:00	
Bill to protect journalists fails in US Senate	WASHINGTON — A shield law known as the PRESS Act that would give journalists greater federal protections failed to pass the Senate on Tuesday evening after it was blocked by Senator Tom Cotton. Shield laws protect journalists from being forced by the government to disclose information such as the identities of sources. The PRESS Act would also limit the seizure of journalists' data without their knowledge. Nearly every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has either a shield law or court recognition of qualified privilege for sources, but no federal law is in place. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives unanimously passed the PRESS Act in January. But an attempt to pass the bill in the Senate via unanimous consent failed Tuesday evening after being blocked by Cotton. Any single senator has the power to halt a bill put forward by a unanimous consent request. In a speech, Cotton, a Republican, said he was blocking the bill over national security concerns. 'Passage of this bill would turn the United States Senate into the active accomplice of deep-state leakers, traitors and criminals, along with the America-hating and fame-hungry journalists who help them out,' Cotton said. 'Contrary to what members of the press may think, a press badge doesn't make you better than the rest of America,' Cotton later added. The PRESS Act makes exceptions for terrorism and other emergencies. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden made a rebuttal after Cotton's speech. 'I understand that we don't have unanimous consent today. I think it's unfortunate. I think America would be stronger and freer if we were passing this legislation today. But we'll be back,' Wyden said. 'This is about as important as it gets. Free speech is fundamental to what makes our country so special,' Wyden said later. Press freedom groups expressed disappointment over the bill's failure to pass. 'This is a commonsense bill with broad bipartisan support,' Gabe Rottman, policy director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, told VOA. 'It's time to get it across the finish line.' After President-elect Donald Trump won election to the White House in November, several press freedom groups said they were making a final push to get the bill through Congress and signed into law before President Joe Biden left office. Trump has previously threatened to jail journalists if they don't reveal sources in stories he believes have national security implications. And last month, he called on Republicans to 'kill this bill' in a post on Truth Social. Now, the only way that the PRESS Act could pass the Senate is either by attaching it to a year-end spending bill or bringing it up for a stand-alone vote, according to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, or FPF. 'We need more than speeches about the PRESS Act's importance. We need action. Senate Democrats had all year to move this bipartisan bill, and now time is running out,' FPF's advocacy director Seth Stern said in a statement. 'Hopefully, today was a preview of more meaningful action to come,' Stern said. The PRESS Act's failure comes on the same day that a Justice Department report revealed that federal prosecutors ignored Justice Department rules when they seized journalists' phone records as part of a media leak investigation during the Trump administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bill-to-protect-journalists-fails-in-senate/7897008.html	2024-12-10T19:01:51-08:00	
ICC prosecutor to Myanmar: Obey international law or face justice	WASHINGTON — International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan has warned that if violations of international law continue to escalate in northern Rakhine, a region in western Myanmar bordering Bangladesh, those responsible could face prosecution by the ICC. The ICC investigation primarily focuses on past violations committed by Myanmar's military, particularly the crimes against the Rohingya population during the 2016-2017 crackdown. However, Khan emphasized that the ICC’s mandate also extends to addressing ongoing violations. The Arakan Army's current activities in Rakhine may not fall under the ICC’s jurisdiction unless they are linked to international crimes within the court's scope. In an exclusive interview with VOA via Zoom on Monday, Khan confirmed additional applications because he had already applied for an arrest warrant against Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on November 27. While the current investigation focuses on crimes against the Rohingya, primarily in Rakhine, Khan's reference to additional applications indicates the ICC may also address other crimes. Khan pointed out that while Myanmar is not a state party to the Rome Statute, the ICC has jurisdiction in the Rakhine cases because many victims have sought refuge in Bangladesh, which is a state party. The Rohingya, a Muslim minority, endured decades of persecution in Myanmar, with a military crackdown in 2017 forcing over 700,000 to flee to Bangladesh. Myanmar’s military was already under investigation for war crimes prior to the 2017 crackdown. The ongoing investigation by the ICC focuses on alleged crimes committed during that period, including atrocities against the Rohingya. Since 2019, the ICC has been investigating crimes against humanity, focusing on the 2016-2017 violence against the Rohingya. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: This arrest warrant for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing is the first to be sought for a high-ranking Myanmar official. How significant is this step in addressing impunity in Myanmar? ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan: I think it’s very important that the victims, the Rohingya people, and many Burmese throughout Myanmar want justice and accountability. This is an issue the office has been examining since 2019. It's the first time my office has applied for arrest warrants in Southeast Asia, and the first warrant in the Myanmar-Bangladesh situation. I believe this demonstrates our commitment to doing the best we can, with the resources available, to treat every human life equally. It doesn’t matter the color of someone's skin, their religion, nationality or where they are from. We are doing our best to apply the law equally and ensure accountability for those responsible for the enormous suffering the victims have endured, and continue to endure, due to the very serious crimes we allege took place. VOA: Are further actions expected to be taken against others? ICC Prosecutor Khan: Yes, absolutely. When I announced the application for arrest warrants, I also informed the Rohingya community and stated more broadly that additional applications would follow. I believe this is necessary because the scale of the alleged criminality is vast. Many individuals may be involved, and we need to send a clear message that we follow the evidence. In relation to ongoing violations, people have a choice: they can either comply with the law or continue ignoring the rights of individuals and the principles of international law. If they choose the latter, we have the International Criminal Court, and we have jurisdiction because Bangladesh is a state party. VOA: How does the ICC address jurisdictional challenges, given that Min Aung Hlaing has rejected the ICC's jurisdiction, citing Myanmar's non-membership and opposing the application? ICC Prosecutor Khan: That's a great question. As you mentioned, Myanmar is not a state party to the Rome Statute and has not signed up. This means our jurisdiction is limited. However, our jurisdiction arises because its neighboring country, Bangladesh, is a state party. The judges of the International Criminal Court determined that when one of the elements of an offense takes place on the territory of a state party — like Bangladesh — we have jurisdiction. In this case, we have jurisdiction because Bangladesh is a state party, and we are alleging the crimes of persecution and deportation. Deportation involves the crossing of international borders into the territory of another state, in this case, Bangladesh. This is what gives rise to our jurisdiction in this case. VOA: You also highlighted the role of evidence from the Rohingya community and international partners. So how does this collaboration enhance your case’s credibility? ICC Prosecutor Khan: Well, that relationship is basic and fundamental. The Rohingya community has endured so much for many years -- from 1978 to 1991, in 1992, and, of course, during the events of 2016 and 2017. We have done as much as we can to build and strengthen bonds with the Rohingya community, both in Bangladesh and around the world. The Rohingya have been displaced and have fled to many other parts of the globe, so we’ve worked to build strong partnerships with states, state parties, non-state actors and civil society organizations. There have been tremendous hurdles because, despite their experiences and suffering, the Rohingya believe that the ICC can help bring justice and vindicate their rights. They have actively engaged in the International Court of Justice case brought by The Gambia and the OIC, and they’ve been very active in working with my team here at the Office of the Prosecutor. It’s important to remember their stamina, their determination, and their belief that justice is their birthright -- it’s key to everything we do. What was very touching when I visited the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar was that the women I spoke with gave me a bag, and I shared a short video when I made the announcement. What they said was simple but profoundly deep: 'We belong to Myanmar. We, the Rohingya, belong to Myanmar. We want justice.' These hand-sewn letters with such powerful words send an important message, one that we amplify in our applications for arrest warrants, which we’ve now submitted to the independent judges of the International Criminal Court. We ask the Rohingya community to continue engaging with us and to remain patient, as they have. We still have a long way to go, but an important step has been taken by making these applications public. Now, we must wait and see what the judges do, while we continue our work on other matters. VOA: What message does this collaboration send to victims of atrocities around the world? ICC Prosecutor Khan: I think the main message is that the law exists, and it doesn't belong to prosecutors like me, judges of the court, or lawyers. Justice is the birthright of every baby, every woman and every man around the world. Justice is the birthright of the Rohingya, just as it is for people in Latin America, other parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East or Europe. It flows from being a member of the human race. This is a message to people with power, with guns, with weapons, and the ability to cause great harm: you don’t have a license to do whatever you want. You have an obligation to comply with minimum standards of behavior -- standards that prohibit genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. This is not only a message to the alleged perpetrators of the crimes we are investigating or applying warrants for. It’s a message to people in different parts of the world right now. If you think you are above the law because you have power, guns, men, resources, or civilians under your control, think again. The law is in force. The law must apply to all. We will do our part, along with our partners, to make the law stronger, more effective, and more comprehensive. We’ll do our best to ensure that it is applied more equally than it has been in the past. Achieving this requires a community of action. It requires partnerships and everyone — including your viewers and listeners — to realize that we cannot be mere spectators. Don’t leave it to the Office of the Prosecutor. Don’t leave it to the International Criminal Court alone. Raise your own voice and be defenders of humanity. If we all feel that we are our brother’s and sister’s keeper — that we are citizens of this beautiful planet — we can make a difference. But if we succumb to despair and despondency, we will witness more and more catastrophes around the world. The relevance of the law is clear as we see so many situations unraveling and worsening globally. This is an important message for your viewers: to join hands with people they may never meet, who are suffering from these blights of inhumanity in far too many places to count.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-prosecutor-to-myanmar-obey-international-law-or-face-justice/7897010.html	2024-12-10T18:56:31-08:00	
Trump’s signals hands-off Syria approach. Can he deliver?	Donald Trump has signaled he wants to avoid involvement in Syria following an insurgent group's ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. However, as White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports, the president-elect might need to balance his stance with U.S. goals of protecting Israel, isolating Iran, and dealing with Russia, Turkey and other actors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-signals-hands-off-syria-approach-can-he-deliver-/7896993.html	2024-12-10T18:30:34-08:00	
How US foreign policy is made	WASHINGTON — When most people think of U.S. foreign policy, they picture the president. The president, to be sure, is the nation's chief executive and its chief foreign policy architect. But he is not the only one calling the shots, and his power has limits. Consider what U.S. presidents can and cannot do. They can deploy the U.S. military around the world but cannot declare war — that power rests with Congress. They can enter into executive agreements with other countries but not treaties, which require Senate approval. They can establish ties with a foreign government but cannot send a dime's worth of aid without Congressional appropriation. Presidents often find their powers tested after they enter office. During his first term in office, then-President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement on climate change and a nuclear deal with Iran, but his campaign pledge to rein in North Korea's nuclear weapons program and end 'endless wars' in the Middle East remained unfulfilled. President Joe Biden's administration then rejoined the Paris agreement and pulled U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, but he failed to revive the Iran nuclear deal. 'There are limits to what a president can do and that is because of the number of actors that are involved and the number of checks and balances that do exist,' said David McKean, former director of policy planning for the State Department and staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who served as ambassador to Luxemburg. Historically, foreign policy was the president's domain, with significant Congressional input, according to Thomas Schwartz, a historian of U.S. foreign policy at Vanderbilt University. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the State Department was small, and the executive bureaucracy limited. As the U.S. grew in power in the 20th century, so did its foreign policymaking apparatus. 'Today's foreign policy machinery is enormous, committed to billions of dollars and thousands of persons involved, in the military, political, economic arms of the United States,' Schwartz told VOA. 'The one thing that probably is consistent is that the role of the president ... is now much more in the forefront.' A model of the U.S. foreign policymaking process, developed by the late political scientist Roger Hilsman, includes three circles: The inner circle: The president and his close advisers, including his national security adviser who usually heads National Security Council meetings The middle circle: Key executive branch departments and agencies – the departments of State and Defense, the military's high command, the intelligence community The outer circle: Congress and a variety of other actors, including interest groups, corporations, think tanks, foreign governments – all vying for influence 'There is no doubt that the institutional architecture of foreign policy has gotten much, much bigger,' McKean said. For example, the State Department, a small agency with 700 employees in the 1930s, has expanded to a 70,000-strong bureaucracy, McKean noted. The NSC The NSC is the nerve center of the foreign policymaking machinery. Created in 1947, the office, located next door to the White House, has expanded in size and scope. Its principal members include the president, the vice president, the secretaries of state and defense and other top officials. McKean calls this the 'president's own foreign policy team.' The national security adviser's influence has changed from administration to administration. However, the adviser, McKean said, has the ear of the president while the secretary of State is often traveling.' When a crisis erupts, such as the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, the NSC swings into action. To help the president decide on a course of action, the national security adviser calls an emergency 'principals meeting,' while NSC staff put together options for discussion. 'When you're dealing with an immediate crisis like Assad, you've got no time, you've got negative time,' said Gordon Adams, an emeritus professor of international relations at American University who served on the NSC in the 1990s. 'Cars have to pick up principles and whisk them to the White House, and those meetings start at any hour of the day or night and happen with great urgency.' Congress With the president in charge of foreign policy, a change in administration can result in significant policy shifts. But often there is more continuity than change. That is because the president is not the only actor shaping foreign policy. As a co-equal branch of government, Congress plays an important role. Though not given a specific role in foreign affairs, Congress can provide oversight of policy decisions and pass legislation to shape policy. Most importantly, Congress controls the budget, Adams said. This means it can influence how much money is spent on foreign aid, military operations and other international initiatives. For example, President-elect Trump has promised a mass deportation of undocumented migrants, but he'll need congressional funding to make it happen. 'Congress is going to have a voice in what the legislative term language is around that process and around the money that is actually appropriated for that process,' Adams said. Other actors As the foreign policy machinery has grown over the years, so too has the influence of outside actors. These include corporations, interest groups, think tanks, foreign governments, the media and the public. 'That is also an area where I think there's been a huge increase in influence so that corporations increasingly play a big role in foreign policy because so much of what goes on in terms of trade involves multinational corporations,' McKean said. Foreign allies can also influence U.S. foreign policy, though this varies from issue to issue and administration to administration, Adams said. He noted that in the 1990s, then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair persuaded a reluctant President Bill Clinton to intervene in the Balkans. With so many actors involved in the U.S. foreign policymaking process, the system can seem bewildering to policymakers in other Western democracies, Adams said. 'They don't have this kind of sloppy all-over-the-place set of display of interests and the ambitions and agendas that we have in the American policy process,' Adams said. 'So in a way, we have one of the least efficient policy processes of Western democracies.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-us-foreign-policy-is-made-/7896988.html	2024-12-10T18:20:05-08:00	
UN official: More political will needed to get aid to Palestinians	NEW YORK — The senior United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Gaza said Tuesday that the situation is 'utterly devastating,' and more political will is urgently needed to get enough aid to desperate Palestinians in Gaza. 'I have said this to the [Security] Council — there's no substitute, no system can and will substitute or compensate for an absence or lack of political will,' Sigrid Kaag said. 'This is political — political will and political choice. This you cannot ask of the U.N., of the humanitarians. This is where member states and the parties are at play.' Kaag spoke to reporters after a more than two-hour closed-door meeting with the U.N. Security Council about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. She said her office has constant engagement with the Israeli government at all levels. It has negotiated and organized supply routes from Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan and Israel. It has worked out technical and logistical systems. But getting lifesaving aid through crossing points is still not enough if it does not reach the people who need it. She said Palestinians in Gaza feel forgotten by the international community and are living between 'a little bit of hope and ultimate despair,' hoping for a ceasefire. Agencies face obstacles Aid agencies have said for months that they face severe access constraints due to Israeli restrictions and denials, and lawlessness and looting by armed Palestinians and desperate civilians. The situation is most severe in northern Gaza, which has been essentially cut off from aid for the past two months after Israel’s army relaunched an intense offensive to neutralize what it says are resurgent Hamas elements. Food security experts say famine is imminent in that part of Gaza. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Monday that the Israeli authorities denied the organization’s requests to bring food and water to the northern towns of Jabalya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. The World Food Program said last week that barely any food had entered those three areas for more than 50 days. In central and southern Gaza, the situation is not significantly better. WFP said fresh food and meat are rare, and when available, prices are exorbitant. Kaag said the commercial sector needs to restart. 'But we cannot meet the needs of civilians in Gaza even through a humanitarian pipeline as much as it can be ramped up and scaled up without the commercial sector,' she said. 'It is simply not possible.' 15 bakeries remain closed On Tuesday, Dujarric told reporters that U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations are prioritizing flour distribution to families in the southern and central parts of Gaza, providing each family with a 25-kilogram sack of wheat flour as it becomes available. In central Gaza, he said a bag of wheat flour can cost as much as $280, and in the south around $245. Dujarric also said fuel was delivered to some bakeries on Friday and Sunday, allowing four to resume full capacity, but 15 others remain closed due to hostilities, flour shortages and safety concerns caused by overcrowding. On November 30, two girls and a woman died during a crowd surge at a WFP- supported bakery in Deir al Balah. The food agency said the tragedy highlighted the severe food shortages driving people into desperation and urged authorities to ensure secure conditions for aid delivery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7896977.html	2024-12-10T17:57:01-08:00	
Trump picks Andrew Ferguson to chair FTC	New York — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped Federal Trade Commissioner Andrew Ferguson to lead the federal consumer protection and antitrust agency. Ferguson has said the agency should tackle perceived censorship of conservative viewpoints online. If social media platforms collaborate to suppress such views or advertisers coordinate to pull business from platforms such as Elon Musk's X, they should be charged with violating U.S. antitrust law, Ferguson has said. 'We must vigorously enforce the antitrust laws against any platforms found to be unlawfully limiting Americans' ability to exchange ideas freely and openly,' Ferguson said in a recent statement. The agency became a political flashpoint under FTC Chair Lina Khan, who promoted antitrust enforcement as a check on corporate power. Her efforts won fans among some Republicans, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, but drew criticism as overly aggressive from some antitrust lawyers and business groups. Her successor will inherit a full slate of cases against Big Tech companies, a lawsuit against the three largest pharmacy benefit managers, and at least a half dozen lawsuits by companies arguing it has outstripped its authority. It is unclear whether the incoming chair will continue with unfinished probes, including into practices at Microsoft that competitors have complained keep customers from switching to other cloud service providers, and potential privacy concerns involving OpenAI. New leadership could also shift course in two major FTC cases against Amazon.com. One takes aim at practices the agency says keep sellers bound to its platform and help Amazon unlawfully dominate the landscape for online marketplaces, and another targets practices allegedly meant to trick Prime subscribers out of canceling service. The new FTC chair would also oversee a case brought against Meta Platforms, then known as Facebook, in 2020, during Trump's first term. The agency is seeking to unwind its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. But the judge overseeing the case has cast doubt on whether the agency can prevail at trial in April. Trump also picked Tom Barrack, a onetime private equity executive and fundraiser for the president-elect, to be U.S. ambassador to Turkey.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-picks-andrew-ferguson-to-chair-ftc/7896959.html	2024-12-10T16:56:24-08:00	
US moves to save once-common monarch butterflies from extinction	washington — The United States is moving to grant federal protections to the monarch butterfly — a once-common species recognizable by its striking black and orange patterns that has faced a dramatic population decline in recent decades. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) said Tuesday it has initiated a public comment period to consider listing the insect under the Endangered Species Act. But the looming presidency of Donald Trump, who rolled back numerous wildlife protections during his first term, casts uncertainty over the decision. 'The iconic monarch butterfly is cherished across North America, captivating children and adults throughout its fascinating lifecycle,' said FWS Director Martha Williams in a statement. 'Despite its fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when we just give them a chance.' The proposed listing comes at a critical time for the species, which has been designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature since 2022. Monarchs are divided into two migratory populations in North America. The larger eastern group has declined by approximately 80% since the 1980s, while the western population has plummeted by 95%. According to the FWS, the species faces a host of threats, including the loss and degradation of its breeding, migratory and overwintering habitats; exposure to insecticides; and the growing impacts of climate change. As part of its conservation efforts, the FWS is also recommending the designation of critical habitat at specific overwintering sites along California's coast. These habitats serve as vital winter refuges, providing monarchs the resources needed to rest and prepare for spring breeding. 'The fact that a butterfly as widespread and beloved as the monarch is now the face of the extinction crisis is a tri-national distress signal warning us to take better care of the environment that we all share,' said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. 'For 30 years, we've watched the population of monarch butterflies collapse. It is clear that monarchs cannot thrive — and might not survive — without federal protections,' added Dan Ritzman, director of conservation at Sierra Club. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is widely credited with saving iconic American species such as the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly bear. During Trump's first administration, however, key provisions of the law were weakened. These changes, later reversed by President Joe Biden, included measures that allowed industrial projects such as roads, pipelines and mines in areas designated as critical habitat for vulnerable species. Trump's administration also removed endangered species protections for gray wolves across most of the United States and slashed critical habitat designated for northern spotted owls.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7896958.html	2024-12-10T16:55:30-08:00	
US says review of Nippon-US Steel tie-up ongoing as US Steel shares tumble	A national security review of Nippon Steel's $15 billion bid for U.S. Steel is ongoing and President Joe Biden will see what it yields before making a decision on whether to block it, the White House said on Tuesday, cautioning he still opposes the tie-up. The statement comes after shares of U.S. Steel tumbled more than 10% on Tuesday afternoon following a Bloomberg report suggesting the deal would be killed in short order. CFIUS, a powerful committee charged with reviewing foreign investments in U.S. firms for national security risks, has until December 22 to make a decision on whether to approve, block or extend the timeline for the deal's review, Reuters has reported. 'The President's position since the beginning is that it is vital for U.S. Steel to be domestically owned and operated,' Saloni Sharma, a White House spokesperson said in a statement. 'As we have said before, the President will continue to see what the CFIUS process yields. We have not received any CFIUS recommendation. The CFIUS process was and remains ongoing.' Bloomberg's initial headline read that Biden was 'set to' block the deal, suggesting a final decision had been made, but the outlet later updated it to say he 'plans to' kill it, echoing prior comments and leaving the door open to a last-minute change. CFIUS declined to comment. Japan's Nippon Steel said it was inappropriate that politics continued to outweigh true national security interests. 'Nippon Steel still has confidence in the justice and fairness of America and its legal system, and — if necessary — will work with U.S. Steel to consider and take all available measures to reach a fair conclusion,' it added in a statement. U.S. Steel said the transaction should be approved on its merits. 'The benefits are overwhelmingly clear,' it said in a statement. 'Our communities, customers, investors, and employees strongly support this transaction, and we will continue to advocate for them and adherence to the rule of law.' The two companies are poised to pursue litigation over the process if Biden decides to block the merger. The acquisition has faced opposition within the U.S. since it was announced last year with both Biden and his incoming successor Donald Trump both publicly indicating their intention to block it. CFIUS told the two companies in September the deal would create national security risks because it could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects. Despite opposition, including from the United Steelworkers union, Japan's Nippon has pressed on in pursuit of a deal, promising to not transfer any U.S. Steel production capacity or jobs outside the U.S. if the merger succeeds. Nippon has also said it would not interfere in any of U.S. Steel's decisions on trade matters, including decisions to pursue trade measures under U.S. law against unfair trade practices. In a bid to win over support from workers, Nippon Steel said on Tuesday it planned to give employees $5,000 each if the deal with U.S. Steel closed. It also pledged $3,160 closing bonuses to employees in Europe, which would result in a nearly $100 million total payment to employees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-review-of-nippon-us-steel-tie-up-ongoing-as-us-steel-shares-tumble/7896955.html	2024-12-10T16:44:33-08:00	
Syrian former prisoners speak out on Assad regime's collapse	As Syrians danced in the streets over President Bashar al-Assad's fall from power, Anwar Etnesh drove his car into the dense traffic clogging the route from his hometown Daraa north to Damascus. Hordes of Syrians like Etnesh were heading to Syria's capital to celebrate the end of the Assad family's rule. But Etnesh was on a mission to find his 55-year-old cousin, whom Assad soldiers arrested in Daraa 13 years ago during anti-government protests. He was never seen or heard from again. Since Assad fled to Russia, according to Russian state media, the militias who overthrew his rule, led by former al-Qaida affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, have been freeing thousands of prisoners. 'I don't know if he's alive,' Etnesh relayed to VOA Mandarin by video call from Damascus. 'I went to the mosque at 7 a.m. and then have been from prison to prison to prison searching. Nine prisons so far. I don't even know what prison he's in.' He is one of the estimated nearly 137,000 Syrians whom rights groups say disappeared into military prisons during the civil war. The Britain-based Syrian Network for Human Rights says Syrian government interrogators have tortured more than 15,000 prisoners to death since 2011. 'What was our crime?' Basheer Mansour, who spoke to VOA Mandarin by phone messaging application and email, is one of the lucky prisoners who survived. He said that in 2011, regime soldiers opened fire on him and his university friends as they attempted to deliver critical medicine and food to Daraa residents living under a government siege. Mansour said two friends were shot to death beside him. He and other survivors were forced into trucks, blindfolded, beaten and corralled into a small toilet space where he said they were held captive and tortured with brutal beatings and sleep deprivation that left some prisoners dead. 'They used an electric rod in my abdominal area and whipped my head,' Mansour said. 'They removed fingernails and burned my body with cigarettes. I wished I would die just to get rid of the torment. They did many things I cannot to this day talk about. What was our crime?' The most extreme torture, said Mansour, was inflicted by hospital staff in a Damascus-area military prison, where he was admitted after suffering severe wounds inflicted during torture. He said he was blindfolded and handcuffed throughout his 10-day hospital stay. 'The last day at the hospital they removed the handcuffs from my hands and feet and asked me to move my legs,' Mansour recalled. 'I tried to move my legs and hands but couldn't. I couldn't move a single part of my body. I started to cry … and begged them to kill me because I did not want to live paralyzed. They took everything from me and stole my life and my future.' Soon after, his captors phoned his father to come get him, he said. 'Now we can go back' Today Mansour uses a wheelchair and lives in North Carolina, where he works at the airport and studies computer programming. He is closely following events unfolding in Syria. 'My family is scattered around the world,' he told VOA Mandarin. 'Some are in Germany, some in Holland, some in France and in Kuwait. I haven't seen them for 11 years. I would love to go back to Syria just to gather with them and see them. I'm happy the regime is gone. Now we can go back to Syria.' But returning to Syria may not be easy. The conglomerate of militias led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham on Tuesday announced an interim prime minister but have not yet made public their detailed plans for governance of Syria. Meanwhile, inside the country, locals — including those like Etnesh who are still looking for imprisoned relatives — are enjoying the new reality — a Syria without rule by Assad. 'I'm in shock. This is a dream. The regime is over. There aren't any Syrian troops anywhere. People are crying, they're happy. … It's disbelief,' Etnesh said. 'And we're all waiting for news of relatives. Most Syrians have someone they know in prison.' As of midday Monday in Damascus, Etnesh had not received any word on his cousin. He told VOA Mandarin he'll search for another week before returning home to Daraa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7896676.html	2024-12-10T16:40:55-08:00	
As climate change intensifies, vulnerable states seek legal redress against polluters	At a landmark hearing Tuesday on climate change law at the United Nation’s top court in The Hague, Britain argued that only existing climate treaties should have any bearing on a state’s obligations to address the crisis, echoing calls from other big economies. Small island states have told the court that global warming poses an existential risk, arguing that international human rights laws must apply, in addition to any negotiated climate agreements. Such an outcome could pave the way for compensation claims against big polluting nations. The hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is one of several legal cases that has the potential to reframe global climate change negotiations. Some 99 countries are participating in the two-week hearing at the ICJ, making it the largest case in the court’s history. It has pitted small island nations against big polluters and fossil fuel producers. At the heart of the case is whether international law obliges nation states to prevent climate change and pay for the damage caused by their greenhouse gas emissions. Britain argued that the only legal obligations are derived from existing climate treaties such as the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set a target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 'The climate crisis can only be met by states working together,' British Attorney General Richard Hermer told the court on Tuesday. 'The most constructive, the most concrete, and thus the most legally effective way is through the legally binding agreements setting out states’ obligations to tackle the challenges of climate change. ... At the heart of the global response to climate change is the landmark Paris Agreement.' ‘Escape accountability’ Critics accused Britain of trying to avoid legal responsibilities. 'The United Kingdom laid out contemptuous arguments in front of the International Court of Justice with one key goal: escape accountability and responsibilities for decades of climate harms,' Sébastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Washington-based Center for International Environmental Law, said in a statement sent to VOA. 'By claiming that the Paris Agreement contains the sum total of States’ legal obligations on climate change, the U.K. effectively asked the Court to ignore both science and history: decades of fossil-fueled emissions, and the ample evidence that they knew far too well that such conduct would push the world to the brink of a catastrophe,' Duyck added. Island states Small island and coastal states, led by Vanuatu, have argued that rising sea levels caused by global warming threaten their existence — and therefore international human rights laws must be relevant, in addition to the binding agreements made in negotiated climate treaties. 'The conduct responsible for this existential harm cannot, I repeat, cannot be lawful under international law,' Vanuatu Attorney General Arnold Kiel Loughman told the court last week. The 15 judges will offer an advisory opinion that has the potential to reframe climate change negotiations, according to analyst Elena Kosolapova of the International Institute for Sustainable Development. 'The expectation is for the court’s advisory opinion to provide a clear legal benchmark and remove any ambiguity around countries’ obligations under international law. And U.N. negotiations would certainly benefit from legal clarity,' Kosolapova told VOA. Global hearings Scientists say climate change is driving extreme weather events around the world. That has put the spotlight on the rights of the communities affected. The ICJ hearing is one of three international courts asked to provide legal clarity on climate change. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights held hearings in Brazil and Barbados earlier this year and is expected to give its opinion on nation states’ legal obligations in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, judges at the Hamburg-based International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled in May that greenhouse gas emissions are subject to international law, and that all states are obliged to limit global warming and protect marine environments. 'If a state fails to comply with this obligation, international [legal] responsibility would be engaged for that state,' Judge Albert Hoffmann explained at the time of the ruling. Small island states praised that advisory opinion, claiming it gave teeth to climate change laws. The hearing at the ICJ is due to finish on Friday. The judges are expected to take several more weeks to issue their opinion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-climate-change-intensifies-vulnerable-states-seek-legal-redress-against-polluters-/7896942.html	2024-12-10T16:20:23-08:00	
Report on attempts to kill Trump urges Secret Service to limit protection of foreign leaders	washington — A congressional task force investigating the attempts to kill Donald Trump during his presidential campaign is recommending changes to the Secret Service, including protecting fewer foreign leaders during the height of election season and considering moving the agency out of the Homeland Security Department. The 180-page report by the bipartisan task force released Tuesday is one of the most detailed looks so far into the July assassination attempt against Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania and a second attempt in Florida two months later. Like the series of other investigations and reports, the task force railed at the agency tasked with protecting the top echelon of America's democratic leaders. 'The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the litany of related security failures are unacceptable,' the authors wrote. 'The Secret Service's zero fail mission allows no margin for error, let alone for the many errors described in this report.' In the July shooting, a gunman opened fire from the roof of a nearby building, wounding Trump in the ear, killing one rallygoer and wounding two others. He was killed by a counter sniper. In another assassination attempt in September, a gunman waited for hours for Trump to appear at his golf course in Florida, but a Secret Service agent thwarted the attack by spotting the firearm poking through some bushes. Here are the highlights of the new report and its recommendations: Reducing the number of people protected — specifically foreign leaders The report's authors noted that the number of people the agency is tasked with protecting has 'greatly expanded.' At the same time, the presidential campaign season is getting longer and more intense. The agency is also tasked with protecting foreign dignitaries during the U.N. General Assembly, when heads of state and government flood into New York. That event happens every September, which comes at the 'height of campaign season,' the report noted, adding to the agency's staffing crunch. 'Congress, DHS, and the USSS should jointly consider the protective role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS's primary duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders,' the report said. Drop some investigative work, especially during elections The Secret Service is known for its high-profile work of protecting the president, the vice president, presidential candidates, their families and others. But agents also carry out a wide range of investigations not related to their protective mission — investigating fraud and financial crimes, for example. Stemming from when the agency was part of the Treasury Department, those investigations are an important part of training Secret Service officers for skills they'll need on protective details, agency leaders say. But the task force recommended reviewing these investigative responsibilities — especially during campaign season — so the agency 'can prioritize the protection of U.S. leaders and candidates running for office.' Questioning whether the Secret Service should stay in the Homeland Security Department After DHS was created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Secret Service was moved there from the Treasury Department. The task force suggested reevaluating that move. During the time Secret Service has been in the Homeland Security Department, 'USSS has not benefited from stable leadership,' the lawmakers said. They said the structure 'potentially weakens USSS, a small but critically important agency, in advocating for its budget and other priorities inside a much larger entity.' Staffing problems The task force said the gunman in Butler, Pennsylvania, Thomas Crooks, exploited gaps in protection because of a lack of assets and staff. Specifically, the panel noted that the Secret Service, already dealing with the increased tempo of a presidential campaign, was protecting not one but two high-profile people that day in close vicinity to each other, with first lady Jill Biden at a nearby event. In one example highlighting the lack of resources at the Trump rally, the task force said there should have been a counter-surveillance unit in Butler, and if there had been one assigned that day, it might have spotted the shooter earlier. Such a counter-surveillance team was in place for the Biden event, the report noted, although that event was indoors. 'From interviews with special agents on the ground, it appears that the main factor in the decision to not request [the counter-surveillance unit] was an assumption that the request would be denied due to the protectee's status as a former President at the time of the event,' the report said. Pointing to bad communication, faulty planning Much of the criticism in the aftermath of the July assassination attempt has centered on how the shooter could have gotten access to a roof with a clear line of sight to Trump and why there was such poor communication between the Secret Service and local law enforcement. The Secret Service often relies on local law enforcement to secure large events. The report detailed how local law enforcement had one idea of its responsibilities while the Secret Service had another. But the task force emphasized that ultimately the Secret Service is responsible for ensuring that coordination runs smoothly. 'The Secret Service must own responsibility for the security of the site,' the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-on-attempts-to-kill-trump-urges-secret-service-to-limit-protection-of-foreign-leaders-/7896665.html	2024-12-10T15:21:09-08:00	
Suspect in killing of CEO struggles, shouts while entering courthouse	ALTOONA, PENNSYLVANIA — The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO struggled with deputies and shouted while arriving for a court appearance Tuesday in Pennsylvania, a day after he was arrested at a McDonald's and charged with murder. Luigi Nicholas Mangione emerged from a patrol car, spun toward reporters and shouted something partly unintelligible referring to an 'insult to the intelligence of the American people' while deputies pushed him inside. Prosecutors were beginning to take steps to bring Mangione back to New York while new details emerged about his life and how he was captured. The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family was charged with murder hours after he was arrested in the Manhattan killing of Brian Thompson, who led the largest U.S. medical insurance company. At the brief hearing, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey informed the court that Mangione will not waive extradition to New York but instead wants a hearing on the issue. Mangione was denied bail after prosecutors said he was too dangerous to be released. Mangione, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, mostly stared straight ahead at the hearing, occasionally consulting papers, rocking in his chair or looking back at the gallery. At one point, he began to speak to respond to the court discussion but was quieted by his lawyer. A law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press said that at the time of his arrest, Mangione was carrying a handwritten document expressing anger with what he called 'parasitic' health insurance companies and a disdain for corporate greed and power. He wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world and that profits of major corporations continue to rise while 'our life expectancy' does not, according to the bulletin. In social media posts, Mangione called 'Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski a 'political revolutionary,' according to the police bulletin. Kaczynski carried out a series of bombings while railing against modern society and technology. Mangione remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Manhattan prosecutors have obtained an arrest warrant, a step that could help expedite his extradition from Pennsylvania. McDonald's customer recognizes suspect Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania — about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) west of New York City — after a McDonald's customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said. Officers found him sitting at a back table, wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a laptop, according to a Pennsylvania police criminal complaint. He initially gave them a fake ID, but when an officer asked Mangione whether he'd been to New York recently, he 'became quiet and started to shake,' the complaint says. When he pulled his mask down at the officers' request, 'we knew that was our guy,' Officer Tyler Frye said. Images of Mangione released Tuesday by Pennsylvania State Police showed him pulling down his mask in the corner of the McDonald's while holding what appeared to be hash browns and wearing a winter jacket and beanie. In another photo from a holding cell, he stood unsmiling with rumpled hair. New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the suspected shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs. New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione also had a three-page, handwritten document that shows 'some ill will toward corporate America.' A law enforcement official who wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed to have acted alone. 'To the Feds, I'll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone,' the document said, according to the official. It also had a line that said, 'I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.' Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Police quickly came to consider the shooting as a targeted attack by a gunman who appeared to wait for Thompson, came up behind him and fired a 9 mm pistol. Investigators have said 'delay,' 'deny' and 'depose' were written on ammunition found near Thompson's body. The words mimic 'delay, deny, defend,' a phrase used to criticize the insurance industry. From surveillance video, New York investigators determined the shooter quickly fled the city, likely by bus. Suspect's family prays for victim's family A grandson of a wealthy, self-made real estate developer and philanthropist, Mangione is a cousin of a current Maryland state legislator. Valedictorian at his elite Baltimore prep school, he went on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesperson said. 'Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest,' Mangione's family said in a statement posted on social media late Monday by his cousin, Maryland Delegate Nino Mangione. 'We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.' From January to June 2022, Luigi Mangione lived at Surfbreak, a 'co-living' space at the edge of touristy Waikiki in Honolulu. Like other residents of the shared penthouse catering to remote workers, Mangione underwent a background check, said Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for owner and founder R.J. Martin. 'Luigi was just widely considered to be a great guy. There were no complaints,' Ryan said. 'There was no sign that might point to these alleged crimes they're saying he committed.' At Surfbreak, Martin learned Mangione had severe back pain from childhood that interfered with many aspects of his life, from surfing to romance, Ryan said. Mangione left Surfbreak to get surgery on the mainland, Ryan said, then later returned to Honolulu and rented an apartment. Martin stopped hearing from Mangione six months to a year ago.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7896650.html	2024-12-10T15:16:06-08:00	
Somali migrants recount ordeal of 16 days helpless, drifting at sea	In the early evening of November 11, after four days at sea, the passengers of two boats carrying 75 Somali migrants spotted distant lights and a hill. They could hear the muezzin calling for the Maghreb, Muslim evening prayers. Their destination, Mayotte, a French island in the Indian Ocean, was finally in sight. The lead skipper confirmed what they saw and heard — they were close to shore. However, he expressed a concern. He said he feared that gangsters on the beach might attack them. He decided to stop the boats and informed the passengers they would spend the night at sea and go ashore in the morning, according to a Swahili-speaking migrant who served as the interpreter. Little did the migrants know their journey, so close to a successful ending, was about to descend into unspeakable horror. The skippers, who were also human traffickers, had been with the passengers since November 7, when they set off in the two boats from a mothership anchored off Kenya’s southern coast, near Mombasa. The skippers’ role was to take Somalis on the final leg of their journey to Mayotte, the French island off the northwest coast of Madagascar that has recently become a magnet for asylum seekers hoping to reach Europe. However, the skippers were not happy with their compensation. The smuggler told the interpreter that he had been contracted to transport 40 people, but now there were 75. 'The money I was given is not enough,' he complained, according to boat passenger Luul Osman Mohamed, who overheard the conversation. The smuggler wanted the passengers to hand over more. Soon after, the smuggler briefly turned the boat’s engine on, revved it in the water, and then shut it off again, perhaps as a tease or a warning to the passengers. The other boat did the same. 'Sometimes they moved farther out to sea, and other times they came closer to shore,' Luul told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service. But after two rounds of this, she said, 'the engine on the other second boat broke down. Then, our engine failed too.' That night, the migrants and the two smugglers spent the night adrift on the two boats, just off the coast. One boat carried 37 people, mostly women and two children — a 2-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl — while the second boat carried 38 passengers. November 12 Early the next morning, two men rendezvoused with the ships in a boat, seemingly responding to phone calls made by the smugglers. The first smuggler announced that he would leave with the men to repair his boat's engine. He never returned. The passengers and the second smuggler remained stranded. The two boats drifted aimlessly in the open sea under the scorching sun, with no shelter to protect them. Desperate to cool off, the passengers resorted to splashing seawater on themselves. November 13 The waves rocked the boats back and forth, but the passengers managed to sleep peacefully. One challenge, however, was that they couldn’t communicate with the second smuggler, as he spoke a language they didn’t understand. This became a minor issue compared to what lay ahead. The next morning, fishermen arrived and communicated with the second smuggler. Together, they managed to repair the engine on the second boat. They agreed the boat with the working engine would tow the other one, and it seemed to work at first. As the engine roared to life, they began moving — only in the wrong direction, further out to sea. For some reason, the skipper steered toward Comoros instead of Mayotte. They continued for three to five hours, Luul recalls, until the only working engine failed once again. 'After taking us deep into the sea, he took the navigation system with him and left on the fishing boat,' Luul said. The second skipper disappeared and never returned. 'When the smugglers were with us, we felt calm. They were with us, and whatever happened to them, we knew would happen to us,' said Anas Ibrahim Abdi, 21. Now, with both smugglers gone, the migrants were at the mercy of the sea and the elements. November 14 The 75 migrants drifted in the ocean. They had run out of the dates, fried chicken and bread they had received from the mothership a week earlier. The boats and the migrants were stranded in no-man’s sea, not knowing where to go — or how. Passengers tied the two boats together, to stay connected, says Luul. But when strong waves battered the vessels, they untied the ropes, fearing that if one boat were to sink, the other would go down, too. About six men who knew how to swim came over to the women’s boat, just in case there was an accident. Anas, who was in the first boat, moved the other way. 'My energy was low, I was sick. Because lots of people come on board, it was not balanced, so I moved to the other boat,' he says. For three days, the passengers tried to make the boats move, without success. During these days the first death occurred — a young man who was a diabetic. 'We read Fatiha for him. He died in an evening,' Anas said. Sometimes, the waves would bring the passengers close to land, only to drag them back to sea. After 10 days adrift, another passenger, a woman named Fatima, passed away. 'It was hot, she was hungry. She was sitting at the front. Her brother was with her. She was shocked for about two days before she died,' Luul said. The following day, another passenger died — the 2-year-old boy. 'We had milk for him. When we mix milk with sea water he refuses. When he sucks milk from his mother she faints, she finds it hard to breathe because she has not eaten. Later we started to mix milk with her urine... That kept him alive for two days,' says Luul. Days later the boy’s mother died, too. As one passenger after another died from hunger and thirst, others suffered hallucinations. Luul says her friend Fathi was one of them. 'She was saying this is Lido beach, let us get off the boat, let us take Bajaj [rickshaw],' she says. 'She was ripping off her clothes.' At times, a swarm of fish hit the boats. Inventive passengers used their sarongs to catch a few, giving them some welcome nutrition. 'We were also eating green grass, salty, that was brought by the waves from the beach,' Luul said. The only other protein came from a bird that came hovering over a body on the boat. It was caught and eaten too. November 23 On the first boat, 17 people died, 14 of them women. Ten others died on the second boat. One boy, realizing the boat was going nowhere, jumped into the water, confident in his ability to swim. He was seen swimming away, but moments later, the waves carried him in the opposite direction. He was never seen again. The last three days, as everyone lost energy, the boats moved swiftly, carried by strong winds. Rain gave the drifting migrants some desperately needed water, but most were losing hope of survival. Then, after a dark night with no moon, Anas recalls, 'At dawn, there was light, we saw the mountain and then a coastline.' Madagascar. After 16 days at sea, the migrants had finally reached land. The migrants were able to guide the boats close to shore and staggered onto the beach. Nearby fisherman shied away at first, Anas said. Then they saw the bodies in the boats. 'They were moved. They gave us water, rice and fruits,' Luul said. The fishermen made a phone call. Another boat came. They tied their boat to the migrants’ and pulled them onto the beach. 'They were good people, they helped us, they changed our clothes, they gave us warm water to get our energy,' Luul said. The migrants were transferred to authorities in Madagascar. Luul, the 31-year-old mother of five, was the only person from her family on the boat. She says she survived because 'everyone has their time to die' — and this wasn’t hers, although she felt it was close. 'I was thirsty, I was hungry; my voice has changed, the last day my throat was not opening, it was swollen. I had lots of spots, and from sitting on the boat. I was weak,' she said. Out of the 75 passengers, 47 survived the grim journey. The Somali Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on the social media platform X that it chartered a plane for the survivors, including Luul and Anas, and brought them back to Mogadishu on Saturday.

US Treasury transfers $20 billion in Ukraine loan funds to World Bank	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday said it transferred the $20 billion U.S. portion of a $50 billion G7 loan for Ukraine to a World Bank intermediary fund for economic and financial aid. The Treasury Department said the disbursement makes good on its October commitment to match the European Union's commitment to provide $20 billion in aid backed by frozen Russian sovereign assets alongside smaller loans from Britain, Canada and Japan to help the Eastern European nation fight Russia's invasion. The disbursement prior to President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration in January is aimed at protecting the funds from being clawed back by his administration. Trump has complained that the United States is providing too much aid to Ukraine and said he will end the war quickly, without specifying how. The $50 billion in credit for 30 years will be serviced with the interest proceeds from some $300 billion in frozen Russian sovereign assets that have been immobilized since Russia invaded in February 2022. The Group of Seven democracies have been discussing the plan for months and agreed on terms in October, prior to Trump's election. President Joe Biden's administration initially sought to split the $20 billion loan in half, with $10 billion to be used for military aid and $10 billion for economic aid, but the military portion would have required approval by Congress, a task made more difficult by Republicans' sweeping election victory. With Tuesday's transfer, the full amount will be devoted to nonmilitary purposes. The Treasury said the funds were transferred to a new World Bank fund called the Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine Financial Intermediary Fund. The global lender's board approved the creation of the fund in October with only one country, Russia, objecting. The bank, whose charter prevents it from handling any military aid, has run a similar humanitarian and economic intermediary fund for Afghanistan. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen personally oversaw staff executing the wire transfer of the $20 billion to the World Bank fund, a department official said. 'These funds — paid for by the windfall proceeds earned from Russia's own immobilized assets — will provide Ukraine a critical infusion of support as it defends its country against an unprovoked war of aggression,' Yellen said in a statement. 'The $50 billion collectively being provided by the G7 through this initiative will help ensure Ukraine has the resources it needs to sustain emergency services, hospitals and other foundations of its brave resistance,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-transfers-20-billion-in-ukraine-loan-funds-to-world-bank/7896569.html	2024-12-10T13:18:15-08:00	
Somali president, Ethiopian prime minister set talks over Somaliland	WASHINGTON — Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed are set to meet in person in Ankara, Turkey, Somali officials said Tuesday. Sources close to the Somali presidency confirmed the talks, telling VOA, 'Ethiopia requested the meeting, and the Somali president accepted.' The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said the meeting is scheduled to take place Wednesday. They added that Somalia's president arrived in Turkey at the invitation of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. There was no immediate confirmation of the meeting from Ethiopian officials. If the meeting occurs, it will be the first between the two leaders since Ethiopia and Somalia became embroiled in a dispute over a maritime agreement that Ethiopia signed with the breakaway republic of Somaliland on January 1. The agreement grants Ethiopia access to a 20-kilometer stretch of Red Sea coastline near the Gulf of Aden in return for potential recognition of Somaliland's independence. The Somali government has called the agreement illegal and a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Mogadishu sees Somaliland as a part of Somalia. Ethiopia maintains that it does not infringe on Somalia's sovereignty. Somaliland is a self-governing territory that declared independence in 1991 but has yet to win international recognition. Somalia is expecting all Ethiopian troops to leave the country by the end of this month as the mandate of an African Union Transition Mission in Somalia expires. Previous attempts In July and August, two rounds of talks between Ethiopia and Somalia, mediated by Turkey, failed to solve the dispute over Somaliland, with Somalia demanding Ethiopia withdraw from the deal. The issue has raised fears of fresh conflict in the Horn of Africa region. In September, Mohamud rejected an offer to meet with Abiy while they were attending a forum on China-Africa cooperation in Beijing, according to diplomatic sources. They say the Somali president made the meeting conditional on Ethiopia first withdrawing from the agreement it signed with Somaliland. The presidents of Djibouti and Mauritania, along with former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was the special envoy to the African Union, tried to arrange a meeting, but were unsuccessful. Additionally, an attempt by the Kenyan government to bring the two leaders together failed. Kenyan President William Ruto recently said that he and the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, were willing to mediate between Somalia and Ethiopia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-president-ethiopian-prime-minister-set-talks-over-somaliland-/7896554.html	2024-12-10T13:05:19-08:00	
Syria post-Assad: Alawite minority faces uncertainty under Islamist rebel control	Washington — Calls are mounting around the world to safeguard Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities following the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime by Islamist rebels. Concerns particularly focus on the future of the Alawite community, a sect from which the Assad family originates. The swift offensive that led to the capture of Damascus was headed by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and other Turkish-backed Islamist rebels. HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, has pledged to respect the rights of Alawites and other ethnic and religious minorities. Rights groups note that these promises have largely been upheld so far. However, concerns persist that once the rebels solidify their control over the country, they may turn against the Alawite community because of its perceived ties to the former Syrian regime. Members of the Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, make up about 10% of Syria’s population of 24 million people and are primarily concentrated in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus, but a significant number of Alawites also reside in Damascus and Homs. Since coming to power in 1970, the Assad dynasty heavily relied on Alawites, who came to fill many high-ranking military and intelligence positions. Anwar al-Bunni, a prominent Syrian human rights lawyer, told VOA that decades of brutal rule under Bashar’s father, Hafez al-Assad, created 'severe tensions and even mobilization toward the Alawite community.' Bunni, however, said recent statements by HTS chief Abu Mohammad al-Golani have been well-received among the Alawites. Golani told CNN on Friday, 'No one has the right to erase another group. These sects have coexisted in this region for hundreds of years, and no one has the right to eliminate them.' 'Alawite community leaders have also said positive things after the fall of the regime, but it is still the beginning,' Bunni said. 'They might have a different position when the process of accountability and transitional justice starts.' Bunni noted that the real test for the Alawite stance would be when officials of the former regime are brought to justice for their crimes against civilians. 'Whether the Alawite community leadership supports future accountability initiatives could ultimately determine how other Syrians will view them in the context of a democratic and free Syria,' he said. Dozens of prominent figures from Qardaha, Assad’s hometown in Latakia province, issued a statement Monday declaring their support for the new rulers in Damascus and pledged full cooperation. Shortly after, videos posted on social media showed statues of Assad being removed from Qardaha. A resident in Latakia told VOA that a meeting took place Monday in Qardaha between rebel delegates and Alawite community leaders. An Alawite activist, who requested anonymity for security reasons, confirmed the meeting, noting that it has been received positively among the local community. 'It is important for both sides to keep meeting in order to create an environment of trust,' the activist said. 'Not all Alawites supported the former regime, and Syrians elsewhere need to understand this.' David Adesnik, vice president of research at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said HTS understands the importance of projecting an image of moderation. 'A key question is whether HTS considers Assad’s identity as an Alawite to be a cause of his extreme brutality. If not, there is little reason to blame the Alawite community and take vengeance,' he told VOA. 'In contrast, HTS and other rebels clearly see Assad’s enduring alliances with Russia and Iran as inherently problematic.' Adesnik also noted that 'HTS and others may find it difficult to ever trust the Alawite community or individual Alawite leaders, but marginalizing them may be sufficient to address such concerns, rather than resorting to violence.' There have been some voices within the Alawite community calling for the establishment of an autonomous region along Syria’s coast. But the Latakia-based activist said such calls were not serious. Adesnik said autonomy for Alawites was not a likely option, adding, 'The coast in particular is strategic terrain because it provides access to the Mediterranean. 'Granting special privileges to the Alawites would also open the door for numerous other minorities to seek special arrangements, which undermine the ability of Damascus to exert control,' he said. 'Some arrangement with the Kurdish region may be inevitable, but I doubt any Syrian government would want to replicate it elsewhere.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-post-assad-alawite-minority-faces-uncertainty-under-islamist-rebel-control/7896499.html	2024-12-10T12:29:27-08:00	
Biden designates national monument at site of Carlisle Indian school	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has created a new national monument on the grounds of a former Indian boarding school in Pennsylvania, which served as the blueprint for hundreds of similar institutions across the United States. 'I want everyone to know,' Biden said. 'I don't want people forgetting, 10, 20, 30, 50 years from now.' Indian children from 140 tribes were taken from their families, tribes and homelands and forced to spend years at the school in the borough of Carlisle, he noted. 'It was wrong, and by making the Carlisle Indian School a national monument, we make clear that [that's] what great nations do. We don't erase history. We acknowledge it. We learn from and we remember, so we never repeat it again.' Biden told the 2024 Tribal Nations Summit in Washington Monday that the monument will encompass 10 hectares (24.5 acres) inside what is today the Carlisle Army Barracks, including historic buildings and structures that once made up the school’s campus. These will include the brick and marble gateposts at the school’s entrance, which Carlisle students built by hand in 1910. The U.S. Army will maintain operational control over the site, which is now home to the U.S. Army War College. The Army will collaborate with the National Park Service to oversee the planning and management of the new national monument, consulting with federally recognized tribes to ensure that the monument accurately reflects historic and contemporary impacts of the boarding school system on tribal members and communities. 'This addition to the national park system that recognizes the troubled history of U.S. and Tribal relations is among the giant steps taken in recent years to honor Tribal sovereignty and recognize the ongoing needs of Native communities, repair past damage and make progress toward healing,' said National Park Service Director Chuck Sams, a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Northeast Oregon. The announcement comes just six weeks after Biden’s visit to the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona. There, he gave a long-awaited apology to Native Americans for the boarding school era, calling it 'one the most consequential things I've ever had an opportunity to do in my whole career as president of the United States.' Earlier Monday, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland opened the summit with a speech focusing on the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative she launched in May 2021. The initiative resulted in a two-volume report that documented the history of the school system, accounting for 417 known schools and confirming more than 900 child deaths. The initiative also included The Road to Healing, in which Haaland and Assistant Interior Secretary Bryan Newland traveled to 12 Native communities, giving survivors and their descendants an opportunity to share their boarding school experiences. 'So many of you spoke bravely and forthright[ly] … about the horrors you endured or the trauma that was passed down over generations. Those stories must continue to be told,' Haaland told the summit leaders. As part of the initiative, the Interior Department engaged the National Native Boarding School Healing Coalition to conduct video interviews with boarding school survivors to create a permanent oral history collection. Haaland announced that the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History will partner to preserve their accounts for the public.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-designates-national-monument-at-site-of-carlisle-indian-school/7896427.html	2024-12-10T12:26:25-08:00

Judge could permanently halt Trump's hush money case while upholding his conviction	Prosecutors are urging a judge not to throw out President-elect Donald Trump's hush money criminal conviction but suggesting a willingness to end the case in a way that would preserve the verdict while avoiding punishment or a protracted legal fight. In court papers made public on Tuesday, the Manhattan district attorney's office proposed an array of options for keeping the historic conviction on the books, including asking Judge Juan M. Merchan to consider treating the case the way he would when a defendant dies. That would effectively put the case into a permanent state of suspended animation. Trump's conviction would stand, but everything would freeze, including any appeal action. It is unclear if that option is viable under New York law. 'As applied here, this Court could similarly terminate the criminal proceeding by placing a notation in the record that the jury verdict removed the presumption of innocence; that defendant was never sentenced; and that his conviction was neither affirmed nor reversed on appeal because of presidential immunity,' prosecutors wrote in an 82-page filing. Among the other options prosecutors proposed was delaying sentencing until after Trump leaves office in 2029. However, they were adamant that the conviction should stand, arguing that Trump's impending return to the White House should not upend a jury's finding. The filing expands on the position the prosecutors laid out last month. Since then, Trump's lawyers have pressed Merchan to dismiss the case altogether in light of his election. The Trump team argues that letting the case continue would present unconstitutional 'disruptions' to his upcoming presidential term. The attorneys also cited President Joe Biden's recent pardon of his son Hunter Biden, who had been convicted of tax and gun charges. Biden complained that his son was unfairly prosecuted for political reasons — and Trump's lawyers say he was, too. It's unclear how soon Merchan may decide what to do next with the case. Trump, a Republican, takes office Jan. 20. He had been scheduled for sentencing late last month. But following Trump's Nov. 5 election victory, Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed the former and future president's sentencing so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case. Merchan also delayed a decision on Trump's prior bid to dismiss the case on immunity grounds. Trump has been fighting for months to reverse his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors said he fudged the documents to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to suppress her claim that they had sex a decade earlier. He says they did not and denies any wrongdoing. Trump portrays the case as a political attack ginned up by D.A. Alvin Bragg and other Democrats. A dismissal would erase Trump's historic conviction, sparing him the cloud of a criminal record and possible prison sentence. Trump is the first former president to be convicted of a crime and the first convicted criminal to be elected to the office. Merchan could also decide to uphold the verdict and proceed to sentencing, delay the case until Trump leaves office, wait until a federal appeals court rules on Trump's parallel effort to get the case moved out of state court or choose some other option. The hush money case was the only one of Trump's four criminal indictments to go to trial. Since the election, special counsel Jack Smith has ended his two federal cases, which pertained to Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and allegations that he hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. A separate state election interference case in Fulton County, Georgia, is largely on hold. Trump denies wrongdoing in all.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-could-permanently-halt-trump-s-hush-money-case-while-upholding-his-conviction-/7896479.html	2024-12-10T12:17:34-08:00	
UN digital program seeks to empower Africa's public workers	NAIROBI, KENYA — The United Nations, Microsoft and Kenya’s Ministry of Information last week launched a digital and artificial intelligence center in Nairobi to train African public servants and accelerate the development and use of online services. Officials said the program — the Timbuktoo GreenTech Hub and Africa Centre for Competence for AI and Digital Skilling — aims to improve the skills of 100,000 government workers. U.N. Development Program Regional Director Ahunna Eziakonwa said at the launch that better digital skills and resources will enable Africa to achieve technological progress. 'An inclusive public sector digital transformation drives efficiency and effectiveness and helps governments to enhance coordination of resources and information and strengthen data and code policymaking and implementation,' she said. Kenyan President William Ruto said that more than 20,000 government services can be accessed online and that the digital transformation has made government work easier. 'This will help us streamline public service delivery and enhance transparency and efficiency, minimize opportunities for corruption and maximize visibility and mobilization of public revenue,' he said. 'The transformative impact of this single initiative on citizens' experience in accessing public services, along with the government's capacity to effectively manage public resources, clearly illustrates the immense value of digital transformation.' Governance experts say digital services offered online have improved citizens' trust in public services and made the work of government employees faster, more accurate and more transparent. However, the frequent power and internet blackouts that plague some African countries sometimes force government workers to resort to traditional paper and file systems. Some workers have little experience with computers and feel that online glitches are slowing them down. Michael Niyitegeka, team leader at Refactory, a software academy in Uganda that prepares youth for global tech work, said authorities must push workers to use the technology. 'Leadership has to be extremely firm in knowing how they want to use these technologies and invest in ensuring that people are working with it,' Niyitegeka said. 'We need to work on the entire system so the citizens can be brought to speed, and different users of these technologies as we are building need to be brought on board so that we are building together,' he said. 'Otherwise, it will probably become a white elephant.' Tech experts say that if developed correctly and with proper investment, then digital technology and artificial intelligence can transform communities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-digital-program-seeks-to-empower-africa-s-public-workers/7896440.html	2024-12-10T12:16:29-08:00

Sub-Saharan officials say reducing fish imports creates local jobs	Yaounde, Cameroon — Officials in Sub-Saharan Africa countries have agreed it is important to reduce over-dependence on imported fish and seafood from North Africa and the European Union and instead they should strive to cultivate fish-farming, which will create jobs for unemployed youth. The officials, meeting in Cameroon, said their goal is to invest some of what they collectively spend on importing fish each year, and put that funding into developing local fish farms. They hope to re-direct to local fish farmers a large amount of the $7 billion spent annually on importing seafood. Fish farmer Tanyi Hubert demonstrates how every day he catches and sells at least 10 kilograms of fresh fish from his pond in Nkolbisson, a neighborhood in Cameroon's capital, Yaounde. He told government officials from 12 African countries, who were in Cameroon on Monday, that he makes at least $40 each day since he started selling fish one year ago from his riverside fish pond, in which he farms fish. Hubert said he is one of several hundred youths the government of Cameroon trained, and provided financial assistance of about $4,000 each, to begin a fish farming business. Eta Collins Ayuk is the director of the Limbe National Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture created by the government of Cameroon to train fish farmers. He said several hundred unemployed Cameroonians who have received training in fish farming are today supplying fish to local markets and raising enough money to take care of their families. 'The catch we get from the wild is rapidly declining and the only way to ensure fish and fish products availability for local consumption should be through the farming of fish, which is aquaculture. We train people to create jobs. We don't train people to go and search for employment,' said Collins. Eta said efficient local fish farming will reduce the large amounts of money Cameroon spends each year on importing fish from North Africa and Europe. The government of this central African country says it has spent about $200 million in 2024, to import 60% of the 550,000 tons of fish and seafood it needs this year to feed its 30 million civilians. Officials and fish farmers from Sub-Saharan African countries meeting in Yaounde on Monday said Africa alone accounts for close to 13% of the world's total fish imports. The continent spends close to $7 billion to import fish and seafood from Europe and North African countries, including Morocco, Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia, officials said. Olodayo Ganiyu, chief executive officer of Aquapet Ventures, a Nigerian company that promotes local fish farming, said it is unfortunate that, despite its huge potential of abundant natural resources including oceans, rivers, lakes, waterways and coasts, Africa still spends huge sums of money to import fish. 'We [Nigeria] import thousands of tons of fish every year, that cost us $1.2 billion. Now the government of my country is encouraging so many people to come into fish farming. A time will come in Nigeria when you will not see any imported fish again. Many people are now encouraged to invest more in aquaculture so that the scarce dollars used in importation of frozen fish into the country will be channeled into health, education and other infrastructure,' he said. Olodayo said participants at the Yaounde meeting this week agreed to try to guide their countries to soon invest about 60% of the money they normally use to import fish, to instead pursue local fish farming development and production. The plan aims to create jobs for African youths who, due to widespread poverty and joblessness, are leaving their countries to seek work in Europe. The participants said Africa has over 30,000 kilometers of untapped coastline to gradually expand the fishing industry, which has the potential to drive economic growth, ensuring food security and creating jobs. Cameroon’s livestock minister, who goes by only one name, Taiga, said the African Continental Free Trade Area, alongside global initiatives, has prepared a blueprint for Africa to use its vast fishing resources to fight hunger and propel development. Taiga said Cameroon and Sub-Saharan countries will succeed to stop the importation of fish and seafood from North Africa and Europe, just as they succeeded to stop the importation of frozen chicken and pork from developed countries. He said the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development is presently assisting African countries to produce fish locally and reduce dependence on imports. Taiga spoke on Cameroon state TV. He said African nations are fighting to stop illegal fishing on their coastal waters but did not say how. The United Nations reports that Africa this year accounted for 13.1 million tons of fisheries and aquaculture production, which is six percent of the world’s annual total. At the conference Monday, officials said they hope that by 2026, some 60% of money they use to import fish will be invested in local production.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sub-saharan-officials-say-reducing-fish-imports-creates-local-jobs/7896428.html	2024-12-10T11:42:47-08:00

Syrian minorities want say in country's future	Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, long repressed under President Bashar al-Assad’s leadership, say they hope for inclusion in political decision-making on the war-ravaged country’s future. Bassam Said Ishak, president of the Syriac National Council of Syria, is calling for what he calls inclusive negotiations. His organization, based in northeast Syria, aims to defend the rights of Christians and all minorities in a post-Assad government in the hope of building a new Syria that is democratic, secular, and pluralistic with equal rights for all citizens. 'I would like to see real negotiations in Syria over a new constitution because the rebels said they want to start such negotiations. What I mean by real negotiations is that nobody is excluded,' Ishak said. 'All groups who have a say about the future of Syria and have their own concerns, visions, and hopes to sit and voice what’s on their hearts and minds without intervening from outside powers to decide who can sit or not sit in these negotiations.' Meanwhile, Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri, the spiritual leader of Syria’s Druze community, issued a statement urging all Syrians to maintain vigilance, saying 'the journey ahead is long and the battle is not over.' He said his group is calling on 'everyone to protect both public and private property as a national and moral duty, prevent acts of vandalism and block any attempt to undermine security and stability in Sweida.' Mazloum Abdi is commander of Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led armed group that includes Christian fighters instrumental in taking down Islamic State militants. He expressed hope in a new leadership. 'This change presents an opportunity to build a new Syria based on democracy and justice that guarantees the rights of all Syrians,' he said in a statement. The rebel offensive begun on November 27, led by Abu Mohammed al-Golani’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, ended the five-decade rule of the Assad government characterized by violent suppression to crush dissent. The U.S. and other countries designated HTS a terrorist group because it was once part of al-Qaida, but the Islamist group has since broken away and appears to have moderated its stance. Since its takeover of Aleppo and other areas, it announced that it would protect Syria’s minority populations. But that might not be the case with other rebel groups. Nadine Maenza, president of the Washington-based International Religious Freedom Secretariat, said she received eyewitness accounts of atrocities committed against a dozen Syrian religious and ethnic minorities in recent days in the Shebha region outside of Aleppo. She will present the concerns in a report to the U.S. Congress. 'Our concern is for the safety of all religious and ethnic minorities,' Maenza said. 'With the track record of both HTS and the Turkish-backed militias having a history of severe religious violations against these groups. Atrocities are continuing against Kurds, Yazidis, Christians, and other religious minorities, but particularly we are seeing them from the Turkish-backed Islamist militias.' Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the European Council of Foreign Relations Middle East program, said, concerns are already emerging about what comes next in Syria with fears about the HTS and the prospect of new chaos, violence and fragmentation amid a possible contested transition. 'There are also concerns that the conflict between Turkey and Syrian Kurds could give ISIS new space to exploit,' Barnes-Dacey said, in a written statement. But he added that 'the biggest hope should lie in the agency of Syrians themselves.' 'They, more than any outsiders, long for a stabilizing transition, having already internalized the cost of conflict,' he wrote. Assad’s brute force against pro-democracy demonstrations in 2011 ignited a 13-year civil war along sectarian lines resulting in 500,000 Syrian deaths and the displacement of half of Syria’s pre-war population of 23 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-minorities-want-say-in-country-s-future/7896410.html	2024-12-10T11:29:29-08:00

VOA Russian: Chechen wars and the formation of the political model of the Russian state	December 11th will mark 30 years since the beginning of the First Chechen war. The initial Russian assault on Chechnya signaled not just the start of a merciless conflict that killed tens of thousands of civilians in Chechnya, but also the end of Russia’s liberal dream. As Russia’s first war after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the First Chechen war served as a prologue to other conflicts unleashed by the Kremlin, including the war in Ukraine. The bloody campaign continued with varying success until the end of August 1996, followed by Second Chechen war, which cemented Russian President Vladimir Putin’s power.

Belarus says it has dozens of Russian nukes, is ready for new missile	MOSCOW — Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko said Tuesday his country is hosting dozens of Russian nuclear weapons and will prepare facilities for the planned deployment of Moscow's newest hypersonic ballistic missile. His remarks came after he and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty last week that gave security guarantees to Belarus, Moscow's closest ally, including the possible use of nuclear weapons to help repel any aggression. The pact follows Moscow's revision of its nuclear doctrine, which for the first time placed Belarus under the Russian nuclear umbrella amid the tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine. 'I have warned all my enemies, 'friends' and adversaries: If you step on the border, the answer will be momentary,' Lukashenko said. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for over 30 years and has relied on Kremlin subsidies and support, allowed Russia to use his country's territory to send troops into neighboring Ukraine in 2022 and to host some of its tactical nuclear weapons. Unlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful. Russia hasn't disclosed how many, but Lukashenko said Tuesday that his country currently has several dozen of them. 'I have brought nuclear warheads here, and not just a single dozen of them,' Lukashenko said in an apparent reference to the tactical weapons, adding that the West failed to track their deployment. 'They haven't even noticed when we brought them here,' he said. Earlier this year, Russian and Belarusian militaries held joint nuclear drills. They involved Belarus' Russia-supplied Iskander short-range ballistic missiles that can be fitted with nuclear warheads and warplanes equipped to carry nuclear bombs. The deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia's capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe. During the signing of the security pact on December 6, Lukashenko asked Putin to deploy more advanced weapons in Belarus, including the Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile that Russia used for the first time last month against Ukraine. Putin responded that Oreshnik missiles could be deployed to Belarus in the second half of 2025, adding that they will remain under Russian control but that Moscow will allow Minsk to select the targets. 'We will determine targets for them here in Belarus, not the Russians,' Lukashenko said Tuesday. 'And we will push the button together if needed, God forbid.' He noted that Belarus has about 30 facilities for nuclear-capable ballistic missiles left over from the Cold War era, when it was part of the USSR and hosted Soviet nuclear weapons. He added that a Belarus manufactures the large vehicles that serve as mobile launchers for Russian ballistic missiles, including Oreshnik. Putin has hailed Oreshnik's capability, saying its multiple warheads that plunge to a target at Mach 10 are immune from interception and are so powerful that the use of several of them in one conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack. Speaking Tuesday, Putin charged that 'a sufficient number of these advanced weapon systems simply makes the use of nuclear weapons almost unnecessary.' Russia's missile forces chief declared that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, has a range allowing it to reach all of Europe. The revamped nuclear doctrine that Putin signed last month formally lowered the threshold for Russia's use of its nuclear weapons, a move that follows U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russian territory with American-supplied longer-range missiles. The doctrine says Moscow could use nuclear weapons 'in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction' against Russia or its allies, as well as 'in the event of aggression' against Russia and Belarus with conventional weapons that threaten 'their sovereignty and/or territorial integrity.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-says-it-has-dozens-of-russian-nukes-is-ready-for-new-missile/7896357.html	2024-12-10T10:57:32-08:00	
VOA Russian: Fake American media linked to Russia is behind Zelenskyy and 'Hitler's car'	A fake American 'media outlet' posted a story about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy buying Adolf Hitler’s car — and it was widely shared in Russian media. The website for the 'media outlet' (apparently trying to copy a renowned Seattle Times) was registered about a week ago. The photo was photoshopped and the story is fake. Some researchers connected the website to John Mark Dougan, an American who fled to Russia. A VOA Russian investigative reporter debunked this fake story.

VOA Persian: Rights group seeks closure of Iran's Qarchak Prison, called 'hell for women and children'	A human rights organization has released a report on the condition of Qarchak Prison in Varamin, Iran, describing it as 'a hell for women and children' and urging it to be shut down. The Iran Human Rights Organization published a new report on Tuesday, on the occasion of International Human Rights Day, emphasizing that the report represents 'only a fraction' of the atrocities occurring at the prison. It says Qarchak Prison has become 'one of the darkest symbols of systematic human rights violations in the Islamic Republic of Iran.'

Syrian rebels who overthrew Assad name interim government leader	The Syrian rebels who overthrew longtime iron-fisted ruler Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday appointed a transitional head of government to run the country until March 1. After a cabinet meeting in Damascus of rebel leaders and ousted officials from Assad’s government, Mohammed al-Bashir, a figure little known across most of Syria who previously ran an administration in a small pocket of the northwest controlled by rebels, said he was picked to lead the interim government. 'The meeting was under the headline of transferring the files and institutions to caretake the government,' Bashir said. He stood in front of two flags: the green, black and white flag flown by opponents of Assad throughout the civil war, and a white flag with the Islamic oath of faith in black writing, typically flown in Syria by Sunni Islamist fighters. There was some sense of normalcy returning to the Syrian capital, with a notable decrease in the number of armed people on the streets. Sources close to the rebels said commanders had ordered fighters to withdraw from cities and for police and internal security forces affiliated with the main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, to deploy instead. Banks and shops reopened for the first time since Assad's overthrow on Sunday and his flight to asylum in Russia. Traffic returned to the roads, construction workers were back fixing a roundabout in the Damascus city center and street cleaners swept roadways. The signs of Middle East conflict remained, however. Israel launched airstrikes against Syrian army bases, whose forces had melted away in the face of the lightning rebel advance that ousted Assad over a two-week period. Israel sent forces across the border into a demilitarized zone inside Syria, saying its airstrikes were aimed at keeping weapons from falling into hostile hands. It denied reports that its forces had advanced beyond the buffer zone into the countryside southwest of Damascus. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the Islamist leader who headed the offensive that forced Assad out, vowed to pursue former senior government officials responsible for torture and war crimes. 'Rewards will be offered to those who will provide information about senior army and security officers involved in war crimes,' Golani said in a statement. The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham he leads is rooted in Syria's al-Qaida branch and is designated by many Western governments as a terrorist organization, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric. Geir Pedersen, the United Nations envoy for Syria, said in Geneva that the groups that forced Assad to flee must transform their 'good messages' into actions on the ground. 'They have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness,' Pedersen said, adding that in Aleppo and Hama, 'we have also seen ... reassuring things on the ground.' But 'what we need not to see is of course that the good statements and what we are seeing on the ground at the beginning, that this is not followed up in practice in the days and the weeks ahead of us.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, 'The United States reaffirms its full support for a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition. This transition process should lead to credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance that meets international standards of transparency and accountability.' 'The Syrian people will decide the future of Syria,' the top U.S. diplomat said. 'All nations should pledge to support an inclusive and transparent process and refrain from external interference.' A German government statement late Monday said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the end of the Assad regime, and said they are 'prepared to work together with the new rulers on the basis of fundamental human rights and the protection of ethnic and religious minorities.' Scholz and Macron emphasized the importance of maintaining Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the statement said. The United Nations has expressed concerns about Israel’s deployment of troops across a demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights, which Israel says is necessary to protect its own security. U.N. envoy Pederson said Tuesday that the world body is continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. 'This needs to stop,' Pederson said. Israeli troops were on the Syrian side of the buffer zone Tuesday, about 25 kilometers southwest of Damascus, according to several security sources cited by Reuters and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Avichay Adraee said reports that Israeli forces were approaching Damascus were incorrect. He said Israeli troops were located inside the buffer zone and at defensive points close to the border. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday that Israeli forces had struck suspected chemical weapons sites as well as long-range rockets as part of an effort to prevent them from ending up in the possession of hostile actors. Saudi Arabia condemned Israel’s actions in Syria, saying in a statement Tuesday that they violate international law and 'sabotage Syria’s chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.' Some material in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-rebels-who-overthrew-assad-name-interim-government-leader/7896304.html	2024-12-10T10:19:32-08:00	
Homes burn in California as wind-driven wildfire prompts evacuations	MALIBU, CALIFORNIA — Thousands of Southern California residents were under evacuation orders and warnings Tuesday as firefighters battled a wind-driven wildfire in Malibu that burned near seaside mansions and Pepperdine University, where students sheltering at the school's library watched as the blaze intensified and the sky turned deep red. A 'minimal number' of homes burned, but the exact number wasn't immediately known, Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said. More than 8,100 homes and other structures were under threat, including more than 2,000 where residents have been ordered to evacuate. Some 6,000 more people were warned to be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice. Ryan Song, a resident assistant at Pepperdine University, said he first noticed the power went out at his dorm late Monday and then looked out the window and saw a huge pink glow. 'I thought, ‘This is too bright,’ and it got bigger and bigger,' the 20-year-old junior said. 'I immediately went outside and saw that it was a real fire.' Song and the other resident assistants went door to door, evacuating students. Most were calm and followed instructions, he said; a few who were scared rushed to their cars to get off campus. Song spent the next few hours racing back and forth in the dark between his dorm and the main campus to ensure no one was left behind as fire raged down a mountain, he said. 'It felt really close,' he said, adding he was probably less than a mile away. 'Seeing the fire rampaging down the hill is obviously scary for students, but I felt like our staff was prepared.' The university later said the worst of the fire had pushed past campus. It was not immediately known how the blaze, named the Franklin Fire, started. County officials estimated that more than 9 square kilometers of trees and dry brush had burned. There was no containment. The fire burned amid dangerous conditions because of notorious Santa Ana winds expected to last into Wednesday. Marrone said at least a thousand firefighters would be scrambling to get a handle on the blaze before 2 p.m., when winds were expected to regain strength. 'Time is of the essence for us to grab ahold of the fire and start getting some containment,' the chief said at a morning news conference. The fire erupted shortly before 11 p.m. Tuesday and swiftly moved south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and extending all the way to the ocean, where large homes line the beach and inland canyons are notoriously fire prone. At one point, it threatened the historic Malibu Pier, but the structure was protected and is intact, officials said. Pepperdine canceled classes and finals for the day and there was a shelter-in-place order on campus. Helicopters dropped water collected from lakes in the school's Alumni Park onto the flames. Firefighters with flashlights and hoses protected nearby homes overnight, ABC 7 reported. As the sun came up Tuesday, smoke billowed over the campus and the adjacent mountains that plunge toward the coast. North to northeast winds were forecast to increase to 48 to 64 kph with gusts up to 105 kph expected, the National Weather Service's office for Los Angeles posted on social media platform X. Power to about 40,000 customers had been shut off by Monday night, including 11,000 in Los Angeles County, as Southern California Edison worked to mitigate the impacts of the Santa Ana winds, whose strong gusts can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires. Email and phone messages were left with Edison inquiring whether electricity had been turned off in Malibu before the fire started. The Woolsey Fire that roared through Malibu in 2018, killing three people and destroying 1,600 homes, was sparked by Edison equipment. Santa Anas are dry, warm and gusty northeast winds that blow from the interior of Southern California toward the coast and offshore. They typically occur during the fall months and continue through winter and into early spring.	https://www.voanews.com/a/homes-burn-in-california-as-wind-driven-wildfire-prompts-evacuations/7896280.html	2024-12-10T10:00:59-08:00	
US Justice Department ignored some policies when seizing reporters' phone records, watchdog finds	WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors sidestepped some Justice Department rules when they seized the phone records of reporters as part of media leak investigations during the Trump administration, according to a new watchdog report being released as the aggressive practice of hunting for journalists' sources could again be resurrected. The report Tuesday from the Justice Department inspector general's office also found that some congressional staffers had their records obtained by prosecutors by sheer virtue of the fact that they had accessed classified information despite that being part of their job responsibilities. Though the report chronicles Justice Department actions from several years ago, the issue has new resonance as President-elect Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, has spoken of his desire to 'come after' members of the media 'who lied about American citizens' and his belief that the federal government should be rid of 'conspirators' against Trump. Those comments raise the possibility that the Justice Department under new leadership — Trump has picked former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi to serve as his attorney general — could undo a three-year-old policy that, with limited exceptions, prohibits prosecutors from secretly seizing reporters' phone records during investigations into leaks of sensitive information. The action from Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2021 followed an uproar over revelations that the Justice Department during the Trump administration had obtained records belonging to journalists at The Washington Post, CNN and The New York Times as part of investigations into who had disclosed government secrets related to the investigation into Russian election interference and other national security matters. The inspector general found that the Justice Department didn't follow certain department rules that had been implemented years earlier when seeking reporters' records in 2020, including having a News Media Review Committee review the request, according to the report. The committee is meant to ensure that officials other than prosecutors, including the head of the department's office of public affairs, are able to weigh in on such efforts. Then-Attorney General William Barr, who authorized obtaining the records from CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post, did not expressly sign off on the use of non-disclosure agreements that were sought — as was required under department policy, according to the report. The Justice Department also seized data from the accounts of some Democratic members of Congress over leaks related to the Russia investigation, and sought records through Apple from then-White House counsel Don McGahn. The department went after records of two members of Congress and 43 congressional staffers, according to the report. The inspector general found no evidence of 'retaliatory or political motivation by the career prosecutors' who initiated the requests. The staffers were considered suspects in most cases merely because of the close proximity between the time they accessed classified material as part of their job responsibilities and the publication of news articles containing secret information, according to the report. Garland's new policy laid out several scenarios under which the Justice Department still could obtain reporters' records, including if the reporters are suspected of working for agents of a foreign power or terrorist organizations, if they are under investigation for unrelated activities or if they obtained their information through criminal methods like breaking and entering. The Justice Department during both Democratic and Republican leadership has struggled with how to balance its determination to protect press freedom and its determination to safeguard national security secrets. President Barack Obama's first attorney general, Eric Holder, announced revised guidelines for leak investigations after an outcry over actions seen as aggressively intrusive into press freedom, including the secret seizure of phone records of Associated Press reporters and editors. And Jeff Sessions, Trump's first attorney general, announced in 2017 a leak crackdown following a series of disclosures during the investigation into Russian election interference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-ignored-some-policies-when-seizing-reporters-phone-records-watchdog-finds/7896172.html	2024-12-10T09:07:04-08:00	
Pakistan's ex-spy chief indicted on political interference, other charges	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan’s military said Tuesday that the former head of the country’s main intelligence agency has been charged with multiple criminal offenses, including political interference, during ongoing court-martial proceedings. The announcement was made four months after Faiz Hamid, a former lieutenant general, was taken into custody by military authorities to undergo an investigation and legal proceedings. The military’s media wing reported that Hamid, who formerly led the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI, 'has been formally arraigned on charges of engaging in political activities, violations of the Official Secrets Act … misuse of authority and government resources.' The charges carry a potential prison sentence of up to 14 years. The statement noted the former ISI chief is also being investigated in connection with the May 2023 attacks on Pakistani military properties and installations, which officials blamed on supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Hamid 'is being afforded with all legal rights as per the law,' the military stated. It was not possible to contact the detainee for comment, as is the case with other suspects in military custody. Hamid served as director general of the ISI from 2019 to 2021, when Khan was in power. In April 2022, the cricket star-turned-prime minister was ousted through an opposition vote of no-confidence in parliament. Khan said his desire to retain Hamid as ISI chief for an extended period had strained his relations with then-military chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, eventually leading to the fall of his government. The 72-year-old deposed Pakistani leader accused Bajwa of orchestrating his ouster, charges the former army chief rejected. Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces dozens of criminal charges he says are orchestrated by the military to keep him from returning to power. Army officials deny the charges. The arrest and subsequent court-martial proceedings of an ISI chief or a high-profile officer are unprecedented in Pakistan, where the military has staged three coups against elected governments and ruled the country for more than three decades since it gained independence in 1947. Khan and his predecessors assert that generals retain influence over government affairs even when not in power and orchestrate the removal of elected prime ministers who fall out with the military. Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington and the United Nations, echoed those claims in an article published in the Dawn newspaper on Monday. She suggested that the military’s role in civilian matters has increased since Khan's removal. 'The past two years have seen a decisive shift in the civil-military power balance in the latter’s favor, with its role in governance even extending to economic policy,' Lodhi stated. 'This is unprecedented even by the country’s past record of the military’s sway over government affairs. … Pakistan’s democratic future and prospects of political stability are clouded by increasing autocratization,' she added. In a nationally televised address to families of fallen soldiers just days before stepping down from office, Bajwa acknowledged that the military had been meddling in national politics for decades. Addressing growing public criticism of the institution, the former Pakistani army chief said, ''I believe the major reason has been the military’s interference in politics for the past 70 years, which is unconstitutional.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-s-ex-spy-chief-indicted-on-political-interference-other-charges/7896160.html	2024-12-10T09:05:33-08:00	
South Korea's ex-defense minister formally arrested over martial law imposition	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A former South Korean defense minister was formally arrested Wednesday over his alleged collusion with President Yoon Suk Yeol and others in imposing martial law last week, as authorities investigate whether their acts amount to rebellion. Martial law, the first in more than 40 years, lasted only about six hours but has triggered a domestic firestorm and large street protests. Yoon and his associates face criminal investigations and impeachment attempts. The Justice Ministry has banned Yoon and eight others from leaving the country as authorities see them as key suspects in the martial law case. It's the first time that a sitting president in South Korea has received a travel ban. The Seoul Central District Court said it approved an arrest warrant for former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun on charges of rebellion and abuse of power. Kim has been detained since Sunday. Prosecutors have up to 20 days to determine whether to indict him. A conviction on the charge of rebellion carries a maximum death sentence. Kim became the first person arrested over the case. He has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoon's decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4. Kim said in a statement Tuesday that he 'deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety and inconvenience.' He said all responsibility for the imposition of martial law rests solely with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce it, saying they were only following his order. Prosecutors reportedly accuse Kim of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power by staging a riot to disrupt the constitution in collaboration with Yoon and other military and police officers. Prosecutors' offices in Seoul couldn't immediately confirm the reports. The opposition-controlled parliament passed a bill Tuesday to appoint an independent special counsel to investigate Yoon and other top military officials over the martial law introduction. The main opposition Democratic Party had advocated for a special counsel investigation, arguing that public prosecutors cannot be trusted to conduct a thorough investigation of Yoon, a former prosecutor-general. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the National Assembly's main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim's instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon's martial law order. Kwak said Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to 'quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.' Kwak said he discussed Yoon's order with the commander at the scene and that they concluded there was nothing that could be done, ruling out the possibility of threatening the lawmakers by shooting blanks or cutting off electricity. At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the military's counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the country's spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeo's command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the president's order. Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' and South Korea wasn't in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesn't allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,' a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Yoon avoided impeachment on Saturday after most governing party lawmakers boycotted a floor vote in the National Assembly. The Democratic Party said it would prepare for a new vote on Yoon's impeachment on Saturday. The party on Tuesday submitted motions to impeach Yoon's police chief and justice minister as well. It pushed to impeach Kim Yong Hyun and the safety minister, but they resigned before parliament took a vote. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If it voted for removal, a new presidential election would be required.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-ex-defense-minister-formally-arrested-over-martial-law-imposition/7896101.html	2024-12-10T08:50:47-08:00	
US sanctions Chinese cybersecurity firm for 'malicious' activities	WASHINGTON — The United States slapped sanctions on a Chinese cybersecurity company and one of its employees Tuesday, accusing it of compromising more than 80,000 firewalls in a 2020 attack. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that it had sanctioned Sichuan Silence Information Technology Company and an employee named Guan Tianfeng over the April 2020 attack, which targeted firewalls around the world, including critical infrastructure in the U.S. Over a three-day period, Guan exploited a vulnerability in a firewall product and proceeded to deploy malware against some 81,000 businesses around the world with the aim of stealing data, including usernames and passwords, while also attempting to infect the computers with ransomware, according to the Treasury Department. More than 23,000 firewalls were in the United States, of which 36 were protecting 'critical infrastructure companies' systems,' the Treasury said. 'Today's action underscores our commitment to exposing these malicious cyber activities ... and to holding the actors behind them accountable for their schemes,' Bradley Smith, Treasury acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. The Treasury, he said, 'will continue to leverage our tools to disrupt attempts by malicious cyber actors to undermine our critical infrastructure.' Alongside the sanctions, the Department of Justice has also unsealed an indictment against Guan and announced a reward of up to $10 million for information about the employee or company, according to the Treasury Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-chinese-cybersecurity-firm-for-malicious-activities/7896129.html	2024-12-10T08:35:55-08:00	
Taiwan says China has launched biggest maritime operation in decades	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Defense officials in Taiwan say China has deployed nearly 90 naval and coast guard vessels in waters stretching from islands in the south of Japan to the South China Sea. The deployment is the largest to regional waters in almost three decades, Taiwanese officials say, and part of what appears to be a military exercise. China has not yet commented on the movements or confirmed it is conducting exercises. Speaking at a regular press briefing on Tuesday, Taiwanese defense officials said Beijing’s operation is not only targeting Taipei but aimed at demonstrating its ability to prevent regional countries, including Japan and the Philippines, from coming to the island’s defense. 'The current scale is the largest compared to the previous four [Chinese war games],' Taiwanese Defense Ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang told journalists at the press conference. China claims democratically ruled Taiwan is part of its territory and has not ruled out the possibility of using force to achieve its goal of reunification. There is little to no support for unification with authoritarian China in Taiwan. Sun said the exercises were the largest since war games were held around the island in response to its first presidential elections in 1996. In recent days, Taiwan’s defense ministry said it has detected 21 Chinese vessels and 47 Chinese military aircraft operating in the immediate vicinity of the island. Hsieh Jih-sheng, a senior intelligence officer at Taiwan’s defense ministry, told journalists at the same press conference that China’s broader maritime deployment is aimed at blocking forces from Japan and the Philippines from coming to Taiwan’s aid in a potential Chinese military attack against the island. In addition to honing its capabilities to deny access to a broad swath around the island, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said China is also forming two 'walls' in the western Pacific, deploying large numbers of vessels to the eastern end of Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone and an area further out in the Pacific. Air defense identification zones are unilaterally established by a country’s air defense forces and are not underpinned by international treaty or law. 'With these two walls, they are sending a clear message: The Taiwan Strait is their internal waters, and cross-strait issues should be handled by the People's Liberation Army [PLA] and the People's Republic of China,' Taiwanese defense official Hsieh told journalists. Taiwan has been preparing for a potential Chinese military exercise around the island since President Lai Ching-te set off on his first overseas trip to the Pacific region, which included stopovers in the U.S. territory of Guam and state of Hawaii, on November 30. Throughout the trip, Taipei repeatedly warned about China potentially launching a new round of military drills near the island and urged Beijing not to 'send the wrong signals.' When asked about the movements of Chinese vessels on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning did not provide additional details. 'The Taiwan question is China’s internal affair. China will firmly defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,' she said during the regular press conference. One Chinese analyst, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue, told VOA that it is hard to say why Beijing hasn’t publicly announced any maritime operations around Taiwan. J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with the Global Taiwan Institute, said Beijing may want to 'keep the Taiwanese side guessing' by not announcing its planned military operations. 'Telegraphing one’s intentions only goes so far. Beijing may want to be more flexible and less predictable than it has been in the past,' he told VOA in written response. Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo’s International Christian University, said maintaining ambiguity makes it difficult for Taiwan and regional countries to respond to Chinese military operations in the region. 'Ambiguity creates challenges for Taiwan and neighboring stakeholders, such as Japan, the United States and the Philippines, to know what the Chinese are doing and what’s the best way to respond,' he told VOA in a phone interview. Despite the lack of clarity from Beijing, Cole in Taipei said the Taiwanese government’s efforts to 'proactively' disclose Chinese military activities in the region help to bring more international attention to the threats and pressure that democratically ruled Taiwan faces from China. 'Such public diplomacy makes the threat more palpable and turns an abstract concept into something that is real and that people can relate to,' he told VOA. On Monday, Taiwan launched a series of war-preparedness drills at strategic locations across the island and publicized information about the unannounced Chinese military operations. Those moves, Taiwanese experts say, have helped Taipei create an intelligence deterrence against Beijing. 'By swiftly disclosing Chinese military operations in the region and initiating its own countermeasures, Taiwan is trying to deter China from further escalating its military activities around the island,' Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told VOA by phone. While Taiwan has adopted some countermeasures, some analysts say Beijing is also 'routinizing' its coercion against Taipei by maintaining a constant military presence across the region. 'The People’s Liberation [Army] and Chinese coast guard are so big that they can maintain a constant presence near Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan at the same time,' said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former Pentagon official. 'Military operators may have a difficult time discerning when an attack is actually coming when every day looks like an attack,' he told VOA by phone. Nagy in Japan said as the United States prepares for a change in administrations over the next few weeks, he expects China to ramp up pressure against Taiwan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-china-has-launched-biggest-maritime-operation-in-decades/7896051.html	2024-12-10T08:34:30-08:00	
France flies 2 fighter jets from Chad to signal start of military withdrawal	PARIS — France flew out the two Mirage fighter jets it had stationed in Chad on Tuesday, signaling the beginning of the withdrawal of its military forces from the former French colony in Central Africa that last month broke off its defense cooperation agreement with Paris. The pair of Mirage 2000-D fighters took off after midday from a French base in the capital, N'Djamena, after Chadian military forces came to wish them farewell, and were returning to a French air force base in Nancy, in eastern France, French military spokesman Colonel Guillaume Vernet said. He added that negotiations with Chadian authorities were continuing on how and when France might withdraw other members of its 1,000-strong force in Chad, and whether all or just some of them will leave. In announcing the end of the defense cooperation agreement with France last month, the Chadian government described the decision as a historic turning point for the country that gained independence in 1960 and said that it would enable Chad to redefine its strategic partnerships in line with national priorities. Chad was one of the last countries in the region in which France maintained a large military presence, having been ousted in recent years from Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso after years of fighting Islamic extremists alongside regional troops. Those countries have inched closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel, the vast expanse below the Sahara Desert. Chadian authorities didn't specify when French troops must leave and said the end of the defense agreement in no way calls into question the countries' historical ties. They said they want to maintain relations in other areas of common interest. Last week, hundreds of people marched in N'Djamena to call for the withdrawal of French troops, chanting 'Chad for us, France out!' Some held banners that read, 'We do not want to see a single French person in Chad.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-flies-2-fighter-jets-from-chad-to-signal-start-of-military-withdrawal/7896073.html	2024-12-10T08:05:11-08:00	
New generation must take up fight against nuclear weapons, Nobel laureate group says	OSLO, NORWAY — Young people must take up the fight for a nuclear-free world, with such weapons many times more powerful than in the past, a representative for this year's Nobel Peace Prize laureate, an atomic bomb survivors' group, said Tuesday. Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of survivors of the 1945 nuclear bombings of Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is campaigning for a world free of nuclear weapons using witness testimony. The average age of Japan's atomic bomb survivors is now 85, Terumi Tanaka, a co-chair of the group, said when accepting the prize at a ceremony held at Oslo City Hall attended by Norway's King Harald, Queen Sonja and other dignitaries. 'Any one of you could become either a victim or a perpetrator, at any time,' Tanaka, 92, told the audience. 'Ten years from now, there may only be a handful of us able to give testimony as firsthand survivors. From now on, I hope that the next generation will find ways to build on our efforts and develop the movement even further.' His group had 'undoubtedly' played a major role in creating the worldwide standard that it was unacceptable to use atomic weapons, or 'nuclear taboo,' he said. But that standard was being weakened, he added. 'In addition to the civilian casualties, I am infinitely saddened and angered that the 'nuclear taboo' risks being broken,' he said. Threats to use nuclear weapons have been made in the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Tanaka said, warning that 4,000 nuclear warheads were ready to be launched immediately around the world. Nihon Hidankyo was also represented at the ceremony by its two other co-chairs, Shigemitsu Tanaka, 84, and Toshiyuki Mimaki, 82. An estimated 210,000 people died, either immediately or over time, as a result of the bombs dropped in 1945 on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and August 9, respectively. Today's nuclear weapons are far more powerful than those used at that time. Tanaka was 13 years old at the time of the Nagasaki bombing, and although he survived the explosion almost unharmed at his home some 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from ground zero, he lost five family members and recalled harrowing encounters. 'The deaths I witnessed at that time could hardly be described as human deaths. There were hundreds of people suffering in agony, unable to receive any kind of medical attention,' Tanaka told the audience. 'I strongly felt that even in war, such killing and maiming must never be allowed to happen.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-generation-must-take-up-fight-against-nuclear-weapons-nobel-laureate-group-says/7896005.html	2024-12-10T07:18:19-08:00	
Netanyahu assails media as he testifies for first time in corruption trial	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the witness stand for the first time on Tuesday in his long-running corruption trial, saying he was being hounded for his hawkish security policies. Netanyahu, 75, is Israel's first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime. He is testifying at the same time Israel is engaged in a war in Gaza and facing possible new threats posed by regional turmoil, including in Syria. Last week judges ruled that Netanyahu, indicted in 2019, must testify three times a week, forcing the longtime Israeli leader to juggle between the courtroom and the war room at Israel's Defense Ministry, minutes away from the courthouse. The leader of the right-wing Likud party, Netanyahu assailed the Israeli media for what he called its leftist stance and accused journalists of having hounded him for years because his policies did not align with a push for a Palestinian state. 'I have been waiting for eight years for this moment to tell the truth,' Netanyahu told the three-judge court. 'But I am also a prime minister. … I am leading the country through a seven-front war. And I think the two can be done in parallel.' Prosecutors accuse Netanyahu of granting regulatory favors worth about $500 million to Bezeq Telecom Israel in return for positive coverage of himself and his wife, Sara, on a news website controlled by the company's former chairman. He is also accused of negotiating a deal with the owner of Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper for better coverage in return for legislation to slow the growth of a rival paper. Netanyahu denies the allegations against him and has pleaded not guilty. He stood rather than sat in the witness box throughout his morning testimony. 'Had I wanted good coverage, all I would have had to have done would be to signal toward a two-state solution. ... Had I moved two steps to the left, I would have been hailed,' he said. In lengthy replies, he portrayed himself as a staunch defender of Israel’s security, withstanding pressures from international powers and a hostile domestic media. Netanyahu smiled confidently when he entered the Tel Aviv District Court around 10 a.m. The trial was moved from Jerusalem for undisclosed security reasons and convened in an underground courtroom. Before Netanyahu took the stand, his lawyer Amit Hadad laid out for the judges what the defense maintains are fundamental flaws in the investigation. Prosecutors, Hadad said, 'weren't investigating a crime, they were going after a person.' A few dozen protesters gathered outside the courthouse, some of them supporters and others demanding he do more to negotiate the release of some 100 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. Israel has been waging war in Gaza against the Palestinian militant group for more than a year, during which Netanyahu had been granted a delay for the start of his court appearances. But last Thursday, judges ruled that he must start testifying. Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu will testify three times a week, the court said, despite the Gaza war and possible new threats posed by wider Middle East turmoil. In the run-up to his court date, Netanyahu revived familiar prewar rhetoric against law enforcement, describing investigations against him as a witch hunt. He denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty. Before the war, Netanyahu's legal troubles bitterly divided Israelis and shook Israeli politics through five rounds of elections. His government's bid last year to curb the powers of the judiciary further polarized Israelis. The shock Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and the ensuing Gaza war swept Netanyahu's trial off the public agenda as Israelis came together in grief and trauma. But as the war dragged on, political unity crumbled. In recent weeks, while fighting abated on one front after Israel reached a ceasefire with Hamas' Lebanese ally Hezbollah, members of Netanyahu's cabinet, including his justice and police ministers, have clashed with the judiciary. His domestic legal woes were compounded last month when the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him and former defense chief Yoav Gallant, along with a Hamas leader, for alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-assails-media-as-he-testifies-for-first-time-in-corruption-trial/7895981.html	2024-12-10T06:59:34-08:00	
Analysts urge Ghana's new president to manage expectations amid economic challenges	Accra, Ghana — Ghana's Electoral Commission declared former president and opposition leader John Mahama the president-elect Monday following Saturday’s general elections. His return to power sparked mixed reactions, with some celebrating a fresh start and others questioning his ability to address Ghana’s economic challenges. Supporters of Ghana’s opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), took to the streets of Accra chanting songs of victory to celebrate Mahama’s reelection. For Jeremiah Maclean, a staunch NDC supporter, his win was nothing short of monumental. 'This is an overwhelming victory, and we are really excited. The good people of Ghana have shown the exit way to the NPP for mismanaging the economy,' he said, referring to the New Patriotic Party of defeated President Nana Akufo-Addo. However, for Alexander Bonsu, a disappointed voter and supporter of the New Patriotic NPP, Mahama's return to power raises serious concerns. 'He was once the president of Ghana, and we saw what he did. We saw how bad the economy was, we saw how he canceled the nursing trainees’ allowances,' he said. For Bonsu, Mahama’s track record leaves little hope for the future. 'Someone who has cost me before, I will find it very difficult to give him another chance,' he added. Yet, NDC supporter Maclean remains optimistic. 'They have voted for a visionary leader, they have voted for a man that will change the fortunes of this country, they have voted for a man that will reset this country,' he said. Ghana’s Electoral Commission tally gave Mahama 56% of the vote. Analysts attribute his win to widespread discontent with the ruling government’s handling of the economy. Dr. Kwame Asah-Asante, a political analyst at the University of Ghana, believes the election results reflect deep-seated frustrations. 'It is a manifestation of the fact that there was a lot of mistrust that people had, the hopelessness with which people viewed the political and economic system that has existed so far,' he said. Mahama’s presidency from 2012 to 2017 left a mixed legacy. According to analyst Jonathan Asante Okyere, while Mahama was credited for infrastructure projects and inclusivity, he struggled with Ghana’s energy crisis. 'We had issues of power fluctuation, power instability but he was able to solve it before he left. Unfortunately, the ordinary citizen did not see that as a kind gesture, so they had to punish him at the polls.' he said. As Mahama prepares to take office, Asante Okyere cautions that the road ahead will be steep, given the nation’s economic challenges. 'The people have a high expectation of his promises,' he said. 'That for me will be the challenge that he is likely to face. If you look at the mess that we find ourselves in, especially as we are not able to service our debts, it feels like there are even deeper cracks than what meets the eye.' For many Ghanaians, the hope is that Mahama’s administration will stabilize the economy and create opportunities in the face of rising inflation and unemployment. Analysts have called for him to cut government expenditures and manage the country’s debt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-urge-ghana-s-new-president-to-manage-expectations-amid-economic-challenges/7895941.html	2024-12-10T06:24:34-08:00	
UN: Taliban's legitimacy hinges on respect for human rights in Afghanistan	Islamabad — The United Nations reported Tuesday that women and girls are bearing the brunt of a persistent 'dangerous erosion' of human rights in Afghanistan, attributing the crisis to an 'intentional failure' of the country’s radical Taliban leaders. 'With authority comes responsibility,' said Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, referencing the August 2021 return of the formerly insurgent Taliban to power. 'The claim of the de facto authorities to be legitimate representatives of the Afghan people within the United Nations must be accompanied by genuine efforts to uphold and advance our shared norms and values,' she stated. The UNAMA statement, released in connection with International Human Rights Day, asserted that the human rights record of the Taliban had been particularly marked by their 'systematic discrimination' against Afghan women and girls. The Taliban government, which is not yet formally recognized by any country, has barred Afghan women from almost all aspects of every day and public life. Girls are banned from receiving education beyond the sixth grade, and most workplaces are not allowed to employ female staff except for a few sectors, such as health, police, and immigration. Women cannot undertake road or air trips unless accompanied by a male guardian. The restrictions stem from dozens of decrees the reclusive Taliban supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, has issued over the last three years based on his strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia. Tuesday’s statement reminded the Taliban that Afghanistan endorsed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, on December 10, 1948. 'If Afghans, in particular women and girls, continue to be denied their rights, this constitutes a clear and intentional failure to protect and be responsible for the well-being of all who live in Afghanistan,' said Fiona Frazer, the country representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Taliban leaders have ignored repeated U.N.-led international calls for them to reverse their sweeping curbs on women, saying their governance is in line with Sharia. The U.N. has repeatedly declined requests from the de facto Afghan authorities to represent the country due to their restrictions on women. Earlier this month, Afghan public health ministry authorities abruptly ordered medical institutions to stop enrolling female students nationwide, citing a new edict released by Akhundzada. The move has effectively closed one of the last available avenues for girls to seek higher education. The edict has drawn a global backlash and calls for its immediate reversal amid warnings it would leave millions of women without female nurses and midwives in a country where the Taliban have barred male doctors from treating female patients. The U.N. has warned the latest ban would exacerbate a deepening humanitarian crisis and health challenges facing poverty-stricken Afghanistan, reeling from years of war and natural disasters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-taliban-s-legitimacy-hinges-on-respect-for-human-rights-in-afghanistan/7895882.html	2024-12-10T05:49:57-08:00	
Medics: Israeli airstrikes kill 25 in northern Gaza	Palestinian medics said Tuesday that Israeli airstrikes killed at least 25 people in the Gaza Strip. The medics said strikes hit a multi-story building in the Beit Hanoun area in northern Gaza, and that most of those killed were from the same family. The latest attacks came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was an 'additional doorway' open to securing a deal with the Hamas militant group for the return of hostages seized in the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Netanyahu said that pathway has been brought by Hamas being 'more isolated than ever' as a result of Israel’s military actions against Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Hamas seized about 250 hostages during the attack in which it also killed 1,200 people. About 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, and at least one-third of them are believed to be dead. The health ministry in Gaza said Tuesday that Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed nearly 44,800 Palestinians. The Israel-Hamas conflict sparked cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which later spiraled into intense clashes with Israeli airstrikes killing a number of Hezbollah leaders. A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has been in place for about two weeks. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, United Kingdom and other Western countries. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/medics-israeli-airstrikes-kill-25-in-northern-gaza/7895772.html	2024-12-10T04:12:23-08:00	
Tensions peak as Bangladesh blames India for ‘spreading misinformation’	Tensions between India and Bangladesh have risen to alarming levels following the recent arrest of a Hindu monk in Dhaka and allegations that Hindus are being persecuted in the Muslim-majority nation. Hindu groups in India have staged anti-Bangladesh protests in recent weeks, but Bangladesh officials have said the accusations of persecution are unfounded. They said Indian news media and social media users are spreading misinformation and fueling friction. Diplomatic relations between the two countries have soured since August, when a student-led uprising ousted authoritarian prime minister Sheikh Hasina. She fled to India and took refuge in the country. Arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Then on November 25, a Bangladeshi Hindu monk, Chinmoy Krishna Das, was arrested at the Dhaka airport on charges of sedition. He was accused of raising a saffron Hindu flag on top of a Bangladeshi national flag during an October rally in the coastal city of Chittagong. Das has been an advocate for religious minorities in the country. Until July, he been a member of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness or, ISKCON, also known as the Hare Krishna movement. He was expelled from ISKON after being accused of abusing children. Das’s sedition arrest sparked protests by his supporters, and a Muslim attorney was killed outside the Chittagong courthouse. Anger in India In neighboring India, protesters called for the release of Das, who remains in custody. His next bail hearing is scheduled to take place on January 2. Hindu groups have launched rallies and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pressure Dhaka to release Das and to take action to stop attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh. On Wednesday, V Bhagaiah, national committee member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological mentor of India’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, said that Hindus have become victims of 'genocide' in Bangladesh. 'While minority Hindus are being murdered and raped, and Hindu temples and properties are being destroyed, the (Muhammad Yunus-led) interim government is quietly watching the genocide,' Bhagaiah said at a rally in Hyderabad. Former Indian Army officer Major General Gagandeep Bakshi, who often appears on national TV channels in India as a security analyst, said that to end the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh, 'the only solution' is to carve out a 'Hindu Nation' from within the Muslim-majority Bangladesh. 'Bangladesh under Mohd Yunis [Mohammad Yunus] has turned to radical jihadism. It wants to push out its Hindu minorities via genocide and seems itching for a fight,' he said on X. 'Divide Bangladesh in two parts. Make a separate country for Bangladeshi Hindus.' On Dec. 2, angry Hindu protesters ransacked the office of a deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh in the northeast Indian border state of Tripura. Response from Bangladesh Hindu temples and properties occasionally have been attacked in Bangladesh over the past years, allegedly by Islamist elements. The Yunus government agrees that Hindus faced violent attacks after Hasina’s ouster. But the violence was motivated by politics, not religion, officials said. The charge that the Hindu community is being violently targeted in Bangladesh, is 'completely baseless,' said Hasib Aziz, commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police. 'Not even a fraction of the allegations surfacing in Indian media that Hindus are facing persecution in Bangladesh is true. The allegation that Chinmoy Das was arrested because he is Hindu is baseless. He was charged under sedition and has been arrested as per law, for inciting violence and indulging in certain subversive activities,' Aziz told VOA. 'Nobody is being targeted in any orchestrated, anti-Hindu hate attack.' Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and others in India have launched a concerted misinformation campaign claiming that Hindus are 'facing a genocide' in Bangladesh, Bangladeshi former diplomat Khalilur Rahman told VOA. 'All they want is to destabilize Bangladesh,' said Khalilur Rahman, senior representative of the Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, who leads Bangladesh. He said the interim government in Bangladesh has emphasized the importance of improving the relationship between the two countries, based on mutual respect. 'Our foreign secretary met his Indian counterpart in Dhaka today. We hope to see efforts to carry forward our bilateral relations in a positive direction. It is in the best interest of both countries and the region,' Khalilur Rahman said. Meghmallar Basu, who is the president of Students’ Union, a left-leaning student organization at Dhaka University, said that to call the tensions and violence in Bangladesh 'genocide against Hindus' would be a 'shameless lie.' Basu, a Hindu, acknowledged the attacks on some Hindu temples and houses by certain 'anti-social forces' who took advantage of the collapse of the Hasina government. 'The misinformation that Hindutva activists in India are intentionally spreading on social media is worsening the relations between the two countries,’’ Basu said. ‘’The Hindu-Muslim relations in our country are also at the risk of worsening because of this propaganda.' Allegations of ‘fake news’ Many blamed India’s mainstream and social media for spreading 'fake news' and stoking the tension between the two countries. Sajjad Hossain Chowdhury, head of operations at the fact-checking organization Rumor Scanner, told VOA that the Indian media and Hindutva nationalist ‘X’ and Facebook accounts have been spreading 'fake news' about Bangladesh since the fall of Awami League government. 'Several Indian mainstream media outlets showed a video of the ritual of immersion of goddess Kali in India and claimed that it was the scene from a temple being vandalized by Islamists in Bangladesh. Using a video clip of a Hindu religious program in India — in which some women were trampled to death— many Indian Hindutva supporters wrote on X that they were Hindu women who had been raped and murdered by Islamists in Bangladesh,' Chowdhury said. 'We have identified more than a dozen rumors spread about Bangladesh, by at least 49 Indian media outlets, between Aug. 12 and Dec. 5.' Dhaka-based political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman said that the narrative that Hindus in Bangladesh are under persecution is consistent with the 'identity politics' of the current ruling party in India. 'So, the Indian authorities constantly try to label certain politically motivated attacks on some Hindus in Bangladesh as communal violence. And despite all the development the Indian media has undergone, it has morphed into a political propaganda mouthpiece of the BJP since they came into power in 2014,' he said. Zahed Ur Rahman added: 'The media ultimately feeds on the radical mindset that a significant number of Indians now possess. This is a result of living in an extremist political environment for too long.' Jon Danilowicz, a retired U.S. diplomat who has served in Bangladesh, said that it is difficult to fathom how the recent 'war of words' between India and Bangladesh serves either country’s interest. 'After mistakenly backing former PM Hasina past her expiration date, India appears to be stubbornly doubling down on its failed Bangladesh policy. The charges that Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus is leading an Islamist regime and unleashing genocide against the Hindu minority are ridiculously untrue,' he told the VOA. Danilowicz said that while the Indian right wing may see verbal and rhetorical attacks on post-Hasina Bangladesh as a 'smart domestic political strategy,' it does not serve India’s long-term regional interests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tensions-peak-as-bangladesh-blames-india-for-spreading-misinformation-/7895753.html	2024-12-10T03:54:25-08:00	
Zelenskyy says ‘decisiveness’ necessary to bring end to war	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that 'only decisiveness' can bring Russia’s war in Ukraine to an end and bring lasting peace. Days after talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said working together to bring an end to the war is the top priority, and he expressed gratitude to Trump 'for his strong resolve to bring this war to a fair end.' The Ukrainian leader further said he told Trump that Russian President Vladimir Putin 'fears only him and perhaps China.' 'We know that America has the capacity to accomplish remarkable things—things that others have not been able to achieve,' Zelenskyy posted on X. 'To succeed in ending this war, we need unity—the unity of America, Europe, and everyone in the world who values security—as well as strong positions and guarantees for peace.' Zelenskyy’s comments come amid questions about the level of U.S. support for Ukraine as U.S. leadership transitions from President Joe Biden’s administration to a new Trump term next month. The United States under Biden has led efforts to organize billions of dollars in military aid for Ukraine, including ammunition and air defenses to defend against Russian attacks. Trump said after the meeting Sunday that there should be an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and the start of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.

Assad’s downfall marks the loss of Moscow’s main ally in the Middle East	Russian state media say Moscow has granted asylum to ousted Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, who reports say landed in Moscow after escaping from Damascus Sunday. The Kremlin was a key supporter of Assad in his government's brutal attempts to defeat rebels, and that memory may make it difficult for Moscow to regain its foothold in Syria, which until a few days ago appeared unshakable. Elizabeth Cherneff narrates this report from Ricardo Marquina	https://www.voanews.com/a/assad-s-downfall-marks-the-loss-of-moscow-s-main-ally-in-the-middle-east/7895707.html	2024-12-10T02:13:25-08:00	
Syrian rebel leader pledges to release names of ousted government officials involved in war crimes	Syrian rebel commander Ahmad al-Sharaa, widely known as Abu Mohammad al-Golani, pledged Tuesday to release the names of senior officials from ousted President Bashar al-Assad’s government who were 'involved in torturing the Syrian people.' 'Rewards will be offered to those who will provide information about senior army and security officers involved in war crimes,' Golani said in a statement. The pledge came amid questions about Syria’s future governance following Assad’s departure. A German government statement late Monday said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the end of the Assad regime, and said they are 'prepared to work together with the new rulers on the basis of fundamental human rights and the protection of ethnic and religious minorities.' Scholz and Macron emphasized the importance of maintaining Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the statement said. The United Nations has expressed concerns about Israel’s deployment of troops across a demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights, which Israel says is necessary to protect its own security. Israeli troops were on the Syrian side of the zone Tuesday, about 25 kilometers southwest of Damascus, according to several security sources cited by Reuters and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Avichay Adraee said reports that Israeli forces were approaching Damascus were incorrect. He said Israeli troops were located inside the buffer zone and at defensive points close to the border. The Britain-based Observatory, which has monitored the conflict in Syria, also said Tuesday that Israeli forces had conducted more than 300 airstrikes on Syrian territory since Assad’s ouster early Sunday. Journalists reported more airstrikes early Tuesday in the Damascus area. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Staar said Tuesday that Israeli forces had struck suspected chemical weapons sites as well as long-range rockets as part of an effort to prevent them from ending up in the possession of hostile actors. Saudi Arabia condemned Israel’s actions in Syria, saying in a statement Tuesday that they violate international law and 'sabotage Syria’s chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters Monday that U.N. peacekeepers 'informed the Israeli counterparts that these actions would constitute a violation of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement that there should be no military forces or activities in the area of separation, and Israel and Syria must continue to uphold the terms of that 1974 agreement and preserve stability in the Golan.' Syria’s U.N. envoy also said he had written to the United Nations to protest the Israeli move, as well as attacks on several military installations in the country. Political transition Syrian rebels said Golani met for the first time Monday with the outgoing prime minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali to 'coordinate a transfer of power.' Jalali told Sky News Arabia TV on Monday, 'We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth.' He said most Cabinet ministers are still working from offices in Damascus. However, the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator for Syria, Adam Abdelmoula, told The Associated Press that some key government services had shut down as anxious state workers stayed home. At the United Nations, Syria’s ambassador, who was appointed by the Assad regime, told reporters that his delegation had received instructions from the new authorities to continue doing their job during the transition. 'We are with the Syrian people. We will keep defending and working for the Syrian people. So we will continue our work till further notice,' Koussay Aldahhak said. He said the country and people are witnessing a new era of change. 'Syrians are looking forward for establishing a state of freedom, equality, rule of law, democracy, and we will join efforts to rebuild our country, to rebuild what was destroyed, and to rebuild the future — better future of Syria for all Syrians,' he said. Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council met late Monday behind closed doors at the request of Russia, which supported Assad militarily during the nearly 14-year Syrian civil war. U.N. Syria envoy Geir Pedersen and U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix both provided briefings. 'The council, I think, was more or less united on the need to preserve the territorial integrity and unity of Syria, to ensure the protection of civilians, to ensure that humanitarian aid is coming to the needy population,' Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters after the meeting. 'The situation needs to be stabilized; there has to be an inclusive political process, and also there should not be a resurgence of terrorist forces,' China’s envoy Fu Cong told reporters. 'The U.N. has a big role to play in all of these.' VOA United Nations Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report. Some information came from The Associated Press.

K-pop light sticks fire up impeachment protests in South Korea	SEOUL, South Korea — While South Korean protesters have long employed songs, dances and chants, customized light sticks popular with K-pop fans have emerged as an effective new tool for demonstrators calling for the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Tens of thousands of protesters have braved near sub-zero temperatures and gathered outside the National Assembly in the capital of Seoul since Yoon's failed martial law attempt last week. 'Impeach, impeach. Impeach Yoon Suk Yeol,' protesters chanted to the beat of K-pop group aespa's latest techno track 'Whiplash.' Videos of synchronized chanting and light stick movements in unison at the protests have gone viral on social media along with flags carrying messages and memes from mainly younger demonstrators. 'Give us geeks the freedom to only worry about geek things,' one meme flag carried on a flagpole at Saturday's protest read, capturing the mood among young people amid deepening political turmoil. One of the advantages of the light sticks is how sturdy they are, said Kim Do Heon, a Seoul-based music critic. 'It also shines very bright and comes in a size that is easy to carry around.' South Koreans are playing the long game, said Shin Jae-yun who came out to protest against Yoon with a light stick for K-pop boy band TREASURE, because protests are a 'very painful act' yet there is no guarantee things will improve right away. 'To endure such pain, you have to have something to enjoy in it so that people can stay hopeful for a long time even when it drags on,' Shin said. Playlists of popular K-pop protest songs are also being shared on X. Kim Byung-joo, a lawmaker from the main opposition Democratic Party, jumped on the trend on Monday and posted a playlist on the platform: 'Impeach Yoon Suk Yeol, ringleader of treason!...from folk songs to K-pop.' South Korea has a rich history of protest since democracy took root in the 1980s after a series of military interventions. Demonstrations over worker rights, threats from neighboring North Korea and perceived government failings have sometimes turned violent in the past. Lee Seul-gi, a 36-year-old woman who is a fan of K-pop boyband ATEEZ, said the impeachment protests this time around have become more accessible. 'Previous rallies might have been a bit violent and scary. But the light sticks and K-pop have lowered the barrier,' Lee said. Candle upgrade Until 2016, candles were prominent at many protests and played a central role in the rallies that led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye. Park was ousted over a graft scandal and was later jailed over the scandal that exposed webs of corruption between political leaders and the country's conglomerates. 'So many people were holding candles, putting paper cups over them and carrying them out so they wouldn't go out. But now the age of the light sticks is here, not candles,' music critic Kim said. Stephanie Choi, a researcher at the State University of New York at Buffalo, said the light sticks still reflect the 'power of solidarity while maintaining the original meaning of non-violence.' While men and women from all age groups are gathering and calling on parliament to impeach Yoon, young women are outnumbering their male peers at the protests. Yoon vowed to abolish the gender equality ministry before taking office and was an unpopular candidate with women voters in their 20s in the 2022 presidential election. He won office in 2022 by the slimmest margin in South Korean history but his party suffered a landslide defeat in parliamentary elections earlier this year. The K-pop industry is notoriously apolitical and so are the lyrics of many K-pop songs playing at the impeachment protests. In South Korea, celebrities expressing political opinions are often frowned upon. But experts say fans are conscious of K-pop's power and the underlying messages of female empowerment it carries. 'K-pop is a female-dominant space...and their feminist demands have shaped K-pop’s esthetics and performances today,' Choi said. Kim Da-in, a 19-year-old fan of virtual idol group Plave, said the impeachment protests are uniting all K-pop fandoms. 'Here, I feel that we are citizens of South Korea first before we are idol fans.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/k-pop-light-sticks-fire-up-impeachment-protests-in-south-korea/7895682.html	2024-12-10T00:37:17-08:00

VOA Turkish: 3 members of the security forces were killed in Turkish airstrikes near Manbij	Turkish warplanes launched three airstrikes near the Qara Quzaq Bridge, a strategic bridge that connects the eastern Euphrates to the western Euphrates. The strikes, targeting Kurdish security forces, resulted in the deaths of one member of the Internal Security Forces and two traffic police officers. These strikes, along with ongoing attacks by Turkish-backed Syrian armed groups on areas governed by the Kurdish Autonomous Administration, have heightened fears and unrest among civilians. Ridwan Bezar, a freelance stringer based in northern Syria, provides a detailed video report of these developments.

VOA Turkish: How developments in Syria may affect relations between Turkey, Kurds	Following the overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria, all eyes turned to the actors in the country, especially the Kurds. While Turkey is again seeking a solution to its Kurdish issue, how will the latest situation in Syria affect this process? Turkey views the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Turkey, the U.S. and EU have designated PKK as a terrorist organization. VOA Turkish talked to experts closely following the region, who emphasized that Turkey's approach to the Kurds in Syria depends on the resolution of its own internal Kurdish issue. According to experts, if Turkey wants to play a role in the reconstruction of Syria, it must cooperate with the Kurds.

South Korea’s leadership crisis jeopardizes US efforts to counter China	WASHINGTON — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s uncertain political future from his martial law backlash could imperil the next Trump administration’s trilateral coordination with the country and Japan in countering China, analysts say. Yoon faces an investigation for treason after declaring martial law and rescinding it hours later last week. Although he survived an impeachment vote on Saturday, the main opposition Democratic Party said the following day it would seek an impeachment vote again. Uncertainty surrounds Yoon’s leadership and the future leadership of South Korea amid rapidly evolving political disarray and confusion. Key government officials have resigned over the martial law controversy, and the head of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), Han Dong-hun, said Sunday that Yoon would resign soon and would no longer be involved in conducting state affairs. In the meantime, the Defense Ministry said Monday that Yoon still had the control of the South Korean military. The South Korean political crisis poses risks to the security of the region, where countries such as North Korea, China and Russia lie in wait to take advantage of the situation, analysts say. 'The resulting political turmoil raises uncertainty over the future direction of the country’s policies and ability to implement them,' said Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation. 'The incoming U.S. administration will be focused on countering the multifaceted Chinese threat to the region and urging allies and partners to assume larger roles,' he said. 'Yoon’s actions will trigger doubts as to the viability of Seoul’s roles and contributions.' 'Coupled with the Japanese leadership change and loss of legislative majority by the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], the United States now has two weakened allies in Northeast Asia,' Klingner said. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba assumed office in October. The same month, Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in parliament. On Monday, Daniel Kritenbrink, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts to discuss regional security, underscoring the importance of maintaining close trilateral cooperation. The trilateral ties were consolidated after Yoon extended an olive branch to then- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida after years of frayed relations between the two countries over colonial wartime issues. The two countries' mending of bilateral ties and their subsequent trilateral summit with the U.S. at Camp David in August 2023, viewed as historic in Washington, is frowned upon by South Korea's main opposition party, which is considered anti-Japan and pro-China. If the Democratic Party files another impeachment motion and manages to get two-thirds of the 300-seat National Assembly and six of nine constitutional court judges to vote in favor, the country will hold a special election to choose a new president. If Yoon resigns or impeachment votes by the parliament and court pass, the main opposition party has a shot at the country’s next leadership. However, how the process will unfold is uncertain as the PPP boycotted the first impeachment vote and the constitutional court has three vacancies. Terence Roehrig, a Korea expert and professor of national security at the U.S. Naval War College, said, 'If Yoon leaves office, either through impeachment or resignation, the special election that follows will undoubtedly select a Democratic Party president.' He continued: 'As a result, there is likely to be a shift in South Korean policy toward China and in maintaining trilateral ties with Japan and the United States. Much has been done in the past two years to institutionalize trilateral relations, but these efforts will be tested with Yoon’s departure along with the incoming Trump administration.' The PPP criticized Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung for what it described as his 'subservient' attitude toward China when he met with then-Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming in March. Lee said at the meeting that South Korea should not be involved in the cross-strait issue involving Taiwan. China considers the independent island nation as its own sovereign territory. Xing in 2023 accused Yoon’s government of tilting too much toward the U.S. and damaging South Korea’s relations with China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press briefing in Beijing on Monday that she will 'not comment on the ROK’s internal affairs,' referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea. Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea foundation chair in Korea Studies at the Brookings Institution, said it would not be surprising for China 'to hope for a DP to come back in office,' as during the previous Moon Jae-in government before Yoon, because the main opposition party is 'more open to engaging China.' Yeo said that based on President-elect Donald Trump's key Cabinet position picks, such as Representative Mike Waltz for national security adviser and Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, both viewed as China hawks, countering China will be a key focus, and good ties between Seoul and Tokyo would be 'desirable.' At the same time, Trump’s preference to deal bilaterally rather than with alliances, makes the future of the trilateral ties a bit uncertain, Yeo said. 'I don’t think the Trump administration may be as active as the Biden administration was in trying to orchestrate and encourage alliances to work together,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-leadership-crisis-jeopardizes-us-efforts-to-counter-china/7895633.html	2024-12-09T21:18:00-08:00	
6 Guatemalans charged with human smuggling in deadly 2021 Mexico crash	AUSTIN, Texas — Six Guatemalans were arrested in Guatemala and in Texas Monday on human smuggling charges linked to a 2021 semitrailer truck crash in Mexico that killed more than 50 migrants, authorities said. The truck had been packed with at least 160 migrants, many of them Guatemalans, when it crashed into a support for a pedestrian bridge in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of the southern state of Chiapas. The arrests were announced on the three-year anniversary of the accident. According to an indictment unsealed Monday in Laredo, Texas, Guatemalan authorities arrested Tomas Quino Canil, 36; Alberto Marcario Chitic, 31; Oswaldo Manuel Zavala Quino, 24; and Josefa Quino Canil de Zavala, 42. Another man, Jorge Agapito Ventura, was arrested at his home in Cleveland, Texas, U.S. authorities said. Guatemalan officials noted a sixth arrest. A sixth name listed on the U.S. federal indictment was blacked out. The accused were charged with conspiracy, placing life in jeopardy, causing serious bodily injury, and resulting in death. It was unclear late Monday if those arrested had attorneys in the United States who could comment on their behalf. Justice Department officials did not immediately respond to an email Monday night. The indictment charges them with conspiring to smuggle migrants from Guatemala through Mexico to the U.S. for payment. In some cases that involved smuggling unaccompanied children, the defendants would provide scripts of what to say if apprehended, the indictment said. The smugglers would move migrants on foot, inside microbuses, cattle trucks and tractor trailers, the indictment said. It said the smugglers would use Facebook Messenger to request and deliver identification documents to the migrants to get them into the U.S. 'The tragedy that occurred three years ago today in Chiapas is further proof that human smugglers are ruthless, callous and dangerous, intending migrants should not believe their lives,' said U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. Guatemalan Interior Minister Francisco Jiménez said the defendants were part of a criminal structure called Los Quino, and that U.S. officials had requested extradition of the four arrested in Guatemala. Authorities executed 15 search warrants across Guatemala on Monday, Jiménez said. He said they had the support of the U.S. and Mexican governments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guatemalans-charged-with-human-smuggling-in-deadly-2021-mexico-crash/7895630.html	2024-12-09T21:00:13-08:00	
Polygamous sect leader sentenced to 50 years in child sex scheme	PHOENIX — A polygamist religious leader who claimed more than 20 spiritual 'wives' including 10 underage girls was sentenced to 50 years in prison on Monday for coercing girls as young as 9 years old to submit to criminal sex acts with him and other adults, and for scheming to kidnap them from protective custody. Samuel Bateman, whose small group was an offshoot of the sect once led by Warren Jeffs, had pleaded guilty to a yearslong scheme to transport girls across state lines for his sex crimes, and later to kidnap some of them from protective custody. Under the agreement, Bateman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit transportation of a minor for sexual activity, which carries a sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment, and one count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, which is punishable by up to life imprisonment. He was sentenced to 50 years on each count, to be served concurrently. The rest of the charges were dismissed as part of the agreement. Authorities say that Bateman, 48, tried to start an offshoot of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints based in the neighboring communities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah. The fundamentalist group, also known as FLDS, split from the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after Mormons officially abandoned polygamy in 1890. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Brnovich sentenced Bateman after hearing statements in court by three teenage girls about the trauma they still struggle to overcome. Although they gave their names in court, The Associated Press does not name victims of sexual crime, and some appeared to still be minors. 'You should not have the opportunity to be free and never have the opportunity to be around young women, ' Brnovich told Bateman, noting that for a man of his age the 50-year sentence was effectively a life sentence. 'You took them from their homes, from their families and made them into sex slaves,' the judge said. 'You stripped them of their innocence and childhood.' A short competency hearing that was closed to the public was held just before sentencing to discuss a doctor's assessment of Bateman's mental health. The defense had argued that Bateman could have benefited from a maximum of 20 years of psychiatric treatment behind bars before being released. The girls told the court, sometimes addressing Bateman himself, how they grappled to develop relationships in high school, among other struggles. Now living with foster families, they said they had received much support from trusted adults outside their community. After the sentencing, the teens hugged and wept quietly. They were escorted out of court by a half dozen men and women in jackets with the slogan 'Bikers Against Child Abuse,' a group dedicated to protecting children from what it calls dangerous people and situations. A woman who sat with the teens said no one in the group would have a comment. There was no one in the courtroom who appeared to be a supporter of Bateman. The alleged practice of sect members sexually abusing girls whom they claim as spiritual 'wives' has long plagued the FLDS. Jeffs was convicted of state charges in Texas in 2011 involving sexual assaults of his underage followers. Bateman was one of Jeffs' trusted followers and declared himself, like Jeffs, to be a 'prophet' of the FLDS. Jeffs denounced Bateman in a written 'revelation' sent to his followers from prison, and then tried to start his own group. In 2019 and 2020, insisting that polygamy brings exaltation in heaven and that he was acting on orders from the 'Heavenly Father,' Bateman began taking female adults and children from his male followers and proclaiming them to be his 'wives,' the plea agreement said. While none of these 'marriages' were legally or ceremonially recognized, Bateman acknowledged that each time he claimed another 'wife,' it marked the beginning of his illicit sexual contact with the woman or girl. Federal agents said Bateman demanded that his followers confess publicly for any indiscretions and he imposed punishments that ranged from public shaming to sexual activity, including requiring that some male followers atone for their 'sins' by surrendering their own wives and daughters to him. Bateman traveled extensively between Arizona, Utah, Colorado and Nebraska and regularly coerced underage girls into his criminal sexual activity, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said. Recordings of some of his sex crimes were transmitted across state lines via electronic devices. Bateman was arrested in August 2022 by state police as he drove through Flagstaff, Arizona, pulling a trailer. Someone had alerted authorities after spotting small fingers reaching through the slats of the door. Inside the trailer, which had no ventilation, they found a makeshift toilet, a sofa, camping chairs and three girls, 11 to 14 years old. Bateman posted bond but was soon arrested again, accused of obstructing justice in a federal investigation into whether children were being transported across state lines for his sex crimes. Authorities also took nine children from Bateman's home in Colorado City into protective custody. Eight of the children later escaped from foster care in Arizona, and were found hundreds of miles away in Washington state, in a vehicle driven by one of the adult 'wives.' Bateman also admitted his involvement in the kidnapping plot. Federal prosecutors noted that Bateman's plea agreement was contingent on all of his co-defendants also pleading guilty. It also called for restitution of as much as $1 million per victim, and for all assets to be immediately forfeited. Seven of Bateman's adult 'wives' have been convicted of crimes related to coercing children into sexual activity or impeding the investigation into Bateman. Some acknowledged they also coerced girls to become Bateman's spiritual 'wives,' witnessed Bateman having criminal sexual activity with girls, participated in illicit group sex involving children, or joined in kidnapping them from foster care. Another woman is scheduled to be tried Jan. 14 on charges related to the kidnappings. Two Colorado City brothers also face 10 years to life at their sentencings, on Dec. 16 and Dec. 20, after being convicted in October of charges including interstate travel to persuade or coerce a child to engage in sexual activity. Authorities say one bought Bateman two Bentley automobiles, while the other bought him a Range Rover. In court records, lawyers for some of Bateman's 'wives' painted a bleak picture of their clients' religious upbringings. One said his client was raised in a religious cult that taught sexual activity with children was acceptable and that she was duped into 'marrying' Bateman. Another said her client was given to Bateman by another man as if she were a piece of property, feeling she had no choice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polygamous-sect-leader-sentenced-to-50-years-in-child-sex-scheme/7895626.html	2024-12-09T20:39:24-08:00	
Biden under pressure to commute federal death sentences	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden is facing growing calls to commute the death sentences of the more than three dozen federal inmates on Death Row before Donald Trump returns to the White House. Trump resumed federal executions during his last term in office, overseeing 13 by lethal injection during his final six months in power, more than any U.S. leader in 120 years. Biden campaigned for the White House as an opponent of the death penalty and the Justice Department issued a moratorium on its use at the federal level after he became president. During his re-election campaign against Kamala Harris, Trump spoke frequently of expanding the use of capital punishment to include migrants who kill American citizens and drug and human traffickers. There had been no federal inmates put to death in the United States since 2003 until Trump resumed federal executions in July 2020. A coalition of death penalty opponents submitted a letter to Biden on Monday asking him to commute federal death sentences to life in prison without parole. 'The only irreversible action you can take to prevent President-elect Trump from renewing his execution spree, as he has vowed to do, is commuting the death sentences of those on federal death row now,' the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and more than 130 other organizations said. 'Your ability to change the course of the death penalty in the United States will be a defining, legacy-building moment in American history,' they said. There are currently 40 prisoners — all men — convicted of federal crimes awaiting execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, including several in high-profile cases. They include: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 31, the 'Boston Bomber,' who was sentenced to death for the murders of two people in the April 15, 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon. Dylann Roof, 30, an avowed white supremacist who shot dead nine Black parishoners during a June 17, 2015 Bible study meeting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. Robert Bowers, 52, an anti-Semitic Pennsylvania man who killed 11 Jewish worshippers during an October 27, 2018 attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. 'Commuted, changed' Nine of the inmates on federal Death Row were convicted of murdering fellow prisoners while one killed a prison guard. Four were sentenced to death for murders committed during bank robberies. There are also four inmates on the military's Death Row including Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who shot dead 13 people during a rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009. The U.S. military has not carried out an execution since 1961. Pope Francis, in his Sunday address at the Vatican, asked the crowd to pray for Death Row inmates in the United States and said their sentences should 'be commuted, changed.' Biden, who controversially pardoned his son Hunter this month for tax and gun crimes, has been barraged with clemency appeals from other religious leaders, former state and federal prison officials, ex-prosecutors and dozens of relatives of murder victims. Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, a former top executive at Facebook, were among the signatories of a letter from top business leaders urging Biden to exercise his clemency power. According to The Washington Post, the White House is considering 'taking steps to commute at least some federal death sentences.' 'No decision has been made, however, about the breadth or scope of such a possible move, including whether to do it at all,' the newspaper said. There have been 23 executions in the United States in 2024 and two more are scheduled before the end of the year. The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while six others — Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee — have moratoriums in place. Federal executions are carried out by lethal injection at a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. The last one was on January 16, 2021, four days before Trump left office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-under-pressure-to-commute-federal-death-sentences/7895615.html	2024-12-09T20:15:12-08:00

UnitedHealthcare CEO was likely killed with a ghost gun that can be made at home	WASHINGTON — The brazen killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was likely carried out with a ghost gun, one of the nearly untraceable weapons that can be made a home, police said Monday. A ghost gun is a firearm without a serial number, and police believe the one used in last week's shooting of Brian Thompson may have been made with a 3D printer. It was capable of firing 9 mm rounds. The man arrested in the crime, Luigi Mangione, also had a sound suppressor, or silencer, police said. Ghost guns have increasingly turned up at crime scenes around the U.S. in recent years. Here's a look at the weapons and efforts to regulate them: What are ghost guns? The firearms are privately made and have no serial numbers. Generally, firearms manufactured by licensed companies must have serial numbers — usually displayed on the frame of the gun — that allow officials to trace the gun back to the manufacturer, the firearms dealer and original purchaser. Ghost guns, however, are made of parts that the owner can assemble together. The critical component in building an untraceable gun is what is known as the lower receiver. Some are sold in do-it-yourself kits, and the receivers are typically made from metal or polymer. They include semiautomatic handguns and rifles. Are they legal? It is legal in the U.S. to build a firearm for personal use. Until about two years ago, ghost gun kits were available online that allowed people to assemble the weapons at home without background checks or age verification. As police found more ghost guns at crime scenes, the Biden administration moved to add age requirements and background checks in 2022. Buying one now is more like purchasing a regular gun at a gun shop. The number of ghost guns has since flattened out or declined in several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore, according to court documents. But gun groups have challenged the regulation in court. The Supreme Court heard a case in October and seemed likely to uphold the regulation. It hasn’t yet handed down a ruling. Where else have ghost guns been used? The number of ghost guns recovered by law enforcement increased from 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 in 2021, according to Justice Department data. However, traditional guns are still used far more often in crimes. Ghost guns really popped into the public consciousness in 2013 when John Zawahri opened fire on the campus of Santa Monica College in California, killing six people, including his father and brother. Zawahri, who was later shot and killed by police, had assembled an AR-15-style weapon after failing a background check at a gun dealer. A gunman who killed his wife and four others in Northern California in 2017 built his own weapon to skirt a court order prohibiting him from owning firearms. In 2019, a teenager used a homemade handgun to fatally shoot two classmates and wound three others at a school in suburban Los Angeles. A mass shooting carried out with an AR-15-style ghost gun left five people dead in Philadelphia in 2023. A ghost gun was also used in a shooting that critically wounded two kindergartners at a tiny religious school in Northern California last week, police said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unitedhealthcare-ceo-was-likely-killed-with-a-ghost-gun-that-can-be-made-at-home-/7894581.html	2024-12-09T18:22:22-08:00	
Biden memorializes painful past of Native people	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Monday presided over his final White House Tribal Nations Summit by reaching into the nation’s dark past and establishing a new national monument to honor the suffering of thousands of Native children and their families in federal boarding schools in the last century. His proclamation starts a three-year clock to design a monument to be placed at the flagship Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School opened in 1879, with the stated mission to 'kill the Indian' to 'save the Man.' Schools like this removed children from their families and forced them to speak English, wear non-native clothing and eschew tribal customs. Earlier this year, Biden described the treatment of thousands of Native children at government boarding schools as 'a blot' on the nation’s history. 'The federal government mandated — mandated — removal of children from their families and tribes, launching what's called the federal Indian boarding school era, over a 150-year span, 150 years from the early 1800s to 1970 — one of the most horrific chapters in American history,' he said earlier this year. 'We should be ashamed.' The most recent U.S. Census found that the population of those who consider themselves wholly or partly Native is upward of nearly 9 million. The U.S. Department of the Interior says it serves 1.9 million American Indian and Alaska Natives, many in sovereign lands. That’s a shadow of the population that historians say thrived on the continent before European colonization. Native Americans were only granted universal U.S. citizenship in 1924 with the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act. Activists like Elveda Martinez of the Walker River Paiute Tribe say it’s remarkable how recent this history of dispossession and discrimination is. 'It's within our generation that Natives finally all had the right to vote,' she said. 'So, that's still a big thing now. We always tell people, you know, it was our parents and people in that generation that fought for the right to vote.' As a group, Native residents have the highest poverty rate in the country, and their youth lag behind other demographics in education, according to a study by a bipartisan research group. On Monday, Biden detailed his administration’s efforts to improve the livelihoods of descendants of the nation’s pre-colonial populations and to give communities more say, such as designating conservation areas. But he stressed that honoring the past is the way forward.'By making the Carlisle Indian School a national monument, we make clear what great nations do,' he said. 'We don’t erase history. We acknowledge it and learn from it, so we never repeat it again.' Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, praised Biden’s work. 'President Biden has been the best president for Indian Country in my lifetime,' she said. 'This is a president and an administration that truly sees Indigenous people and has worked tirelessly to address the issues in Indian Country that have long been underfunded or outright ignored.' As a sign of her esteem, Haaland, who is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, draped Biden in a personalized parting gift: a black-and-white version of a blanket designed by Pueblo artist Pat Pruitt, who says the motif, which depicts thunder and lightning in the desert, is meant to evoke 'the feeling of that calm before the storm that is filled with electricity and sound.' But as one tribe made clear Monday, America’s Native people are not a monolith. The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians lashed out at the Biden administration for what the group says is a 'lack of tribal consultation' over a wave of proposed off-reservation casinos, including a recent approval for Oregon’s first off-reservation casino. 'It is performative to celebrate an administration’s contributions to Indian Country when the actions tell a very different story,' Cow Creek Umpqua Tribal Chairman Carla Keene said in a statement sent to VOA on Monday. 'We have been dismissed and ignored about policy that will devastate our social, cultural, and economic livelihood. There is time to do the right thing and put a stop to the pending decisions that will irreversibly harm Tribes across the Pacific Northwest and West Coast, which is a backwards step in American history, not forward.' The principal chief of the large and powerful Cherokee nation — which includes about 450,000 people — issued a careful, diplomatic statement Monday advocating for the summit to continue under the next administration. 'I’m looking forward to attending the White House Tribal Nation’s summit this week,' Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. posted on Facebook. 'Other than when the summit was not held (2017-2020), I’ve been attending since 2013. I hope it is a productive engagement and I hope it continues on in future years.' President-elect Donald Trump indicated that he views Native issues as intertwined with energy generation, by naming North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as Interior secretary, while also serving as 'White House energy czar.' 'We're going to do things with energy and with land interior that is going to be incredible,' he said, but did not elaborate. As president, Trump angered Indigenous activists by lifting a ban on the Keystone XL pipeline that cuts through sovereign native lands on its path south from Canada to Texas. Biden revoked Trump’s permit for the oil pipeline on the first day of his term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-memorializes-painful-past-of-native-people/7894575.html	2024-12-09T18:01:50-08:00

US wary of fissures, fragmentation as Syria looks to rebuild	washington — U.S. diplomats and military officials have intensified their outreach to groups vying to chart a new course for Syria, as well as to Syria’s neighbors, in an effort to ensure the fall of the regime of former President Bashar Assad does not give way to a more unstable and dangerous future. A number of key meetings took place Monday in Jordan, where senior U.S. diplomatic officials held consultations with their Jordanian counterparts following similar meetings a day earlier in Doha, Qatar. And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more diplomatic missions are in the works. 'Senior officials from this department are fanning out through the region as we speak, working with counterparts on how the United States can help support the Syrian people as they decide their own path for the future' Blinken told an audience at the State Department Monday. 'This moment presents a historic opportunity, but it also carries considerable risks,' he said. 'History shows how quickly moments of promise can descend into conflict and violence.' As evidence of the U.S. concern, the commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, also engaged with allies in the region. General Michael 'Erik' Kurilla met in Amman with Major General Yousef Al-Hunaiti, the chairman of the Jordanian Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to a U.S. readout, Kurilla promised U.S. support for Jordan should the situation in Syria deteriorate. Other U.S. officials on Monday likewise emphasized the need for a calm and orderly transition in Syria. 'We want to make sure that our allies are safe and secure,' U.S. Deputy United Nations Ambassador Robert Wood told reporters at the U.N. in New York. 'We want to make sure that there isn't a humanitarian catastrophe,' Wood said. 'So, we're going to be working over the coming days and weeks to try to make sure that we can ensure all of those things happen.' But officials at the State Department and the Pentagon caution there is ample reason to worry that hopes for a better future for the Syrian people could disintegrate, with differences leading to new waves of violence and even migrations out of Syria. They say that while the words and actions of Syrian rebel leaders, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s Abu Mohammed al-Golani, seem promising, pledges for a new, inclusive government will be tested if tensions between rival groups continue to simmer or escalate. And the State Department officials said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terror group that grew out of the al-Qaida terror group’s Syrian affiliate before cutting ties, has yet to show that it deserves to have the terror designation removed. So too, there are concerns about the Islamic State terror group, which commands between 2,500 and 5,000 fighters across Syria and Iraq, and which has been growing stronger in recent months. 'ISIS will try to use this period to reestablish its capabilities, to create safe havens,' Blinken said Monday, using an acronym for the terror group, also known as IS or Daesh. 'We are determined not to let that happen.' U.S. allies on the ground in Syria, however, warn IS has already begun ramping up its attacks, seeking to take advantage of the collapse of Syrian regime forces over the past week. 'We are worried,' the U.S. representative for the political wing of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) told VOA, pointing to an uptick in attacks across northeastern Syria. 'They are targeting our internal security forces,' said Syrian Democratic Council representative Sinam Mohamad, noting efforts by IS sleeper cells in places like Raqqa, Deir el-Zour and even Hasakah, home to one of the SDF-run prisons holding thousands of IS fighters captured after the fall of the terror group’s self-declared caliphate in 2019. She also warned of increased activity, and new escape attempts at al-Hol, a displaced persons camp that holds tens of thousands of IS wives and other family members, many of them children. Mohamad praised U.S. forces for lending support to the SDF but said there are indications of additional IS activity in areas abandoned by Syrian regime forces along with their Russian and Iranian allies. U.S. military officials hope a series of airstrikes, carried out Sunday at five locations across central Syria, will help to blunt the threat. The strikes are 'a way to certainly prevent them [IS] from taking advantage of the dynamics within Syria and the current situation,' said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, briefing reporters at the Pentagon Monday. But U.S. counterterrorism officials have long warned that IS is capable of demonstrating both patience and resilience and is well-aware of the types of fissures that could still serve to derail a transition government in Syria. And perhaps nowhere are those tensions more palpable at the moment than in Syria’s northeast, where fighting has broken out between Kurdish militias and the Syrian National Army, or SNA, a coalition of Turkish-backed militias. Turkey has defended various efforts to strike at the SDF, claiming it is led by fighters with the People's Protection Units, or YPG, a Syrian-based offshoot of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), labeled by both Ankara and Washington as a terrorist organization. The SDC and SDF, in return, have accused the SNA of attacking civilians in Manbij, and other nearby areas. 'The United States, now, they are trying to stop this,' the SDC’s Mohamad told VOA. 'There is some negotiation,' she said. 'We hope they [the U.S.] can succeed in that.' The State Department Monday said it has been clear with both sides, echoing warnings from the SDF that ongoing clashes could hurt the ability of the U.S.-backed force to contain IS. 'We don't want to see an escalation,' said spokesperson Matthew Miller of the clashes between Kurdish groups and the SNA. 'We don't want to see anyone take advantage of this period of instability to try, and further their own position.'

Report: Media mogul Murdoch fails in bid to change family trust	Rupert Murdoch has lost a bid to change his family trust to consolidate control of his media empire in the hands of his son Lachlan, The New York Times reported Monday, citing a sealed court document. Nevada Commissioner Edmund Gorman concluded in a decision filed Saturday that Murdoch and his eldest son, Lachlan, who is the head of Fox News parent Fox Corp and News Corp, had acted in 'bad faith' in their effort to amend the irrevocable trust, the Times reported. The court docket indicates Gorman issued a recommendation or order Saturday, but the document is not publicly available. The trust currently would divide control of the company equally among Murdoch’s four oldest children — Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence — after his death. Rupert Murdoch proposed amending the family trust to solidify Lachlan's leadership of the family's media empire after his death, and block any interference by three of Lachlan’s siblings, who are politically moderate, the Times reported. Under one scenario, three of the heirs could technically outvote a fourth, setting up a battle over the future of the powerful media outlets, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox and is sole chair of News Corp. In his opinion, Gorman said, the plan to change the trust was a 'carefully crafted charade' to 'permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s executive roles' inside the empire 'regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries' of the family trust, the Times said. A lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, Adam Streisand, said they were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal, the Times reported. The commissioner's ruling is subject to approval by a district judge, whose decision could be challenged in court. The trust was set up in Nevada, which is prized for its strict confidentiality rules. A spokesperson for Rupert Murdoch, 93, could not immediately be reached for comment. Lachlan Murdoch did not respond to an email seeking comment. Lachlan's siblings issued a joint statement expressing hope that the family would focus on mending relationships. 'We welcome Commissioner Gorman’s decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members,' the siblings said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-media-mogul-murdoch-fails-in-bid-to-change-family-trust-/7893557.html	2024-12-09T16:56:40-08:00	
Haiti gang massacres around 180 people, targeting elderly	Around 180 people were killed over the weekend in Haiti's Cite Soleil area, Haiti's prime minister's office said Monday, after attacks that an NGO said were ordered by a gang leader who suspected his child had been made ill using witchcraft. 'A red line has been crossed,' the office said in a statement, adding it would 'mobilize all forces to track down and annihilate' those responsible, including Wharf Jeremie gang leader Monel 'Mikano' Felix, whom it accused of planning the attack. It said the victims were mostly elderly. The National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH), an NGO in Haiti that monitors state institutions and promotes human rights education, said Sunday at least 110 people — all aged over 60 — had been killed in Cite Soleil over the weekend. It later said the death toll could be higher and cited witnesses as saying that 'mutilated bodies were burned in the streets, including several young individuals who were killed [while] attempting to save residents.' RNDDH said Felix had ordered the violence after his child became sick, and after seeking advice from a voodoo priest who accused elderly people in the area of harming the child through witchcraft. The group said Felix's child had died Saturday afternoon. Reuters was not able to independently verify the events outlined by RNDDH. Felix did not immediately comment on the accusations. Cite Soleil, a densely populated slum by the port of the capital Port-au-Prince, is among the poorest and most violent areas of Haiti. Tight gang control, including the restriction of mobile phone use, has limited residents' ability to share information about the massacre. The government, riven with political infighting, has struggled to contain the gangs' growing power in and around the capital. The armed groups are accused of indiscriminate killings, gang rapes, ransom kidnappings and fueling critical food shortages. In October, the Gran Grif gang took responsibility for the killing of at least 115 people in Pont-Sonde, a town in Haiti's breadbasket Artibonite region. They said it was retaliation for residents helping a self-defense group hinder their road toll operations. Calls for U.N. peacekeepers A U.N.-backed security mission was requested by Haiti in 2022 and approved a year later but so far has just partially deployed and remains deeply under-resourced. Haitian leaders have called for the Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support mission to be converted into a U.N. peacekeeping force to ensure it is better supplied, but the plan stalled amid opposition from China and Russia in the Security Council. Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general, said the weekend's death count was at least 184, including 127 elderly people. 'The secretary-general reiterates his pressing call to Member States to provide the Multinational Security Support mission the financial and logistical support required to successfully assist the Haitian National Police,' he said. A White House security spokesperson echoed the call for urgent international support for the mission and said the United States was 'appalled.' Dujarric also called for an acceleration of the political transition within Haiti. Haiti's transitional government has said it plans to hold long-awaited elections in 2025, provided there is sufficient security for a free and fair vote. The security situation has, however, continued to deteriorate, and many countries have yet to deliver on pledges of support. Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, urged countries to improve efforts to stop arms trafficking to Haiti. The U.N. estimates the gangs' increasingly modern arsenals are largely trafficked from the United States. 'These latest killings bring the death toll just this year in Haiti to a staggering 5,000 people,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-gang-massacres-around-180-people-targeting-elderly/7893554.html	2024-12-09T16:47:11-08:00	
Syrian refugees in Turkey gather at border crossings to return to their homeland	KILIS / IZMIRl, TURKEY — Hundreds of Syrian refugees lined up Monday at Turkey’s southern Oncupinar border crossing in Kilis province to return to their homeland after the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Syrians who spoke to VOA Turkish said they were happy to soon be back in their country, as they saw a new beginning there. Muhammed Taha, who crossed into Turkey in 2014, was among the Syrians in line at the crossing to return to his hometown of Aleppo with his five children, four of whom were born in Turkey. 'Justice has been served,' Taha said. 'I could not return to my country before because of the war. Thank God, the war is over. The clashes have ended.' He added, 'I will apply to go to my hometown, Aleppo, with my five children soon. I believe we will be more peaceful there. I will be reunited with my relatives and friends there.' Many Syrians expressed their wish to reconstruct their war-torn country after their return. Ahmed Mansur, who came to the border crossing from southern Gaziantep province with his parents and family of four, thanked Turkey for hosting them during the war in Syria, but stated that this is the time to return home. 'Assad destroyed our country. Thank God, he fled in the end. We will start everything from scratch in our country. We will repair our destroyed homes and try to hold on to life by working there,' Mansur told VOA Turkish. Before returning, Syrians must hand over to authorities the temporary identity cards they received in Turkey and sign the voluntary return form. Refugees from Aleppo Most of the Syrians at the border crossing were from Aleppo, which the rebel forces, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, captured in a lightning offensive last week. According to Turkey’s Presidency of Migration Management, 2.9 million Syrians were under temporary protection as of November 28, as Turkey does not give refugee status to Syrians, citing its geographical limitation to the 1951 Geneva Convention. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said Monday that over 1.2 million Syrians in Turkey are from Aleppo. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Monday that Turkey opened its Yayladagi border gate, which has been closed since 2013, to facilitate the safe and voluntary return of Syrians. 'We will also manage the processing of immigrants' voluntary returns in a way befitting our hosting,' Erdogan said. Concerns While the collapse of the 61-year-long Baathist regime was widely celebrated by Syrians in Turkey, returning is no longer that easy for some after more than a decade living abroad. Emine Afare, 36, is among the refugees who are undecided about returning. After leaving Aleppo in 2013, she now resides in the Basmane district of Izmir, which hosts a large Syrian and African immigrant community. Afare said she could not describe the joy she felt at the release of many of her relatives who were imprisoned by the Assad regime. However, she said she believed that a strong social and economic infrastructure was needed after the yearslong conflict. 'According to the news we received from Aleppo, 20% of education and health services are operating. It will take at least two years to complete this. Electricity and water must be provided. Our homes, hospitals and schools must be rebuilt. This requires a lot of work. I will then decide to return,' she told VOA Turkish. The mother of two children who were born in Turkey, Afare said her 8-year-old daughter does not speak Arabic, and Syria is now a foreign country to her. 'There is a generation born in Turkey. Since 2011, this generation has received education in Turkey and adopted Turkish culture. They are now foreigners to Syria,' she said. 'We are thinking about how these children will integrate into Syria.' Muhammed Salih Ali, head of the Association for Solidarity with Syrian Refugees in Izmir, reiterated Afare’s concerns about the younger generation. 'Social adaptation is now required for them to return to Syria. It is very difficult for this generation to return. But if their family has their own land, they will have to go with them. But they will have a hard time,' he said. Ali, who fled Al-Hasakah and settled in Turkey 25 years ago, believes that the number of people returning to Syria will increase from now on. 'I have waited for this moment for 25 years. I cannot describe my happiness that this oppression has ended,' he said. Ali thinks that more than half of the Syrian refugees in Turkey will return to Syria, as many of them are landowners. But he emphasized that there is a dire need for help to reconstruct the country. 'Syria alone does not have the means to do this. The Syrians will return. The people will start over, but many means need to be provided. We are calling on every country, asking them to help us,' he said.

Mozambique political unrest disrupts Eswatini sugar exports	Mbabane, Eswatini — In the wake of political turmoil and protests in Mozambique, Eswatini’s sugar industry has faced disruptions to supply chains and exports and has had to find alternative routes for its products. Eswatini's sugar industry depends heavily on a terminal at the port of Maputo, Mozambique, to send its raw sugar to the European Union and the United States. This terminal, jointly owned by Eswatini, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, has been vital for the country's sugar industry since the mid-1990s. Nontobeko Mabuza, with the Eswatini Sugar Association (ESA), warned that the unrest in Mozambique poses a grave threat to Eswatini's exports to regional and European markets. 'The option, however, is for us to move the sugar via the Durban [South Africa] port, but this would come at an additional cost,' Mabuza said. 'For consistency and safe delivery, our customers might choose to migrate to using the Durban port as the port from which we ship. This would, however, strain the transport infrastructure and potentially, as I said earlier, come at an additional cost, and it would possibly also cause longer turnaround times as the shipments are diverted' from Mozambique to South Africa. In 2023, the ESA generated $305 million from more than 26,000 tons of sugar exports to the United States and other markets via the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act. But according to Bhekizwe Maziya, chief executive of the national agriculture marketing board, Mozambique’s instability caused severe traffic congestion and delays at the borders with Eswatini. What was mainly happening, Maziya said, was closure of the Lebombo border post between South Africa and Mozambique. 'So transport had to be rerouted to Eswatini from South Africa and en route to Mozambique. The effects were the congestions at our borders and the delays that were experienced by importers and exporters.' The protests led by opposition presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane, who says he won the recent election, have resulted in a complete shutdown of traffic on Mozambique’s major roads, plus violent confrontations with security forces that have left more than 100 people dead. Mozambican political activist Solomon Mondlane said the instability could have far-reaching consequences for southern African economies as landlocked countries like Eswatini struggle to find other export routes for their goods. 'With the unrest showing no signs of abating, it is essential for neighboring countries to assess their own trade dependency on Mozambique and identify alternative routes if necessary to mitigate potential disruptions,' Mondlane said. Political analyst Sibusiso Nhlabatsi said the Southern African Development Community must strengthen its conflict management strategies in the face of internal conflicts within member states, like Mozambique, by establishing a framework for accountability and ensuring member states are responsible for their impact on regional stability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-political-unrest-disrupts-eswatini-sugar-exports-/7893536.html	2024-12-09T16:18:48-08:00	
Ethnic armed group claims capture of key western Myanmar border	BANGKOK — One of the most powerful ethnic minority armed groups battling Myanmar’s army has claimed the capture of the last army outpost in the strategic western town of Maungdaw, gaining full control of the 271-kilometer (168-mile) border with Bangladesh. The capture by the Arakan Army makes the group’s control of the northern part of Rakhine state complete and marks another advance in its bid for self-rule there. Rakhine has become a focal point for Myanmar’s nationwide civil war, in which pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic minority armed forces seeking autonomy battle the country’s military rulers, who took power in 2021 after the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told The Associated Press by text message from an undisclosed location late Monday that his group had seized the last remaining military outpost in Maungdaw on Sunday. Outpost commander Brigadier General Thurein Tun was captured while attempting to flee the battle, Khaing Thukha said. The situation in Maungdaw could not be independently confirmed, with access to the internet and mobile phone services in the area mostly cut off. Myanmar’s military government did not immediately comment. Maungdaw, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, has been the target since June of an Arakan Army offensive. The group captured Paletwa and Buthidaung, two other towns on the border with Bangladesh, earlier this year. Since November 2023, the Arakan Army has gained control of 11 of Rakhine’s 17 townships, along with one in neighboring Chin state. Ann, a town in Rakhine that hosts the strategically important military headquarters overseeing the western part of the country, appears to be on the verge of falling entirely to the Arakan Army. The group said in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app late Friday that it had taken more than 30 military outposts, except the army’s western command, which controls Rakhine and the southern part of neighboring Chin state, as well as the country’s territorial waters in the Bay of Bengal. Recent fighting in Rakhine has raised fears of a revival of organized violence against members of the Muslim Rohingya minority, similar to what drove at least 740,000 members of their community in 2017 to flee to neighboring Bangladesh for safety. The Arakan Army, which is the military wing of the Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group in Rakhine state, where they are the majority and seek autonomy from Myanmar’s central government, denies the allegations, though witnesses have described the group’s actions to the AP and other media. Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations, but they are widely regarded by many in the country’s Buddhist majority, including members of the Rakhine minority, as having illegally migrated from Bangladesh. The Rohingya face a great amount of prejudice and are generally denied citizenship and other basic rights. The border between Myanmar and Bangladesh extends from land to the Naf River and offshore in the Bay of Bengal. The Arakan Army said Sunday it had ordered the suspension of transport across the Naf River because police and local Muslims affiliated with the army were attempting to escape by boat to Bangladesh. The rebel group has been accused of major human rights violations, particularly involving its capture of the town of Buthidaung in mid-May, when it was accused of forcing an estimated 200,000 residents, largely Rohingyas, to leave, and then setting fire to most of the buildings. It was accused of attacking Rohingya civilians fleeing fighting in Maungdaw in August. The Arakan Army is also part of an armed ethnic alliance that launched an offensive in northeastern Myanmar in October last year and gained strategic territory along the border with China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethnic-armed-group-claims-capture-of-key-western-myanmar-border/7893273.html	2024-12-09T15:39:20-08:00	
Zelenskyy says he is open to negotiated end to war with Russia	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday he is open to the possibility of a diplomatic resolution to the country’s war with Russia. 'Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. No doubt, a diplomatic resolution would save more lives. We do seek it,' the Ukrainian president said Monday at a joint press conference in Kyiv with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz. Zelenskyy also said he is open to the possibility of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine to help his country end its war with Russia, a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly three years. 'But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO,' Zelenskyy said. On his Telegram channel, the Ukrainian leader said the deployment of troops to Ukraine would be a step forward for the Eastern European country’s quest to join NATO. Zelenskyy’s openness to a negotiated end to the conflict with Russia and the presence of Western troops in Ukraine coincides with Russia’s recent gains in Ukraine and the upcoming inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Trump met with Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris over the weekend. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said he plans to call U.S. President Joe Biden soon about Ukraine joining NATO. 'He is the current president, and a lot rides on his opinion. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today — while he is not yet in the White House,' Zelenskyy said. Trump has said he wants the war between Russia and Ukraine to end quickly and has called for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. However, Zelenskyy told the New York Post that while Trump wants a ceasefire, the two leaders have not discussed any details about that arrangement. Merz, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's challenger in the upcoming German election, said at the joint address with Zelenskyy that the 'basic consensus' in Germany is that Germany will continue to supply Ukraine with military aid. In his meetings with Zelenskyy, Merz did, however, note that Germany’s position on Ukraine differs from the stance that France, the U.S. and the U.K. have taken on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 'Our position is clear, as is that of my parliamentary group: We want to put your army in a position to reach military bases in Russia — not the civilian population, not the infrastructure — but the military targets from which your country is being fought,' he said. 'With this range restriction, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand behind its back,' he said. Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 18 drones that Russian forces deployed in overnight attacks. The Ukrainian air force said the intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytsky, Odesa, Poltava, Rivne, Sumy, Ternopil and Vinnytsia regions. There were no reports of casualties or major damage. Ukrainian air defenses also shot down two Russian guided missiles, the military said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday its air defenses destroyed 13 Ukrainian aerial drones. Most of the drones were shot down near the Russia-Ukraine border in the Belgorod and Rostov regions. Two of the drones were destroyed over Astrakhan, located about 200 kilometers from the border. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-says-he-is-open-to-negotiated-end-to-war-with-russia-/7893258.html	2024-12-09T15:14:20-08:00	
Unemployment continues to plague China’s youth in 2024	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — FILE - A recruiter talks with an applicant at a booth at a job fair at a shopping center in Beijing, on June 9, 2023. A record of more than one in five young Chinese are out of work, their career ambitions at least temporarily derailed by a depressed job market as the economy struggles to regain momentum after its long bout with COVID-19 Melody Xie thought 2024 would be the year for her to start the next chapter of her life as an adult in China: finding a job, getting married and eventually having children. But after sending out hundreds of resumes and failing to pass two civil service exams, the 24-year-old college graduate remains unemployed and has had no choice but to move back in with her parents who live in the southern city of Guangzhou. 'It’s been a year since I graduated from university but I have no income, no savings and no social life,' she told VOA in a written response on November 28. Like Xie, hundreds of thousands of young people in China have struggled to find ideal full-time jobs throughout 2024. While the Chinese government has introduced some fiscal measures to boost the sluggish economy in October, China’s youth unemployment remains high. Since July, China’s unemployment rate for youth between 16 and 24 has remained above 17%. While some Chinese state media outlets claim the youth unemployment rate has improved since October, the economic downturn has been exacerbating China’s unemployment problem for several years, said Dali Yang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Chicago. 'There is a backlog of youths who were supposed to be joining the labor force over the last two to three years, but they didn’t do very well in the job market,' he told VOA by phone. 'As a new cohort of youth graduating from college each year, that makes the job market very tough for the college graduates,' he added. In addition to the large number of unemployed college graduates in the job market, Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch, told VOA that poor working conditions in the country are also discouraging many educated young people in China from looking for full-time jobs. 'Many Chinese businesses will ask employees to work 12 to 16 hours a day, and they expect employees to work six or seven days a week,' Li said. 'Most young people in China are not willing to accept these jobs with tough working conditions, so that has also led to an increase in youth unemployment rate,' he told VOA by phone. Linda Liu, a 25-year-old former project manager at a tech company in China’s Guangxi province, said jobs in some rural towns in China often offer very poor pay and almost no benefits. 'After being laid off from my job at a tech company in Guangzhou at the beginning of 2023, I moved back to my hometown in Guangxi province and soon found a job there,' she told VOA in a written response. 'But since the pay was very low and I can only take four days off each month, I quit after less than six months,' Liu added. While some young Chinese are still looking for jobs, others have decided to 'lie flat' or quit without backup plans. 'After being laid off in 2021, I left Beijing and moved to the southwestern Yunnan province for two years,' Celine Liu, a 26-year-old former law firm clerk, told VOA in a recorded response. 'At the time, I wanted to pull myself away from the hectic lifestyle in the big city and figure out what I wanted to pursue in my life. But after moving back to Beijing earlier this year, I realized I could no longer adapt to life in the big city, and that has also affected my ability to do well in job interviews,' she added. The idea of 'lying flat' also denotes a laid-back lifestyle that rejects intense competition and societal expectations. In recent years, many young Chinese people have chosen to 'retire' to rural parts of the country with a lower cost of living to cope with the ongoing unemployment challenges. Some of them turn to e-commerce as a source of income. Others see quitting without a backup plan as an opportunity for them to slow down and enjoy life. 'Many young people in China, including myself, follow the typical pattern of entering college, finding a job after graduation, getting married and having children, but we often don’t know what kind of future we want,' said Victor Wang, a 26-year-old former engineer in the Chinese city of Zhejiang. 'After quitting without a backup plan, I finally have a chance to take care of my physical and mental health, and it finally feels like I’m in control of my life,' he told VOA in a written response. As the youth unemployment rate remains high in China, Ye Liu, an expert on international development at King’s College London, told VOA, young people in China might 'diversify' their work patterns. 'More young people [will engage] in freelancing, part-time employment and [work] multiple jobs,' she said. China will host an annual economic work conference this week and youth unemployment is expected to be one of several topics discussed by top Chinese officials during the event. Discussion of the topic remains sensitive on the internet in China and social media platforms. Last week, a commentary about China’s weak consumption, unemployment and 'dispirited' youth by Gao Shanwen, chief economist of China’s state-owned SDIC Securities, was removed by China’s internet censors. Additionally, access to Chinese economist Fu Peng’s video social media account was blocked after he commented on China’s weaker consumption at a conference in September. The Chinese government has introduced some measures to boost employment opportunities for college graduates, including rolling out campus recruitment activities and increasing job placement rates for unemployed youth. China’s state news outlet, People’s Daily Online, reported more than 1,000 employers from around the country 'are expected to offer more than 30,000 education-related positions.' However, Li at China Labor Watch said unless the Chinese authorities try to fundamentally improve working conditions and strengthen protection for workers’ benefits, China’s youth unemployment problem is unlikely to improve within the next five years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unemployment-continues-to-plague-china-s-youth-in-2024-/7892948.html	2024-12-09T14:29:33-08:00

At UN climate hearing, China rebuffs bid to clarify states’ legal obligations	After years of resisting international pressure to meet financial obligations for combating climate change, China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases —according to public data — is seeking to avoid legal accountability at the International Court of Justice, or ICJ, in The Hague. Since last week, more than 100 countries and organizations have presented arguments at the world’s highest court regarding states' responsibilities for climate change and whether high-emitting nations should be held accountable for the harm they have caused. Island nations and other climate-vulnerable countries — contributing little to global greenhouse gas emissions but losing territory to rising sea levels — are demanding legal accountability from polluting nations. Amid concerns that the court might establish new legal grounds for climate-related litigation, Ma Xinmin, China’s representative, argued against liability for global warming. 'GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions do not constitute internationally wrongful acts under general international law,' Ma stated. According to a report by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, more than 2,000 climate litigation cases have been filed worldwide, but most claimants face significant challenges in achieving favorable outcomes. 'If there was some finding in the advisory opinion that there was a liability that could spark litigation elsewhere presumably. 'said Alice Hill, a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former special assistant to President Barack Obama for climate change policies, in an interview with VOA. Earlier this year, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea issued a landmark advisory opinion clarifying states’ legal obligations to address marine pollution caused by climate change. This case set a significant precedent for future decisions on international legal duties. China, however, argued in a written submission that the tribunal lacked the authority to issue advisory opinions, stating, 'The Tribunal’s aforementioned reasoning is inconsistent with the rules of treaty interpretation.' In addition to China, the United States argued last week against new legal frameworks to deal with climate change obligations, marking a rare moment of alignment between the two geopolitical rivals on the global stage. 'Any other legal obligations related to climate change mitigation identified by the court should be interpreted consistently with states’ obligations under this treaty regime,' argued Margaret Taylor, a legal adviser to the U.S. State Department. 'Neither of them wants to have any new form of liability for emissions they may have caused.' said Hill of the Council on Foreign Relations. Nikki Reisch, climate and energy director at the Center for International Environmental Law, stated in an email to VOA, 'In its arguments before the ICJ, China has ultimately aligned itself with other major polluters,' she added. China benefiting from the status quo In 1992, when China was classified as a developing country under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, its historical emissions were about 41% of those of the EU. Today, China’s cumulative emissions have now caused more global warming than the 27 member states of the EU combined, according to a recent analysis by the U.K.-based climate website Carbon Brief. Under the current framework, including the agreement reached at last month’s COP29 U.N. Climate Summit, China is not required to make financial contributions to offset the global costs of its pollution but is merely 'encouraged' to do so. The country claims that since 2016, it has provided and mobilized more than $24 billion to help developing nations tackle climate challenges. Reisch noted that the weaknesses of existing climate mechanisms have worked to China’s advantage. 'The decades-old climate negotiations are a space that China can navigate to advantage, and use in a running battle with the West,' Reisch said. 'That, while rightfully focused on the historical responsibility of the world’s largest cumulative emitters, all too conveniently obscures China’s own role in the climate crisis today.' Reisch said. Ma Xinmin argued before the court that existing U.N. treaties should remain the cornerstone for determining states’ obligations. 'China hopes that the court will uphold the U.N. climate change negotiation mechanism as the primary channel for global climate governance,' Ma said. Dean Baker, senior economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, noted that China's emissions have peaked and are expected to decline in the coming years. He also highlighted the country is doing an enormous amount in terms of rapidly switching to electric vehicles and ramping up clean energy production. 'However, it does not want to tie itself to international commitments, even though it is likely to exceed any plausible green standards,' Baker told VOA in an email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-climate-hearing-china-rebuffs-bid-to-clarify-states-legal-obligations/7893190.html	2024-12-09T13:55:46-08:00	
US making 'intensive efforts' to find journalist Austin Tice in Syria	WASHINGTON — In the aftermath of the fall of the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria, U.S. officials say they continue to work to locate American journalist Austin Tice, who has been detained in the country for more than 12 years. 'There are intensive efforts under way by the United States to find Austin Tice and bring him home to his family,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Monday. He added that Roger Carstens, U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, is currently in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, working to secure Tice’s release. 'We will not rest until [Tice] is returned home safely to his loved ones,' said Miller. The rapid ousting of Assad has fostered cautious hope among Tice’s family that he will be released soon. 'What we’re hoping is that as people that are coming into Damascus are opening the prisons, that by the power of God, they’ll open the one that Austin’s in,' Tice’s mother, Debra, told VOA on Sunday. 'We’re already believing that the door is going to be open.' Citing a source vetted by the U.S. government, she told VOA that her son is being held in a prison in Damascus. Debra Tice has for years criticized the U.S. government for what she says is a long-term failure to do enough to secure her son’s release. Led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Syrian rebels declared that they had toppled Assad after seizing control of the capital, Damascus, on Sunday. The move prompted Assad to flee, ending his family’s decades-long autocratic rule, including more than 13 years of civil war. Over the past week, rebels took control of the major Syrian cities of Aleppo and Hama, and finally the capital. In those cities, thousands of prisoners have been released from prisons run by the now-deposed Assad government. The Syrian opposition plans to establish a commission to find Tice and others who disappeared under the Assad government, the coalition leader told NBC News. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States is working with regional partners to underscore to all parties the need to protect civilian populations. 'We continue to seek information about Austin Tice so that we can find him and bring him home to his family,' Blinken said Monday at the State Department. A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Tice has been held in Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or seen of him since. President Joe Biden on Sunday also reaffirmed his commitment to securing Tice’s release from Syria. 'We remain committed to returning him to his family,' he said in remarks at the White House. 'We believe he is alive. We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet,' the president added. In response to a question about a potential rescue operation to retrieve Tice, Biden said the U.S. first must identify where he is located. The FBI said Sunday that it is still offering a reward of up to $1 million for information that leads to Tice’s safe return. Tice is an award-winning freelance journalist and photographer who works for outlets that include The Washington Post, CBS and McClatchy. He is the longest-held American journalist abroad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-making-intensive-efforts-to-find-journalist-austin-tice-in-syria/7893208.html	2024-12-09T13:51:59-08:00

Despairing Syrians search notorious Sednaya prison for missing relatives	SEDNAYA, Syria — As families desperately scoured the filthy cells of Syria's forbidding Sednaya prison on Monday for any sign of long-detained relatives after its gates were flung open by rebels, hope for finding missing loved ones began to fade. Thousands of prisoners spilled out of President Bashar Assad's pitiless detention system after he was toppled on Sunday, sometimes to tearful reunions with relatives who believed they had been executed years earlier. But countless families were still trawling dark corridors and hidden cells in the labyrinthine complex for a trace of loved ones detained for attending protests, defying authorities or simply voicing discontent. Ahmed Najjar had come to Damascus from Aleppo, hoping to find his brother's two children, seized by Assad's security forces in 2012. 'We're looking. They're saying there's an underground prison,' he said. Rumors spread on Sunday that thousands more inmates were still imprisoned in underground cells that could not be reached. The White Helmets rescue organization, which for years has dug through fallen buildings after airstrikes, deployed a team. 'They had a map from a defected Syrian army officer and broke down one wall and found nothing,' said one of the rescue workers. 'They broke a second and found a door.' But by Monday afternoon there was no sign of more prisoners. Outside, Intsar al-Jaber sat waiting for news. The 45-year-old's brother and cousin were imprisoned in Sednaya, but she had not been allowed to see them since 2014. 'They told me then that my brother was dead and not to come back. [They said,] 'Your brother is a terrorist, and he died, so there's nothing for you here. Don't come.'' But she continued to wait and hope. At a mosque on the road to the prison, people were registering names and phone numbers in case imprisoned relatives were found. One woman said she had seen her son in a screenshot of released prisoners on Sunday. Rights groups have reported mass executions in Syria's prisons, and the United States said in 2017 it had identified a new crematorium at Sednaya for hanged prisoners. Torture was widely documented. Videos have emerged of some shaven-headed, near-skeletal prisoners barely able to give their names or say where they were from. Reuters was not able to verify them all, but the large-scale freeing of prisoners is not in dispute. Inside the solitary confinement cells, there was water and mud on the concrete floors. Each had a single metal bowl for food. Excrement lay around. People searching the prison rifled through discarded papers and asked former inmates if they knew of routes to other stories, while others smashed down walls or drilled into the floor searching for hidden cells. Several times, a breakthrough revealed a hidden hallway, prompting bursts of gunfire from rebels to alert the thousands waiting. Each time, a crowd dashed forward. One woman screamed, 'My son, I'm coming, I'm coming,' while another pleaded, 'God, please don't disappoint me.' A man called Mazen said Assad's police had taken 10 of his relatives including his uncle, his brother-in-law, and siblings and cousins. 'We got a video here to a secret door. I gave it to the rescue workers. They are trying to dig, but they haven't got anything yet,' he said. Fadel Abdul Ghany, who heads the Syrian Network for Human Rights, said the fact that the prison doors had simply been flung open had made it harder to trace inmates, and set genuine criminals free alongside political prisoners. 'They need to run this as well, just like they’re trying to manage other things, keep things under control,' he said. Outside the prison, where traffic once passed quickly, with passengers' eyes averted, a long queue of cars waited to get in while others scrambled across the scrubby countryside on foot and cut barbed wire fences to join the crowds searching inside. One of those, Radwan Eid, called Sednaya 'the human butcher's shop.' 'The blood that was spilled here cannot just run,' he said. 'They must be held to account.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/despairing-syrians-search-notorious-sednaya-prison-for-missing-relatives/7893119.html	2024-12-09T12:38:41-08:00	
NY police say man arrested with weapon 'consistent with' gun in killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO	NEW YORK — Police have arrested a 26-year-old man with a weapon consistent with the gun used to kill the head of the largest U.S. health insurer, New York's police commissioner said Monday. The man was taken into custody after police got a tip that he had been spotted at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. 'They also recovered clothing, including a mask consistent with those worn by our wanted individual,' Tisch said. 'Also recovered was a fraudulent New Jersey ID matching the ID our suspect used to check into his New York City hostel before the shooting incident,' Tisch said. UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday in what police said was a 'brazen, targeted' attack as he walked alone to the Hilton from a nearby hotel, where UnitedHealthcare's parent company, UnitedHealth Group, was holding its annual investor conference, police said. The shooter appeared to be 'lying in wait for several minutes' before approaching the executive from behind and opening fire, Tisch said. He used a 9 mm pistol that police said resembled the guns farmers use to put down animals without causing a loud noise. In the days since the shooting, police turned to the public for help by releasing a collection of photos and video — including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspect at a Starbucks beforehand. Photos taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan's Upper West Side showed the suspect grinning after removing his mask, police said. Investigators have suggested the gunman may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer. Ammunition found near Thompson's body bore the words 'delay,' 'deny' and 'depose,' mimicking a phrase used by insurance industry critics. The gunman concealed his identity with a mask during the shooting yet left a trail of evidence, including a backpack he ditched in Central Park, a cellphone found in a pedestrian plaza, and a water bottle and protein bar wrapper that police say he bought at Starbucks minutes before the attack. Monday's development came as dogs and divers returned to New York's Central Park while the dragnet for Thompson's killer stretched into a sixth day. Investigators have been combing the park since the Wednesday shooting and have been searching at least one of its ponds for three days. On Friday, police found the backpack that they say the killer discarded as he fled from the crime scene to an uptown bus station, where they believe he left the city on a bus. Retracing the gunman's steps using surveillance video, investigators say the shooter fled into Central Park on a bicycle, emerged from the park without his backpack and then ditched the bicycle. He then walked a couple of blocks and got into a taxi, arriving at the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, which is near the northern tip of Manhattan and offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. The FBI announced late Friday that it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, adding to a reward of up to $10,000 that the NYPD has offered. Police say they believe the suspect acted alone. Late Saturday, police released two additional photos of the suspect that appeared to be from a camera mounted inside a taxi. The first shows him outside the vehicle and the second shows him looking through the partition between the back seat and the front of the cab. In both, his face is partially obscured by a blue mask. Through the park search, the NYPD has taken steps to minimize disruption to visitors, leading to an odd juxtaposition of joggers, tourists and an active crime scene. On Monday, a small section of the park was cordoned off with blue and white police tape, giving divers searching a pond an area to change and get in the water. K-9 units sniffed leaf-covered planters between walking paths. At one point, a group of about 30 French-speaking tourists followed a guide down a path, but they couldn't go any further because of the police tape. Before turning back, many of them whipped out their phones to snap a photo of the divers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ny-police-say-man-arrested-with-weapon-consistent-with-gun-in-killing-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-/7893051.html	2024-12-09T11:41:35-08:00	
Veteran Daniel Penny is acquitted in NYC subway chokehold case over Jordan Neely's death	New York — A Marine veteran who used a chokehold on an agitated subway rider was acquitted on Monday in a death that became a prism for differing views about public safety, valor and vigilantism. A Manhattan jury cleared Daniel Penny of criminally negligent homicide in Jordan Neely's 2023 death. A more serious manslaughter charge was dismissed last week because the jury deadlocked on that count. Penny, who had shown little expression during the trial, briefly smiled as the verdict was read. Both applause and anger erupted in the courtroom, and Neely's father and two supporters were ushered out after audibly reacting. Another person also left, wailing with tears. 'It really, really hurts,' Neely's father, Andre Zachery, said outside the courthouse. 'I had enough of this. The system is rigged.' Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the Democrat whose office brought the case, said prosecutors 'followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end' and respect the verdict. There was no immediate comment from lawyers for Penny, who rushed to a waiting car after the verdict. The anonymous jury, which had started deliberating Tuesday, was escorted out of court to a van. Penny's attorneys had said he was protecting himself and other subway passengers from a volatile, mentally ill man who was making alarming remarks and gestures. The case amplified many American fault lines, among them race, politics, crime, urban life, mental illness and homelessness. Neely was Black. Penny is white. There were sometimes dueling demonstrations outside the courthouse, including Monday, when chants could be heard through the courtroom window ahead of the verdict. High-profile Republican politicians portrayed Penny as a hero while prominent Democrats attended Neely's funeral. Penny, 26, served four years in the Marines and went on to study architecture. Neely, 30, was a sometime subway performer with a tragic life story: His mother was killed and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a teenager. As a younger man, Neely did Michael Jackson tributes — complete with moonwalks — on the city's streets and subways. But Neely also struggled with mental illness after losing his mother, whose boyfriend was convicted of murdering her. He subsequently was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia, was repeatedly hospitalized, and used the synthetic cannabinoid K2 and realized it negatively affected his thinking and behavior, according to medical records seen at the trial. The drug was in his system when he died. Neely told a doctor in 2017 that being homeless, living in poverty and having to 'dig through the garbage' for food made him feel so hopeless that he sometimes thought of killing himself, hospital records show. About six years later, he boarded a subway under Manhattan on May 1, 2023, hurled his jacket onto the floor, and declared that he was hungry and thirsty and didn't care if he died or went to jail, witnesses said. Some told 911 operators that he tried to attack people or indicated he'd harm riders, and several testified that they were afraid. Neely was unarmed, with nothing but a muffin in his pocket, and didn't touch any passengers. One said he made lunging movements that alarmed her enough that she shielded her 5-year-old from him. Penny came up behind Neely, grabbed his neck, took him to the floor and 'put him out,' as the veteran told police at the scene. Passengers' video showed that at one point during the roughly six-minute hold, Neely tapped an onlooker's leg and gestured to him. Later, he briefly got an arm free. But he went still nearly a minute before Penny released him. 'He's dying,' an unseen bystander said in one video. 'Let him go!' A witness who stepped in to hold down Neely's arms testified that he told Penny to free the man, though Penny's lawyers noted the witness' story changed significantly over time. Penny told detectives shortly after the encounter that Neely threatened to kill people and the chokehold was an attempt to 'de-escalate' the situation until police could arrive. The veteran said he held on as long as he did because Neely periodically squirmed. 'I wasn't trying to injure him. I'm just trying to keep him from hurting anyone else. He's threatening people. That's what we learn in the Marine Corps,' Penny told the detectives. However, one of Penny's Marine Corps instructors testified that the veteran misused a chokehold technique he'd been taught. Prosecutors said Penny reacted far too forcefully to someone he perceived as a peril, not a person. Prosecutors also argued that any need to protect passengers quickly ebbed when the train doors opened at the next station, seconds after Penny took action. Although Penny himself told police he'd used 'a choke' or 'a chokehold,' one of his lawyers, Steven Raiser, cast it as a Marine-taught chokehold 'modified as a simple civilian restraint.' The defense lawyers contended that Penny didn't consistently apply enough pressure to kill Neely. Contradicting a city medical examiner's finding, a pathologist hired by the defense said Neely died not from the chokehold but from the combined effects of K2, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion. Penny did not testify, but several of his relatives, friends and fellow Marines did — describing him as an upstanding, patriotic and empathetic man. The manslaughter charge would have required proving that Penny recklessly caused Neely's death. Criminally negligent homicide involves engaging in serious 'blameworthy conduct' while not perceiving such a risk. Both charges were felonies and carried the possibility of prison time. While the criminal trial played out, Neely's father filed a wrongful death suit against Penny.	https://www.voanews.com/a/veteran-daniel-penny-is-acquitted-in-nyc-subway-chokehold-case-over-jordan-neely-s-death/7893029.html	2024-12-09T11:31:35-08:00

Germany, other European countries suspend decisions on Syrians' asylum bids after Assad's fall	BERLIN — Germany and several other European countries said Monday they are suspending decisions on asylum claims by Syrian nationals because of the unclear situation in their homeland following the fall of Bashar Assad. Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees said Monday that more than 47,000 applications are currently pending. It said it would reassess the situation and resume decisions once things in Syria have stabilized. Interior Ministry spokesperson Sonja Kock noted that asylum decisions take account of the circumstances of each case, which involves assessing the situation in the applicant's country. She said the migration authority has the option of prioritizing cases from other places if a situation is unclear, as it currently is in Syria. More broadly, German officials said it's too early to tell what the fall of Assad will ultimately mean for the many Syrians who sought refuge in Germany in recent years, particularly in the mid-2010s. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said it's not yet possible to predict 'concrete possibilities to return' and 'it would be unserious to speculate about this in such a volatile situation.' Her ministry said that, as of Oct. 31, there were 974,136 Syrian nationals in the country, the majority of whom had some kind of refugee or other protected status. In neighboring Austria, Chancellor Karl Nehammer also tasked his interior minister with suspending decisions on current asylum applications by Syrians, the Austria Press Agency reported. 'It is important to first establish facts, to put asylum and family reunion procedures on hold,' Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said. 'We need to wait until the dust settles, so we can see what is happening, what the next points are.' Sweden's Migration Agency said it will also pause decisions on Syrian asylum cases, arguing that it isn't possible at present to assess applicants' reasons for seeking protection. It didn't specify how long the pause would last, but said a similar decision was made in connection with the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. In Finland, the director of the Department for International Protection at the Finnish Immigration Service, Antti Lehtinen, told public broadcaster YLE that decisions have been suspended there, and he can't immediately estimate when they will resume. In Norway, the Directorate of Immigration announced a similar decision, saying that it has put asylum applications from Syria on hold 'until further notice.' France says it was considering following Germany's example. 'We are working on a suspension of ongoing asylum files from Syria,' the French Interior Ministry said. 'We should reach a decision in the coming hours.' The ministry said 450 applications from Syrian citizens are pending in France.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-and-other-european-countries-suspend-decisions-on-syrians-asylum-bids-after-assad-s-fall-/7892855.html	2024-12-09T09:52:50-08:00	
China may use rare earth to retaliate against US, say analysts	NEW DELHI — China is seizing control of critical minerals including rare earth that go into the making of electric vehicles (EVs), its batteries and a range of electronic products for civilian and military uses, according to analysts. Chinese companies in recent months have stepped up efforts to procure the minerals from diverse places like Myanmar, Vietnam, Morocco and Congo, according to several reports. China’s quest for a larger share of critical minerals is significant because it is expected to use them as retaliatory tools against the U.S. if Washington decides to dramatically increase tariffs on Chinese goods, as President-elect Donald Trump has said he would do, according to analysts who spoke to VOA. 'Rare earths are a powerful tool China will use to retaliate against the Trump administration if the tariff war escalates,' Zhiqun Zhu, political scientist at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, told VOA in an emailed interview. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce recently announced tighter control over exporting several rare earth minerals to the U.S. In early December, China banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony, which have widespread military applications, expanding curbs Beijing began rolling out in 2023. 'This is just the first step and a warning to the incoming administration in Washington. However, the doors are still open for negotiation to avoid a heightened tariff war,' Zhu said. Beatrix Keim, director of Germany-based Center Automotive Research, said, 'China controls the vast majority of refining capacity for rare earth and lithium, which is used for making batteries. China needs these minerals to feed its expanding new energy vehicle (NEV) sector.' 'At the same time, China is investing in relationships with several countries that supply these resources,' she added. China has 36% of the world’s rare earth reserves but controls 70% of the global supply from mines in different countries, according to Now-Gmbh, a government-run research organization in Germany. China also controls 77% of the refining capacity for rare earth, it said. 'Some of the other sources of rare earth [minerals] like Vietnam, Russia and Brazil could be considered allies of China,' Lourdes Casanova, director of Cornell University’s Emerging Markets Institute, told VOA in an email. The U.S. has significant rare earth resources at 1.8 million tons, according to U.S. Geological Survey estimates, besides being able to source from India and Australia, which have considerably higher resources. Chinese companies also control most of the mines producing cobalt, a crucial component of electric vehicle batteries and other electronics, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the London-based minerals research and pricing firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Congo accounts for 70% of the global supply of cobalt, according to International Shareholder Services (ISS) based in the U.S. state of Maryland. Myanmar tussle China is taking advantage of the clashes between the military junta and rebel groups in Myanmar to extend its influence in the rare earth mining areas of the country. Myanmar produces several types of rare earth minerals, including heavy rare earth elements, which are critical in so-called 'clean energy' technologies. The rebel group Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has taken control of the Myanmar town of Kanpaikti, on the country's border with China. Kanpaikti has rich sources of rare earth minerals. This means that China could potentially be the sole buyer, purchasing the minerals from rebel groups instead of the ruling military junta, Sreeparna Banerjee, an associate fellow at New Delhi’s Observer Research Foundation, told VOA. Chinese officials have been engaged in negotiations with rebel groups for a long time, she said. 'China stands to maintain its supply dominance by negotiating directly with the new power holders ... the Kachin Independence Army (KIA),' said Banerjee. 'This could potentially provide China with more favorable terms, as the KIA may prioritize securing revenue from a reliable buyer.' On the other hand, the ongoing conflict between the rebels and the military junta has resulted in disruption of supplies and a sharp rise in the prices of some rare earth materials, like dysprosium and terbium, Banerjee said. Bucknell’s Zhu said, 'It is not surprising that China has reached out to the rebels regarding continued mining and China's undisrupted purchase of rare earths from Myanmar.' Xi’s Morocco visit Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Morocco last month amid increasing investments by Chinese companies for manufacturing batteries used in electric vehicles. China’s Gotion High-Tech has committed $1.3 billion to build Africa’s first EV battery 'gigafactory' near Rabat, while two other Chinese companies are making battery components. 'I think China is planning to manufacture cars in Morocco that could be sold in Europe, which is a short distance away,' said Keim, of Center Automotive Research. 'That way, Chinese companies can evade high tariff rates in European countries.' In October, the European Union imposed heavy tariffs ranging from 17% to 35.3% for various types of China-made EVs. The EU justified the decision saying China subsidized its EV makers, allowing them to sell at extremely low prices in Europe. China has challenged the decision at the World Trade Organization, resulting in heightened trade tensions between Beijing and the EU. 'European EV makers are unable to compete with Chinese firms,' said Casanova, of Cornell University. 'The EU wants to protect its own companies, like the German Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW, the French Renault or the Italian Stellantis [formerly Fiat].'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-may-use-rare-earth-to-retaliate-against-us-say-analysts/7892877.html	2024-12-09T09:51:18-08:00	
Belarus' authoritarian ruler pardons 29 political prisoners amid claims of ongoing repression	TALLINN, Estonia — Belarus' authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, pardoned 29 political prisoners Monday amid what human rights groups describe as renewed oppression in the country. Belarusian officials did not provide the names of those released but said that the group included 11 women and 18 men. More than half of those pardoned had disabilities and chronic illnesses. 'All of those released repented for their actions and appealed to the head of state to be pardoned,' the presidential administration said in a statement. No prominent opposition figures, many of whom have not heard from for over a year, have been pardoned. They include Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, who planned to challenge Lukashenko at the ballot box in 2020 but was jailed before the vote, and Viktar Babaryka, who was also imprisoned after gaining popularity before the election. Other key figures, such as opposition activist Mikola Statkevich and lawyer Maxim Znak, who have had no contact with the outside world since the end of 2023, have also not been included. The latest announcement marks the seventh group pardon by Lukashenko in the last six months. In all, 178 political prisoners have been freed, according to Belarusian human rights group Viasna. Most were jailed following mass anti-government protests in 2020, when Lukashenko secured his sixth term in a vote widely condemned as fraudulent. The mass pardons come amid a new wave of repression as the authorities prepare to hold new presidential elections in January 2025, said Viasna spokesman Pavel Sapelka. 'Lukashenko is sending contradictory signals to the West, with twice as many people put in prison has have been pardoned,' Sapelka said. 'Repression in Belarus is still growing.' The Belarusian authorities engineer harsh conditions for political prisoners, denying them meetings with lawyers and relatives, and depriving them of medical care. At least seven political prisoners have died behind bars since 2020, according to Viasna. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for more than 30 years, is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies, allowing Russia to use his country's territory to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and to deploy some of its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-authoritarian-ruler-pardons-29-political-prisoners-amid-claims-of-ongoing-repression-/7892735.html	2024-12-09T08:36:36-08:00	
Altercation highlights chronic tension between Thailand, Myanmar over fishing rights	BANGKOK, THAILAND — A recent altercation between fishermen from Thailand and the Myanmar navy has publicized the long-running dispute between the two countries about overlapping fishing rights, experts say. In the early hours of November 30, Myanmar patrol boats fired on 15 Thai fishing vessels off Ranong province in southern Thailand. One Thai national was killed while four Thai crew members were detained along with 27 Myanmar nationals. One Thai fishing vessel, the Sor Charoenchai 8, was also seized. Thailand authorities have since been trying to negotiate with Myanmar over the release of the Thai sailors. Nikorndej Balankura, spokesman for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Bangkok Friday that the four men were being taken to the town of Koh Song on the Thailand-Myanmar border. 'At this moment, the Thai township border committee is coordinating the relevant measures required to send the four crew members back to Thailand,' he said. 'It’s being discussed and aim to finalize this process as soon as possible. I sincerely hope there will be good news soon.' But as of Monday, the four still remained in Myanmar’s custody. Thai Defense Minister Phumtham Wechayachai confirmed the Thai national who died in the altercation had drowned after jumping into the sea when the Myanmar navy opened fire. The deceased was a 24-year-old who was on his first expedition, reports say. Phumtham told reporters on Monday that Thailand was still waiting for a reply from the Myanmar military government, and now is unsure of a timeline as to when the four remaining Thais will be freed. He previously said the firing of shots was an 'overreaction' from the Myanmar navy. But Myanmar’s military government maintained it acted correctly because boats were invading its waters. The regime, which is currently fighting a brutal conflict with pro-democracy resistance groups throughout the country, said it was also investigating materials found on the fishing trawler relating to Myanmar’s revolutionary groups. Thailand and Myanmar share land borders of more than 2,400 kilometers in Southeast Asia. They also share a maritime boundary of 263 kilometers in the Andaman Sea, which was officially established in 1980 through a bilateral agreement. But Thai trawlers have often crossed those maritime lines. Phil Robertson, director at Asia Human Rights Labour Advocates, says the Thai fishermen were illegally fishing. 'The Thai fishing fleets were up to their old lawless ways, conducting fishing in Myanmar’s territorial waters, and this time they got caught by the rights-abusing [Myanmar] navy that shoots first and asks questions later. This latest incident is really a repeat of previous practices on both sides,' he told VOA. Myanmar’s waters are attractive to Thai fishermen because of the rich fishing stocks available. Thailand’s fishery sector contributed to more than 2 percent of the country’s gross domestic product in 2023. Dominic Thomson, regional director of Southeast Asia for the Environmental Justice Foundation, says fishing disputes between the two countries have been going on for decades, but this incident is a first. 'Thailand and Myanmar have yet to fully resolve their maritime boundary in the Andaman Sea, leading to overlapping claims. 'The tensions over fishing rights dates back to the 1980s when Thailand massively expanded its fishing fleet due to high domestic demand for seafood, coinciding with a sharp decline in fish stocks within Thai waters. Overfishing in Thai waters therefore drove Thai fishing vessels into Myanmar’s Exclusive Economic Zone, often without permits,' he told VOA via email. Thailand was given a yellow card warning by the European Union in 2015 over its failure to combat illegal, underreported and unregulated, or IUU, fishing. The mechanism is the first step used by the EU to warn trade partners over their inaction over reducing illegal fishing. If a red card is shown to a country, it means that nation hasn't made enough progress and its fishing exports to the EU will be banned. Later that year, Thailand introduced new regulations that said Thai fishing vessels must have monitoring technology installed to warn them when they encroach on maritime border lines. It is not clear whether these warning systems were ignored, or not active when the vessels were fired at on November 30. 'There have been no reports of similar incidents since at least 2015. The nature of the incident, coupled with the detention of the fishing vessels and crew is unprecedented,' Thomson said. Robertson says questions remain over how this happened. 'Reliable sources report that there were many more Thai fishing boats engaged in this illegal fishing activity than reported, raising questions about why Thai marine regulatory agencies are failing to ensure their fishing fleets respect Burmese waters. The Thai fishermen look like victims here, but they are the core problem as well,' Robertson added. Thomson said Thailand must look at its monitoring systems to prevent a repeat incident. 'Thailand should ensure that its monitoring and control systems are adequately staffed, trained and resourced to ensure that Thai fishing vessels that stray into other countries’ waters are told to turn back as soon as possible. It is vital that there are appropriate sanctioning powers in place and consistent enforcement of these powers to deter similar intrusions in the future,' he added. Thailand is set to welcome Myanmar and other ASEAN nation members to Bangkok in a ministerial meeting on December 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/altercation-highlights-chronic-tension-between-thailand-myanmar-over-fishing-rights/7892721.html	2024-12-09T08:28:38-08:00	
China’s defense minister reappears, as military purge marches on	Taipei, Taiwan — Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun has reappeared in public after a media report claimed he was under disciplinary investigation. Analysts say that while his reappearance suggests Dong is politically safe, it does not mean China will stop its anti-corruption purge against the military. Dong attended a security forum in Shanghai last Thursday on the security situation in the Gulf of Guinea. This marked his first public appearance since taking part in a meeting with counterparts from Southeast Asian countries and the United States last month in Laos. During the forum, Dong met with heads of delegations from 18 African countries and expressed China’s willingness to strengthen maritime cooperation with regional countries and help maintain security in the Gulf of Guinea, China’s state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Prior to his re-emergence last week, the Financial Times reported on November 26 that Dong was facing an anti-corruption-related investigation, citing unnamed current and former U.S. officials. The Chinese defense ministry dismissed the report during a regular press conference on November 28, calling it a 'sheer fabrication' spread by rumor-mongers with evil motivations. However, a suspension and disciplinary investigation that the defense ministry announced November 28 against another official, Admiral Miao Hua, still raised questions about Dong’s fate. Analysts say Dong’s reappearance on December 5 signals that he is 'politically safe for now.' 'The Chinese government wants to show that Dong remains safe and, despite some changes at the top of the Chinese military, the Chinese leadership still maintains a certain level of control,' said Lin Ying-yu, an expert on the Chinese military at Tamkang University in Taiwan. Lin spoke with VOA in a phone interview. It remains unclear, however, whether Dong’s personal relationship with Miao might affect him later, said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University, or ANU. 'Miao Hua’s role as head of political works [in the Central Military Commission] is in part akin to the Chinese military’s chief human resource officer and it means virtually any official whose career got fast-tracked over the last seven years will have to have Miao’s seal of approval,' he told VOA in a written response. He said the personal ties between Dong and Miao 'can be a big deal in political purges but can also be nothing.' Campaign intensifies Since Chinese President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, he has carried out a sweeping anti-corruption campaign against the People’s Liberation Army, or PLA. The campaign has intensified over the past year. The investigation into Miao is the latest case. At least nine generals in the PLA and several defensive industry executives have been removed from China’s national legislative body due to corruption-related charges. In June, two of Dong’s predecessors, former defense minister Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe were removed from their roles and expelled from the Chinese Communist Party amid allegations of corruption. Experts say the investigation into Miao, who is an admiral in the Chinese navy, shows how widespread and deep-rooted the problem of corruption is across different branches of the military. 'The Chinese navy was previously plagued by corruption in 2020, leading to the removal of several naval commanders. Since last year, the Chinese military’s rocket force became the focus of the Chinese authorities’ anti-corruption campaign,' said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. During an inspection of the PLA’s information support force on December 4, Chinese President Xi urged the military to 'improve conduct, enforce discipline and combat corruption,' emphasizing that the Chinese military 'must be entirely loyal, pure and reliable.' Sung at ANU said the investigation against Miao will likely set off 'a new round of purges inside the Chinese military.' 'Since Miao has essentially been the PLA’s head of HR, many appointees [in the PLA] need to get into his good graces, and what kind of entanglement that entails leaves a lot of room for imagination,' he told VOA. Impact on warfighting and morale Experts say that while there are legitimate reasons for Chinese authorities to root out rampant corruption in the military, Xi has used the anti-corruption campaign to maintain his control over the PLA. 'Xi uses the anti-corruption campaign to strengthen his control over the Chinese military and under this ‘reign with terror,’ it’s difficult for the military to challenge his authority,' Tamkang University’s Lin told VOA. In addition to maintaining control over the military, Xi is using the anti-corruption campaign to eliminate military commanders from other factions within the Chinese Communist Party, said Su Tzu-yun. He adds that such a vicious cycle could negatively impact morale in the military. The constant personnel reshuffling at the top level will also affect the military’s operation and long-term planning, according to Sung. Military purges 'will inevitably lead to personnel reshuffling thus slow down [the Chinese military’s] long-term planning for force building and warfighting,' he told VOA. Since Xi has urged the military to combat corruption and it is used to control the military, Lin said the pace of Beijing’s anti-corruption campaign against the PLA will likely continue in 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-defense-minister-reappears-as-military-purge-marches-on-/7892681.html	2024-12-09T08:13:37-08:00	
TikTok asks federal appeals court to bar enforcement of potential ban until Supreme Court review	TikTok asked a federal appeals court on Monday to bar the Biden administration from enforcing a law that could lead to a ban on the popular platform until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge to the statue. The legal filing was made after a panel of three judges on the same court sided with the government last week and ruled that the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban as soon as next month, was constitutional. If the law is not overturned, both TikTok and its parent ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, have claimed that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, 2025. TikTok has more than 170 million American users. 'Before that happens, the Supreme Court should have an opportunity, as the only court with appellate jurisdiction over this action, to decide whether to review this exceptionally important case,' attorneys for the two companies wrote in the legal filing on Monday. It's not clear if the Supreme Court will take up the case. President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok the last time he was in the White House, has said he is now against such action. In their legal filing, the two companies pointed to the political realities, saying that an injunction would provide a 'modest delay' that would give 'the incoming Administration time to determine its position — which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court review.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-bar-enforcement-of-potential-ban-until-supreme-court-review-/7892664.html	2024-12-09T07:51:58-08:00

Emilia Perez,' 'The Brutalist' lead Golden Globe film nominations	BEVERLY HILLS, California — Musical thriller 'Emilia Perez' and historical epic 'The Brutalist' led the roster of films nominated on Monday for the 2025 Golden Globes, the Hollywood honors that kick off the movie awards season leading to the Oscars. 'Emilia Perez,' released by Netflix NFLX.O, scored 10 nods and 'The Brutalist,' from independent distributor A24, earned seven. Taking home a Globe can help movies in the race to the Academy Awards in March. Last year's Hollywood strikes scrambled this year's release schedule, and awards pundits say there is no clear frontrunner for best picture at the Oscars. The Globe winners will be chosen by 334 entertainment journalists from 85 countries and will be announced Jan. 5 at a ceremony broadcast live on CBS and streamed on Paramount+. 'Emilia Perez' stars Zoe Saldana as a lawyer who helps a drug cartel leader (Spanish actor Karla Sofía Gascón) fake his death and transition from a man to a woman. Selena Gomez co-stars as the cartel leader's wife. All three were nominated for by Globes voters for acting honors. 'The Brutalist' stars Adrien Brody in an epic tale of a Hungarian immigrant who flees the horrors of World War Two to rebuild his life in the United States. Box office smash 'Wicked,' adapted from a long-running Broadway play about the witches in 'The Wizard of Oz,' landed four nominations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/emilia-perez-the-brutalist-lead-golden-globe-film-nominations-/7892640.html	2024-12-09T07:24:42-08:00

Tonga PM abruptly resigns following rift with king	Nuku'alofa, Tonga — Tonga's Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni abruptly resigned on Monday, stepping down in the wake of a power struggle with the Pacific nation's royal family. Sovaleni has butted heads with Tonga's influential King Tupou VI, fueling speculation of a deepening rift between the royals and his government. In cryptic remarks delivered before announcing his shock resignation, Sovaleni suggested the country's nobility was 'fearful' of losing its sway. 'I thought this land had been given freedom, but there's still enslavement,' he told parliament through tears. 'I hope there's a time where we'll work together. If the nobility can do it and we can work together, we can achieve great things.' Sovaleni resigned before facing a vote of no confidence brought on by opposition lawmakers on Monday afternoon. Tonga's hereditary nobles occupy nine seats in the country's 26-member legislative assembly. If the nobles voted as a bloc alongside the opposition, they would have enough numbers to force Sovaleni out. It was not immediately clear who would replace Oxford-educated Sovaleni, who has been prime minister since 2021. Veteran politician and longtime rival 'Aisake Eke loomed as one of the the likely frontrunners. The line of Tongan kings and queens stretches back more than 1,000 years, according to a government history. Although the monarchy no longer enjoys the unbridled power of old, it remains one of the most dominant institutions across the Tongan archipelago. King Tupou VI penned a letter earlier this year saying he no longer had 'confidence' in Sovaleni as Tonga's armed forces minister. Bad blood Sovaleni refused to stand down from the portfolio, sparking a tense standoff between two of Tonga's most powerful figures. Eventually Sovaleni backed down, delivering a traditional apology to the king and resigning from the armed forces ministry. Although the details of the disagreement remain a mystery, it appears this was not enough to quell the bad blood between the two. Tonga overhauled its constitution after pro-democracy protests in 2006, which spiralled into angry riots that left swathes of capital Nuku'alofa in smoking ruins. At the time, the Tongan king held immense sway as the country's head of state, head of government, and military commander-in-chief. Although the monarchy eventually agreed to devolve much of its responsibility to a cabinet of elected lawmakers, its power has not been totally diluted. The king still has the power to veto legislation, and appoints the prime minister on the advice of the Tongan parliament. A developing country of some 106,000 people spread across dozens of islands, Tonga's debt-laden government is seen as particularly vulnerable to economic pressure from China. The island kingdom owes China's export bank around $130 million – almost a third of its GDP – which was loaned to help rebuild after the 2006 riots Repayments on that loan were scheduled to start spiking this year. Sovaleni was first elected to parliament in 2014 and served as deputy prime minister from 2014-17, then became education minister in 2019.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tonga-pm-abruptly-resigns-following-rift-with-king-/7892532.html	2024-12-09T06:23:54-08:00	
China launches anti-monopoly probe into Nvidia	BEIJING — China on Monday said it has launched an investigation into U.S. chip maker Nvidia over suspected violations of the country's anti-monopoly law, in a move that will likely be seen as a retaliatory move against Washington's recent chip curbs. The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said Nvidia is also suspected of violating commitments it made during its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd, according to terms outlined in the regulator's 2020 conditional approval of that deal. It did not elaborate on how Nvidia might have violated China's anti-monopoly laws. Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's shares fell 2.2% in premarket trading after the Chinese regulator's announcement. The investigation comes after the U.S. last week launched its third crackdown in three years on China's semiconductor industry, which saw Washington curb exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers. Nvidia has enjoyed booming demand from China, though this has been dented over the past year by U.S. efforts to stop China from acquiring the world's most advanced chips. Before the U.S. curbs, Nvidia dominated China's AI chip market with more than 90 per cent share. However, it currently faces increasing competition from domestic rivals, chief among them being Huawei. When the U.S. firm made a $6.9 billion bid to acquire Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies in 2019 there were concerns that China could block the deal due to U.S.-China trade frictions. Beijing however later approved the deal in 2020 with multiple conditions for Nvidia and the merged entity's China operations, including prohibitions on forced product bundling, unreasonable trading terms, purchase restrictions, and discriminatory treatment of customers who buy products separately.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-launches-anti-monopoly-probe-into-nvidia-/7892526.html	2024-12-09T06:09:19-08:00	
Head of UN human rights promises advice to FIFA and Saudi Arabia over 2034 World Cup issues	Geneva — Two days before FIFA confirms Saudi Arabia as the 2034 World Cup host, the United Nations' top human rights official pledged Monday to try to ensure migrant labor standards are 'properly respected' around the tournament. Saudi Arabia is the only candidate and sure to win Wednesday when FIFA will ask an online meeting of its 211 member federations to award the 2034 hosting rights by acclaim without an itemized vote. The oil-rich kingdom's World Cup plan needs to build eight of the 15 promised stadiums from scratch, plus add 175,000 hotel rooms. It will rely heavily on migrant workers, often from South Asia, within a labor law framework that activist groups say does not protect them. On Monday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, said his organization in Geneva was not directly engaged by FIFA on World Cup issues. 'What we are involved in though is to make sure that indeed, in each and every major sporting event, human rights are part and parcel of the way that sports events are not only conceived but also conducted,' Türk said at a news conference on the eve of the UN's annual Human Rights Day. Critics of FIFA say a Saudi-hosted World Cup risks repeating rights abuses seen during a decade of similar preparations for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Allegations of widespread labor abuses in Saudi Arabia are already part of an investigation by the UN-backed International Labor Organization (ILO) after a formal complaint by trade unions. Two United States senators have cited human rights in urging FIFA to find a different host for its marquee men's event that earns billions of dollars in profit for the soccer body. 'Whatever the decision is, to whoever is going to organize it, we will provide precisely that type of advice to the organizers,' Türk, an Austrian lawyer, said. 'That will include also, of course, the need to make sure that migrant labor standards are properly respected and all the various other human rights dimensions of major sporting events.' FIFA has been criticized for not using its leverage ahead of the World Cup decision with Saudi Arabia, despite its president Gianni Infantino building close ties to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi officials made some promises in a formal bid document to engage with the ILO and domestic agencies but not international groups like unions and rights groups that have limited or no access to work in the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/head-of-un-human-rights-promises-advice-to-fifa-and-saudi-arabia-over-2034-world-cup-issues-/7892422.html	2024-12-09T05:09:47-08:00	
Sent back to Cambodia from Thailand, six government critics face charges, trial	Bangkok — Experts tell VOA that Thailand’s deportation last month of six Cambodian activists back to Cambodia shows Bangkok continues to participate in 'transnational repression' — coordination among governments targeting dissidents outside their countries. Authorities deported Pen Chan Sangkream, Hong An, Mean Chanthon, Yin Chanthou, Soeung Khunthea and Vorn Chanratchana last month. The four women and two men have since been charged by Cambodia with treason for posting social media statements criticizing Cambodian policies over the 20-year-old Cambodia-Laos-Vietnam Development Triangle Area, or CLV-DTA, agreement, which is aimed at easing trade and migration among the three countries, The Associated Press reports. They are now being held in separate facilities in pre-trial detention in Cambodia, and will face trial for their charges, that could see them sentenced to lengthy time in prison, according to Radio Free Asia. The six activists are supporters of the banned opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party and had left Cambodia for Thailand in 2022. Tiy Chung, a regional spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, confirmed to VOA by email that the six have been deported and 'are people of concern.' UNHCR, he said, is 'deeply concerned' by the deportation, which included a child, he said, and which goes against Thailand’s obligation to ensure that no one is expelled or returned to someplace where their life or freedom could be at risk. 'We are seeking urgent clarification from the Thai authorities on the circumstances surrounding this deportation and urge them to honour Thai law and their international obligations to prevent such actions in the future,' he wrote. In recent years the Cambodian government has cracked down critics in and out of the country. Planned protests against the CLV-DTA agreement saw September arrests of at least 100 activists, who accused Phnom Penh of ceding Cambodian territory, although the same month saw Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet announce Cambodia would pull out of the decades-old deal. In February, three other Cambodian activists, recognized as persons of concern by the UNHCR, and their families, were arrested in Thailand before they had planned to protest Manet’s visit to Thailand. The practice of transnational repression is not new. Freedom House said in 2022 that since 2014, over 150 people in Thailand had been victims of the practice. Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights Labor Advocates, said Thailand is not safe for Cambodian refugees. 'The message here to all Cambodian refugees sheltering in Thailand is you’re not safe because the friendship between the Hun and Shinawatra families trumps any obligations Thailand is supposed to uphold under international human rights law,' he said. Cambodia has been ruled by the Cambodian People’s Party for 45 years, with critics saying in recent years the regime has stepped up efforts to target dissidents, opposition parties and independent media who pose threats to its reputation or rule. Hun Manet took power in 2023, succeeding his father, Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for nearly four decades. Thailand and Cambodia have endured an up-and-down relationship over the years, with border and cultural conflicts periodically being divisive. Those relations appear currently to be close, in part because of family ties. Thai prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra met Manet in Laos in October. But it is the relationship between their fathers and predecessors, Thaksin Shinawatra and Hun Sen, that has cemented strong ties between the two families. Thailand’s ruling Pheu Thai party has vowed to work together on transnational crime with Manet. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst in Thailand, told VOA the family links are likely key in this deportation case. 'The close personal relations and even family ties between the two families make this deportation suspect. It will be difficult not to conclude that these intimate links facilitated it. The deportation is an ill-considered move for the Paetongtarn leadership and government that claims democratic legitimacy despite coming second in the May 2023 election,' he told VOA. The purported treasonous crimes that six Cambodians allegedly committed fall under Article 453 of Cambodia's criminal code. If found guilty, the criticism of the Cambodian regime and its policies toward neighbors Vietnam and Laos could land them a decade in prison. Thailand has its own strict laws it implements for those who are critical of its monarchy. Under Article 112 of its criminal code, it is illegal to criticize the Thai monarchy, carrying sentences of 15 years in prison for each offense. In January, a 30-year-old man was sentenced to 50 years in jail after being ruled to have defamed the monarchy. Prem Singh Gill, visiting fellow in Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, Indonesia, says the Thai and Cambodian governments share similar interests when it comes to prohibiting dissent. 'This collaborative approach is not coincidental but strategically designed. Both countries share similar authoritarian impulses, with royal institutions and political elites working in concert to maintain their grip on power. By harmonizing their approach to dissent, Thailand and Cambodia create a more comprehensive mechanism of controlling political discourse,' Gill told VOA via email. 'Transnational repression becomes a sophisticated tool of regional authoritarianism, where activists find themselves trapped in a network of legal and extra-legal threats. Governments collaborate through informal channels, sharing intelligence, coordinating deportations, and creating an environment of constant vulnerability for political dissidents,' he added. Thailand recently was elected to a seat at the U.N. Human Rights Council and is expected to begin its duties in January 2025. VOA contacted Thailand’s Foreign Affairs Ministry for comment but received no response.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sent-back-to-cambodia-from-thailand-six-government-critics-face-charges-trial-/7892412.html	2024-12-09T05:00:07-08:00	
Israel announces deaths of 4 soldiers in southern Lebanon fighting	Israel’s military said Monday that four of its soldiers were killed in fighting in southern Lebanon. A military statement said the soldiers were all from the same brigade, but it did not specify when they were killed or the circumstances of their deaths. The development comes nearly two weeks after Israel and the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah began a cease-fire. The agreement, which calls for both sides to pull back from southern Lebanon, has brought a sharp reduction in fighting, but has not eliminated violence in the area. Lebanon’s military said Monday an Israeli airstrike hit a car near an army checkpoint in southern Lebanon, killing one person and wounding four soldiers. The Lebanese military is not a party to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, and along with the United Nations is supposed to monitor a buffer zone between the warring sides as part of the ceasefire agreement. Hezbollah launched attacks against Israel in October 2023 in solidarity with its ally, the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip, following the Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. Israel and Hezbollah traded cross-border attacks for months, with the conflict intensifying in September and Israeli troops entering Lebanon in October. The ceasefire has allowed Israeli troops to refocus on Gaza, where health officials said Monday Israeli airstrikes killed at least six people. Israeli officials also said Monday that a drone believed to have originated in Yemen hit a residential building in the central Israeli city of Yavne. There were no reported injuries, authorities said. The Yemen-based Houthi militant group has launched multiple attacks against Israel during the past year, and it has carried out a campaign targeting ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, all part of what the Iran-backed group says are actions in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,700 Palestinians, more than half of the verified deaths women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Israel says that the death toll includes thousands of militants it has killed. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, United Kingdom and other Western countries.

Taiwan says China has sent naval ships into nearby waters ahead of anticipated drills	BEIJING — China's military appears to be preparing for widely anticipated drills in response to a recent visit by Taiwan's president to Hawaii and Guam. Taiwan's defense ministry said Monday that it detected Chinese naval and coast guard ships entering the Taiwan Strait and the western Pacific and that China had restricted airspace along its southeast coast through Wednesday. There was no immediate confirmation from the Chinese side. A Taiwan defense ministry statement said it has set up an emergency response center and launched combat readiness exercises. It did not say what those exercises entailed. The Chinese government says Taiwan is part of its territory and opposes American support and military sales to the self-governing island. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te made stops in Hawaii and Guam during a weeklong tour of the Pacific that ended Friday. China maintains that Taiwan is a province that should not have its own president or foreign relations. 'It must be pointed out that there is no such thing as a defense ministry in Taiwan,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said when asked about the Taiwanese statement. 'Taiwan is part of China, and the Taiwan issue is China's internal affairs. China will firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.' China, which views Lai as a separatist, held major military exercises around Taiwan following his inauguration in May and his national day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022. The Taiwan defense ministry statement said China had restricted air space in seven zones off Fujian province, which faces Taiwan, and off Zhejiang province, which stretches north from Fujian to Shanghai.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-china-has-sent-naval-ships-into-nearby-waters-ahead-of-anticipated-drills-/7892323.html	2024-12-09T03:27:15-08:00	
Earth's lands are drying out; Nations are trying to address it in talks this week	Much of Earth's lands are drying out and damaging the ability of plant and animal life to survive, according to a United Nations report released Monday at talks where countries are working to address the problem. The report was released at the U.N. summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on combating desertification — once-fertile lands turning into deserts because of hotter temperatures from human-caused climate change, lack of water and deforestation. It found that more than three-quarters of the world's land experienced drier conditions from 1970 to 2020 than the previous thirty-year period. 'The drier climates now affecting vast lands across the globe will not return to how they were,' said Ibrahim Thiaw, chief of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which is facilitating the Riyadh talks. 'This change is redefining life on Earth.' At the talks, which started last week and are set to end on Friday, nations are discussing how better they can help the world deal with droughts — a more urgent lack of water over shorter periods — and the more permanent problem of degrading land. Earth's drying comes with devastating effects If global warming trends continue, nearly five billion people — including in most of Europe, parts of the western U.S., Brazil, eastern Asia and central Africa — will be affected by the drying by the end of the century, up from a quarter of the world's population today, the report warned. UNCCD's chief scientist Barron Orr warned drier land could lead to 'potentially catastrophic impacts affecting access to water that could push people and nature even closer to disastrous tipping points,' where humans are no longer able to reverse damaging effects of climate change. Sergio Vicente-Serrano, one of the lead authors of the report, said that as the atmosphere heats up because the burning of coal, oil and gas spews planet-warming emissions, it leads to more evaporation on the ground. That makes water less available for humans, plants and animals, making it harder to survive. Farming is particularly at risk, with drier land being less productive and hurting both yields and the availability of food for livestock, the report said. That can lead to food insecurity for communities worldwide. Aridity also leads to more migration, because erratic rainfall, degrading land and frequent water shortages make it harder for regions or nations to develop economically, the report said. It said the trend is especially noticeable in some of the world's driest areas such as southern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and southern Asia. Addressing the problem at UN talks— slowly Negotiators in Riyadh are mainly discussing how best the world can respond to more frequent and damaging droughts. Jes Weigelt, of European climate thinktank TMG, said it's still a sticking point because countries can't agree on whether rich nations should be forking out funds for drought responses around the world. Any money pledged would go toward better forecasting and monitoring systems as well as creating reservoirs and other structures that can provide access to water even during prolonged dry spells. 'The big contentious issue is do we do this (drought response) through a binding U.N.-level protocol or are there other options that we should explore,' Weigelt said. A binding protocol would mean that among other obligations, developed countries might be asked to provide funding. Thiaw, the UNCCD chief, said that hosts Saudi Arabia pledging $2.15 billion from various countries and international banks for drought resilience has set the right tone for the meetings. And the Arab Coordination Group — 10 development banks based in the Middle East — committed $10 billion by 2030 to address degrading land, desertification and drought. The funds are expected to support 80 of the most vulnerable countries prepare for worsening drought conditions. But the U.N. estimates that between 2007 and 2017, droughts cost $125 billion worldwide. 'As hosts, our primary objective is to help facilitate the critical discussions taking place,' said Osama Faqeeha, Saudi Arabia's deputy environment minister and an advisor to the talks' presidency. 'These crises know no borders.' Lasting solutions for an arid world While drought can be very damaging, Thiaw wrote in Monday's report, recovery is possible. But he called the drying of land 'an unrelenting menace that requires lasting adaptation measures.' Longer lasting solutions — such as the curbing of climate change — are not much of a talking point at the Riyadh summit. Hosts Saudi Arabia have long been criticized by some other nations and climate analysts for stalling progress on curbing emissions from fossil fuels at other negotiations. The U.N.'s report recommends that countries improve their land use practices and are more efficient at using water. That includes rolling out measures like growing crops that need less water and irrigation methods that are more efficient — like drip irrigation, which feeds water to plants slowly to minimize evaporation — on a much larger scale. It also suggests better monitoring so that communities can plan ahead, and large-scale reforestation projects to protect the earth and its moisture. Andrea Toreti, one of the report's lead authors, said addressing the issue — just like tackling climate change or biodiversity loss — will need countries to work better together. It 'requires coordinated international action and an unwavering commitment,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earth-s-lands-are-drying-out-nations-are-trying-to-address-it-in-talks-this-week-/7892310.html	2024-12-09T03:18:38-08:00	
Ukraine reports destroying 18 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 18 drones that Russian forces deployed in overnight attacks. The Ukrainian air force said the intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytsky, Odesa, Poltava, Rivne, Sumy, Ternopil and Vinnytsia regions. There were no reports of casualties or major damage. Ukrainian air defenses also shot down two Russian guided missiles, the military said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday its air defenses destroyed 13 Ukrainian aerial drones. Most of the drones were shot down near the Russia-Ukraine border in the Belgorod and Rostov regions. Two of the drones were destroyed over Astrakhan, located about 200 kilometers from the border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-reports-destroying-18-russian-drones/7892288.html	2024-12-09T02:21:43-08:00	
South Korea’s leadership unclear as Yoon struggles to retain power	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea’s defense ministry insisted that President Yoon Suk Yeol remained in charge of the country’s armed forces on Monday, even as the justice ministry enforced a travel ban against him following his attempt to declare martial law last week. The developments deepened what legal scholars described as an extraordinary constitutional crisis. Although Yoon is being investigated for treason, and the head of his own party has said he would no longer be involved in state affairs, conservative lawmakers have continued to resist his impeachment, and it appeared Yoon continued to hold key levers of power as of late Monday. When asked by a reporter how a president under suspicion of rebellion could control the country’s armed forces, a spokesperson for South Korea’s defense ministry responded: 'Legally, the authority remains with the current commander in chief.' Yoon has also continued to perform other presidential duties, such as accepting the resignation of senior officials and appointing others. The developments raise questions about what, if any duties, he has ceded, as he and his conservative allies have promised. On Sunday, PPP chief Han Dong-hoon said that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would handle state affairs in consultation with the party, but offered few other details about the apparent power-sharing arrangement. Neither Han holds an elected position. PPP officials did not respond to VOA’s request for more details about the alleged deal, which numerous legal scholars have called extra-constitutional and likely illegal. Jeon Hak-seon, a constitutional law professor at Hankook Foreign Language University, said the only established process for removing a president’s powers are impeachment or resignation. There is no constitutional provision, Jeon said, for an arrangement in which the president voluntarily and informally entrusts his powers to another official – and certainly not an unelected one. 'Such a system does not exist,' Jeon told VOA. 'The term ‘entrustment’ is not even used in Korean law.' Another Seoul-based legal professor, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, said Yoon and his party are likely trying to avoid a presidential vacancy, because under such a scenario an election must be held within 60 days, according to the constitution. Yoon, frustrated by what he saw as opposition attempts to obstruct his governing, declared martial law late Tuesday – the first such decree since South Korea became a democracy in the 1980s. Yoon said the move was necessary to 'crush anti-state forces,' but opposition lawmakers overturned the decree within hours. In a speech Saturday, Yoon apologized for causing anxiety and said future governance 'will be handled jointly by our party and the government.' The two-minute speech was Yoon’s only public appearance since lifting the martial decree early Wednesday. South Korean opposition lawmakers failed to impeach Yoon in a vote on Saturday, but vowed to soon hold another vote. Yoon’s office did not respond Monday to VOA’s request for clarification about what, if any, presidential powers had been ceded to the party or prime minister. Responding to a similar VOA question on Sunday, a presidential spokesperson said: 'I ask for your deep understanding that we cannot help but be cautious in sending messages. However, if there is anything to say at the level of the Office of the President, we will share it without delay.' Early Monday, the Yonhap news agency reported that many officials at the presidential office 'seem to be abandoning their messaging apps or social media accounts and creating new ones, possibly in preparation for ongoing investigations by the prosecution and police.' South Korea’s Justice Ministry on Monday announced that it had imposed a travel ban on Yoon, who faces three separate government investigations into treason for his activities related to the martial law attempt. While in office, South Korean presidents are immune from prosecution, except in cases involving allegations of rebellion or treason. However, it remained unclear whether any law enforcement agency would attempt to question or arrest Yoon, a former chief prosecutor. Yoon’s popularity plunged to an all-time low of 17%, according to a poll released Monday by Realmeter, a public opinion research organization. Other recent polls have put that figure much lower. Ahead of Saturday’s impeachment vote, an estimated crowd of 100,000 protesters gathered outside the country’s legislature. Despite immense public pressure, lawmakers in Yoon’s PPP have refused to support impeachment, saying such an outcome would create instability. The situation in some ways mirrors 2017, when South Korea's former conservative president, Park Geun-hye, was removed from office on corruption-related charges. Those developments deeply fractured the conservative party, and made some reluctant to repeat the process. But conservatives are likely to face mounting pressure if street protests and strikes intensify and polling continues to reflect Yoon’s low popularity, said Mason Richey, professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. 'Logically, the Han-Han-Yoon governing arrangement may be unsustainable, as it is apparently extra-constitutional and opens up tensions in handling state affairs,' said Richey. 'Although much about this saga so far has been illogical.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-leadership-unclear-as-yoon-struggles-to-retain-power/7892280.html	2024-12-09T02:11:34-08:00	
Fishing boat capsizes after colliding with barge in South Korea, killing 7	SEOUL, South Korea — A fishing boat capsized after colliding with a sand barge in waters off South Korea's southeastern coast early Monday, leaving seven crew members dead and one missing, according to local coast guard and fire departments. The 29-ton fishing boat, which had eight passengers, three South Koreans and five Indonesian nationals, capsized after colliding with a 456-ton barge in waters near the city of Gyeongju, according to Kim Eul-dong, an official at the Pohang coast guard. Dozens of emergency workers, along with 15 coast guard vessels and six helicopters, were mobilized to search for the missing passenger, who was Indonesian. None of the passengers from the barge were hurt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fishing-boat-capsizes-after-colliding-with-barge-in-south-korea-killing-7/7892249.html	2024-12-09T00:25:19-08:00	
Australian synagogue fire declared terrorism	MELBOURNE, Australia — Australian law enforcement authorities on Monday declared an arson attack on a synagogue last week a terrorist act in a decision that increases resources available to the investigation. Arson squad detectives have been investigating the blaze that extensively damaged the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne on Friday. But the investigation was taken over on Monday by the Joint Counter-Terrorism Team which involves Victoria state Police and Australian Federal Police as well as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the nation's main domestic spy agency. 'The decision ... to transition the Adass Israel Synagogue fire attack to the Victorian Joint Counter-Terrorism Team is a crucial turning point in this investigation,' Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Krissy Barrett told reporters. 'I want to thank Victoria Police investigators for the significant information they have gathered so far, which has helped lead us to believe that this is likely to be a politically motivated attack. This is now a terrorism investigation,' Barrett added. The declaration gave investigators more resources, information and legal powers to pursue the three suspects, police said. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said investigators had made 'significant progress,' but declined to detail that progress. Witnesses reported seeing two masked men spreading a liquid accelerant before the fire. Police have not revealed what role the third suspect played. Police have also not revealed if they know the identity of any suspect. The synagogue fire is the first declared terrorist incident in Australia since April when a 16-year-old boy allegedly stabbed a bishop and priest in a Sydney Assyrian church while a service was being streamed online. Some lawmakers had been calling for the arsonists to be charged with terrorism offenses so that they would potentially face longer prison sentences. The blaze is an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and Hamas last year. Cars and buildings have been vandalized and torched around Australia in protests inspired by the war. In a separate initiative, Australian Federal Police announced on Monday the formation of Special Operation Avalite to target antisemiticism around the country. The investigators were brought together in response to arson attacks on the synagogue, Jewish lawmaker Josh Burns' Melbourne office in June and on a car in a Sydney street last month that was related to antisemitic vandalism. 'Special Operation Avalite will be an agile and experienced squad of counter-terrorism investigators who will focus on threats, violence, and hatred towards the Australian Jewish community and parliamentarians,' Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, who is Jewish, said his government was striving to make the Jewish community 'feel safe.' 'We've experienced in Australia, in the last year, the highest level of antisemitism that I've experienced in my lifetime. That's a common reaction from members of the Australian Jewish community,' Dreyfus said. The Victoria government on Friday offered 100,000 Australian dollars ($64,300) to help repair the synagogue and said there would be an increased police presence in the area. The federal government on Sunday offered the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, an umbrella body representing more than 200 Jewish organizations, AU$32.5 million ($20.8 million) to enhance security at community sites including synagogues and schools.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-synagogue-fire-declared-terrorism-/7892243.html	2024-12-09T00:08:36-08:00	
Polarization' is Merriam-Webster's 2024 word of the year	The results of the 2024 U.S. presidential election rattled the country and sent shockwaves across the world — or were cause for celebration, depending on who you ask. Is it any surprise then that the Merriam-Webster word of the year is 'polarization'? 'Polarization means division, but it's a very specific kind of division,' said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement. 'Polarization means that we are tending toward the extremes rather than toward the center.' The election was so divisive, many American voters went to the polls with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an existential threat to the nation. According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat concerned that Donald Trump's views — but not Harris' — were too extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris — but not Trump. The Merriam-Webster entry for 'polarization' reflects scientific and metaphorical definitions. It's most commonly used to mean 'causing strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings.' Merriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in search and usage. Last year's pick was 'authentic.' This year's comes as large swaths of the U.S. struggle to reach consensus on what is real. 'It's always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody,' Sokolowski said. 'It's a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news, alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word's meaning in the culture.' It's notable that 'polarization' originated in the early 1800s — and not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about science, Sokolowski said. He called it a 'pretty young word,' in the scheme of the English language. 'Polarized is a term that brings intensity to another word,' he continued, most frequently used in the U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ideology. 'The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,' the Merriam-Webster editor continued. 'We've had dictionaries of English for 420 years and it's only been in the last 20 years or so that we've actually known which words people look up.' 'Polarization' extends beyond political connotations. It's used to highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends and other industries. All the scrutiny over Taylor Swift's private jet usage? Polarizing. Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarizing. The International Olympic Committee's decision to strip American gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it: polarizing. Even lighthearted memes — like those making fun of Australian breakdancer Rachael 'Raygun' Gunn's performance — or the proliferation of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved polarizing. Paradoxically though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word itself. Sokolowski cited its frequent use among people across the political spectrum, including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN. 'It's used by both sides,' he said, 'and in a little bit ironic twist to the word, it's something that actually everyone agrees on.' Rounding out Merriam-Webster's top 10 words of 2024: Demure TikToker Jools Lebron's 38-second video describing her workday makeup routine as 'very demure, very mindful' lit up the summer with memes. The video has been viewed more than 50 million times, yielding 'huge spikes' in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means reserved or modest. Fortnight Taylor Swift's song 'Fortnight,' featuring rapper Post Malone, undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks. 'Music can still send people to the dictionary,' Sokolowski said. Totality The solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico's Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully blot out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or aggregate amount — or wholeness. Resonate 'Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of the word 'resonate,'' Sokolowski said. This may be because the word, which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional way, can add gravitas to writing. But, paradoxically, artificial intelligence 'also betrays itself to be a robot because it's using that word too much.' Allision The word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March, a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. 'When you have one moving object into a fixed object, that's an allision, not a collision. You're showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in fact, in motion,' Sokolowski said. Weird This summer on the TV news show 'Morning Joe,' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Republican leaders 'weird.' It may have been what launched his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Though it's a word that people typically misspell — is it 'ei' or 'ie'? — and search for that reason, its rise in use was notable, Sokolowski said. Cognitive Whether the word was used to raise questions about President Joe Biden's debate performance or Trump's own age, it cropped up often. It refers to conscious intellectual activity — such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering. Pander Pander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said. 'Conservative news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights supporters.' Whereas Walz said Trump's visit to a McDonald's kitchen pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what someone — such as an audience — wants or demands even though it is not 'good, proper, reasonable, etc.' Democracy In 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make 'democracy' its first word of the year. Since then, the word — which, of course, means a form of government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions, policies and laws — is consistently one of the dictionary's most looked up. 'There's a poignancy to that, that people are checking up on it,' Sokolowski said. 'Maybe the most hopeful thing that the curiosity of the public shows, is that they're paying attention.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/polarization-is-merriam-webster-s-2024-word-of-the-year/7892235.html	2024-12-08T23:41:21-08:00	
UN Security Council to discuss Syria after Assad’s ouster	The U.N. Security Council is set to hold closed-door talks Monday on the situation in Syria, following the lightning advance by rebels that ousted President Bashar al-Assad. Russia, which provided military assistance to Assad during the nearly 14-year Syrian civil war, requested the Security Council session to discuss the developments, including the potential implications on the U.N.’s peacekeeping mission in the Golan Heights. Israeli troops deployed Sunday to the U.N.-monitored buffer zone in the Golan Heights, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying the move was necessary to protect Israelis after Syrian forces abandoned their positions. Many questions remained Monday about who will lead Syria and how the country will try to recover after years of war and nearly five decades under the rule of the Assad family. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement late Sunday that the United States will be 'closely monitoring developments as they unfold and engaging with our partners in the region.' 'The United States strongly supports a peaceful transition of power to an accountable Syrian government through an inclusive Syrian-led process,' Blinken said. 'During this transitional period, the Syrian people have every right to demand the preservation of state institutions, the resumption of key services, and the protection of vulnerable communities.' Blinken said the United States will support international efforts to hold Assad and others accountable for abuses against the Syrian people and detention of civilians such as U.S. journalist Austin Tice. Assad was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the country’s civil war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus. More than half a million Syrians died in the war, and the conflict displaced at least half the country’s pre-war population of 22 million people. Assad’s fall prompted crowds to gather and celebrate in Damascus and elsewhere. Rebels opened prisons where the Assad government held thousands of people as part of its crackdown against the uprising that began in 2011 against his rule. There was continued focus Monday on the Saydnaya prison outside of Damascus, where the White Helmets rescue organization said it deployed teams to search for potential hidden, underground cells where people may still be held. Russian news agencies said Sunday that Assad and his family arrived in Moscow and were granted asylum in Russia. The downfall of Assad was stunningly quick, with the rebels capturing the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs in a matter of days as the Syrian army ended any opposition. The rebels are led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group (HTS) which has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. Abu Mohammed al-Golani leads HTS and could chart the country's immediate direction. He is a former al-Qaida commander who cut ties with the group years ago and says he embraces pluralism and religious tolerance. But there are bitter divides in the country. Turkey-backed opposition fighters are battling U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group is still active in some remote areas.

US to stick with Kurdish allies in Syria	WASHINGTON — The fall of the Assad regime in Syria will not impact U.S. support, at least for now, for one of Washington’s most steadfast allies in the fight against the Islamic State terror group, according to senior American officials. Speaking just hours after Russian officials confirmed former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad had fled Damascus and taken refuge in Moscow, and a day after rebel forces entered the Syrian capital, U.S. officials insisted there are no plans to alter the U.S. military footprint in Syria, which includes some 900 troops, most of them working in the country’s northeast with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces or SDF. Maintaining U.S. positions across eastern Syria 'is something we will continue to do,' a senior U.S. administration official said Sunday, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive information. 'We think that presence is critically important for the stability of those areas and for denying the efforts of ISIS to resurge, and also for the integrity of the SDF and the groups that we work with in the East to maintain stability out there,' the official said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group, also known as IS or Daesh. The SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias formed in 2015, mustering a force of 30,000 to 40,000 fighters that played a key role in eroding IS’s hold on large swaths of territory, including the terror group’s self-proclaimed Syrian capital of Raqqa. Four years after its creation, in March 2019, the SDF announced the fall of the town of Baghuz, IS’s last stronghold in Syria. But the defeat of the self-declared IS caliphate in Syria came at a cost. SDF officials estimated some 11,000 fighters were killed in the yearslong campaign. And fighting with remnants of the terror group has persisted. Intelligence shared both by the U.S. and by United Nation member states earlier this year indicated an uptick in IS activity, especially by small cells in Syria’s central desert, describing it as a growing logistic hub for the terror group. Various estimates warn the number of IS fighters across Syria and Iraq has grown to between 2,500 and 5,000. This past July, U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, warned IS was on pace to 'more than double the total number of attacks they claimed in 2023.' And IS has made repeated attempts to free some 9,000 of its fighters being held in about 20 SDF-run prisons across northeastern Syria, described by one senior U.S, official as 'the largest collection of terrorist fighters in the world.' Additionally, the SDF has been charged with overseeing security at displaced persons camps, like al-Hol and al-Roj, which house about 30,000 people, most of them children under the age of 12, and many from families loyal to IS. U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday said Washington has no intention of letting Syria, or the SDF, face those challenges alone. 'Our mission against ISIS will be maintained, including the security of detention facilities where ISIS fighters are being held as prisoners,' the president said. 'We're clear eyed about the fact that ISIS will try to take advantage of any vacuum to reestablish its capabilities, to create a safe haven,' Biden added. 'We will not let that happen.' To underscore the U.S. commitment, Biden said U.S. forces Sunday carried out dozens of airstrikes against IS camps and operatives. U.S. Central Command said the operation struck more than 75 targets using a combination of long-range bombers, fighter jets and close air support. 'We targeted a significant gathering of ISIS fighters and leaders,' the senior administration official said, adding U.S. war planes dropped about 140 munitions during the strikes, which were authorized earlier Sunday. 'It's a significant strike, I think, just given the collection of ISIS individuals in that area and the size of the area,' the official added. But U.S. concerns about instability extend beyond the threat from IS itself. There are fears that ongoing tensions between the SDF and Turkey could also bring additional instability and danger. Already, there have been reports of clashes between Turkish-backed forces and the SDF in northern Syria. Turkey has also long voiced objections to the U.S alliance with the Kurdish-led SDF, arguing many of the fighters are also People's Protection Units, or YPG, a Syrian-based offshoot of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), labeled by both Ankara and Washington as a terrorist organization. And though the U.S. views the SDF and YPG as different entities, in Turkey's view, they are one and the same. U.S. officials said Sunday that there have already been high-level talks between officials at the Pentagon and State departments with their Turkish counterparts, describing the calls as 'constructive.' 'Additional conflicts, additional fronts opening up, not in anybody's interest,' the official said. Some analysts, however, worry the Turkish-Kurdish tensions will not be so easily resolved, pointing in part to Biden’s failure to mention Turkey Sunday while discussing U.S. outreach to Syria’s other neighbors. '[It] indicates that behind the scenes there's continuing to be ongoing machinations between American diplomats and Turkish officials about their aims for occupying portions of north and east Syria and thereby jeopardizing the Syrian Democratic Forces and civilians who live under the [Kurdish-led] Autonomous Administration,' said Myles Caggins, a nonresident fellow at the New Lines Institute and former spokesperson for the U.S.-led, anti-IS coalition in Syria and Iraq. 'President Biden made it very clear that U.S. forces will remain in north and east Syria in the foreseeable future to continue the anti-ISIS mission,' Caggins told VOA. 'The United States government has an opportunity to showcase and highlight its strong support of the Syrian Democratic Forces and people of Northeast Syria.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-stick-with-kurdish-allies-in-syria-/7892183.html	2024-12-08T18:20:05-08:00	
Notre Dame hosts first Mass since 2019 fire	PARIS — Notre Dame Cathedral, its air thick with the smell of incense, hosted its first Mass on Sunday since the catastrophic fire of 2019, a moment that transcended religious significance to become a powerful symbol of Paris’ resilience. Beneath the glow of traditional chandeliers and modern spotlights, which illuminated its intricately carved stonework, the cathedral emerged reborn, its grandeur restored after five years of reconstruction. For Catholics, it marks the revival of the city’s spiritual heart, a place where faith has been nurtured for centuries. For the world, it signals the rebirth of one of global heritage's most famous landmarks. The event was both solemn and historic. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich presided over the morning Mass, including the consecration of a new bronze altar. The liturgy was attended by 2,500 people, including French President Emmanuel Macron — enjoying a brief respite from France's political tumult and economic troubles — clergy, dignitaries and a few lucky members of the public who stood in long lines to enter. Nearly 170 bishops from France and around the world took part, along with one priest from each of the 113 parishes in the Paris diocese, accompanied by worshippers from these communities. Macron, in line with France’s strict division of state and church, did not take communion. Notre Dame’s journey from ruin to resurrection was defined by extraordinary craftsmanship, nearly $1 billion in global donations and a collective, unyielding determination to rebuild. After the Mass, faithful attendees, priests, nuns, and other guests lingered in the cathedral, their awe evident. Many took pictures and selfies in front of the altar, the baptistery, and vibrant rose windows, their joy mingling with reverence. Others knelt to pray at chapels dedicated to saints, savoring a spiritual intimacy many had not experienced since the fire. Later Sunday, the cathedral opened its doors to members of the public who secured reservations last week for the first fully public Mass. The Associated Press learned that tickets for this service were claimed within 25 minutes, underscoring Notre Dame’s enduring appeal. What’s more extraordinary is that this is taking place in a country with a strong emphasis on secularism and a low rate of church attendance. The public watches from a distance Public viewing areas along the Seine on Sunday morning drew hundreds of people who wished to witness the historic moment from afar, although their numbers were likely subdued by rainy and miserably cold weather conditions. Retired engineer Claude Lancrenon, watching from a viewing area, expressed both awe and disappointment. 'There is so much security,' he said, gesturing toward the barriers. 'Yesterday, that seemed appropriate. But today, I had hoped it would be more open so we could approach the cathedral. I still hope we’ll be able to get closer.' Tight security — akin to that of the Paris Olympic Games — reflected the importance of the occasion, ensuring the safety of dignitaries and the public alike. Nathalie Martino, a retired event organizer visiting Paris, recalled the anguish of watching the cathedral burn. 'I cried so much that day,' she said. 'And now, here I am. I had to come. It was something I needed to do.' A sacred space reborn Sunday’s Masses follow Saturday evening’s ceremonies in which Ulrich symbolically reopened the cathedral’s massive wooden doors by striking them three times with a crosier crafted from charred beams salvaged from the fire. As the doors swung open, choirs filled the air with song and the cathedral’s great organ — silent since the fire — resounded with majestic melodies. Inside, the restoration reveals a cathedral transformed with now-gleaming limestone walls cleaned of centuries of grime. The restored stained-glass windows project dazzling patterns of color across the nave. 'No one alive has seen the cathedral like this,' said the Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, Notre Dame’s rector. 'It is more than restored — it is reborn.' The consecration of the new altar was a pivotal moment in Notre Dame’s return to full liturgical life. The altar houses relics of five saints tied to Paris, including St. Catherine Labouré and St. Charles de Foucauld, continuing a centuries-old tradition of embedding sacred artifacts at the heart of worship spaces. The consecration, involving holy water, chrism oil, incense and prayer, transforms the altar into a sacred centerpiece of the cathedral. That was the most moving moment of the day for Marie Capucine, 37, a consecrated virgin representing her Parisian parish of Saint Germain des Prés at the reopening. She recalled the day the fire raged, and the ‘’communion in prayer all over the world'' for the cathedral to be saved. 'That shows that the Church gathers, no matter whether people are believers or not, it says something to the world, something beautiful,' she concluded. A moment of unity The reopening of Notre Dame is also a moment of cultural and national unity. Macron, who vowed to restore the cathedral within five years after the fire, called the project 'a jolt of hope' for France, a nation often divided by political crises. Challenges overcome The path to restoration was fraught with challenges. Lead contamination forced work to pause, and the COVID-19 pandemic added delays. Yet the project, overseen by architect Philippe Villeneuve, has been hailed as a triumph of human ingenuity and collective resolve. Cutting-edge fire prevention systems, including thermal cameras and a misting system, have been installed to safeguard the cathedral’s future. Villeneuve described the effort as 'restoring not just a building but the soul of a nation,' emphasizing the personal and national significance of the work. A sacred future and an ‘octave’ With its spire once again piercing the Parisian sky, Notre Dame is poised to reclaim its role as a global beacon of faith and art. The cathedral, which previously welcomed 12 million annual visitors, is expected to draw 15 million in its new chapter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/notre-dame-hosts-first-mass-since-2019-fire/7892164.html	2024-12-08T17:08:26-08:00	
Australia outlines changes to anti-slavery law	Sydney — Civil society groups and academics say that Australia is falling behind other countries in tackling slavery. The government this week released its response to an independent assessment of Australia's slavery laws. The review found that the legislation had 'not yet caused meaningful change' for victims and made various recommendations to strengthen the law. The Australian government has accepted 25 of 30 recommendations made by an independent assessment of Australia’s Modern Slavery Act of 2018. While some activists and unions say the government’s responses are positive, other campaigners say they fear Australia is doing much less than other countries to combat modern slavery and human trafficking. Justine Nolan, director of the Australian Human Rights Institute, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Saturday that the reforms could be delayed by federal elections due before next May. 'There is a danger of this again getting lost in the election cycle with everything, sort of, stopping very early in the new year. We have just had a visit from the U.N. special rapporteur, who has recognized that Australia has a problem in this. This is not something we can keep waiting on,' said Nolan. Under recommended legislative changes, Australian authorities would have to publish locations and industries known to be high risk for modern slavery, including agriculture and construction. The government said in a statement that 'modern slavery practices rob an individual of their freedom and control over their lives. From the trafficking of children, to the criminal exploitation of workers, to an individual forced into servitude — these practices are major violations of human rights.' James Cockayne is the anti-slavery commissioner in the state of New South Wales, responsible for increasing awareness about exploitation. He recently told local media that other global jurisdictions are expanding anti-slavery laws. 'The legislative landscape is moving pretty rapidly on these things internationally at the moment. There has been significant developments in the EU and continue to be day-on-day,' he said. Canada’s modern slavery law came into effect early this year. It requires companies to file annual reports on efforts to identify and prevent forced and child labor. The 2023 Global Slavery Index, published by the campaign group Walk Free, estimated there are 50 million people in modern slavery. In Australia, it is estimated that 41,000 people are being exploited.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-outlines-changes-to-anti-slavery-law/7892158.html	2024-12-08T16:42:21-08:00	
Georgian journalists allege brutal beatings; protests rage against ending EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia — Tens of thousands of people joined an 11th straight day of protests in Georgia on Sunday after the governing party moved to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union, while a separate demonstration decried violence against Georgian journalists covering the rallies. Police have been using increasing force in their attempts to curb the demonstrations, which have centered on the parliament building in the capital, Tbilisi. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas every day to disperse the rallies, beating scores of protesters who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital’s central boulevard. At Saturday night’s demonstration, reporter Maka Chikhladze and her colleague from the independent Pirveli TV channel were targeted by a violent mob, Chikhladze told The Associated Press. Chikladze said her colleague managed to capture footage of men dressed in black who were beating demonstrators before they turned on the pair, violently pushing Chikhladze to the ground. She later told AP that her colleague sustained a head injury and had his camera stolen. Chikhladze charged that Georgia’s government was using bands of thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, an allegation denied by representatives of the Georgian Dream party. On Sunday, several hundred media workers marched down Tbilisi’s central Rustaveli Avenue before putting up posters of colleagues they say had been assaulted while doing their jobs. 'Our colleagues are beaten, injured, some remain in hospital in serious condition,' TV Pirveli anchor Ekaterine Mishveladze told AP. In a separate incident Saturday, AP journalists saw several masked men violently tackle a protester attempting to enter the offices of an opposition party, Ahali. The man, Koba Khabazi, lay slumped on the ground while his attackers repeatedly kicked him. He later showed AP his head injuries. Georgian Dream retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 election, a vote widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia’s help and have boycotted parliament sessions. Opposition protests gained new momentum after the Georgian Dream’s decision last Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the rallies and beat scores of protesters, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on Rustaveli Avenue. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials. Speaking Thursday at a ministerial conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken denounced what he described as the brutal 'repression of those calling for their country to stay on the path to closer ties with Europe.' Mamuka Mdinanradze, leader of the Georgian Dream party, condemned mob violence against protesters during a news briefing Sunday, and denied any connection with the government. The office of Georgia’s rights ombudsman issued a statement Sunday criticizing Georgian police for 'failing to take adequate measures' to ensure safety during the demonstrations. President Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, refused to recognize the official election results and contested them before the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal earlier this week. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. The law requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-journalists-allege-brutal-beatings-protests-rage-against-ending-eu-talks/7892149.html	2024-12-08T16:32:19-08:00	
Biden and Trump address regime collapse in Syria	Both U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump reacted Sunday to the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria.

From VOA Turkish: Kurdish politicians in Turkey are satisfied with fall of Assad regime but wary of future	Kurdish politicians in Turkey expressed their satisfaction with the end of the Assad regime in Syria. Speaking to VOA Turkish, several Kurdish politicians in Turkey called on Ankara to see the Kurds in Syria as friends and allies rather than as a threat. They also called on Kurdish groups in Syria to reconcile with Turkey. Following the developments in Syria, the first statement from Kurdish political actors in Turkey came from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM Party). The DEM Party suggested a transitional administration in which ethnic and religious groups in Syria would be represented and called for the United Nations to take responsibility for the return of refugees.

Taylor Swift’s record-breaking ‘Eras Tour’ ends in Vancouver	Vancouver, British Columbia — Taylor Swift’s 'The Eras Tour' officially ended Sunday in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The nearly two-year-long tour was record-breaking and trend-setting. It is finally the end of an era for Taylor Swift. The last show here in Vancouver is the finale of a 149-concert tour that spanned almost two years. It is estimated that it earned around two-billion dollars since the first concert in March 2023. Each concert lasted about three-and-a-half hours and featured at least 44 songs, divided into 10 parts, or 'eras,' of her recording career. The tour stopped in 53 cities on five continents. For Vancouver residents, the arrival of Swiftmania took over the city and drew comparisons to when the area hosted the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. Chris May is the general manager of BC Place Stadium, the venue that hosted the final three Swift concerts. He said organizing and preparations for these concerts was similar to ceremonies for the Olympics, Paralympics and the 2015 Women’s World Cup of Soccer, which were held in the stadium. He said 70% of attendees for the final concerts were from outside of the greater Vancouver area. 'That means we have a huge amount of guests that have never been here before. So, you know, it's working through those realities of ensuring we have enough staffing, enough signage and wayfinding, and people to help to get people where they're going,' he said. May said the April 2024 concert for Diljit Dosanjh, which was the biggest Punjabi music concert outside of India, drew more than 50,000 fans. All told, Swift's three Vancouver concerts drew about 160,000 people. Jarrett Vaughan, an adjunct professor at the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia, said Swift’s adept use of social media played a crucial role in the tour’s success. He also said the COVID-19 pandemic played a part for some younger members of her audience. 'I think when we look at the current audience that she has, you know, they were fairly young at that time. They didn't have the opportunity to attend concerts going through maybe middle school or elementary school, and so for them now, to be able to attend something like this is pretty remarkable,' he said. Vaughan said the legacy of the Eras Tour will not solely be just Swift’s use of social media, but the positivity she created for her fan base. Stephanie Burt is an English professor at Harvard College and recently taught a very popular class at the school on Swift. For her, the secret to Swift’s Eras Tour and her career itself is simple, she is really good at writing songs that are aspirational and relatable. 'We hear the songs, and we hear both someone who's already like us and someone who we want to be more like and want to be closer to and aspire to be like. That's a rare gift to extend it that long, and the tour testifies to the persistence of her talent and to her versatility and to her ability to collaborate and organize and plan,' she said. Vancouver’s tourism office estimates the final dates of Swift’s tour boosted the city’s economy by $112 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taylor-swift-s-record-breaking-eras-tour-ends-in-vancouver/7892139.html	2024-12-08T16:11:37-08:00	
From VOA Turkish: Some Syrians in Istanbul want to return to their hometowns after Assad’s fall	As the 61-year Baathist regime comes to an end, with Syrian President Bashar Assad leaving the country, one of the largest celebrations abroad is being held in Turkey, which hosts nearly 3 million Syrian refugees. Istanbul, which hosts nearly 500,000 Syrian refugees, has been the scene of many demonstrations since Saturday evening. Sunday, opponents of the regime removed the Syrian flag hanging at the Syrian Consulate General in Istanbul’s Tesvikiye district, and they celebrated the victory of rebel forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) at the historic Fatih Mosque and Saraçhane Square throughout the day. VOA Turkish talked to Syrians celebrating Assad’s fall in Istanbul.

Reindeer' volunteers bring holiday magic to Ukrainian children on front lines	IZIUM, Ukraine — Hopes for victory, a swift end to the war and prayers for their loved ones' survival or return from Russian captivity are among the wishes scattered throughout letters sent to a volunteer group by Ukrainian children living in front-line areas. While the volunteers, who are named reindeer after the magical beasts that pull Santa’s sleigh, cannot fulfill many of these dreams, they strive to deliver on the simpler ones, such as requests for power banks to help families endure outages, bicycles, books, and even pets. Every winter, the volunteers travel to heavily damaged cities to deliver gifts and ensure that, despite the war, Ukrainian children can celebrate the holiday season just like their peers around the world. This year, the group received 2,310 letters, according to project manager Inna Achkasova from the NGO Ukrainian Frontiers, who launched the St. Nicholas’ Reindeers initiative in 2015. The children’s wishes are published on the project’s website. Donors affectionately known as magicians then choose a letter and buy the requested gift to make that child's dreams come true. The reindeer then deliver those gifts. 'Children are those who have no choice whatsoever. No one asks them whether they want to stay or leave,' says project psychologist Kateryna Shutalova. 'What happens to them is never their choice. And this makes them the most vulnerable.' But every child gets only one childhood, even if it’s shaped by war. That’s why, in their letters, the horrors that have impacted their lives coexist with wishes similar to those of children everywhere. 'My father is in captivity, and I live with my mother and brother,' one boy wrote in his letter. He continued: 'I love playing football and practice it professionally. I want a leather football.' Volunteers sift through all the letters, enduring the tragic stories of each child, to sort and deliver the gifts correctly. Among the writers are children who have lost loved ones to shelling, endured Russian occupation, seen their homes destroyed, have parents serving on the front lines, or were forced to flee to escape the war. 'What struck me wasn’t their wishes but how deeply children feel the need to tell their stories,' Shutalova says. Wearing reindeer antlers, the volunteers set out on their journey on Dec. 6, when Ukraine celebrates St. Nicholas Day. Their journey is expected to last until mid-January. On a frosty morning in Kharkiv, covered by the season’s first snow, a team of volunteers departs in two buses filled with gifts, headed for the formerly Russian-occupied city of Izium, around 55 kilometers (35 miles) from the front line. At first, when the celebration has started, the children observe cautiously, their expressions somber, but that mood doesn't last. With each activity, they became more cheerful and engaged. One of them is 9-year-old Alina Soboleva, who remains detached despite the volunteers’ efforts. She watches the festivities unfold with a quiet gaze. Her grandmother, Svitlana Lokotosh, explains that Alina has been withdrawn since witnessing the deaths of her mother and other grandmother in a shelling in the courtyard of their home. Alina had been watching through the window as her mother spoke on the phone. When the shell struck, a fragment hit her mother in the neck. Her grandmother rushed outside to help and was killed by another shell. In her letter, Alina asked for two pet mice. She said it was her dream. 'Our only wish is for peace and quiet,' says Lokotosh, who took Alina in after her mother’s death. 'So the children don’t have to be afraid.' Shutalova explains that parents often find it hard to talk to their children about the war. They’re either afraid, lack the emotional resources, or are overwhelmed by their feelings. 'But for children to process what they’ve been through, they need to talk, play, and express those emotions,' she says. At the celebration, parents stand against the walls, smiling as their children laugh and play despite having endured so much at such a young age. Among them is Anna Bolharska, a 32-year-old mother of two. Her father-in-law was killed, and her brother-in-law was injured during the occupation. In the spring of 2022, she and her children fled Izium amid relentless shelling, only returning after Ukrainian forces liberated the city in September that year. 'I don’t like to remember those times. We try to move forward because dwelling on it is too hard mentally,' Bolharska says. 'We try not to remind the children and to keep them distracted.' Her 9-year-old daughter, Myroslava Bolharska, dreams of becoming a veterinarian. In her letter, she asked for a guitar. 'During the war it seems everyone’s dreams have changed — to wish for the war to end,' she wrote. The reindeers' winter journey will take them to over 40 towns in the coming weeks. They hope to realize many dreams and bring joy to the kids, even though some of their wishes are impossible to fulfill. 'Some children wrote in their letters that they want their childhood back,' project co-founder Inna Achkasova says, adding that the reindeer volunteers aim to ensure that every child feels seen, heard and loved.	https://www.voanews.com/a/reindeer-volunteers-bring-holiday-magic-to-ukrainian-children-on-front-lines/7891899.html	2024-12-08T15:49:42-08:00	
From VOA Turkish: Analysts: Turkey is the biggest winner, Russia and Iran are the biggest losers in Syria	The civil war in Syria, which began in 2011, gained a new dimension with the overthrow of the Assad regime. After armed rebel groups let by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) entered Damascus, Assad left Syria. Russian state media reported that Assad and his family arrived in Moscow. Military sources and experts in France who assessed the developments for VOA Turkish agreed that the biggest winner in the latest developments is Turkey, 'while the biggest losers are Iran and Russia.' However, they said the way negotiations between HTS and Turkey proceed, especially on the Kurdish issue, will be decisive.

Iran Foreign Ministry The ministry said in statement Iran respects Syria's unity and national sovereignty and called for 'the swift end of military conflicts, the prevention of terrorist actions, and the commencement of national dialog' with all sectors of Syrian society. Tehran said it would continue to support international mechanisms for pursuing the political process, adding that long-standing and friendly relations between the Iranian and Syrian nations are expected to continue. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu The fall of Assad, a major link in the Iranian axis, is an historic day and a direct result of blows dealt to Hezbollah and Iran by Israel, Netanyahu said. 'We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border,' he added. U.S. President Joe Biden 'President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners,' the White House said in a statement. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump 'Assad is gone. He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer,' Trump posted on Truth Social. 'Russia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success.' Russian Foreign Ministry The ministry said in a statement, Syrian President Bashar Assad has left office and departed the country after giving orders for there be a peaceful handover of power. The ministry did not say where Assad was now and said Russia has not taken part in the talks around his departure.

Jordan's King Abdullah King Abdullah said Jordan respected the choices of the Syrian people. He urged the avoidance of any conflict in Syria that might lead to chaos and stressed the need to protect the security of his country's northern neighbor, according to a statement published by the Royal Hashemite Court. French President Emmanuel Macron 'The barbaric state has fallen. Finally. I pay tribute to the Syrian people, to their courage, to their patience. In this moment of uncertainty, I wish them peace, freedom and unity,' Macron said in a post on X social media. 'France will remain committed to the security of all in the Middle East.' U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer 'The Syrian people have suffered under Assad’s barbaric regime for too long and we welcome his departure.' 'Our focus is now on ensuring a political solution prevails, and peace and stability is restored.' 'We call on all sides to protect civilians and minorities and ensure essential aid can reach the most vulnerable in the coming hours and days.' Qatar Foreign Ministry Qatar's foreign ministry renewed its call to end the crisis in Syria along the lines of the 2015 U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 which laid out the steps for a ceasefire and political transition. The foreign ministry said it is following developments in Syria with interest and called for the preservation of the unity of the state. Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been communicating with all regional actors on Syria and is determined to do what is possible to avoid a chaotic outcome for the country, a Saudi official told Reuters. 'We have been in contact with all actors in the region.

Foreign Ministry of Egypt Egypt has called on all parties in Syria to preserve the capabilities of the state and national institutions, the Egyptian foreign ministry said. The foreign ministry affirmed its support for the Syrian people and the country's sovereignty and unity. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan Syria has reached a stage where the Syrian people will shape the future of their own country, today there is hope, Fidan said in a news conference in Doha. The Syrian people cannot do this alone. Turkey attaches importance to Syrian territorial integrity. A new Syrian administration must be established inclusively, there should be no desire for revenge. Turkey calls on all actors to act with prudence and to be watchful. Terrorist organizations must not be allowed to take advantage of this situation. Opposition groups must be united. We will work for stability and safety in Syria. The new Syria should not pose a threat to neighbors, it should eliminate threats. Any extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) cannot be considered a legitimate counterpart in Syria. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha 'Assad has fallen. This is how it has always been and will always be for dictators who bet on Putin. He always betrays those who rely on him. The main goal now is to restore security in Syria and effectively protect its people from violence.' Konstantin Kosachyov, Russian Lawmaker Syrians will have to cope with a full-scale civil war alone, deputy chairman of Russia's upper house of parliament Konstantin Kosachyov said, the Interfax news agency reported. Afghanistan Taliban Administration's Ministry of Foreign Affairs 'Afghanistan congratulates the leadership of the movement and the people of Syria on the recent developments, which have resulted in the removal of key factors contributing to conflict & instability.' 'The capital, Damascus, has come under control of Syrian people under the leadership of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and we express hope that the remaining phases of the revolution will be managed effectively to establish a peaceful, unified, & stable governance system.' Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Daniel Shapiro 'The United States will continue to maintain its presence in eastern Syria and will take measures necessary to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State,' Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Daniel Shapiro told the Manama Dialogue security conference in Bahrain. Shapiro called on all parties to protect civilians, particularly minorities, and respect international norms. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock 'It is impossible to say exactly what is happening in Syria now. But one thing is clear: for millions of people in Syria, the end of Assad means the first big sigh of relief after an eternity of atrocities committed by the Assad regime.' 'Assad has murdered, tortured and used poison gas against his own people. He must finally be held accountable for this. 'The country must not now fall into the hands of other radicals — regardless of the guise. We therefore call on the parties to the conflict to live up to their responsibility for all Syrians. This includes the comprehensive protection of ethnic and religious minorities such as Kurds, Alawites or Christians and an inclusive political process that creates a balance between the groups.' German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz 'Bashar al Assad has brutally oppressed his own people, has countless lives on his conscience and has driven numerous people to flee Syria, many of whom have also come to Germany. The Syrian people have experienced appalling suffering. The end of Assad's rule over Syria is therefore good news. 'What matters now is that law and order are quickly restored in Syria. All religious communities, all minorities must enjoy protection now and in the future.' Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani 'We are calling for a peaceful handover between the fallen regime and the new reality, so for a peaceful rather than military transition. It seems to me that at the moment things are going in this direction,' Tajani said in a press conference. U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen Special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen underscores the clear desire expressed by millions of Syrians that stable and inclusive transitional arrangements are put in place, a statement said. He urged all Syrians to prioritize dialog, unity, and respect for international humanitarian law and human rights as they seek to rebuild their society, adding he stands ready to support the Syrian people in their journey toward a stable and inclusive future. 'Today marks a watershed moment in Syria’s history — a nation that has endured nearly 14 years of relentless suffering and unspeakable loss... This dark chapter has left deep scars, but today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new one— one of peace, reconciliation, dignity, and inclusion for all Syrians.' U.N. Aid Chief Tom Fletcher 'Events in Syria moving at remarkable pace. More than [a] decade of conflict has displaced millions. Now many more are in danger. We will respond wherever, whenever, however we can to support people in need, including reception centers —food, water, fuel, tents, blankets.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-reaction-to-end-of-assad-rule-in-syria/7891894.html	2024-12-08T15:14:50-08:00	
Timeline: Assad's fall followed years of bloodshed and division	The collapse of Bashar Assad's rule over Syria marks the culmination of a nearly 14-year rebellion and a key moment in a civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced half the population and drew in outside powers. This is how it unfolded: 2011 - The first protests of Assad quickly spread across the country and were met by security forces with a wave of arrests and shootings. Some protesters take up guns and military units defect as the uprising becomes an armed revolt that will gain support from Western and Arab countries and Turkey. 2012 - A bombing in Damascus is the first by al-Qaida's new Syrian affiliate, the Nusra Front, which gains in power and starts crushing groups with a nationalist ideology. World powers meet in Geneva and agree on the need for a political transition, but their divisions on how to achieve it will foil years of U.N.-sponsored peace efforts. Assad turns his air force on opposition strongholds, as rebels gain ground, and the war escalates with massacres on both sides. 2013 - Lebanon's Hezbollah helps Assad to victory at Qusayr, halting rebel momentum and showing the Iran-backed group's growing role in the conflict. Washington has declared chemical weapons use a red line, but a gas attack on rebel-held eastern Ghouta near Damascus kills scores of civilians without triggering a U.S. military response. 2014 - Islamic State group suddenly seizes Raqqa in the northeast and swathes more territory in Syria and Iraq. Rebels in the Old City of Homs surrender, agreeing to move to an outer suburb — their first big defeat in a major urban area and a precursor to future 'evacuation' deals. Washington builds an anti-Islamic State coalition and starts airstrikes, helping Kurdish forces turn the jihadi tide but creating friction with its ally Turkey. 2015 - With better cooperation and more arms from abroad, rebel groups gain more ground and seize northwestern Idlib, but Islamist militants are taking a bigger role. Russia joins the war on Assad's side with air strikes that turn the conflict against the rebels for years to come. 2016 - Alarmed by Kurdish advances on the border, Turkey launches an incursion with allied rebels, making a new zone of Turkish control. The Syrian army and its allies defeat rebels in Aleppo, seen at the time as Assad's biggest victory of the war. The Nusra Front splits from al-Qaida and starts trying to present itself in a moderate light, adopting a series of new names and eventually settling on Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). 2017 - Israel acknowledges airstrikes against Hezbollah in Syria, aiming to degrade the growing strength of Iran and its allies. U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces defeat Islamic State in Raqqa. That offensive, and a rival one by the Syrian army, drive the jihadi group from nearly all its land. 2018 - The Syrian army recaptures eastern Ghouta, before quickly retaking the other insurgent enclaves in central Syria, and then the rebels' southern bastion of Deraa. 2019 - Islamic State loses its last scrap of territory in Syria. The U.S. decides to keep some troops in the country to prevent attacks on its Kurdish allies. 2020 - Russia backs a government offensive that ends with a ceasefire with Turkey that freezes most front lines. Assad holds most territory and all main cities, appearing deeply entrenched. Rebels hold the northwest. A Turkey-backed force holds a border strip. Kurdish-led forces control the northeast. 2023 - The Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 triggers fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, ultimately reducing the group's presence in Syria and fatally undermining Assad. 2024 - Rebels launch a new assault on Aleppo. With Assad's allies focused elsewhere his army quickly collapses. Eight days after the fall of Aleppo the rebels have taken most major cities and entered Damascus, driving Assad from power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/timeline-assad-s-fall-followed-years-of-bloodshed-and-division/7891891.html	2024-12-08T14:55:11-08:00	
Kennedy Center honors Coppola, the Grateful Dead, Raitt and Sandoval	Washington — Celebrities, cultural icons and a few surprise guests are gathering for the annual Kennedy Center Honors celebration Sunday evening in Washington. This year's recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment are director and filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, the Grateful Dead, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, and singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt. In addition, the venerable Harlem theater The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, is being recognized. There will be personalized tributes with performances and testimonials from fellow artists during the gala at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Medallions were presented during the traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department. The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, 'If I Could Turn Back Time.' Several of the latest honorees have themselves participated in past tributes to friends and colleagues at the Kennedy Center. Coppola spoke during fellow director Martin Scorsese's induction in 2007. Sandoval performed in the tribute to his mentor, jazz trumpet legend Dizzy Gillespie. Raitt has taken part in tributes to Buddy Guy and Mavis Staples. Raitt even attended the Kennedy Center Honors in the 1970s when her father, Broadway performer John Raitt, was taking part in a tribute to composer Richard Rogers. The tribute to the Grateful Dead is expected to double as a memorial to the band's founding bass player Phil Lesh, who died in October at age 84. This could also be the last Kennedy Center Honors ceremony without political intrigue for a while. During Republican Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term. Democratic President Joe Biden is scheduled to host a reception for the honorees at the White House and plans to attend the Kennedy Center ceremony afterward. The show will air on CBS on Dec. 22.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kennedy-center-honors-coppola-the-grateful-dead-raitt-and-sandoval/7891876.html	2024-12-08T13:58:47-08:00	
Biden: Assad’s Syrian collapse a ‘fundamental act of justice’	U.S. President Joe Biden declared Sunday that the sudden demise of the Syrian government under Bashar Assad was a 'fundamental act of justice,' but that it was 'a moment of uncertainty' for the Mideast. Biden, speaking at the White House, said the collapse of the decades-long iron rule by the Assad family was 'the best opportunity in a generation for the Syrian people to forge their own destiny.' Biden said that action by the U.S. and its allies over the last two years weakened Syria's backers — Russia, Iran and Iran-supported Hezbollah militants in Lebanon — to the extent that 'for the first time' they could no longer defend the Assad government. 'Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,' Biden said, after a meeting with his national security advisers at the White House. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that Assad had fled his country, which his family had ruled for decades, because close ally Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, 'was not interested in protecting him any longer.' Trump’s comments on his social media platform came a day after he decried the possibility that the U.S. might intervene militarily in Syria to aid the rebels as they moved to oust Assad, declaring, 'THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT.' The Biden administration had no intention of intervening, according to Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. The U.S has about 900 troops in Syria, including forces working with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group. Biden said he intends for those troops to remain, adding that U.S. forces on Sunday conducted 'dozens' of what he called 'precision airstrikes' on Islamic State camps and operations in Syria. Biden said the U.S. is 'clear eyed' that ISIS will try to take advantage of the situation in Syria. The Syrian opposition that brought down Assad is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The Biden administration has designated the group as a terrorist organization and says it has links to al-Qaida, although Hayat Tahrir al-Sham says it has since broken ties with al-Qaida. 'We will remain vigilant,' Biden said. 'Make no mistake, some of the rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human rights abuses.' He added that the groups are 'saying the right things now.' 'But as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions,' Biden said. Trump, who takes office January 20, linked the upheaval in Syria and Russia's war in Ukraine, noting that Assad's allies in Moscow, as well as in Iran, the main sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah, 'are in a weakened state right now.' Vice President-elect JD Vance, a veteran of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, wrote on his own social media Sunday to express skepticism about the insurgents. 'Many of 'the rebels' are a literal offshoot of ISIS. One can hope they've moderated. Time will tell,' he said. With the collapse of the Assad regime, the family of missing U.S. journalist Austin Tice renewed calls to find him. 'To everyone in Syria that hears this, please remind people that we're waiting for Austin,' Tice's mother, Debra, said in comments that hostage advocacy groups spread on social media. 'We know that when he comes out, he's going to be fairly dazed & he's going to need lots of care & direction. Direct him to his family please!' Tice disappeared in 2012 outside Damascus. 'We've remained committed to returning him to his family,' Biden told reporters. 'We believe he's alive, we think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence to that yet. And Assad should be held accountable.' The president added: 'We have to identify where he [Tice] is.' Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-assad-s-syrian-collapse-a-fundamental-act-of-justice-/7891867.html	2024-12-08T13:44:18-08:00	
How it happened: Two seismic weeks that toppled Syria's government	London — Half a century of rule by the Assad family in Syria crumbled with astonishing speed after insurgents burst out of a rebel-held enclave and converged on the capital, Damascus, taking city after city in a matter of days. Opposition forces swept across the country and entered Damascus with little or no resistance as the Syrian army melted away. President Bashar Assad, Syria’s ruler for 24 years — succeeding his father, Hafez Assad — fled the country. Russian state media reported that he was in Moscow. It’s a stunning development in Syria’s devastating 13-year conflict. Anti-government protests in 2011 met with a brutal crackdown, escalating into a civil war that has killed more than half a million people and displaced half of Syria’s prewar population of 23 million. Assad, backed by Iran and Russia, gradually regained control of more than two-thirds of Syria, leaving the rebels with one stronghold in the northwest of the country. And there the conflict remained, largely frozen, for years until late November. Here’s a look at a seismic two weeks for the Middle East. Wednesday, Nov. 27: Rebel offensive begins Armed opposition groups launch a large-scale attack on areas controlled by government forces in northwestern Syria and claim to have wrested control of over 15 villages from government forces in northwestern Aleppo province. The government and its allies respond with airstrikes and shelling in an attempt to halt the insurgent advances. The offensive is led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Formerly the Syrian branch of al-Qaida and known as the Nusra Front, HTS later distanced itself from al-Qaida, seeking to market itself as a more moderate group. It is classed as a terrorist group by the United Nations and the U.S. The attack on Aleppo follows weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. Turkey, a main backer of Syrian opposition groups, says the rebels began a limited offensive to stop the attacks, but it expanded as government forces began to retreat. Thursday, Nov. 28: The offensive expands The offensive expands to reach the countryside of Idlib province amid reports government troops are retreating. Friday, Nov. 29: Rebels enter Aleppo The insurgents enter Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, for the first time since they were pushed out in 2016 after a grueling military campaign by Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran. They meet with little resistance. Saturday, Nov. 30: Aleppo falls under insurgent control The rebels say they control Aleppo, raising a flag over the city’s citadel and occupying the international airport. The Syrian armed forces claim to have redeployed troops and equipment in preparation for a counterattack. By evening, the insurgents seized at least four towns in the central Hama province and claim to have entered the provincial capital. Sunday, Dec. 1: The government fights back The Syrian military launches a counterattack with troops and airstrikes on Idlib and Aleppo. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visits Damascus, telling Assad that Tehran will support the counteroffensive. But Assad receives little, if any, help from his allies. Russia is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Iran has seen its proxies across the region degraded by regular airstrikes. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up Assad’s forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Monday, Dec. 2 - Wednesday, Dec. 4: Fighting rages near Hama The insurgents push south, advancing to within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of Hama, the country’s fourth-largest city and a key crossroads in central Syria, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Damascus. State media reports fierce fighting in the province, and both state media and a U.K.-based observer group say government forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, have recaptured some territory. Turkey urges Assad to hold talks with the opposition. Thursday, Dec. 5: Insurgents capture Hama After several days of fighting the rebels swept into Hama. Dozens of jubilant fighters are seen firing weapons into the air in celebration in Assi Square, the site of massive anti-government protests in the early days of the uprising in 2011. The Syrian army says it has redeployed to positions outside the city to protect civilians. Friday, Dec. 6: Rebels advance on Homs Rapidly advancing now, the rebels seize two towns on the outskirts of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city. About 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Hama, Homs is the gateway to Damascus and the location of one of Syria’s two state-owned oil refineries. Capturing it would cut the link between Damascus, Assad’s seat of power, and the coastal region where he enjoys wide support. The government denies reports that its military has withdrawn from the city. Top diplomats from countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and Russia, hold talks on Syria in the Qatari capital, Doha. Saturday, Dec. 7: Homs falls, Assad’s grip weakens Opposition forces take Homs after government forces abandon it. The insurgents say they have encircled Damascus and are carrying out the 'final stage' of their offensive. The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, seeks urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition,' as Syrian state media denies Assad has fled the country. Sunday, Dec. 8: Assad is toppled Syrian state television airs a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad has been overthrown, and all prisoners have been set free. HTS commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani visits the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and calls Assad’s fall a victory for 'the Islamic nation.' Russian officials and Iranian state TV say Assad has left Syria. Russian state news agencies later report he and his family are in Moscow and were granted asylum. Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali says Syria's government is ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-it-happened-two-seismic-weeks-that-toppled-syria-s-government/7891849.html	2024-12-08T13:30:42-08:00	
Ukrainian couple takes care of abandoned animals despite shelling	The town of Orikhiv in southeastern Ukraine is located just ten kilometers from the front lines and is under almost-constant Russian shelling. Only some 900 people remain, a fraction of those who lived there before the war. Among them is the couple of Yuriy and Lubov Lysenko, who have been caring for dozens of animals that their neighbors left behind. Eva Myronova has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

India not pursuing shared BRICS currency, analysts say	NEW DELHI — India is not pursuing the creation of a shared BRICS currency, an idea that has met with a strong verbal pushback from incoming U.S. President Donald Trump, but the South Asian giant is making efforts to promote trade in its local currency, according to analysts in New Delhi. Trump has threatened a 100% tariff on products from BRICS nations if they develop their own currency to replace the U.S. dollar. The BRICS bloc, which began with China, Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa, expanded this year to include Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia and Egypt. 'We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency nor back any other currency to replace the mighty U.S. dollar,' Trump said in a post on the Truth Social media platform. Talk of a BRICS currency gained some momentum following U.S.-led sanctions on Russia in 2022 and since, in recent years, economic and political tensions have grown between the West and China. Russia and China have publicly expressed a desire to explore diversification of international trade away from the dollar. Ajai Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations, though, said New Delhi does not plan to move away from the American currency. 'Trump’s post is like a forewarning to tread carefully down this road. But at the moment, this is just an idea, and a common BRICS currency is simply not on India’s agenda,' Sahai said. The creation of such a currency is unlikely to gain traction due to mistrust and internal differences within major countries in the alliance such as India and China, according to analysts working in the Indian capital. 'India is not supportive of this particular initiative. Any common currency is not going to help anyone; only the dominant countries like China ultimately will dictate. So, it is very difficult to develop a consensus to have a common currency,' according to Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga Institute of Indo Pacific Studies. The emerging countries group is also too diverse to make it economically viable to forge a competing currency, according to Mahapatra. 'Unlike the European Union, we [BRICS countries] don’t have a common market. We don’t have a common trade policy. We have nothing in common,' Mahapatra said. At the same time, several BRICS members have accelerated efforts to explore ways to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar, which has been the world’s dominant currency since the end of World War II. BRICS countries account for about 40% of the world’s population and an estimated one-third of global gross domestic product. At a summit held in the Russian city of Kazan in October, BRICS nations agreed to boost efforts to trade in local currencies rather than in U.S. dollars and said they would strengthen banking networks within the group to facilitate settlements in their currencies. 'Trade in local currencies and smooth cross-border payments will strengthen our economic cooperation,' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said. India, which adopted a new foreign trade policy last year to support using the rupee more frequently for trade, has identified 17 countries with which it wants to use rupees or the other country’s currency, according to Biswajit Dhar, a senior professor at the Council for Social Development in New Delhi. Those countries include Russia. New Delhi, which did not join U.S. sanctions against Russia, is paying for its crude oil imports from Moscow in rupees. As trade with Russia increases exponentially, though, that also presents problems. 'India runs a huge trade deficit vis-a-vis Russia, which means that when India is buying a lot of oil and is paying in rupees, Russia does not know what to do with the stock of rupees it is holding now,' Dhar said. 'Indian businesses are wary of selling to Russia because of the sanctions.' he said. Aside from Russia, other countries such as Malaysia, Kenya, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh also have agreed to facilitate trade in rupees. Such efforts however are modest, and India’s international trade is still dominated by the dollar. Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar Subramanian has said that moving away from the U.S. currency is not part of New Delhi’s economic policy. 'We have never actively targeted the dollar. That's not part of either our economic policy or our political or strategic policy,' he said responding to a question on dedollarization at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington in October. But in an indirect reference to Russia, he said that India had to look for 'workarounds' when trade in dollars with some partners became difficult. 'It was the U.S. actions targeting Russia that made countries search for mechanisms and options to the dollar. It was not to dislodge the dollar’s position,' according to Ajay Srivastava, of the Global Trade Research Initiative. However, he said Trump’s threat to impose 100% tariffs on products coming from countries adopting a BRICS currency makes the idea of such a potential new currency 'unrealistic and more symbolic than practical.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-not-pursuing-shared-brics-currency-analysts-say/7888407.html	2024-12-08T12:31:12-08:00

Trump: Sweeping changes starting on 1st day he takes office	Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is vowing to make swift and sweeping changes as he takes office on January 20, deporting millions of migrants in the country illegally, imposing tariffs on imported goods that could raise consumer prices for Americans and pardoning rioters who tried to upend his 2020 reelection loss. Six weeks ahead of taking office for a new four-year tenure in the White House, Trump seemed emboldened by his victory last month, making him only the second American president elected to a second, nonconsecutive term after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. 'People like me now, you know?' he told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' in an interview conducted Friday in New York and broadcast Sunday. 'It’s different than the first — you know, when I won the first time [in 2016], I wasn’t nearly as popular as this,' he said. 'And one thing that’s very important, in terms of the election, I love that I won the popular vote, and by a lot,' with about a 2.3 million-vote margin in his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris out of the 155 million ballots that were cast. But Trump, a Republican, also lapsed into familiar grievances, refusing as he has for four years to concede he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden because of unfounded claims of fraudulent balloting and vote counting. Asked by NBC anchor Kristen Welker how, in his view, Democrats were able to steal that election but not the one a month ago, Trump said, 'Because I think it was too big to rig.' Trump blamed Biden for the nation’s political divide and heaped insults on his perceived foes, including the nine-member House of Representatives committee that spent more than a year examining the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters trying to block lawmakers from certifying that Biden had won the 2020 election. He called the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the investigative panel 'political thugs and, you know, creeps. For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.' Trump said that on his first day in office he would be 'acting very quickly' to pardon many of the more than 1,200 people convicted of an array of offenses linked to the rioting at the Capitol. Many of them have already completed their prison sentences while others have years to go or have to be tried. He has characterized those imprisoned as 'hostages' and called them 'patriots.' 'These people are living in hell,' he said. Yet Trump said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden. 'I’m not looking to go back into the past,' he said. 'Retribution will be through success.' But he said that if the Senate confirms his choices of former Florida state attorney general, Pam Bondi, as attorney general, and loyal political supporter Kash Patel as FBI director, they would have autonomy in deciding what to investigate and prosecute. Trump described special counsel Jack Smith, who twice indicted him, as 'very corrupt.' Trump centered much of his campaign on closing the southwestern U.S. border with Mexico and said mass deportations will begin quickly. First will be convicted criminals, he said, while other incoming Trump officials have said those with deportation orders will also be among the first to be deported. 'I think you have to do it, and it’s a hard — it’s a very tough thing to do. It’s — but you have to have, you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally,' he said. Trump made no exceptions for families with mixed immigration status, where some family members are in the U.S. legally and some illegally. 'I don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back,' he declared. Trump said the cost and logistical complexity of such a massive deportation plan does not faze him. 'You have no choice,' he said. 'First of all, they’re costing us a fortune. But we’re starting with the criminals, and we’ve got to do it. And then we’re starting with the others, and we’re going to see how it goes.' But he said he would attempt to work with Democratic lawmakers to exempt so-called 'dreamers' from deportation, young children who were brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents and have little connection to their native countries. He also said he will attempt to end birthright citizenship in the U.S., now embedded in the country’s Constitution, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of the legality of their parents being in the U.S. Trump said he would keep a campaign promise to levy tariffs on imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada. He acknowledged that he could not 'guarantee American families won’t pay more' as a result of his plan. 'I can’t guarantee anything,' Trump said. 'I can’t guarantee tomorrow.' He said he is actively trying to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, 'if I can.' He said Kyiv may not get as much military assistance under his administration as it has under Biden. During a political debate in September, Trump declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-sweeping-changes-starting-on-1st-day-he-takes-office-/7891797.html	2024-12-08T11:57:37-08:00	
‘Moana 2’ cruises to another record weekend, $600 million globally	The Walt Disney Co.'s animated film 'Moana 2' remained at the top of the box office in its second weekend in theaters as it brought in another record haul. The film added $52 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. That brings its domestic total to $300 million, surpassing the original, and its global tally to a staggering $600 million. The amount set a record gross for a movie on the weekend following Thanksgiving weekend, unseating 'Frozen II,' which earned $35.2 million in the same time frame in 2019. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation. Originally conceived as a Disney+ series, 'Moana 2' has already broken into the top five highest grossing releases of the year. Its performance means Disney has three films in this year's top five, including 'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' The studio also has another big movie on the way before the year ends: Barry Jenkins' 'Mufasa,' out Dec. 20. The weekend also showcased several new releases, including A24’s horror comedy 'Y2K' and the Jude Law crime thriller 'The Order.' But nothing was ever going to present significant competition to the enticing Thanksgiving leftovers, 'Moana 2,' 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II.' Second place at the box office was occupied by 'Wicked,' which added $34.9 million, bringing its domestic total to $320.5 million in three weeks. Globally, the musical adaptation released by Universal is at $455.6 million. 'Gladiator II' followed in third place with $12.5 million, while 'Red One' came in fourth with $7 million. 'These holdovers are going to create the momentum that’s going to put an $8.5 billion-plus box office year on the horizon,' said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. Pre-pandemic, $11 billion had become the annual norm for the movie business. Since then, the closest the industry has gotten to that number was last year, which cracked $9 billion. This year started off slow and up to a few months ago, Dergarabedian said, even hitting $8 billion for the year was in doubt. But in the two weeks since Thanksgiving, the deficit from last year has narrowed by over 5%. The newcomers struggled to make a significant impact. Even the 10th anniversary rerelease of Christopher Nolan’s 'Interstellar,' which played in only 165 theaters, did better than 'Y2K' ($2.1 million) and 'The Order' ($878,000) combined. Paramount reported that the science fiction epic starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway brought in an estimated $4.4 million. IMAX also noted that all the 70mm IMAX presentations of 'Interstellar' were sold out through the weekend. 'I was thrilled so many moviegoers took advantage of the original IMAX experience of ‘Interstellar’ this weekend,' Nolan said in a statement. The biggest of the many newcomers was the Indian action pic 'Pushpa: The Rule – Part 2,' which earned $4.9 million. Sony and Crunchyroll's anime release, 'Solo Leveling – ReAwakening,' made $2.4 million. Fathom also released pop duo for KING + COUNTRY’s 'A Drummer Boy Christmas' concert in theaters where it made $2.1 million. 'It’s a really diverse marketplace,' Dergarabedian said. 'There's event cinema, international cinema, a rerelease of a 10-year-old film. It's easily one of the most eclectic and interesting lineups I’ve ever seen.' Next weekend theaters are in for another influx of bigger movies, with both Sony's comic book film 'Kraven the Hunter' and the animated 'The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim' opening in wide release.

UN calls for unity in Syria as rebels topple Assad regime	New York — The U.N. secretary-general called for calm and avoiding violence Sunday, in the aftermath of the sudden and stunning fall of Syria’s Assad regime to rebel forces. 'After 14 years of brutal war and the fall of the dictatorial regime, today the people of Syria can seize an historic opportunity to build a stable and peaceful future,' Antonio Guterres said in a statement. 'The future of Syria is a matter for the Syrians to determine, and my Special Envoy will be working with them towards that end.' His envoy, Geir Pedersen said that the country is in a 'watershed moment' in its history, with immense challenges ahead, and must avoid bloodshed and preserve unity as it transitions. 'This dark chapter has left deep scars, but today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new time — one of peace, reconciliation, dignity, and inclusion for all Syrians,' U.N. Syria envoy Pedersen told reporters in Doha, Qatar where he is attending meetings about the situation. On November 27, multiple rebel groups aligned under the leadership of U.N.-designated terror group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched their biggest challenge in years to the regime of President Bashar Assad. They made stunning gains in just over one week, first sweeping into the northwest city of Aleppo, then taking towns and villages in Idlib governorate. Emboldened, they continued to the central city of Hama and then Homs, capturing them. Late Saturday, the rebels made their way to the capital, Damascus. President Assad and his family reportedly left the city ahead of their arrival to an unknown destination. The U.N. envoy said he had no information on Assad’s whereabouts. On their telegram channel Saturday, HTS announced Assad’s fall and said it is the beginning of a new era for the country, which has been torn apart by nearly 14 years of civil war. It will be a 'new Syria' where 'everyone lives in peace and justice prevails,' the group said. The Assad family has ruled Syria with an iron grip since 1971, first Hafez and then his son, Bashar. 'Let me urge all Syrians to prioritize dialogue, unity, and respect for international humanitarian law and human rights as they seek to rebuild their society,' Pedersen said. 'Let me stress that there must be a collective effort to secure peace and dignity for all.' He said he is ready to support the Syrian people in their journey toward a stable and inclusive future that they will decide and shape themselves. 'But to this end, let me emphasize the clear desire expressed by millions of Syrians that stable and inclusive transitional arrangements are put in place urgently, and that the Syrian institutions continue to function, and that the Syrian people are enabled to begin to chart the path to meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people and restore a unified Syria, with its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, in a way that can receive the support and engagement of the entire international community,' Pedersen said. Pedersen acknowledged that the fact that HTS is a designated terrorist group 'creates challenges.' 'It's extremely important that we now see on the ground a development that proves that we can achieve, you know, a transition to what I hope will be a democratic future for Syria,' he emphasized. The U.N. has been involved in trying to end the Syrian conflict since its start in 2011. Security Council resolution 2254 in 2015 laid out a road map for a Syrian-owned and led process with U.N. facilitation for reaching a political settlement. Mediation has been stalled for years. Pedersen is the fourth in a string of U.N. envoys who have tried to resolve the conflict, which has killed an estimated half-million Syrians and displaced more than 12 million others. The United Nations said Friday that at least 370,000 people have been displaced in northwest Syria in the latest fighting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-calls-for-unity-in-syria-as-rebels-topple-assad-regime-/7891705.html	2024-12-08T09:54:25-08:00	
As Assad falls, fighting intensifying over northern Syria town	Hours after Syrian rebel forces announced the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime, Turkish-backed armed groups launched an attack Sunday on a town in northern Syria under the control of U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces. The Syrian National Army, or SNA, a coalition of Turkish-backed militias, announced advances in several parts of Manbij, a town in northern Syria, as intense clashes erupted with fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), according to the Turkey’s state-run Anadolu. But the Manbij Military Council, which is affiliated with the SDF, denied that 'large parts of the city' have been controlled by Turkish-backed groups, saying in a statement Sunday that its fighters were continuing their military mission in Manbij. The SDF said that several administrative buildings in Manbij were targeted in Turkish military strikes. The Turkish military has not commented on the developments in the city. Manbij, located in Aleppo province, has been under the control of U.S.-backed SDF fighters since it was liberated from Islamic State militants in 2016. But Turkey, which views the SDF as a terrorist organization, has been supporting rebel groups in efforts to expel the Kurdish-led forces from the area. A reporter with VOA’s Kurdish Service in northern Syria said that after hours of fierce fighting between the two sides, some Turkish-backed groups have retreated from Manbij while others remain positioned outside the city. He added that SNA’s Sunday attack was aided by some sleeper cells inside the city. The 11-day rapid rebel offensive across the country, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, resulted in the capture of the capital Damascus and other strategic cities in northwest and central Syria. Simultaneously, an operation led by SNA factions aimed at dislodging Kurdish forces from parts of Aleppo province. Following the collapse of the Syrian regime in Damascus, SDF General Commander Mazloum Abdi stated that the country was experiencing a historic moment. 'This change is an opportunity to build a new Syria based on democracy and justice that guarantee the rights of all Syrians,' he said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

Who is Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of the insurgency that toppled Syria's Assad?	BEIRUT — Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the militant leader whose stunning insurgency toppled Syria's President Bashar Assad, has spent years working to remake his public image, renouncing longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicting himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. In recent days, the insurgency even dropped his nom de guerre and began referring to him by his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa. The extent of that transformation from jihadi extremist to would-be state builder is now put to the test. Insurgents control capital Damascus, Assad has fled into hiding, and for the first time after 50 years of his family's iron hand, it is an open question how Syria will be governed. Syria is home to multiple ethnic and religious communities, often pitted against each other by Assad's state and years of war. Many of them fear the possibility Sunni Islamist extremists will take over. The country is also fragmented among disparate armed factions, and foreign powers from Russia and Iran to the United States, Turkey and Israel all have their hands in the mix. The 42-year-old al-Golani — labeled a terrorist by the United States — has not appeared publicly since Damascus fell early Sunday. But he and his insurgent force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS — many of whose fighters are jihadis — stand to be a major player. For years, al-Golani worked to consolidate power, while bottled up in the province of Idlib in Syria's northwest corner as Assad's Iranian- and Russian-backed rule over much of the country appeared solid. He maneuvered among extremist organizations while eliminating competitors and former allies. He sought to polish the image of his de-facto 'salvation government' that has been running Idlib to win over international governments and reassure Syria's religious and ethnic minorities. And he built ties with various tribes and other groups. Along the way, al-Golani shed his garb as a hard-line Islamist guerrilla and put on suits for press interviews, talking of building state institutions and decentralizing power to reflect Syria's diversity. 'Syria deserves a governing system that is institutional, no one where a single ruler makes arbitrary decisions,' he said in an interview with CNN last week, offering the possibility HTS would eventually be dissolved after Assad falls. 'Don't judge by words, but by actions,' he said. Al-Golani's beginnings in Iraq Al-Golani's ties to al-Qaida stretch back to 2003, when he joined extremists battling U.S. troops in Iraq. The Syrian native was detained by the U.S. military but remained in Iraq. During that time, al-Qaida usurped like-minded groups and formed the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In 2011, a popular uprising against Syria's Assad triggered a brutal government crackdown and led to all-out war. Al-Golani's prominence grew when al-Baghdadi sent him to Syria to establish a branch of al-Qaida called the Nusra Front. The United States labeled the new group as a terrorist organization. That designation still remains in place and the U.S. government has put a $10 million bounty on him. The Nusra Front and the Syrian conflict As Syria's civil war intensified in 2013, so did al-Golani's ambitions. He defied al-Baghdadi's calls to dissolve the Nusra Front and merge it with al-Qaida's operation in Iraq, to form the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Al-Golani nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaida, which later disassociated itself from ISIS. The Nusra Front battled ISIS and eliminated much of its competition among the Syrian armed opposition to Assad. In his first interview in 2014, al-Golani kept his face covered, telling a reporter for Qatari network Al-Jazeera that he rejected political talks in Geneva to end the conflict. He said his goal was to see Syria ruled under Islamic law and made clear that there was no room for the country's Alawite, Shiite, Druze and Christian minorities. Consolidating power and rebranding In 2016, al-Golani revealed his face to the public for the first time in a video message that announced his group was renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham — the Syria Conquest Front — and cutting its ties to al-Qaida. 'This new organization has no affiliation to any external entity,' he said in the video, filmed wearing military garb and a turban. The move paved the way for al-Golani to assert full control over fracturing militant groups. A year later, his alliance rebranded again as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — meaning Organization for Liberating Syria — as the groups merged, consolidating al-Golani's power in northwest Syria's Idlib province. HTS later clashed with independent Islamist militants who opposed the merger, further emboldening al-Golani and his group as the leading power in northwestern Syria, able to rule with an iron fist. With his power consolidated, al-Golani set in motion a transformation that few could have imagined. Replacing his military garb with shirt and trousers, he began calling for religious tolerance and pluralism. He appealed to the Druze community in Idlib, which the Nusra Front had previously targeted, and visited the families of Kurds who were killed by Turkish-backed militias. In 2021, al-Golani had his first interview with an American journalist on PBS. Wearing a blazer, with his short hair gelled back, the now more soft-spoken HTS leader said that his group posed no threat to the West and that sanctions imposed against it were unjust. 'Yes, we have criticized Western policies,' he said. 'But to wage a war against the United States or Europe from Syria, that's not true. We didn't say we wanted to fight.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-is-abu-mohammed-al-golani-the-leader-of-the-insurgency-that-toppled-syria-s-assad-/7891514.html	2024-12-08T06:07:31-08:00	
Trump calls for 'immediate ceasefire' in Ukraine after meeting Zelenskyy in Paris	KYIV — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, shortly after a meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming Kyiv 'would like to make a deal' to end the more than 1,000-day war. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Moscow and Kyiv have both lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that 'should never have started.' 'There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed,' he said, as he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to act to bring the fighting to an end. Trump's remarks came after a meeting Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, that Zelenskyy later described as 'constructive'. Speaking to reporters later that day, Zelenskyy insisted that any peace deal 'should be just' for Ukrainians, 'so that Russia and Putin or any other aggressors will not have the opportunity to return.' In a separate social media update Sunday, Zelenskyy asserted that Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since Moscow's all-out invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, while a further 370,000 have been wounded. Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to publish official casualty figures, but Western officials have said that the past few months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and wounded each month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-calls-for-immediate-ceasefire-in-ukraine-after-meeting-zelenskyy-in-paris-/7891506.html	2024-12-08T05:47:58-08:00

Ghana ruling party candidate concedes in presidential election	ACCRA, GHANA — Ghana's ruling New Patriotic Party candidate, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, on Sunday conceded defeat in the country's presidential election after failing to shake off widespread frustration over the struggling economy. Defeat in Saturday's election ended two terms in power for the NPP under President Nana Akufo-Addo, marked by Ghana's worst economic crisis in years, high inflation and a debt default. 'The people of Ghana have spoken, the people have voted for change at this time and we respect it with all humility,' Bawumia said in a news conference. Bawumia said he had called his opponent, National Democratic Congress (NDC) candidate and former president John Mahama, to congratulate him. Blaring horns and cheering, Mahama supporters were already gathering and celebrating outside the party campaign headquarters in Accra. On his X account, Mahama confirmed he had received Bawumia's congratulatory call over his 'emphatic victory.' The vice president said Mahama won the presidency 'decisively' as well as Mahama's NDC party winning the country's parliament election, according the NPP's own internal tally of votes. Ghana's economic woes dominated the election, after the west Africa gold and cacao producer went through a crisis of default and currency devaluation, ending with a $3 billion International Monetary Fud bailout. Earlier, NDC spokesperson Sammy Gyamfi told reporters the party's internal review of results showed Mahama won 56.3% of the vote against 41.3% for Bawumia. 'It is very clear the people of this country have voted for change,' Gyamfi said. Political parties had agents at polling stations to observe and tally the initial vote counts before the ballots were sent for official collation by the election commission. Earlier, Commission Deputy Commissioner Bossman Asare told reporters regional results had yet to arrive at the national center. The commission had said official results were likely due by Tuesday. With a history of democratic stability, Ghana's two main parties, the NPP and NDC, have alternated in power equally since the return to multiparty politics in 1992. Under the slogan 'Break the 8' -- a reference to two terms in power -- Bawumia had sought to lead the NPP to an unprecedented third term. But he struggled to break away from criticism of Akufo-Addo's economic record. Though inflation slowed from more than 50% to around 23%, and other macro-economic indicators are stabilizing, economic struggles were still a clear election issue for many. That frustration opened the way for a comeback challenge from Mahama, who was president from 2012 to 2017 but since failed twice in presidential bids.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-ruling-party-candidate-concedes-in-presidential-election/7891419.html	2024-12-08T02:52:04-08:00	
Syrians celebrate as rebels topple Assad	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — The Syrian government collapsed early Sunday, falling to a lightning rebel offensive that seized control of the capital of Damascus and sent crowds into the streets to celebrate the end of the Assad family's 50 years of iron rule. Syrian state television aired a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been set free. The man who read the statement said the opposition group, known as the Operations Room to Conquer Damascus, called on all rebel fighters and citizens to preserve the institutions of 'the free Syrian state.' The statement emerged hours after the head of a Syrian opposition war monitor said Assad had left the country for an undisclosed location, fleeing ahead of insurgents who said they had entered Damascus following a remarkably swift advance across the country. Many of the capital's residents were in disbelief at the speed at which Assad lost his hold on the country after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced half the country's prewar population of 23 million and drew in several foreign powers. Celebrations erupt across capital As daylight broke over Damascus, crowds gathered to pray in the city's mosques and to celebrate in the squares, chanting 'God is great.' People also chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. In the streets, teen boys picked up weapons that had apparently been discarded by security forces and fired them in the air. Soldiers and police officers left their posts and fled, and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Videos from Damascus showed families wandering into the presidential palace, with some emerging carrying stacks of plates and other household items. 'I did not sleep last night, and I refused to sleep until I heard the news of his fall,' said Mohammed Amer Al-Oulabi, 44, who works in the electricity sector. 'From Idlib to Damascus, it only took them [the opposition forces] a few days, thank God. May God bless them, the heroic lions who made us proud.' Meanwhile, organizations that had previously been close to Assad's government attempted to distance themselves from it. Syria's al-Watan newspaper, which was historically pro-government, wrote: 'We are facing a new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood. We believe and trust that Syria will be for all Syrians.' The newspaper added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing government statements in the past. 'We only carried out the instructions and published the news they sent us,' it said. 'It quickly became clear now that it was false.' A statement from the Alawite sect — to which Assad belongs and which has formed the core of his base — called on young Syrians to be 'calm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country.' 'We were and still are advocates of peace and advocates of unity,' it said. The statement called for 'the language of reason and dialogue to prevail over all parties in the service of Syria and its great people.' Assad's whereabouts unknown Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said in a video statement that the government was ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. He later told Saudi television network Al-Arabiyya that he does not know where Assad and the defense minister are. He said he lost communication with Assad late Saturday. Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus. A senior diplomat from the United Arab Emirates, which had sought to rehabilitate Assad's image and has welcomed high-profile exiles in recent years, declined to comment on his whereabouts when asked by reporters at a conference in Bahrain. Anwar Gargash said Assad's destination at this point is a 'footnote in history,' comparing it to the long exile of German Kaiser Wilhelm II after World War I. Assad has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital. There was no immediate comment from Iran, which had been Assad's staunchest supporter. The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned. AP footage showed broken windows and documents scattered in the entryway. Entry into Damascus caps lightning advance Opposition forces had not reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege. The night before, opposition forces took the central city of Homs, Syria's third-largest, as government forces abandoned it. The city stands at an important intersection between Damascus, the capital, and Syria's coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus — the Syrian leader's base of support and home to a Russian strategic naval base. The rebels had already seized the cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a fast-moving offensive that began November 27. The advances in the past week were by far the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assad's government, the insurgents, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have met little resistance from the Syrian army. UN calls for 'orderly transition' HTS set up a 'salvation government' in 2017 to administer a large region in northwestern Syria under its control. In recent years, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group's image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. 'Golani has made history and sparked hope among millions of Syrians,' said Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and an expert on Syrian groups. 'But he and the rebels now face a formidable challenge ahead. One can only hope they rise to the occasion.' The U.N.'s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called Saturday for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' Speaking to reporters at the annual Doha Forum in Qatar, he said the situation in Syria was changing by the minute. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assad's chief international backer, said he feels 'sorry for the Syrian people.' The Israeli military said Sunday it has deployed forces in a demilitarized buffer zone along its northern frontier with Syria following the rebel offensive there. The military, which said it also sent troops to 'other places necessary for its defense,' said the deployment was meant to provide security for residents of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war and the international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rebels-topple-syrian-government-ending-50-years-of-iron-rule-by-assad-family/7891386.html	2024-12-08T00:46:06-08:00	
World's oldest-known wild bird lays egg in Hawaii at age 74	The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials said. The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week. Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate for life and lay one egg per year. But Akeakamai has not been seen for several years, and Wisdom began interacting with another male when she returned last week, officials said. 'We are optimistic that the egg will hatch,' Jonathan Plissner, supervisory wildlife biologist at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, said in a statement. Every year, millions of seabirds return to the refuge to nest and raise their young. Albatross parents take turns incubating an egg for about two months. Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They spend most of their lives flying over the ocean and feeding on squid and fish eggs. Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956 and has raised as many as 30 chicks, Plissner said. The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 68 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-oldest-known-wild-bird-lays-egg-in-hawaii/7890334.html	2024-12-08T00:16:58-08:00	
Japanese artist finds global fans with intricate leaf-cutting	TOKYO — A frog holding a taro-leaf umbrella. A parade of frolicking animals. An Ukiyo-e style Mount Fuji. Giant waves. A Japanese artist who goes by the name Lito carves these delicate designs on fallen leaves, giving life back to them. The world of Lito's delicate art, which he began in 2020 and posts on social media almost daily, has won fans from around the world. The leaf art has also given him solace after earlier struggles with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a purpose in life — the joy of making people happy with his art. He enjoys working at night. From a pile of leaves treated with a wrinkle-free chemical, he picks one and places it on a cutting board. First, he outlines the design on the leaf with a pen in his right hand. Then he takes a design knife in his left hand and starts cutting the leaf carefully. Slowly, the leaf begins to take the shape of a frog carrying an umbrella — a simple design he demonstrated in a recent interview with The Associated Press. More complex, highly intensive work on a single leaf can take more than eight hours to complete. His leaf-cutting works include titles such as Scrolls of Frolicking Animals, Leaf Aquarium and Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji: The Great Wave off Kanagawa. Each piece includes his own twists and often uses animals. 'I would rather finish it in one go when I am focused,' Lito, 38, said. He didn't want to disclose his real name for personal reasons. Since his childhood, Lito says he has had high levels of concentration and patience. But he had trouble fitting into what was considered the norm at school or at work, despite all his efforts. He struggled to interpret others' feelings and to avoid confrontations. After years of difficulty, he went to a hospital at age 30 and was told he has ADHD, a diagnosis that he felt explained why he has always done things differently. He saw no point in forcing himself to do things the same way as other people, and began to adjust his life. In early 2020, Lito came across the art of leaf cutting. He saw it as the perfect use of his patience and concentration. Word of his skills has spread across social media, and he has published books on his leaf-cutting work. He holds a near monthly solo exhibition in various places in Japan. 'If I can make people happy by doing what I am doing, I want to do more. That's my driving force for what's next,' Lito says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japanese-artist-finds-global-fans-with-intricate-leaf-cutting/7887919.html	2024-12-08T00:16:22-08:00	
As data centers proliferate, conflict with local communities follows	ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA — Richard Andre Newman thought he would live the rest of his life in his quiet, leafy neighborhood in suburban Virginia. He was born and raised in Bren Mar Park, where children ride their bikes and neighbors wave hello. But now, as he's approaching 60, he's considering selling his Fairfax County home and moving away. That's because he's getting a new neighbor: Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center. Newman feels helpless to stop it. 'I planned on staying here until I died,' he said, 'until this came up.' The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States. Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies. But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities. Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to homes. 'All that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn't run residents away from their homes,' he said. Dotting the hills in Northern Virginia In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular Washington & Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation's capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro. Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners association in the community. The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction and electrical jobs to build the facility. Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022, hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green space. But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for the Plaza 500 project. When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under the old rules. Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere. A spokesperson for the firm declined to respond to questions for this story. 'I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue,' Ray said, 'has any chance to go up against the data center industry.' Local leaders say data centers a financial boon For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's existing data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech companies that own them in 2023. For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs — often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000 residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs. Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits. 'I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,' Smith said. 'Data centers are not going away.' Amazon data centers welcomed by some in Oregon On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river. Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another $1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023. That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras, and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things. Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals. Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint against them. Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the relationships between the company and local officials, and raised eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers. Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River. The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a commissioner. 'They said, 'Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what you need. Tell us what we can do for you,'' Doherty recalled. Other former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS didn't ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy. 'We engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a community's goals,' said Kevin Miller, AWS' Vice President of global data centers. 'This helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good neighbors.' Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of AWS-suited lawyers. 'We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off,' said Lindsay. 'But there were better deals to be made.' Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer and Police Chief Rick Stokoe say their direct line to AWS allows them to get the most out of the company. 'This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,' said Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement. Both Keefer and Stokoe have been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks for AWS. 'These companies would not be here if they weren't getting some kind of incentive,' Stokoe said. 'There wouldn't be any money to talk about.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-data-centers-proliferate-conflict-with-local-communities-follows/7889331.html	2024-12-08T00:14:38-08:00	
Senegalese artisans in the spotlight as they exhibit for the first time at a prestigious art event	DAKAR, SENEGAL — For the artistic and cultural elites of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment. Every two years, hundreds of artists, curators and art lovers from across the world descend on the West African capital to attend the event, which was founded in 1989 by the Senegalese government and has over the decades become one of the most important showcases on the continent. Pop-up exhibitions are held in hundreds of venues, from stylish five-star hotels to local art galleries. Roads are even more crowded than usual, with traffic jams stretching out for miles along the Corniche, the city's picturesque seaside boulevard. Every night, there are music concerts, fashion shows, talks with artists and movie screenings held against the backdrop of palm trees and to the soundtrack of popping champagne bottles. But it wasn't until this year that the local artisans in the Soumbedioune crafts market, just off the Corniche and at the doorstep on the Medina working-class neighborhood, realized what the Biennale was. For years, 'we saw the OFF signs, but we didn't know what was going on,' said Ndiouga Dia, a 48-year-old leatherworker from Soumbedioune, referring to a series of events organized in parallel to the official government program, scattered all over the city. 'Only the artists knew among themselves what was going on.' Craftsmanship is deeply rooted in the country's culture. Senegal, like most African nations, has little capacity for industrial production, and traditionally much of its economy has relied on locally produced goods. For centuries, craftsmen played a central role in Senegalese social life, sculpting religious statues and ceremonial masks, sewing boubous (traditional colorful wide-sleeved robes), molding pottery and weaving baskets. But these days, their role is in decline. As living costs rise, many Senegalese opt for cheaper, often Chinese products. And those that can afford it buy Western clothes and furniture to mark their social status. So when two designers approached Dia, who is also the community leader of the Soumbedioune artisans, with a proposal for a joint exhibition, he didn't hesitate for a second. It felt good to be noticed and included, Dia said. Designers Kemi Bassène and Khadim Ndiaye asked five artisans — a sculptor, a painter, a jeweler, a leatherworker and a upholsterer — to interpret the theme of 'hippo.' They chose the theme because it was easily recognizable across Africa, they said, bringing together people from different nations who live next to the water. The exhibition, held in the central square of Soumbedioune, surrounded by artisanal boutiques and restaurants selling thieboudienne, the most famous Senegalese dish, has been a hit among locals. There are hippo earrings and a hippo necklace; a giant wooden sculpture of a sleeping hippo; and a hippo-shaped bag. Papise Kanté, a 45-year-old sculptor who created two wooden hippo statues for the exhibition, said it allowed him to tap into a more creative part of his work, instead of just producing objects that he intended to sell. 'I have been sculpting since I was a young child,' said Kanté, who comes from a long line of sculptors. 'Every artist wants to get better.' But it also gave his work recognition. 'It's because of the Biennale that people know my work,' he said. If you participate in the Biennale, he added, 'you are proud.' Bassène, the curator, grew up in Medina, next to Soumbedioune, but is now based in Paris. He said he wanted to bridge the divide between arts and crafts. 'This is the first time in the history that artisans, especially those who are custodians of traditional craftsmanship, are invited to the Biennale,' Bassène said. 'For craftsmen in Africa, there is a natural progression towards the world of modern design.' It was 'normal,' he said, to include artisans in the Biennale 'if we wanted to try to decolonize a little.' This year's Biennale is being held as Senegal is undergoing profound political change, with the newly elected authorities charting a more self-reliant and pan-African course. Last month, the governing party, PASTEF, secured a resounding victory in legislative elections. Its win granted President Bassirou Diomaye Faye a clear mandate to carry out ambitious reforms promised during the campaign to improve living conditions for ordinary Senegalese — including greater economic self-reliance, revamping the fishing industry, and making maximum use of natural resources. The theme of this year's Biennale has been 'The Wake,' alluding to the emancipation of the African continent from its remaining dependence on former colonial powers. The new government of Senegal has 'a transformational agenda,' said Bassène. 'I think that what we have experienced politically will impact all the social sciences and all art.' In the meantime, the Soumbedioune artisans have big plans. Dia, the community leader, said that they are planning a collaboration with a local school to manufacture backpacks for students. His dream, he said, was to expand the production across the whole country so the Senegalese parents 'do not have to buy Chinese products.' 'We have all the know-how,' he said. 'We can produce more.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegalese-artisans-in-the-spotlight-as-they-exhibit-for-the-first-time-at-a-prestigious-art-event/7887944.html	2024-12-08T00:13:27-08:00	
Sumo wrestlers bring 1,500 years of tradition to London as sport has international moment	LONDON — London's Royal Albert Hall, the gilded concert venue known for an annual Rule Britannia singalong, is preparing to host a different kind of spectacle: Sumo wrestling. Camera shutters clicked furiously and reporters 'Ahhhed' in delight Wednesday as wrestlers Daisuke Kitanowaka and Akira Fukutsuumi demonstrated a sideways stamp and put on an exhibition of heavyweight grappling to promote a tournament scheduled for next October. It marks only the second time an elite five-day tournament will be held outside Japan. The first was in 1991 at the same venue. Organizers are hoping to whip up the kind of excitement that was generated three decades ago, when the deeply ritualistic sport attracted sell-out crowds and a national television audience. 'It wasn't just an event here at the hall,'' said James Ainscough, chief executive of the Royal Albert Hall. 'It became a national moment. People talked about it in the workplace. You could see kids acting it out each day in playgrounds the length and breadth of the country. So it's a huge honor and a huge matter of excitement to welcome it back in 2025.'' A variety of factors, including a series of sumo wrestling scandals, the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed the sport's return to London. But organizers believe the time is right because sumo is having a bit of a moment. Two Netflix series have introduced audiences to the intricacies of the sport, which has roots stretching back 1,500 years. Earlier this year, Hanshin Contents Link opened a sumo hall in Osaka, Japan's third-largest city, that entertains foreign tourists with explanatory exhibitions and actual bouts. Organizers of the London event say they hope to show Japan's rich culture as well as its traditional sport that pits two huge men clad in very little against each other in a test of strength and technique. On hand Wednesday was the winner of the previous U.K. tournament, Nobuyoshi Hakkaku, nicknamed 'bulldog'' by British fans in 1991. Now the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, he reminisced about how the only thing that made him really nervous was preparing for a victory speech in English. Japan's ambassador to the U.K., Hiroshi Suzuki, also made an appearance, a reflection of the event's importance to the nation. Organizers promised that spectators also would see exhibitions of Kabuki theater and other Japanese traditions. But the main attraction were the wrestlers. Kitanowaka and Fukutsuumi gamely tried to show off their sport. Clad in their mawashi, or ceremonial aprons, they faced off on a mat in front of several dozen journalists. The big men slammed into each other with an 'oomph' as flesh slapped flesh. A grunt or two broke the silence. No sweat was evident. It was over in a flash. Then they went outside, dropping their robes and exposing their flesh to the frosty November air as they entered and exited a classic London black cab for photographers. Nothing seemed to bother them. Not the cold. Not the demands to stand this way or that. As the concert hall loomed behind them, they did their best to be sumo diplomats. 'Sumo has a wonderfully intriguing collection of culture and ritual and sport and excitement,'' Ainscough said. 'And to bring sumo back to the Royal Albert Hall again doesn't just create a sporting moment, it creates a moment where we can learn and be inspired by another culture and another set of principles to live by. It's a moment where we can all grow closer together.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/sumo-wrestlers-bring-1-500-years-of-tradition-to-london-as-sport-has-international-moment/7887924.html	2024-12-08T00:12:48-08:00	
Assad’s ouster after 14 years of war in Syria brings to an end a decades-long dynasty	BEIRUT — The fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government Sunday brought to a dramatic close his nearly 14-year struggle to hold onto power as his country fragmented amid a brutal civil war that became a proxy battlefield for regional and international powers. Assad's downfall came as a stark contrast to his first months as Syria's unlikely president in 2000, when many hoped he would be a young reformer after three decades of his father's iron grip. Only 34 years old, the Western-educated ophthalmologist was a rather geeky tech-savvy fan of computers with a gentle demeanor. But when faced with protests against his rule that erupted in March 2011, Assad turned to the brutal tactics of his father in an attempt to crush them. As the uprising hemorrhaged into an outright civil war, he unleashed his military to blast opposition-held cities, with support from allies Iran and Russia. International rights groups and prosecutors alleged widespread use of torture and extrajudicial executions in Syria's government-run detention centers. The Syrian war has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country's pre-war population of 23 million. As the uprising spiraled into a civil war, millions of Syrians fled across the borders into Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon and on to Europe. His departure brings an end to the Assad family rule, spanning just under 54 years. With no clear successor, it throws the country into further uncertainty. Until recently, it seemed that Assad was almost out of the woods. The long-running conflict had settled along frozen conflict lines in recent years, with Assad's government regaining control of most of Syria's territory while the northwest remained under the control of opposition groups and the northeast under Kurdish control. While Damascus remained under crippling Western sanctions, neighboring countries had begun to resign themselves to Assad's continued hold on power. The Arab League reinstated Syria's membership last year, and Saudi Arabia in May announced the appointment of its first ambassador to Syria since severing ties with Damascus 12 years earlier. However, the geopolitical tide turned quickly with a surprise offensive launched by opposition groups based in northwest Syria in late November. Government forces quickly collapsed, while Assad's allies, preoccupied by other conflicts — including Russia's war in Ukraine and the yearlong wars between Israel and the Iran-backed militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas — appeared reluctant to forcefully intervene. Assad's whereabouts were not clear Sunday, amid reports he had left the country as insurgents took control of the Syrian capital. He came to power in 2000 by a twist of fate. His father had been cultivating Bashar's oldest brother Basil as his successor, but in 1994 Basil was killed in a car crash in Damascus. Bashar was brought home from his ophthalmology practice in London, put through military training and elevated to the rank of colonel to establish his credentials so he could one day rule. When Hafez Assad died in 2000, parliament quickly lowered the presidential age requirement from 40 to 34. Bashar's elevation was sealed by a nationwide referendum, in which he was the only candidate. Hafez, a lifelong military man, ruled the country for nearly 30 years during which he set up a Soviet-style centralized economy and kept such a stifling hand over dissent that Syrians feared even to joke about politics to their friends. He pursued a secular ideology that sought to bury sectarian differences under Arab nationalism and the image of heroic resistance to Israel. He formed an alliance with the Shiite clerical leadership in Iran, sealed Syrian domination over Lebanon and set up a network of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups. Bashar initially seemed completely unlike his strongman father. Tall and lanky with a slight lisp, he had a quiet, gentle demeanor. His only official position before becoming president was head of the Syrian Computer Society. His wife, Asma al-Akhras, whom he married several months after taking office, was attractive, stylish and British-born. The young couple, who eventually had three children, seemed to shun trappings of power. They lived in an apartment in the upscale Abu Rummaneh district of Damascus, as opposed to a palatial mansion like other Arab leaders. Initially upon coming to office, Assad freed political prisoners and allowed more open discourse. In the 'Damascus Spring,' salons for intellectuals emerged where Syrians could discuss art, culture and politics to a degree impossible under his father. But after 1,000 intellectuals signed a public petition calling for multiparty democracy and greater freedoms in 2001 and others tried to form a political party, the salons were snuffed out by the feared secret police who jailed dozens of activists. Instead of a political opening, Assad turned to economic reforms. He slowly lifted economic restrictions, let in foreign banks, threw the doors open to imports and empowered the private sector. Damascus and other cities long mired in drabness saw a flourishing of shopping malls, new restaurants and consumer goods. Tourism swelled. Abroad, he stuck to the line his father had set, based on the alliance with Iran and a policy of insisting on a full return of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, although in practice Assad never militarily confronted Israel. In 2005, he suffered a heavy blow with the loss of Syria's decades-old control over neighboring Lebanon after the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri. With many Lebanese accusing Damascus of being behind the slaying, Syria was forced to withdraw its troops from the country and a pro-American government came into power. At the same time, the Arab world became split into two camps -- one of U.S.-allied, Sunni-led countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, the other Syria and Shiite-led Iran with their ties to Hezbollah and Palestinian militants. Throughout, Assad relied for largely on the same power base at home as his father: his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam comprising around 10% of the population. Many of the positions in his government went to younger generations of the same families that had worked for his father. Drawn in as well were the new middle class created by his reforms, including prominent Sunni merchant families. Assad also turned to his own family. His younger brother Maher headed the elite Presidential Guard and would lead the crackdown against the uprising. Their sister Bushra was a strong voice in his inner circle, along with her husband Deputy Defense Minister Assef Shawkat, until he was killed in a 2012 bombing. Bashar's cousin, Rami Makhlouf, became the country's biggest businessman, heading a financial empire before the two had a falling out that led to Makhlouf being pushed aside. Assad also increasingly entrusted key roles to his wife, Asma, before she announced in May that she was undergoing treatment for leukemia and stepped out of the limelight. When protests erupted in Tunisa and Egypt, eventually toppling their rulers, Assad dismissed the possibility of the same occurring in his country, insisting his regime was more in tune with its people. After the Arab Spring wave did move to Syria, his security forces staged a brutal crackdown while Assad consistently denied he was facing a popular revolt, instead blaming 'foreign-backed terrorists' trying to destabilize his regime. His rhetoric struck a chord with many in Syria's minority groups - including Christians, Druze and Shiites - as well as some Sunnis who feared the prospect of rule by Sunni extremists even more than they disliked Assad's authoritarian rule. Ironically, on February 26, 2011, two days after the fall of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak to protesters and just before the wave of Arab Spring protests swept into Syria — in an email released by Wikileaks as part of a cache in 2012 — Assad e-mailed a joke he'd run across mocking the Egyptian leader's stubborn refusal to step down. 'NEW WORD ADDED TO DICTIONARY: Mubarak (verb): To stick something, or to glue something. ... Mubarak (adjective): slow to learn or understand,' it read.	https://www.voanews.com/a/assad-s-ouster-after-14-years-of-war-in-syria-brings-to-an-end-a-decades-long-dynasty-/7891367.html	2024-12-07T22:50:27-08:00	
Opposition fighters reportedly drive Syrian leader from the country. Who are they and what now?	Syria's government appears to have fallen after opposition fighters said they entered Damascus following a stunning advance. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said the government was ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government. 'I am in my house and I have not left, and this is because of my belonging to this country,' Jalili said in a video statement. He said he would go to his office to continue work in the morning and called on Syrian citizens not to deface public property. A Syrian opposition war monitor, Rami Abdurrahman, said Assad left the country on a flight from Damascus early Sunday. Jalili did not address reports of Assad's departure. Opposition fighters entered Syria's capital in a swiftly developing crisis that has taken much of the world by surprise. Syria's army has abandoned key cities with little resistance. Who are these opposition fighters? If they take control of Damascus after seizing some of Syria's largest cities, what then? Here is a look at the stunning reversal of fortune for Assad and the government in just the past 10 days, and what might lie ahead as Syria's 13-year civil war reignites. The aim? Overthrow the government This is the first time that opposition forces have reached the outskirts of the Syrian capital since 2018, when the country's troops recaptured the area following a yearslong siege. The approaching fighters are led by the most powerful insurgent group in Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, along with an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Both have been entrenched in the northwest. They launched the shock offensive on November 27 with gunmen capturing Aleppo, Syria's largest city, and the central city of Hama, the fourth largest. The HTS has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. But the group said in recent years it cut ties with al-Qaida, and experts say HTS has sought to remake itself in recent years by focusing on promoting civilian government in their territory as well as military action. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday from Syria that the aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad's government. Possible rifts ahead The HTS and Syrian National Army have been allies at times and rivals at times, and their aims might diverge. The Turkish-backed militias also have an interest in creating a buffer zone near the Turkish border to keep away Kurdish militants at odds with Ankara. Turkey has been a main backer of the fighters seeking to overthrow Assad but more recently has urged reconciliation, and Turkish officials have strongly rejected claims of any involvement in the current offensive. Whether the HTS and the Syrian National Army will work together if they succeed in overthrowing Assad or turn on each other again is a major question. Others take advantage While the flash offensive against Syria's government began in the north, armed opposition groups have also mobilized elsewhere. The southern areas of Sweida and Daraa have both been taken locally. Sweida is the heartland of Syria's Druze religious minority and had been the site of regular anti-government protests even after Assad seemingly consolidated his control over the area. Daraa is a Sunni Muslim area that was widely seen as the cradle of the uprising against Assad's rule that erupted in 2011. Daraa was recaptured by Syrian government troops in 2018, but rebels remained in some areas. In recent years, Daraa was in a state of uneasy quiet under a Russian-mediated ceasefire deal. And much of Syria's east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led group backed by the United States that in the past has clashed with most other armed groups in the country. Syria's government now has control of only three of 14 provincial capitals: Damascus, Latakia and Tartus. What's next? A commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces have started carrying out the 'final stage' of their offensive by encircling Damascus. And Syrian troops withdrew Saturday from much of the central city of Homs, Syria's third largest, according to a pro-government outlet and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. If that city is captured, the link would be cut between Damascus, Assad's seat of power, and the coastal region where he enjoys wide support. Assad appears to be largely on his own as allies Russia and Iran are distracted by other conflicts and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah has been weakened by its war with Israel, now under a fragile ceasefire. The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, seeks urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition,' saying the situation is changing by the minute. He met with foreign ministers and senior diplomats from eight key countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran on the sidelines of the Doha Summit.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opposition-fighters-reportedly-drive-syrian-leader-from-the-country-who-are-they-and-what-now-/7891355.html	2024-12-07T21:26:40-08:00	
White House on guard against Islamic State resurgence in Syria	LOS ANGELES — The White House said Saturday that U.S. priorities in Syria now are to ensure the country's conflict does not encourage a resurgence of the Islamic State militant group or lead to a 'humanitarian catastrophe.' U.S. President Joe Biden and his team are monitoring the 'extraordinary events in Syria' are in touch with regional partners, the White House said on Saturday. 'President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners,' the White House said in a statement. Spillover 'is a concern,' said national security adviser Jake Sullivan, with particular worry about the so-called Islamic State, also known as ISIS. In previous phases of Syria's long-running civil war, 'at its worst, we saw the explosion of ISIS onto the scene,' he said at a conference in Simi Valley, California run by the Reagan National Defense Forum. The main priority is to ensure 'that the fighting in Syria not lead to a resurgence of ISIS,' Sullivan said. 'We are going to take steps ourselves, directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds, to ensure that does not happen.' The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria, including U.S. forces working with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group, according to The Associated Press. Gen. Bryan Fenton, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, told the AP he would not want to speculate on how the upheaval in Syria would affect the U.S. military’s footprint in the country. 'It’s still too early to tell,' he said. What would not change is the focus on disrupting IS operations in Syria and protecting U.S. troops, Fenton said during a panel at the Reagan event. Rebel forces are in the midst of a lightning offensive and say they have begun to encircle Syria's capital, Damascus. Sullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure allies Israel, Jordan, Iraq and others in the region, 'who would potentially face spillover effects from Syria, are strong and secure, and we're in touch with them every day.' Washington is also alert to stopping a 'humanitarian catastrophe, both in terms of civilians, access to life-saving necessities, and in terms of the protection of religious and ethnic minorities in Syria,' Sullivan said. 'Of course, an event like this happens and ISIS immediately looks to take advantage. We have seen reports of ISIS trying ... to reconstitute to a certain extent.' So the United States will seek to 'contain the potential violence and instability,' protect allies and ensure that ISIS not 'get new oxygen out of this' that could lead them to threaten US or allies' interests, Sullivan added. Sullivan's remarks come as Washington prepares for a transition of power next month back to former president Donald Trump, who defeated Biden in November's election. Trump, who visited Paris on Saturday, warned against US involvement in Syria, saying the country is 'a mess' and 'not our friend.' 'THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,' Trump said on his Truth Social platform. Sullivan, addressing Trump's remarks, agreed, saying 'the United States is not going to... militarily dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war.'

US House to vote to provide $3 billion to remove Chinese telecoms equipment	WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote next week on an annual defense bill that includes just over $3 billion for U.S. telecom companies to remove equipment made by Chinese telecoms firms Huawei and ZTE 000063.SZ from American wireless networks to address security risks. The 1,800-page text was released late Saturday and includes other provisions aimed at China, including requiring a report on Chinese efforts to evade U.S. national security regulations and an intelligence assessment of the current status of China's biotechnology capabilities. The Federal Communications Commission has said removing the insecure equipment is estimated to cost $4.98 billion but Congress previously only approved $1.9 billion for the 'rip and replace' program. Washington has aggressively urged U.S. allies to purge Huawei and other Chinese gear from their wireless networks. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel last week again called on the U.S. Congress to provide urgent additional funding, saying the program to replace equipment in the networks of 126 carriers faces a $3.08 billion shortfall 'putting both our national security and the connectivity of rural consumers who depend on these networks at risk.' She has warned the lack of funding could result in some rural networks shutting down, which 'could eliminate the only provider in some regions' and could threaten 911 service. Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan on Saturday praised the announcement, saying 'funding is desperately needed to fulfill the mandate to remove and replace covered equipment and services while maintaining connectivity for tens of millions of Americans.' In 2019, Congress told the FCC to require U.S. telecoms carriers that receive federal subsidies to purge their networks of Chinese telecoms equipment. The White House in 2023 asked for $3.1 billion for the program. Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said funding for the program and up to $500 million for regional tech hubs will be covered by funds generated from a one-time spectrum auction by the FCC for advanced wireless spectrum in the band known as AWS-3 to help meet rising spectrum demands of wireless consumers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-to-vote-to-provide-3-billion-to-remove-chinese-telecoms-equipment/7891322.html	2024-12-07T19:08:23-08:00	
South Korea arrests former defense minister over martial law declaration, Yonhap News says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean prosecutors on Sunday arrested former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun over his alleged role in President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law on Tuesday, Yonhap News Agency said. Yoon survived an impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday, prompted by his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, but the leader of his own party said he will be effectively excluded from his duties before eventually stepping down. Ruling Party leader Han Dong-hoon plans to meet with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Sunday morning. Kim, who offered his resignation on Wednesday, was seen as a central figure in Tuesday's brief martial law declaration. A senior military official and filings to impeach Yoon by opposition members said Kim had made the proposal to Yoon. The prosecution's special investigative team has questioned Kim, who voluntarily appeared at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office at around 1:30 a.m. on Sunday (1630 GMT on Saturday), the report said. The office was not immediately available for comments. Three minority opposition parties filed a complaint with the prosecution against Yoon, Kim and martial law commander Park An-su, accusing them of insurrection. If convicted, the crime of leading an insurrection is punishable by death or life imprisonment, with or without prison labor. Opposition lawmakers alleged Yoon mobilized military forces to block a vote by lawmakers seeking to nullify what they said was an unconstitutional martial law decree. The national police raided the office of Kim on Sunday as part of an investigation into claims of treason against Yoon and top ministers, Yonhap said. Earlier on Saturday, Yoon addressed the nation in a televised speech to apologize for his martial law decree, saying he would not avoid legal and political responsibilities for his action, though he did not offer to resign. Yoon said he would put his fate in the hands of the ruling party, which Ruling Party leader Han Dong-hoon later said was effectively a promise to leave office early. Han has said Yoon would be 'effectively excluded from his duties' and his party will consult with the prime minister to manage state affairs. Yoon shocked the nation on Tuesday night when he gave the military sweeping emergency powers to root out what he called 'anti-state forces' and obstructionist political opponents. He rescinded the order six hours later, after parliament defied military and police cordons to vote unanimously against the decree. Yoon's martial law declaration plunged South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy and a key U.S. military ally, into its greatest political crisis in decades, threatening to shatter the country's reputation as a democratic success story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-arrests-ex-defense-minister-over-martial-law-yonhap-news-says-/7891316.html	2024-12-07T18:54:52-08:00	
Georgia's president says she talked with Trump, Macron about 'stolen election'	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili said she talked with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron about the parliamentary election last month in her country that she and the opposition say was rigged. 'In depth discussion with Presidents Trump & Macron,' Zourabichvili, who was in Paris for the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral, said on X late on Saturday, underneath a photo showing her, Trump and Macron talking. 'Exposed the stolen election and extremely alarming repression against the people of Georgia.' Zourabichvili became the voice of the now weeks-long protest movement following the October vote that gave the ruling Georgian Dream party a win and its subsequent announcement that it was suspending efforts to join the European Union. The leader of Georgia's main opposition party and several other members have been detained during the protests and on Saturday the opposition said one of its politicians was beaten during a police raid on its offices. Georgian media also reported that a camera crew from pro-opposition Pirveli TV was attacked by masked men while broadcasting from near the protest site. 'The Russian regime is back at work tonight in Tbilisi — chasing civilians through the streets as they flee terror, targeting politicians, media, artists,' Zourabichvili said in a separate post on X on Saturday, posting a video showing a group of hooded men with batons beating up several men in a building. Zourabichvili, who has a largely ceremonial role as president, and the opposition have been accusing Georgian Dream of pursuing increasingly authoritarian, anti-Western and pro-Russian policies in the nation of 3.7 million people. The Kremlin has denied that Russia is interfering in the situation in Georgia, which Moscow compared to the 2014 'Maidan' revolution in Ukraine that overthrew a pro-Russian president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-s-president-says-she-talked-with-trump-macron-about-stolen-election-/7891312.html	2024-12-07T18:27:49-08:00	
Taiwan reports near doubling of Chinese warships nearby	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan's defense ministry said on Sunday that China had nearly doubled the number of its warships operating around the island in the previous 24 hours, ahead of what security sources expect will be a new round of war games. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has been angered by visits by President Lai Ching-te to Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam as part of a Pacific tour. Lai returned from the week-long trip on Friday night. Beijing has held two rounds of war games around Taiwan this year. In its daily morning report on Chinese military activities, Taiwan's defense ministry said there were 14 Chinese warships operating nearby, up from the eight it reported the previous day. The ministry said it had detected four Chinese balloons flying over the Taiwan Strait, one of which had brushed the top of the island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-reports-near-doubling-of-chinese-warships-nearby-/7891309.html	2024-12-07T18:21:23-08:00	
Pearl Harbor survivors, ages 104 and 102, return to Hawaii for attack anniversary	PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII — Ira 'Ike' Schab, a 104-year-old Pearl Harbor attack survivor, was so determined to stand and salute during a remembrance ceremony honoring those killed in the Japanese bombing that thrust the U.S. into World War II some 83 years ago that he spent six weeks in physical therapy to build the strength to do so. On Saturday, Schab gingerly rose from his wheelchair and raised his right hand, returning a salute delivered by sailors on a destroyer and a submarine passing by in the harbor. His son and a daughter supported him from either side. 'I was honored to do it. I’m glad I was capable of standing up,' he said afterward. 'I’m getting old, you know.' Schab is one of only two servicemen who lived through the attack who made it to an annual observance hosted by the U.S. Navy and National Park Service on a grass field overlooking the harbor. A third survivor had been planning to join them but had to cancel because of health issues. The December 7, 1941, bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900 Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel. Dozens of survivors once joined the event but their attendance has declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000 military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack. Schab agreed when ceremony organizers asked him earlier this year to salute on behalf of all survivors and World War II veterans. 'He’s been working hard, because this is his goal,' said his daughter Kimberlee Heinrichs, who traveled to Hawaii with Schab from their Beaverton, Oregon, home. 'He wanted to be able to stand for that.' Schab was a sailor on the USS Dobbin at the time of the attack, serving as the tuba player in the ship's band. He had showered and put on a clean uniform when he heard the call for a fire rescue party. He hurried topside to see Japanese planes flying overhead and the USS Utah capsizing. He quickly went back below deck to join a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun topside. Ken Stevens, 102, who served on the USS Whitney, joined Schab at the ceremony. USS Curtiss sailor Bob Fernandez, 100, was unable to come due to health issues. Attendees observed a moment of silence at 7:54 a.m., the same time the attack began eight decades ago. F-22 jets in missing man formation flew overhead shortly after. Fernandez, speaking in a phone interview from California, where he lives with his nephew in Lodi, recalled feeling shocked and surprised as the attack began. 'When those things go off like that, we didn’t know what’s what,' Fernandez said. 'We didn’t even know we were in a war.' Fernandez was a mess cook on the Curtiss and his job that morning was to bring sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast. Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly by. Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing 12.7-centimeter, 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to the ship's guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above. 'I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,' Fernandez said. The ship's guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber that then slammed into the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command. Fernandez's ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn’t view himself that way. 'I’m not a hero,' he said. 'I’m just nothing but an ammunition passer.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pearl-harbor-survivors-ages-104-and-102-return-to-hawaii-for-attack-anniversary/7891303.html	2024-12-07T18:02:39-08:00	
Israeli strikes kill 6 in Lebanon's south, 34 in Gaza	beirut — Lebanon's health ministry said Saturday that Israeli strikes killed six people in the country's south, 10 days into a ceasefire between the Hezbollah group and Israel. Both Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah face accusations of having breached the truce that took effect on November 27 to end a war that has killed thousands in Lebanon and sparked mass displacements on both sides. 'The Israeli enemy's airstrike on the town of Beit Lif resulted in the martyrdom of five people and the injury of five others,' a health ministry statement said, adding that in a separate incident a drone strike killed one person in Deir Seryan. The two locations are more than 20 kilometers apart. Earlier Saturday, the Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah militant in southern Lebanon, one of multiple operations against 'activities ... that posed a threat' to Israel. 'In one case, the (military) identified a Hezbollah terrorist who posed a threat to the troops deployed in southern Lebanon in violation' of the ceasefire, the military said, adding the air force 'struck the terrorist.' Lebanon's official National News Agency reported that 'an enemy drone targeted a motorcycle in Deir Seryan' On Monday the health ministry said Israeli strikes killed nine people in southern Lebanon after Israel said it was taking aim at dozens of Hezbollah targets in retaliation for an attack claimed by the militant group. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the ceasefire was 'holding' despite a series of incidents. A committee including France, United Nations peacekeepers, Israel, and Lebanon and chaired by the United States is tasked with maintaining communication between the various parties and ensuring violations are identified and dealt with to avoid any escalation. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on 'the international community, particularly the parties sponsoring security arrangements, to work seriously and decisively to halt the ongoing violations by the enemy, ensure its withdrawal from occupied territories and actively contribute to implementing the ceasefire.' Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 34 Palestinians on Saturday, health officials in the enclave said, as Qatar voiced hope of fresh momentum in efforts to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The health officials said that an Israeli strike hit a house in Gaza City late Saturday, killing four women. The Israeli military did not provide an immediate comment on Saturday's strikes across Gaza. The death toll was revised upward from 30 reported earlier in the day by the Palestinian health ministry, which also said dozens were wounded. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants in the daily death tallies. Neither AFP nor Reuters could independently verify the figures. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed about 44,500 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. Nearly three-quarters of Gaza's 2.3 million population is displaced, and nearly the entire population is at risk of famine, according to the United Nations. Some information in this story is from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-kill-6-in-lebanon-s-south-34-in-gaza/7891302.html	2024-12-07T17:53:44-08:00	
Garland’s ruby slippers from 'The Wizard of Oz' auctioned for $28M	MINNEAPOLIS — A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz and stolen from a museum nearly two decades ago fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday. Heritage Auctions had estimated that they would fetch $3 million or more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55 million, or $1.91 million including the buyer's premium, a commission that the buyer pays, said Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the Dallas-based auction house. More than 800 people were tracking the slippers, and the company's web page for the auction had hit nearly 43,000 page views by Thursday, he said. As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, The Ruby Slippers of Oz, puts it, the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen 'more twists and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.' They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum’s door and display case. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health. His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off 'one last score' after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence — a person who buys stolen goods — later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how. The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty. The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had lent them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, 'There’s no place like home.' Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to help the museum purchase the slippers. The Wizard of Oz story has gained new attention in recent weeks with the release of the movie Wicked, an adaptation of the megahit Broadway musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked Witch of the West. The auction also included other memorabilia from The Wizard of Oz, such as a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked Witch of the West.	https://www.voanews.com/a/garland-s-ruby-slippers-from-the-wizard-of-oz-auctioned-for-28m/7891298.html	2024-12-07T17:19:21-08:00	
Insurgents reach gates of Syria's capital, threaten to upend Assad rule	BEIRUT — Insurgents' stunning march across Syria accelerated Saturday with news that they had reached the gates of the capital and that government forces had abandoned the central city of Homs. The government was forced to deny rumors that President Bashar Assad had fled the country. The loss of Homs is a potentially crippling blow for Assad. It stands at an important intersection between Damascus and Syria's coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus — the Syrian leader's base of support and home to a Russian strategic naval base. The pro-government Sham FM reported that government forces took positions outside Syria's third-largest city, without elaborating. Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Syrian troops and members of different security agencies have withdrawn from the city, adding that rebels have entered parts of it. The capture of Homs is a major victory for insurgents, who have already seized the cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a lightning offensive that began November 27. Analysts said Homs falling into rebel hands would be a game-changer. The rebels' moves around Damascus, reported by the monitor and a rebel commander, came after the Syrian army withdrew from much of southern part of the country, leaving more areas, including several provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters. For the first time in the country's long-running civil war, the government now has control of only three of 14 provincial capitals: Damascus, Latakia and Tartus. The advances in the past week were among the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assad's government, the insurgents, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have met little resistance from the Syrian army. The rapid rebel gains, coupled with the lack of support from Assad's erstwhile allies, posed the most serious threat to his rule since the start of the war. The United Nation's special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, on Saturday called for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' Speaking to reporters at the annual Doha Forum in Qatar, he said the situation in Syria was changing by the minute. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assad's chief international backer, said he feels 'sorry for the Syrian people.' In Damascus, people rushed to stock up on supplies. Thousands went to Syria's border with Lebanon, trying to leave the country. Many shops in the capital were shuttered, a resident told The Associated Press, and those still open ran out of staples such as sugar. Some were selling items at three times the normal price. 'The situation is very strange. We are not used to that,' the resident said, insisting on anonymity, fearing retributions. 'People are worried whether there will be a battle [in Damascus] or not.' It was the first time that opposition forces reached the outskirts of Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured the area following a yearslong siege. The U.N. said it was moving noncritical staff outside the country as a precaution. Assad's status Syria's state media denied social media rumors that Assad left the country, saying he is performing his duties in Damascus. He has had little, if any, help from his allies. Russia is busy with its war in Ukraine. Lebanon's Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up Assad's forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran has seen its proxies across the region degraded by regular Israeli airstrikes. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday posted on social media that that the United States should avoid engaging militarily in Syria. Pedersen said a date for talks in Geneva on the implementation a U.N. resolution, adopted in 2015, and calling for a Syrian-led political process, would be announced later. The resolution calls for the establishment of a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with U.N.-supervised elections. Later Saturday, foreign ministers and senior diplomats from eight key countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran, along with Pederson, gathered on the sidelines of the Doha Summit to discuss the situation in Syria. In a statement issued late Saturday, the participants affirmed their support for a political solution to the Syrian crisis 'that would lead to the end of military activity and protect civilians.' They also agreed on the importance of strengthening international efforts to increase aid to the Syrian people. The insurgents' march Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said insurgents were in the Damascus suburbs of Maadamiyah, Jaramana and Daraya. Opposition fighters were marching toward the Damascus suburb of Harasta, he added. A commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces had begun the 'final stage' of their offensive by encircling Damascus. HTS controls much of northwest Syria and in 2017 set up a 'salvation government' to run day-to-day affairs in the region. In recent years, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group's image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials, and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. The shock offensive began November 27, during which gunmen captured the northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest, and the central city of Hama, the country's fourth-largest city. Opposition activists said Saturday that a day earlier, insurgents entered Palmyra, which is home to invaluable archaeological sites that had been in government hands since being taken from the Islamic State group in 2017. To the south, Syrian troops left much of the province of Quneitra including the main Baath City, activists said. Syrian Observatory said government troops have withdrawn from much of the two southern provinces. The Syrian army said in a statement that it carried out redeployment and repositioning in Sweida and Daraa after its checkpoints came under attack by 'terrorists.' The army said it was setting up a 'strong and coherent defensive and security belt in the area,' apparently to defend Damascus from the south. The Syrian government has referred to opposition gunmen as terrorists since conflict broke out in March 2011. Diplomacy in Doha The foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey, meeting in Qatar, called for an end to the hostilities. Turkey is a main backer of the rebels. Qatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, criticized Assad for failing to take advantage of the lull in fighting in recent years to address the country's underlying problems. 'Assad didn't seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,' he said. Sheikh Mohammed said he was surprised by how quickly the rebels have advanced and said there is a real threat to Syria's 'territorial integrity.' He said the war could 'damage and destroy what is left if there is no sense of urgency' to start a political process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/insurgents-reach-gates-of-syria-s-capital-threatening-to-upend-decades-of-assad-rule-/7891291.html	2024-12-07T17:03:46-08:00	
Explosives-laden motorcycle detonates in Colombia killing 1, injuring 14	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — A motorcycle loaded with explosives detonated at a police checkpoint in southwestern Colombia on Saturday, killing the driver and injuring 14 others, authorities said. Officers had been conducting inspections in the community of Las Penas in the Jamundi municipality to prevent possible violence by illegal armed groups, commander of the Cali Metropolitan Police Col. Carlos Oviedo told journalists. The driver 'became scared' and detonated the explosives after being called to the checkpoint, Oviedo said, killing himself and injuring seven civilians and seven police officers. One of the officers has a 'reserved prognosis,' he added. Criminal groups consider Jamundi strategic because of its plantations of coca leaf, which is transformed into cocaine, and because it is connected to the port of Buenaventura. The organized crime group Jaime Martinez is active in the area. It is composed of dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish acronym FARC, that did not accept the 2016 peace deal with the state. Attacks with explosives against military and police officers, which authorities attribute to illegal armed groups, have continued despite efforts by Colombian President Gustavo Petro to negotiate peace deals with the irregular armies under a strategy known as total peace. The Ombudsman’s office expressed concern over growing violence in Jamundi and urged authorities to guarantee the protection and security of citizens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/explosives-laden-motorcycle-detonates-in-colombia-killing-1-injuring-14/7891296.html	2024-12-07T16:59:19-08:00

After dissolving government, leader of Burkina Faso junta names new PM	ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST — Burkina Faso's junta head named former communications minister Rimtalba Jean Emmanuel Ouedraogo as prime minister Saturday, according to a presidential decree, a day after dissolving the government. Ouedraogo served in the Cabinet of outgoing premier Apollinaire Joachim Kyelem de Tambela, who was stripped of his functions by Captain Ibrahim Traore on Friday. No reason was given for the dismissal of Tambela, who had headed three successive military-appointed governments since Traore came to power in a 2022 coup. A close ally of Traore and a journalist by trade, Ouedraogo was formerly editor-in-chief and then director of the Sahel country's state television. After the September 2022 coup, Traore tapped Ouedraogo for the post of Minister of Communications and government spokesperson as a civilian figure in the military administration. He was subsequently reappointed to the role in three reshuffles. The west African country was plunged into instability by a January 2022 coup during which Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba seized power. Little more than eight months later, Damiba himself was overthrown by Traore, 36, who now heads the junta regime. Under Traore, the country, along with its fellow junta-led neighbors in Mali and Niger, has turned away from former imperial ruler France and pivoted toward Russia instead. The three states have banded together to form the Alliance of Sahel States and are battling jihadi violence that first erupted in northern Mali in 2012. Since it spread to Burkina Faso, that conflict has killed around 26,000 people and forced some 2 million people to flee their homes, according to monitoring group ACLED.	https://www.voanews.com/a/burkina-junta-chief-names-new-pm-after-dissolving-govt-/7891288.html	2024-12-07T16:20:27-08:00	
North Macedonian political party calls for ban on social media content that incites 'self-destructive behavior'	SKOPJE, North Macedonia — A political party in North Macedonia on Saturday demanded authorities ban social networks whose content incites violence and self-destructive behavior after several young people were seriously injured in connection with the popular 'Superman challenge' on TikTok. Health authorities said at least 17 students, ages 10 to 17, were brought to hospitals in the capital Skopje and other towns over the past week with broken bones, contusions and bruises. The children were injured after being thrown into the air by their friends to fly like superheroes and get applause on the internet. The Liberal-Democratic Party, which was part of the left-led coalition that ruled the country from 2016 to earlier in 2024, issued a press statement Saturday strongly condemning 'the irresponsible spread of dangerous content on social media, such as the latest TikTok 'challenge' known as 'Superman,' which has injured six children across (the country) in the past 24 hours.' 'The lack of adequate control over the content of social media allows such 'games' to reach the most vulnerable users,' the party statement said. It demanded the 'immediate introduction of measures to ban content that incites violence and self-destructive behavior, increase surveillance, and sanction platforms that enable dangerous trends.' North Macedonia's education minister Vesna Janevska said students should focus on education, not TikTok challenges. 'The ban on mobile phones in schools will not have an effect. Phones will be available to children in their homes, neighborhoods and other environments,' she said. Psychologists have warned that the desire to be 'in' with the trends on social networks, combined with excessive use of mobile phones, is the main reason for the rise in risky behaviors among children. They urged parents and schools to talk with students.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-macedonian-political-party-calls-for-ban-on-social-media-content-that-incites-self-destructive-behavior-/7891124.html	2024-12-07T15:55:06-08:00	
Ghana counts votes in tight presidential race, hopes for better times	ACCRA, GHANA — Ghana voted in a presidential and parliamentary election Saturday amid hopes for an economic revival after the worst financial crisis in a generation that led to a major debt default in the West African nation. President Nana Akufo-Addo is stepping down next month after serving the two terms allowed by the constitution in Ghana, the world's second-largest cocoa producer and a significant gold miner. Twelve candidates are vying to succeed him, but the race is seen as primarily between Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, chosen successor of Akufo-Addo's New Patriotic Party (NPP), and former President John Dramani Mahama of the National Democratic Congress (NDC). Opinion polls tipped Mahama, who served as president from 2012 to 2016, for a potential comeback. Mahama, 66, has framed Bawumia as representing a continuation of policies that led to Ghana's economic woes, and has promised to renegotiate terms of a $3 billion IMF bailout secured last year to restructure the country's debts. The crisis peaked in 2022 when Ghana turned to the International Monetary Fund. 'This is the only election that we can all see the direction of the outcome before we start voting,' Mahama said after casting his vote in Bole, his hometown in northern Ghana. 'We are hopeful and confident that we'll win,' he added. Bawumia, a 61-year-old former central banker, also expressed confidence that he would win after he voted in his Walewale constituency in northern Ghana. 'By the grace of God, I'm very hopeful of winning this election. I think that we have done a lot of work. We have put our message to the people, I think the message has been well received,' he said. On the campaign trail, Bawumia has highlighted Ghana's gradual recovery from the crisis, with economic growth surging by 6.9% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, the fastest rate in five years. He told supporters he will foster policies that will strengthen Ghana's recovery. Both candidates said voting was generally calm and peaceful. Jubilant NDC supporters took to the streets of Accra's historic Jamestown, chanting, banging pans and blaring horns after results from their polling stations showed the party in a comfortable lead. The electoral commission said over 99% of polling stations opened on time with voting materials delivered to them. It said later Saturday evening that turnout was massive, but it was too early to give a specific figure. Benjamin Bano-Bio, director of electoral services, said voting was calm though there were some pockets of violence. 'Our verification machines were effective, and the entire process was largely peaceful, except for a few places where violence occurred, leading to the death of one person,' Bano-Bio told a news conference. After polls closed at 1700 GMT, election teams immediately began tallying ballots under the watch of agents from political parties before sending them to collation centers. Some provisional legislative results are expected late Saturday night and Sunday, while the presidential outcome is expected by Tuesday, although trends often allow an early prediction. Approximately 18.7 million of Ghana's 34 million population are registered to vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-counts-votes-in-tight-presidential-race-hopes-for-better-times/7891123.html	2024-12-07T15:27:37-08:00	
US announces nearly $1 billion in military aid for Ukraine	WASHINGTON — The United States on Saturday announced a new $988 million military assistance package for Ukraine as Washington races to provide aid to Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It nearly halves the available $2.21 billion remaining in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) as the Biden administration works to commit to buying weapons from industry, rather than pull from U.S. weapons stocks. Trump's victory in the November election has cast doubt on the future of American aid for Ukraine, providing a limited window for billions of dollars in already authorized assistance to be provided before he is sworn in next month. The package features drones, ammunition for precision HIMARS rocket launchers, and equipment and spare parts for artillery systems, tanks and armored vehicles, the Pentagon said in a statement. The Biden administration has often used Presidential Drawdown Authority, which authorizes President Joe Biden to transfer excess articles and services from U.S. stocks without congressional approval during an emergency. The USAI funds are separate and will go to purchase new weapons from the defense industry or partners rather than drawn from American stocks, meaning it will not immediately arrive on the battlefield. It follows a $725 million package announced Monday that included a second tranche of landmines as well as anti-air and anti-armor weapons. The outgoing U.S. administration is working to get as much aid as possible to Ukraine before Trump — who has repeatedly criticized U.S. assistance for Kyiv and claimed he could secure a ceasefire within hours — takes over. Trump's comments have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about the future of U.S. aid, and Ukraine's ability to withstand Russian attacks in the absence of further American support. The United States has spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022 and coordinating aid from dozens of countries. Ukraine's international supporters have since then provided tens of billions of dollars in weapons, ammunition, training and other security aid that has been key to helping Kyiv resist Russian forces. The Biden administration still has about $6 billion of congressionally granted presidential drawdown authority, including funds authorized in 2024 and funds discovered by the Pentagon after overestimating the value of arms shipped to Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022 the U.S. has committed more than $62 billion worth of security assistance to Ukraine.

Net is tightening' on man suspected of shooting executive, says official	NEW YORK — New York's mayor said Saturday 'the net is tightening' on the man suspected of gunning down a top health insurance executive before fleeing the city. Mayor Eric Adams said detectives knew the name of the fresh-faced suspect, an image of whom was released by investigators Thursday and who has now been on the run for almost four days. Adams praised 'the manner in which (investigators) were able to follow his footsteps to recover evidence — some of it is known, some of it is unknown — but the net is tightening and we're going to bring this person to justice,' he said, the New York Post reported. Adams was quoted by the Post as saying the police were withholding the suspect's name for now. 'We don't want to release that,' the mayor said. 'If you do, you are basically giving a tip to the person we are seeking, and we do not want to give him an upper hand at all. Let him continue to believe he can hide behind the mask.' 'We revealed his face,' the mayor continued, referring to numerous security camera photos and video released after Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare was gunned down. And eventually, 'we're going to reveal who he is and we're going to bring him to justice,' Adams said. The masked assailant was caught on camera entering a bus station in a northern neighborhood of Manhattan in the wake of Wednesday's slaying, but he could not be identified exiting the facility on foot, a police spokesperson confirmed to Agence France-Presse. 'They believe he's not in New York City,' the spokesperson added. The image of the smiling suspect was obtained from a youth hostel where the gunman apparently stayed before the hit, detectives said, with media reporting he lowered his mask to flirt with a receptionist. The FBI, which said it was assisting the New York police, offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his capture. 'Delay' and 'deny' The gunman on Wednesday sprayed Thompson of United Healthcare — one of the country's largest medical insurers — with bullets in front of bystanders, in an audacious attack captured by a surveillance camera and now seen by millions. Thompson was attending an investor conference in the Midtown business district. Police have yet to suggest a motive and would not confirm media reports that the words 'delay' and 'deny' — often used by insurance companies to reject claims — were written on shell casings found at the scene. Video footage shows Thompson on the sidewalk outside the New York Hilton Midtown when a man in a hooded top, his lower face covered, approaches from behind, then fires several shots at his 50-year-old victim, who crumples to the ground. Camera footage showed the suspect fleeing on foot, before getting on a bicycle, with police revealing he headed to Central Park. Officers have confirmed that a cell phone as well as DNA from a coffee cup were recovered from near the murder scene. In the absence of an arrest, speculation has been rife that the gunman may have sought revenge for adverse medical coverage decisions made by the insurer. UnitedHealthcare is a major player in the lucrative American health care market; the parent group had revenues of $100.8 billion in the third quarter of the year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/net-is-tightening-on-man-suspected-of-shooting-executive-says-official/7891063.html	2024-12-07T13:20:31-08:00	
Brazil judge sentences 3 former officers for killing of Black man	RIO DE JANEIRO — A judge handed down long sentences Saturday to three former officers of Brazil's Federal Highway Police over the 2022 death of a Black man who was killed by asphyxiation inside an SUV's smoke-filled trunk. Video of officers forcibly keeping Genivaldo de Jesus Santos, 38, in the back of their police vehicle as a dense cloud of what appeared to be tear gas emerged from the car sparked outrage across Brazil and protests in Umbauba, in the northeastern state of Sergipe. Police had said the man displayed aggressive behavior and was 'actively resisting' the officers who pulled him over. They said agents immobilized him then used 'instruments of lesser offensive potential' to contain him. The man could be heard screaming and local media later reported that the victim had tried to explain that he was taking medication for psychiatric disorders. Jurors found the officers guilty of torturing and killing the man at the end of a 12-day trial. Justice Rafael Soares sentenced Paulo Rodolpho Lima Nascimento to 28 years in prison for homicide, according to a statement from the 5th Federal Regional Court. Soares sentenced the other officers, William de Barros Noia and Kleber Nascimento Freitas, to more than 23 years in prison each for torture resulting in death. In August 2023, an internal disciplinary process recommended that the three officers be dismissed, a decision that was later confirmed by the Justice Ministry. Police violence has once again come into sharp focus in Brazil recently. Last Tuesday, footage of a military police officer in Sao Paulo throwing a man off a bridge and into a river prompted a backlash. A day earlier, local media G1 published a video that showed an off-duty military police officer last month firing a series of shots at and killing a young man who had stolen packets of soap. That incident also occurred in Sao Paulo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-judge-sentences-3-former-officers-for-killing-of-black-man-/7891036.html	2024-12-07T11:52:17-08:00	
Macron welcomes Trump to Paris with presidential pomp, joined by Zelenskyy	PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Donald Trump to Paris on Saturday with a full a dose of presidential pomp, and they held an impromptu meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymr Zelenskyy on a day that mixed pageantry with attention to pressing global problems. U.S. President-elect Trump said when he arrived at the Elysee Palace for a face-to-face meeting with Macron — which soon expanded to include Zelenskyy — that the two would be discussing a world that’s gone 'a little crazy.' Trump’s visit to France, part of a global celebration of the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral five years after a devastating fire, came as Macron and other European leaders are trying to win Trump’s favor and persuade him to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion. Macron's office said that would be discussed as well as the wars in the Middle East. As Trump arrived at the official residence of the French president, Macron went out of his way to project an image of close ties, posing for multiple handshakes interspersed with plenty of back-patting. Trump said it was 'a great honor' and talked about the 'great relationship' they have had. A grand red carpet was rolled in the same way the French welcome sitting American presidents. Before they went inside, Trump said, 'It certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now. And we’ll be talking about that.' Zelenskyy arrived at the palace about 45 minutes after Trump. Macron had planned to meet with Zelenskyy, and the French president's office said the three-way meeting was proposed by Macron and arranged shortly before Trump’s arrival. Trump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine swiftly but has not specified how, raising concerns in Kyiv about what terms may be laid out for any future negotiations. Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating a relationship since the Republican defeated Democrat Kamala Harris last month. But Macron's office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying other politicians not now in office had been invited as well. Trump was invited as president-elect of a 'friendly nation,' Macron's office said, adding, 'This is in no way exceptional, we’ve done it before.' The red-carpet treatment, however, was a sign of how eager Macron and other European leaders are to win Trump’s favor even before he takes office. During one of Trump’s first trips as president during his first term was to Paris, where Macron made him the guest of honor at Bastille Day events. Trump later said he wanted to replicate the grand military parade back in the United States. President Joe Biden also was invited but will not attend. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre cited a scheduling conflict and said first lady Jill Biden will represent the United States. The meeting with the French president is taking place before the Notre Dame event, as will the get-together with Prince William, who's also scheduled to meet with Jill Biden, according to the British royal palace. To build trust with the incoming U.S. administration, Zelenskyy’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, met key members of Trump’s team on a two-day trip earlier this week. A senior Ukrainian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly, described the meetings as productive but declined to disclose details. Relations between France and the United States during Trump’s first term began warmly enough but grew increasingly strained over time. Macron was the guest of honor at Trump’s first state dinner, and Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship suffered after Macron criticized Trump for questioning the need for NATO and raising doubts about America’s commitment to the mutual defense pact. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump often mocked Macron, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American companies. But Macron was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Trump last month after the election. When he accepted the invitation to travel to Paris, Trump said Macron had done 'a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!' A fire in 2019 nearly destroyed the 861-year-old landmark. More than 20 French government security agents were helping ensure Trump’s safety alongside the Secret Service, according to French national police. A special French police van provided anti-drone protection for Trump’s convoy. Security was tighter than usual outside the U.S. Embassy and other sites around Paris for the Notre Dame reopening, where dozens of international VIPs were expected. Trump was president in 2019 when the fire engulfed Notre Dame, collapsing its spire and threatening to destroy one of the world’s greatest architectural treasures, known for its mesmerizing stained glass. 'So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,' he wrote at the time on what was then Twitter. Last weekend, Trump announced that he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France. Predecessors in that prestigious role include Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-welcomes-trump-to-paris-with-presidential-pomp-joined-by-zelenskyy/7891010.html	2024-12-07T10:41:29-08:00	
Pope presides over ceremony with wide bruise on his chin	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis was seen with a significant bruise on his chin Saturday, but he presided over a ceremony to install new cardinals without apparent problems. A Vatican spokesperson said later Saturday that the bruise was caused by a contusion on Friday morning when Francis hit a nightstand with his chin. The pontiff, who turns 88 later this month, appeared slightly fatigued but carried on as normal with the scheduled ceremony to create 21 new cardinals in St. Peter's Basilica. Francis has suffered several health problems in recent years and now uses a wheelchair due to knee and back pain. In 2017, while on a trip to Colombia, Francis sported a black eye after he hit his head on a support bar when his popemobile stopped short.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-presides-over-ceremony-with-wide-bruise-on-his-chin/7890996.html	2024-12-07T10:17:57-08:00	
Trump says that US should 'not get involved' in conflict in Syria	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday the U.S. should not be involved in the conflict in Syria, where rebel forces are threatening the government of President Bashar Assad. 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!,' Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. Trump said because Russia, an Assad ally, is tied up fighting a war with Ukraine, it 'seems incapable of stopping this literal march through Syria, a country they have protected for years.' If Russia were forced out of Syria, it 'may actually be the best thing that can happen to them' because 'there was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia,' Trump said. Trump’s comments appeared to reflect his opposition to the presence of some 900 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly of them in the northeast, where they have backed a Syrian Kurd-led alliance in preventing a resurgence of Islamic State militants. Trump announced in 2018 during his first term that he wanted to withdraw the U.S. troops because he said Islamic State was near defeat. But he held off as advisers warned that a pullout would leave a void that would be filled by Iran and Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-that-us-should-not-get-involved-in-conflict-in-syria/7890980.html	2024-12-07T10:00:47-08:00	
Explosion destroys apartment block in The Hague, killing 1, injuring others	THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS — An explosion and fire rocked a neighborhood in the Dutch city of The Hague on Saturday, killing one woman and injuring other people and destroying several apartments, according to authorities. The cause of the disaster is unclear. Mayor Jan van Zanen said investigators are looking into 'all possibilities.' Police said they are looking for a car seen leaving the scene. Emergency authorities said four people were rescued from the rubble and taken to a hospital. The mayor said rescuers were no longer looking for survivors but for bodies. He could not specify how many people might still be unaccounted for. Residents of the northeastern neighborhood of Mariahoeve in The Hague heard a huge bang and screams before dawn. One woman told local media that she thought an earthquake had happened. Dutch authorities deployed a specialized urban search and rescue team to the scene, with four dogs trained to find victims. The team was previously used during the devastating earthquake in Turkey in 2023. Soon after the explosion, a line of ambulances could be seen waiting nearby in anticipation of more victims. The spokesperson for the local hospital said that they were on standby to deal with injuries. The mayor called it 'an extremely heavy day.' 'I had expected a different Saturday,' van Zanen told a news conference. Prime Minister Dick Schoof said in a statement he was shocked by the images of the disaster. 'My thoughts go out to the victims, all other people involved and the emergency services who are now working on the scene,' he said. The Dutch royal family expressed similar sentiments. 'Our thoughts are with those affected in The Hague after the explosion and fire this morning,' including those 'who are afraid of the fate of their loved ones,' King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/explosion-destroys-apartment-block-in-the-hague-killing-1-injuring-others/7890978.html	2024-12-07T09:51:31-08:00	
Decriminalization dominates Australian drug summit	SYDNEY — Australian authorities are being criticized for ruling out drug decriminalization at an international summit in Sydney this week, ignoring a call by many experts and health groups for a health care response to drug use and addiction rather than criminal penalties. Several hundred politicians, policy experts, police officers and health professionals gathered this week for a summit on drug reform in Sydney. The New South Wales government is examining ways to redraft the state’s drug laws and policies. Calls for the decriminalization of drug use and possession were the focus of the meeting. Campaigners say not treating drug use as a crime would encourage people to seek help without fear of legal consequences. New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park told local media Friday, though, there is not enough local support for such reform. 'The summit is not just about decriminalization, and for a government to move to decriminalize in the drugs ... would be a seismic shift to the way in which we handle drugs in New South Wales,' Park said. 'In relation to decriminalization, we think that is too significant to put on the table now without a clear mandate.' The Sydney summit heard from the mayor of Portland, in the U.S. state of Oregon, Ted Wheeler. He told delegates that earlier this year, state lawmakers repealed laws that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of illicit drugs in the state. He said that the health system has been overwhelmed, and that drug-related crime has risen sharply because of the legislation. International debate is passionate and divided. A report by the Global Commission on Drug Policy, formed in 2011 to campaign for drug reform, called for a total reexamination of the approach to illicit substances. Louise Arbour, a former U.N. high commissioner for human rights, was involved in the report and told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that a new approach is needed. 'Globally, it is very clear that this so-called war on drugs has created a gigantic international illegal drug trade,' Arbour said. 'The worst aspect of that war is that it has essentially been a war on people — been a war on people who use drugs and not a war on people who actually prey on them.' The annual number of drug overdose deaths in Australia has almost doubled over the past 20 years, according to the Penington Institute, a nonprofit organization in Victoria state. Some 100,000 people are estimated to die each year from drug overdoses in the United States, but the number of fatalities has decreased, according to research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7890969.html	2024-12-07T09:45:02-08:00	
Germany, France, Poland condemn use of force against protesters in Georgia	BERLIN — The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland on Saturday strongly condemned 'the disproportionate use of force' against peaceful protesters and the targeting of the opposition and media representatives in Georgia. Mass protests in Georgia fueled by the governing party’s decision to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union entered a second week Thursday, with police cracking down on demonstrators with increasing force. In their joint statement, the three foreign ministers called for the immediate release of opposition members. They demanded that 'fundamental rights, including freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, must be upheld and protected as per Georgia’s constitution and international commitments.' The ruling Georgian Dream party retained control of parliament in a disputed October 26 election, a vote widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia’s help and have boycotted parliament sessions. Opposition protests gained new momentum after the Georgian Dream’s decision on November 28 to put the EU accession talks on hold. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the rallies and beat scores of protesters, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital’s central boulevard. Hundreds have been detained and over 100 people have been treated for injuries since the start of the clashes. Fifty more protesters were detained Friday night, Georgian officials said Saturday. Police chased demonstrators through the streets of Tbilisi until the early hours of Saturday and violently detained some of them. The crackdown has drawn a strong condemnation from the United States. Speaking at a ministerial conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday denounced what he described as a brutal 'repression of those calling for their country to stay on the path to closer ties with Europe.' On Saturday, Germany, France and Poland called on 'Georgian Dream to deescalate tensions and open an inclusive dialogue with all political forces and representatives of civil society.' 'We underscore our determination to support the democratic and European aspirations of the Georgian people,' the statement said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-france-poland-condemn-use-of-force-against-protesters-in-georgia/7890948.html	2024-12-07T09:10:51-08:00	
Clashes kill 6 Pakistan troops, 22 militants near Afghan border	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan said Saturday that a predawn assault on a security post and intelligence-driven counterinsurgency raids in its northwestern province bordering Afghanistan killed at least six troops and 22 militants. The military’s media wing said that the violence occurred in several districts, including Tank and North Waziristan. The statement identified the slain militants as 'khwarij,' a term employed by the government to categorize insurgents affiliated with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, a globally recognized terrorist organization. Area security officials said that dozens of heavily armed TTP militants staged a multipronged attack on the security outpost in the town of Thall, resulting in the deaths of six paramilitary troops and injuries to several others in the ensuing gun battles. The TTP reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack but did not comment on its casualties in the reported military raids elsewhere. Intensified TTP-led attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and separatist ethnic Baloch insurgents in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan, have resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives, including many security personnel this year alone, according to official data. Pakistan alleges TTP leaders and fighters orchestrate terrorism from Afghan hideouts with the support of the neighboring country’s Taliban government, which is not recognized by any country. Taliban leaders reject the charges, saying they are not allowing anyone to use Afghanistan to threaten other countries, including Pakistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-kill-6-pakistan-troops-22-militants-near-afghan-border/7890923.html	2024-12-07T08:36:17-08:00	
Power cuts, train cancellations as Storm Darragh batters UK	LONDON — Tens of thousands of people across the U.K. were left without power Saturday morning after Storm Darragh hit the country with strong winds and caused pre-Christmas travel disruptions. The U.K.'s Met Office issued a rare red alert for high winds overnight to Saturday morning, covering parts of Wales and southwest England. The government warned 3 million people living in the area with a siren-like alert on their phones to stay at home Friday night. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the storm posed a 'challenging situation.' 'About 3 million homes will have had the emergency alert system to their mobile phone. I would just encourage anyone who has had that to follow the advice,' Reynolds told Sky News on Saturday. Darragh, the fourth named storm of the season, is also expected to bring heavy rain through the weekend, with more than 100 flood warnings and alerts in place across the U.K. One man died after a tree fell onto his van during the storm, said police in Lancashire, northwest England. In Wales, the Met Office estimated gusts of up to 150 kph, which knocked out power for over 50,000 people, according to the PA news agency. Power cuts affected 86,000 homes in England, Scotland and Wales, according to the Energy Networks Association. Trains were disrupted or suspended on several routes, including from Glasgow to Edinburgh in Scotland and between Cambridge and Stansted Airport in eastern England. Rail operator CrossCountry put a 'do not travel' notice in place for Saturday due to cancellations and severe delays. Network Rail Wales suspended trains on the Welsh northern coast due to a 'fallen tree blocking the line,' and several bridges in southern England and Wales were closed for safety reasons. A separate amber warning, which is less serious than the red alert but still poses 'potential risk to life and property,' covering a larger stretch of the Britain and Northern Ireland is in place until Saturday night. In Northern Ireland, thousands were left without power, and several bus and train services were suspended or delayed. Christmas markets and sporting events were postponed, including the Merseyside derby between Premier League leaders Liverpool and Everton. In Ireland, which issued an 'orange' wind warning, 400,000 people were left without electricity, according to the RTE news agency. Dublin Airport said a 'a number of flights scheduled for Saturday morning have been cancelled by airlines' due to the storm. Darragh comes two weeks after Storm Bert battered much of Britain, causing flooding in parts of Wales and knocking out power to thousands of homes in Ireland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/power-cuts-train-cancellations-as-storm-darragh-batters-uk/7890908.html	2024-12-07T08:06:05-08:00	
Polls open in Ghana election, but economic crisis overshadows voting	ACCRA, GHANA — Polls opened in presidential and legislative elections in Ghana on Saturday, poised to be a litmus test for democracy in a region shaken by extremist violence and coups. Some 18.7 million people are registered to vote in the West African country hit by one of the worst economic crises in a generation. However, the two main candidates offer little hope for change for the nation. Ghana used to be a poster child for democracy in the region. At a time when coups threatened democracy in West Africa, Ghana has emerged as a beacon of democratic stability with a history of peaceful elections. It had also been an economic powerhouse, priding itself on its economic development. But in recent years, it has struggled with a profound economic crisis, including surging inflation and a lack of jobs. According to an opinion poll released earlier this year by Afrobarometer, a research group, 82% of Ghanaians feel their country is headed in the wrong direction. Although 12 candidates are running to become Ghana’s next president, Saturday’s election — like previous ones since the return of multiparty politics in 1992 — has emerged as a two-horse race. Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia is the candidate of the ruling New Patriotic Party, or NPP, which has struggled to resolve the economic crisis. He faces off against former President John Dramani Mahama, the leader of the main opposition party National Democratic Congress, or NDC. He was voted out in 2016 after failing to deliver on promises for the economy. The NDC prides itself as a social democratic party, while the ruling NPP tags itself as leaning to the right. But in fact, analysts and voters said, the programs of their presidential candidates do not differ in a significant way. Two hundred seventy-six members of parliament will also be elected Saturday. The ruling NPP party and the main opposition NDC each have 137 members in the 275-member legislature, with one independent member who has been voting mostly along with the ruling party. One more constituency will be allowed to vote in this election, bringing the number of deputies to 276. In their final campaign rallies Thursday, both candidates made a last push to pitch their political parties as the answer to Ghana’s economic woes. Bawumia, 61, an Oxford-educated economist and former deputy governor of the country’s central bank, promised to build on the outgoing administration’s efforts and stabilize the economy. Mahama, 65, on the other hand, restated his promise to 'reset' the country on various fronts. 'We need to reset our democracy, governance, economy, finances, agriculture, infrastructure, environment, health sector and all that we hold dear as a people,' the former president said. Across the capital of Accra, the mood for the election has been upbeat in posters and billboards with bikers displaying stunts, political rallies on the streets, election jingles and songs blasting from public speakers. But the concern for many is also palpable for the key thing at stake: The country’s ailing economy, which has been challenged on various fronts in recent years. The country defaulted on most of its foreign debt last year as it faced a worsening economic crisis that spiked the price of fuel, food and other essential items. The inflation rate hit 54% by the end of last year, and although it’s been coming down since then, not many Ghanaians can still tell the difference when they go to the market. The chronic challenge of illegal gold mining — known locally as galamsey — has also been a major issue in the campaign and a source of concern for voters, triggering protests and criticism against the outgoing government. Ghana is Africa’s top gold producer and the world’s sixth largest, but the commodity has been increasingly mined illegally as people become more desperate to find jobs in an economy that has been crumbling. The mining has polluted rivers and other parts of the environment despite government actions to clamp down on the practice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polls-open-in-ghana-election-but-economic-crisis-overshadows-voting/7890769.html	2024-12-07T03:54:32-08:00	
At least 20 killed in Gaza as Qatar voices hope for ceasefire	CAIRO — Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 20 Palestinians on Saturday, local health officials said, as Qatar voiced hope of fresh momentum in efforts to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the reported strikes in Gaza City and Rafah. At least eight of the fatalities were civilians, according to residents and medics. It was unclear whether the rest of those killed were fighters, and Reuters could not independently verify the figures. Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Qatar was engaging with the incoming Trump administration on Gaza after sensing fresh momentum for ceasefire talks following the U.S. election. Donald Trump's Middle East envoy has traveled to Qatar and Israel to kick-start the U.S. president-elect's diplomatic push for a ceasefire and hostage release deal before his inauguration on January 20, a source briefed on the talks told Reuters on Thursday. The war in Gaza has been raging for over 14 months, with much of the enclave laid to waste and more than 44,000 Palestinians killed, according to Gaza health authorities, as Israeli forces continue their drive to wipe out Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the militant group. The deadliest Israeli-Palestinian violence in decades began when Hamas stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others designate Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations. In the occupied West Bank on Saturday, a Palestinian man was shot dead by Israeli forces at a checkpoint, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. Police said a security guard shot him after he threw firecrackers at the forces there and that a knife was found on his person.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-20-killed-in-gaza-as-qatar-voices-hope-for-ceasefire/7890763.html	2024-12-07T03:39:34-08:00	
Ukraine confirms Danish delivery of F-16s as Zelenskyy seeks support in Paris	KYIV, UKRAINE — Denmark has delivered a second batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday as he traveled to Paris to meet with top politicians and dignitaries. In a message on Telegram, Zelenskyy praised Denmark and lamented a lack of dedication from other allies. 'The first batch of planes provided by the Danes are already shooting down Russian missiles: rescuing our people and our infrastructure. Now our air shield is reinforced even further,' he said. 'If all partners were so determined, we would have been able to make Russian terror impossible.' The announcement comes as Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region marks a day of mourning for 10 people killed in a Russian attack on Friday. A further 24 people, including two children, were injured when a missile struck a local service station, said regional Governor Ivan Fedorov. Three more people were killed in a strike on the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Friday, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. Addressing the attacks, Zelenskyy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not seek 'real peace.' Putin 'only seeks the ability to treat any country this way, with bombs, missiles, and all other forms of violence,' Zelenskyy said. 'Only through strength can we resist this. And only through strength can real peace be established.' Zelenskyy is due to meet other world leaders Saturday, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at an event in Paris celebrating the renovation of Notre Dame Cathedral after a devastating fire in 2019. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is among those expected to be in attendance, with European leaders keen to cultivate the incoming leader's favor to persuade him to maintain support for Ukraine against Russia’s three-year invasion. It’s not clear whether Trump will meet with Zelenskyy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-confirms-danish-delivery-of-f-16s-as-zelenskyy-seeks-support-in-paris/7890749.html	2024-12-07T03:12:44-08:00	
Yoon impeachment uncertain, as opposition pleads with conservatives to return for vote	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The impeachment effort against South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared uncertain on Saturday, as opposition forces made an emotional, last-minute effort to convince their conservative colleagues to support the measure. During a tense session at South Korea's National Assembly, nearly all conservative lawmakers of the governing People Power Party, or PPP, walked out of the legislative chamber just minutes before the vote, effectively boycotting the opposition-led impeachment motion against Yoon. As conservatives filed out of the chamber one by one, each was met by loud jeers and chants from an opposition-dominated crowd gathered just outside, with many screaming insults, including 'collaborators.' Hours later, a dramatic scene continued to unfold as the opposition used a variety of pressure tactics to get their counterparts to return. At one point, opposition lawmakers chanted the names of their conservative colleagues, one by one, followed by 'come back.' At least two conservatives returned, joining one other PPP member who had stayed, prompting loud cheers in the National Assembly building. The impeachment effort needs the votes of eight conservative PPP lawmakers to pass. The opposition Democratic Party says the vote can last until approximately 12:30 a.m. local time. Outside the legislative compound was a crowd of approximately 100,000 people, according to police estimates, the vast majority of whom had gathered to support the impeachment measure. Many chanted for conservative lawmakers to return. Yoon declared martial law late Tuesday, claiming it was necessary to 'crush anti-state forces' and 'protect constitutional order.' The decree was overturned by opposition lawmakers within hours. Earlier on Saturday, he apologized for causing public anxiety and vowed he would not attempt a second martial law decree. In an apparent attempt to find a path forward that does involve his resignation, Yoon also said 'future governance will be jointly handled by our party and the government.' It is not clear how Yoon would yield any presidential authority to the PPP, analysts said, since there does not appear to be an established political process for doing so. Some PPP lawmakers have begun pushing for a compromise proposal, under which South Korea’s constitution would be amended to shorten presidential terms to four years, rather than the current five. Under such a proposal, Yoon would apparently step down early and the powers of the presidency could be reduced in some manner. However, opposition party lawmakers have given no indication that they would support such a deal. 'This is a cunning tactic only in order to buy time,' Kim Joon-hyung, a lawmaker with the opposition Rebuilding Korea Party told VOA. 'This regime, and the ruling party is dead and dysfunctional, even if the impeachment vote fails.' South Korea’s presidential office has not clarified Yoon’s remarks or whether he would support such an arrangement. A Seoul-based law professor, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the ongoing discussions, said there is no process by which the president can transfer the powers of the presidency to the party. 'But more importantly, I don’t think that’s what [Yoon] meant,' he added. 'I think he merely meant that he will follow whatever decision the party makes regarding how to stabilize the situation ... whether that refers to constitutional revision is unclear.' Yoon and his party may be trying to avoid a vacancy in the office of the presidency, because under such a scenario an election must be held, according to the constitution, he said. 'President Yoon seems to be trying everything he can to hang on to power,' said Hans Schattle, a professor of political science at Yonsei University. 'But the idea of him staying in office any longer seems totally out of sync with the public outrage right now.' Opposition lawmakers, who have a solid majority in the unicameral legislature, have vowed to quickly hold another impeachment vote if their Saturday effort fails, raising the prospect of a prolonged period of political instability. 'The public will continue to demand that the president, the instigator of this rebellion, will face prosecution or arrest,' Rep. Kim Min-seok told VOA amid the uncertainty Saturday. Kim, a senior Democratic Party leader, said Yoon’s apology was insincere. 'This will further fuel public anger and lead to greater political chaos,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/yoon-impeachment-uncertain-as-opposition-pleads-with-conservatives-to-return-for-vote/7890741.html	2024-12-07T02:49:51-08:00	
US to observe 83rd anniversary of attack on Pearl Harbor	Pearl Harbor 'changed the future of the world,' U.S. President Joe Biden said at a White House event for veterans and their families on Friday, the eve of the anniversary of Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The president recalled that he 'heard so much' about Pearl Harbor when he was growing up and talked about his uncles who enlisted in the military after the attack. 'During World War II, we stood at an inflection point,' the president said. 'We still stand at an inflection point. The decisions we make now in the next four to five years will determine the course of our future for decades to come. ... We owe it to the next generation to set that course on a more free, more secure and more just path.' Saturday, December 7, marks the 83rd anniversary of Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, a U.S. naval base on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, near Honolulu. Hundreds of Japanese fighter planes unleashed bombs, bullets and aerial torpedoes on America’s Pacific Fleet in the Sunday morning attack. More than 2,400 U.S. sailors, soldiers and civilians were killed that day. About half of them died on the USS Arizona battleship. The Japanese succeeded in sinking four of the eight U.S. battleships at Pearl Harbor and damaging the remaining four. According to the Naval History and History Command website, 'That more Japanese aircraft were not shot down had nothing to do with the skill, training or bravery of our Sailors and other servicemembers. 'Rather, U.S. antiaircraft weapons were inadequate in number and capability, for not only had the Japanese achieved tactical surprise, they achieved technological surprise with aircraft and weapons far better than anticipated — a lesson in the danger of underestimating the enemy that resonates to this day.' The day after the attack, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt appeared before a joint session of Congress, seeking a declaration of war. After he delivered his famous 'Day of Infamy' speech, the Senate unanimously supported the declaration. In the House, there was one dissenter, Montana’s Representative Jeanette Rankin, a pacifist. Roosevelt signed the declaration Monday afternoon. The United States had now been officially drawn into World War II. Before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States had imposed economic sanctions on Japan as a way of stopping Japan’s expansion goals in Asia. The sanctions affected Japan’s access to aircraft exports. The attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor was part of Japan’s plan to prevent any challenges to those goals in Asia. There is now a USS Arizona Memorial that expands over the hull of the sunken vessel without touching it. Earlier this week, a 104-year-old survivor of Pearl Harbor returned to Hawaii to participate in this year’s commemorations. Ira 'Ike' Schab Jr. of Portland, Oregon, who was a Navy musician, was greeted at the airport in Honolulu with a water cannon salute and music from the U.S. Pacific Fleet Band. When asked what he remembers about that day, Schab told the Hawaii News Now website, 'Being scared, more than anything else.' Schab said he made the trip because he is one of the Pacific Fleet’s 'very few' survivors remaining from that day. He said, 'They deserve to be recognized and honored.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-observe-83rd-anniversary-of-attack-on-pearl-harbor/7890052.html	2024-12-07T00:04:53-08:00	
Taliban shutter Afghan broadcaster over foreign content	Washington — The Taliban said Thursday it had shuttered an Afghan TV station over what it said was 'vulgar' programming. Around eight Taliban officials, including at least one who was armed, raided the Kabul office of Arezo TV on Wednesday morning. Men and women were separated, and their phones taken, according to an employee who spoke with Agence France-Presse on the condition of anonymity. At least six staff members were detained and placed under investigation. The offices were sealed and the staff told to wait for further orders, the employee said. The Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice said Thursday that Arezo TV had been working with foreign media to dub TV programs into the Afghan language. The content appears to have been foreign TV dramas. 'Some people were using the name of Arezo TV to carry out actions that were contrary to Islamic values and national traditions,' the ministry said in a statement. 'It became clear that some people had used the name and building of Arezo TV as well as their position in the media outlet to pay temporary workers to dub vulgar serials and programs that were against Islamic and Afghan principles and traditions with the financial support of exiled media outlets outside the country,' it said. Arezo TV, which was founded in 2006, produces news, wildlife documentaries and 'Islamic series' that are dubbed from Turkish. The broadcaster has a staff of about 70 in Kabul, according to a local journalists' association. The raid and arrests will have a negative impact on media in Afghanistan, media associations said. Mohammad Graan, president of the Afghanistan chapter of the South Asian Association of Reporters Club and Journalists Forum, or SJF, said that detaining Arezo TV staff could 'dishearten' journalists. 'It is clear that it will pressure journalists psychologically and demotivate them,' he told VOA. Graan said that under the law, no one has the right to search an individual's phone or computer but, he said, 'the Taliban are doing that, and that would have a negative impact on all journalists.' He said that the Taliban are selective in dealing with the media and journalists. 'It is clear that whoever is against them or whatever damages their image, they would take action against it,' said Graan. When the Taliban seized power in August 2021, they said media were free to report, if they didn't publish content that is 'contrary to Islam.' Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid has said that there are no restrictions on journalists, if they 'consider the national interest and Islamic values and avoid spreading rumors.' But journalists say a lack of clarity around rules makes reporting in Afghanistan hard. A Kabul-based journalist who did not want his identity to be disclosed told VOA that the Taliban actions 'show that they are not committed to their words on respecting freedom of speech.' 'It is not the first time, and it won't be the last time in Afghanistan that the Taliban closed a TV [station],' he said. The journalist said that the Taliban have closed stations in the capital and other provinces for years. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders says that since the Taliban takeover, more than 40% of media outlets have disappeared and that media work under strict conditions. The watchdog ranks Afghanistan as the third-worst country globally for press freedom. The Kabul journalist said journalists are working under a lot of pressure. He said managers at the media outlet he works for pressured him to remove a post this week about the Taliban ban on women training at medical institutes. 'They [the management] told me that if there is any problem, we would not be able to help you as we are also under a lot of pressure,' he said. Graan, of the SJF, said that the journalists in Afghanistan do not feel safe. 'They live in fear. They fear that what they report could create problems for them. They could lose their job or be put in jail.' The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the Human Rights Office have both said that journalists and media outlets 'operate under an environment of censorship and tight restrictions.' Some information in this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-shutter-afghan-broadcaster-over-foreign-content/7890620.html	2024-12-07T00:04:13-08:00	
Russian LGBTQ+ activists describe a climate of fear amid new laws, court rulings	TALLINN, Estonia — In the year since Russia's Supreme Court effectively outlawed any promotion of LGBTQ+ rights, activists say they are experiencing a climate of fear and intimidation in the country. LGBTQ+ rights have been under legal and public pressure for over a decade under President Vladimir Putin, but especially since the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Putin has argued the war is a proxy battle with the West, which he says aims to destroy Russia and its 'traditional family values.' Putin insists Russia doesn't discriminate against LGBTQ+ people, but he also decries 'perversions that lead to degradation and extinction.' Parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin last year called gender transitioning 'pure satanism' that should stay in the U.S. Any public representation of gay and transgender people is banned. Gender-affirming medical care and changing one's gender in official documents is prohibited. With the Supreme Court's ruling in November 2023 that found 'the international LGBT movement' to be extremist, members of the LGBTQ+ community can be prosecuted and imprisoned for up to six years. As a result, many people like Gela Gogishvili and Haoyang Xu have fled Russia. They lived a happy life in the republic of Tatarstan, where Gogishvili was a pharmacist and Xu was a student from China. They were detained after the Kremlin in December 2022 expanded its ban of 'propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations' from minors to adults, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ+ activities. Authorities accused them of spreading 'LGBT propaganda' among minors. Gogishvili was fined, while Xu was put in a detention center for migrants pending deportation. They eventually fled abroad separately and are seeking asylum in France. 'I'm scared for the queer community in Russia that remains in the country,' Gogishvili said. Targeting nightclubs, rainbow flags and gay tourism Those who remain find themselves pushed into the shadows, marginalized even further and dogged by fear of repression and prison. 'Six years, it's not a joke,' said Olga Baranova, head of the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives. She says activists must decide if what they're doing is worth that kind of a prison sentence. Just days after the Supreme Court ruling in 2023, the LGBTQ+ community was rattled by news of police raiding gay bars, nightclubs and venues that hosted drag shows in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities. Last spring, the first criminal case on charges of involvement with the 'LGBT movement' extremist group was lodged against the owner and staff of a bar in the city of Orenburg that held drag performances. Charges have been filed for displaying symbols such as a rainbow flag — even though many of those accused had nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ community, said human rights lawyer Max Olenichev. More raids of bars and nightclubs were reported in Moscow last month, almost exactly a year since the Supreme Court ruling. One man arrested for allegedly running a travel agency for gay customers faces charges of organizing activities of an extremist organization. Independent news outlet Mediazona reported that Andrei Kotov, 48, rejected the charges and said police beat him and administered electric shocks during his arrest, even though he didn't resist. Fear, intimidation and terror This 'speaks more about the desire of the authorities to create some kind of atmosphere of fear. It's not repressions, it's terror,' said Vladimir, an LGBTQ+ rights advocate in Russia who like many interviewed by AP insisted on being identified only by a first name out of security concerns. Ikar, a fellow activist and transgender man, described the actions by authorities as 'an attempt to intimidate ... to make people lose their social connections, stay silent, stay home.' Vladimir and Ikar belong to an underground LGBTQ+ rights group offering legal aid. Activists thoroughly verify identities of anyone seeking its help. The group sees a growing number of cases related to violence against LGBTQ+ people, Vladimir said. Some regional organizations have closed and others have changed their operations. The Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives moved much of its work to online chats and meetings so people can still 'support each other,' according to Baranova. Help for hard-hit transgender community The ban and other repressive laws and rulings have delivered a harsh blow to the already-vulnerable trans community, says Yan Dvorkin, head of the Center T trans rights group. Finding a job is more difficult, both for those who haven't changed their gender marker in documents and those who have. Access to gender-affirming medical care is a major issue. Violence has spiked, Dvorkin said, as has harassment and discrimination, including blackmail attempts, by threatening to report them to authorities. Anna, a 25-year-old transgender Muscovite, said being part of the community provided the courage to transition last year, after the ban on gender-affirming care was enacted. Anna considers herself lucky to have a good paying job to afford a doctor advising her from abroad on hormonal therapy, and is able to get the medicine in Moscow. But she said she hasn't come out to her colleagues for fear of losing her job, and she is sometimes harassed on the street because of her appearance. She says she has a support network of friends and doesn't want to leave Russia, even though she' knows the risks. Uncertainty for those staying in Russia Yulia, another transgender woman, also says she wants to stay, describing it as a kind of mission to show that 'people like me are not necessarily weak.' In her mid-40s, she has a family and children, a successful career, and the respect and acceptance from colleagues and friends. For her, 'it's about normalizing' being trans, she said. But much 'normalizing' is possible now and in the future is uncertain. The ban on 'propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations' forces print, TV and movie censorship of LGBTQ+ relations. In a recent example, two Russian streaming services cut a trans character from the 1990 drama series Twin Peaks. At the same time, there is abundant official rhetoric condemning LGBTQ+ people. Gela Gogishvili, the gay man who fled Russia last year, worries about the next generation of LGBTQ+ people who are currently growing up and 'will be taught that (being queer) is bad.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-lgbtq-activists-describe-a-climate-of-fear-amid-new-laws-court-rulings-/7889406.html	2024-12-07T00:02:51-08:00	
Maternal mortality review panels are in the spotlight. Here's what they do	Efforts to reduce the nation's persistently high maternal mortality rates involve state panels of experts that investigate and learn from each mother's death. The panels — called maternal mortality review committees — usually do their work quietly and out of the public eye. But that's not been the case recently in three states with strict abortion laws. Georgia dismissed all members of its committee in November after information about deaths being reviewed leaked to the news organization ProPublica. Days later, The Washington Post reported that Texas' committee won't review cases from 2022 and 2023, the first two years after the state banned nearly all abortions. In Idaho, the state let its panel disband in 2023 only to reinstate it earlier this year. 'They've become more of a lightning rod than they were before,' said epidemiologist Michael Kramer, director of the Center for Rural Health and Health Disparities at Mercer University in Georgia. Here's what maternal mortality review committees across the nation do and what might happen next: What are they? 'Maternal mortality review committees are important because they are the most comprehensive source of information about maternal mortality that we have,' said David Goodman, who leads the maternal mortality prevention team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The panels review deaths that occur during pregnancy or within a year after it ends, whether directly related to the pregnancy or not. Causes of death can range from hemorrhage during childbirth to drug overdoses to traffic accidents. The goal, Kramer said, is to examine maternal deaths and help 'decide what we can do about them.' All states, a few cities and Puerto Rico have these committees. Their membership varies and may include OB-GYNs, maternal-fetal medicine doctors, nurses, midwives, mental and public health experts and members of patient advocacy groups. Most have representatives from several areas of expertise, which the CDC recommends. How members are selected also varies; people may apply, submit letters of interest or be invited to serve. The selection shouldn't be politically motivated, Kramer said, because 'if there's a systematic exclusion of certain data or certain perspectives' it's difficult to truly understand what's happening. How do they look at deaths? First, the panels work with state vital statistics offices and epidemiologists to identify deaths associated with pregnancy by examining death certificates and looking for a pregnancy checkbox or a related cause of death. They may also search for links to birth and fetal death records, or delve into hospital discharge data, media reports and obituaries. Once they identify cases, they collect as much information as possible, such as prenatal care records, hospital and social service records, autopsy reports and interviews with family members. Professional 'abstractors' distill all this into case narratives, which committee members pore over. Most use a standardized review process developed by the CDC — and all panels can get help and guidance from the agency. They consider questions such as: Was the death pregnancy-related? What was the underlying cause? Was it preventable? What factors contributed? States generally have privacy rules that protect committee members and people who provide information on the deaths. The groups then issue public reports that don't name moms or hospitals but include overall findings, trends and recommendations. Some come out a couple of years or more after the deaths. Across the nation in 2023, Goodman said, 151 recommendations from those reports were implemented by communities, hospitals, medical professionals and policymakers. What about Georgia, Texas and Idaho? Georgia will rebuild its committee through a new application process, the state public health commissioner said. Texas' committee has been reviewing 2021 deaths and will start on 2024 cases at its next meeting, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Lara Anton said in an email to The Associated Press. 'Reviewing cases is a lengthy process and legislators have asked for more recent data. Starting the next review cycle with 2024 cases will allow us to provide that in the next report,' Anton said, adding that maternal and child health epidemiologists will continue to analyze and publish data for 2022 and 2023. In Idaho, the reconstituted review committee now falls under the state board of medicine, which licenses doctors, instead of the state's health and welfare department. It will operate like it always has, said Bob McLaughlin, spokesperson for the medical board. Members met for the first time in November and plan to issue a report by Jan. 31. Because the legislature wanted the most up-to-date information, McLaughlin said the first report will cover only 2023 cases, and the group will review 2022 deaths next. Goodman said he's encouraged that every state has a review committee now — only 20 had them in 2015.	https://www.voanews.com/a/maternal-mortality-review-panels-are-in-the-spotlight-here-s-what-they-do/7889322.html	2024-12-07T00:02:20-08:00	
Irish YouTuber moves millions of followers to donate millions for charity	NEW YORK — Sean McLoughlin wears a lot of hats: YouTuber. Voice actor. Coffee entrepreneur. But McLoughlin, better known by his pseudonym Jacksepticeye, likes to say he would be a therapist if he wasn't posting video game playthroughs for his nearly 31 million subscribers. The 34-year-old Irish creator finds that gaming enthusiasts aren't just drawn by his expressive reactions to the latest action role-playing games; fans also resonate with his candid discussions of mental health. The supportive responses from his niche but passionate following make McLoughlin feel 'less alone,' he said, forging the same camaraderie that brought him to online gaming communities as a lonely 20-something living at his family's remote home. That shared connection is also central to his annual fundraiser, 'Thankmas.' The charity livestream is one of many online specials emerging as a modern spin on the classic telethon. Total donations have increased more than 50% over the last year on Tiltify, a digital platform that integrates giving tools into streams. The spaces are credited for allowing more authentic interactions between nonprofits and young donors — and encouraging benevolence in a corner of the web marked by incendiary rhetoric. 'If you want to do good things, the people are there, and they'll listen,' McLoughlin said. 'They're already following you for what you do for a reason. So they'll follow you to help out people as well.' Follow they have. His streams have raked in more than $26 million, according to partner Tiltify. This year's goal is to collect $6 million for two nonprofits supporting mental health: Crisis Text Line and Samaritans. A seven-figure target would have seemed a longshot when McLoughlin entered the space. The initial idea was to hold monthly fundraisers. He hosted seven charitable streams in 2018, Tiltify records show, for causes including pediatric cancer and clean water. The year culminated in the inaugural 'Thankmas,' which pulled over a quarter of a million dollars. But McLoughlin said the pace became 'a bit much.' That same year he announced a brief break from YouTube, in part due to unhappiness from the demands he felt for high content volumes. He resolved to focus on one big holiday event at the end of the year, when he said people are 'a bit more giving and heartfelt.' It wasn't until 2020 that Tiltify CEO Michael Wasserman said the two began working closely to maximize the streams' reach. McLoughlin reached out, according to Wasserman, and said he wanted something 'more impactful.' With communities worldwide reeling from the pandemic, they put together the #HopeFromHome campaign: a peer-to-peer event where multitudes could simultaneously rally around the same cause. McLoughlin served as a tent pole supporting the other streamers. Their first effort together yielded $1.9 million for United Way Worldwide and more than one-third came from McLoughlin's stream alone. The following 'Thankmas' generated more than $4.7 million. Wasserman said he'd never seen his technology used so collaboratively. 'That's what really made this a regular, multimillion-dollar event,' Wasserman said. 'Not just making it, 'Hey I'm going to fundraise and just watch me,' but, 'We as a community can do this and get involved together.'' Specials feature calls, celebrities This year's 'Thankmas' will be performed before a live audience in Los Angeles but broadcast online. Recent specials have seen McLoughlin make surprise calls into streams that are also pooling contributions. Comedic segments sometimes feature traditional celebrities; actor Jack Black played a life-sized game of Jenga in 2022. The idea resembles the star-studded telethon pioneered last century by comedian Jerry Lewis. But new technologies and web cultures enable more engaging experiences. Wasserman said charitable livestreams like McLoughlin's are not a 'passive watching experience.' It's 'a much more personable approach to giving,' according to Yvette Wohn, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who studies human-computer interaction. A streamer's audience 'cares about them,' Wohn said, and donors flock to their content because 'they really like that person.' Social media and chat boxes allow fans to feel seen by hosts in ways television viewers could never expect. Followers might get shoutouts by name upon contributing. McLoughlin has previously shared fan art submitted through specific hashtags. Fandoms also develop subcultures. McLoughlin's gaming catchphrases are especially popular among his circles. Jacksepticeye content often starts with him shouting, 'Top of the morning to ya, laddies!' and fans have uploaded video compilations of the expression. Members then form friendships with others in the fandom. That creates a 'positive social pressure' to donate, according to Wohn, helping new generations 'dip their toes into building an identity as somebody that gives.' 'Giving habits are things that build over time,' Wohn said. 'If younger people start to engage in this culture of giving, I feel like the general culture of giving might expand in ways that cannot be done from a top-down perspective.' Online communities offer kinship Still, McLoughlin describes online communities as a 'double-edged sword.' The 'monetization of hate,' he said, is 'bigger than it's ever been.' And the desire for acceptance can introduce lonely people to dark pockets of the internet that nevertheless provide kinship. 'Thankmas' aims to prove it's easy to do good online. Yes, he acknowledged, charity work is 'quite intimidating.' Where is the line between promoting the fundraiser and promoting himself? McLoughlin doesn't know. He just hopes people trust it's coming from the right place. At least one longtime follower was drawn by McLoughlin's ties to this year's cause. Jack Worthey, a 20-year-old from Texas, said McLoughlin brought much comfort growing up with 'similar family troubles.' It had been several years since he watched Jacksepticeye content, he said, but he was pulled back by an October video where McLoughlin detailed his journey finding mental health treatment. Worthey said he wouldn't have looked into 'Thankmas' had McLoughlin had not made the promotion so personal. He now plans to raise awareness through digital art.

France’s Notre Dame Cathedral reopens 5 years after shocking blaze	PARIS — Notre Dame will formally reopen Saturday, five years after the Paris cathedral was devastated by fire, with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump among world leaders there to celebrate its remarkably rapid restoration. Held up as an example of French creativity and resilience by President Emmanuel Macron, Notre Dame's renaissance so soon after a 2019 blaze that destroyed its roof and spire comes at a difficult time for the country. The sense of national accomplishment in restoring a beloved symbol of Paris has been undercut by political turmoil that has left France without a proper government and in a budget crisis. Macron is hoping that the first full service inside Notre Dame and the sight of around 40 world leaders in Paris might provide a fleeting sense of pride and unity -- as the Paris Olympics did in July and August. The re-opening 'is the proof that we know how to do grand things, we know how to do the impossible and the whole world has admired us for it on two occasions this year,' Macron said during a televised address on Thursday, referring to the widely praised Olympics. During a visit with TV cameras last week however, he somewhat undermined the suspense behind the reopening, revealing the cathedral's freshly scrubbed limestone walls, new furniture and vaulted wooden roof cut from ancient oak trees selected from the finest forests of France. The reconstruction effort has cost around $750 million, financed from donations, with the re-opening achieved within five years despite predictions it could take decades. Workers had to overcome problems with lead pollution, the COVID-19 epidemic, and the general overseeing the project falling to his death while hiking in the Pyrenees last year. Trump show? While the reborn 12th-century architectural masterpiece will be the main focus of public attention on Saturday, TV cameras are also likely to linger on Trump who will be making his first overseas trip since winning reelection to the White House last month. He accepted an invitation from Macron to attend earlier this week, saying the French leader had done 'a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so.' U.S. President Joe Biden will be represented by his wife Jill, while Britain's Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also be present. Zelenskyy is expected to seek his first face-to-face meeting with Trump who has vowed to force a peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine, possibly by withholding U.S. weapon supplies. One surprising absentee will be Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church, who has decided against breaking off from a weekend trip to the French island of Corsica. A message from Francis addressed to the French people will be read out to the congregation of VIPs, church figures and selected members of the public when the service begins on Saturday evening. 'Universal sadness' Parisians watched in horror in 2019 as flames ravaged Notre Dame, a landmark famed as the setting for Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame and one of the world's most-visited monuments. The apocalyptic images were even seen by some as a sign of the demise of Western civilization, with the 850-year-old wonder saved from complete collapse only by the heroic intervention of firefighters. The exact cause of the blaze has never been identified despite a forensic investigation by prosecutors, who believe an accident such as an electrical fault was the most likely reason. 'We felt a sense of universal sadness when Notre Dame burned,' said fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, who has dreamed up colorful new priestly vestments that will be worn by senior clergy on Saturday. 'It was a moment of terrible emotions, like a premonition of our world in difficulty,' he told AFP recently. The service will feature prayer, organ music and hymns from the cathedral's choir, followed by a televised concert with performances by Chinese piano virtuoso Lang Lang, South African opera singer Pretty Yende and possibly American singer and fashion designer Pharrell Williams. Harsh weather forced officials to move Macron's planned speech indoors and pre-record the concert Friday night, with forecasts for winds of up to 80 kph as Storm Darragh put parts of France on red alert. On Sunday, the first Mass with 170 bishops and more than 100 Paris priests will take place at 10:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) followed by a second service in the evening at 6:30 p.m. which will be open to the public.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-notre-dame-cathedral-reopens-5-years-after-shocking-blaze/7890711.html	2024-12-06T23:38:57-08:00	
Romania's top court scraps presidential election	BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — Romania's constitutional court on Friday canceled the country's presidential election following allegations of Russian interference in favor of the far-right front-runner, just two days ahead of the run-off. Romania's pro-EU President Klaus Iohannis said he would stay in his post until a new government that emerges from legislative elections last weekend can be formed to set a new presidential election date. The country's authorities had objected after far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped the election's first round on November 24, a shock result in the EU and NATO member bordering Ukraine. On Wednesday, the presidency declassified documents detailing allegations against Georgescu and Russia, including 'massive' social media promotion and cyberattacks. Based on this, said the court, it had unanimously decided to annul the entire electoral process to ensure its 'correctness and legality.' The process 'was marred throughout its entire duration and at all stages by multiple irregularities and violations of electoral legislation that distorted the free and correct nature of the vote cast by citizens,' it said in its ruling. 'All these aspects had the converging effect of disregarding the essential principles of democratic elections,' it added. 'Attack on democracy' Georgescu, a former senior civil servant, had been due to face centrist mayor Elena Lasconi in Sunday's runoff. 'It is basically a formalized coup d'etat... Our democracy is under attack,' Georgescu, 62, said in a video message, calling on Romanians to 'remain faithful to our common ideal.' 'They will not be able to stop me. And they cannot stop the Romanian people from what they want to change,' he told local media. Lasconi, a 52-year-old former journalist, also called the court's decision 'illegal, immoral ... crushing the very essence of democracy.' Fears had been raised that if Georgescu won, the country -- whose strategic importance has increased since Moscow invaded Ukraine -- would join the EU's far-right bloc and undermine European unity against Russia. While Bucharest streets were largely empty late Friday, without any protests taking place as far as AFP journalists could see, several people condemned the court's decision. 'We are upset because this is a political game' to allow the losers to 'get back in the game,' said Marius Neagu, a 48-year-old salesman. Miruna Mihai, 25, said the decision 'is a slap in the face of everyone who voted in this election' and risked 'radicalizing' Georgescu's supporters. IT worker Madalina Stroe, 34, welcomed it however, saying she didn't want Romania 'to go back in time to Communism in case Georgescu was elected. I don't want us to lose our freedom.' Outgoing Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu -- who lost in the first round of presidential elections -- hailed the decision as 'the only correct solution.' Late on Friday, the United States said it had faith in Romania's institutions and called for a 'peaceful democratic process.' 'We call on all parties to uphold Romania's constitutional order and engage in a peaceful democratic process free from threats of violence and intimidation,' said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. 'Deepens polarization' Anti-corruption prosecutors said Friday they had opened an investigation into 'illegal operations with computer devices or software.' Prosecutors are already probing 'possible violations of electoral legislation' and 'money laundering offenses.' In documents drawn up for a security council meeting and published Wednesday, authorities said data had 'revealed an aggressive promotional campaign, in violation of electoral legislation.' Last week, authorities condemned 'preferential treatment' of Georgescu by TikTok, something the social media platform has denied. The European Commission announced Thursday it had stepped up monitoring of TikTok. A separate intelligence services document stated that Romania was a 'target for aggressive Russian hybrid actions,' including cyberattacks. On Monday, before the documents were released, Romania's constitutional court validated the first-round presidential results. Friday's decision to cancel the elections is 'an unprecedented and historic decision,' political analyst Costin Ciobanu told AFP. It 'deepens uncertainty and polarization within Romanian society, raising serious concerns about the strength of Romania's institutions and democracy,' he added. Georgescu shot into the limelight with his performance in the first round of voting. Having praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past, he has more recently avoided answering questions about him being pro-Russian. While the president's post is largely ceremonial, the head-of-state has moral authority and influence on Romania's foreign policy. The president also designates the prime minister -- a key role especially since legislative elections last weekend returned a fragmented parliament. The governing pro-European Social Democrats won the vote, but far-right parties made strong gains, together securing a third of the ballots. Since the 1989 fall of Communism, Romania has not seen such a breakthrough by the far right, fueled by mounting anger over soaring inflation and fears over Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romania-s-top-court-scraps-presidential-election/7890706.html	2024-12-06T23:16:38-08:00	
Syrian rebels seize fourth city, close in on Homs in threat to Assad's rule	AMMAN, JORDAN/BEIRUT — Syrian rebels said they seized control of the southern city of Daraa on Saturday, the birthplace of a 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad and the fourth city his forces have lost in a week. Rebel sources said the military agreed to make an orderly withdrawal from Daraa under a deal giving army officials safe passage to the capital Damascus, about 100 kilometers north. Social media videos showed rebels on motorcycles and others mingling with residents on the streets. People fired shots into the air at the city's main square in celebration, according to the videos. There was no immediate comment from the military or Assad's government, and Reuters could not independently verify the rebels' claim. With the fall of Daraa, Assad's forces have surrendered four important centers to the insurgents in a week. Daraa, which had a population of more than 100,000 before the civil war began 13 years ago, holds symbolic importance as the cradle of the uprising. It is the capital of a province of about 1 million people, bordering Jordan. Daraa's seizure followed the rebels' claim late Friday that they had advanced to the edge of the central city of Homs, a key crossroads between the capital and the Mediterranean coast. Capturing Homs would cut off Damascus from the coastal stronghold of Assad's minority Alawite sect, and from a naval base and air base of his Russian allies there. 'Our forces have liberated the last village on the outskirts of the city of Homs and are now on its walls,' the Syrian faction leading the sweeping assault said on the Telegram messaging app. A coalition of rebel factions that include the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) made a last call on forces loyal to Assad's government in Homs to defect. Ahead of the rebel advance, thousands of people fled Homs towards the coastal regions of Latakia and Tartus, strongholds of the government, residents and witnesses said. Assad regime under threat A U.S.-backed alliance led by Syrian Kurdish fighters captured Deir el-Zor, the government's main foothold in the vast eastern desert, on Friday, three Syrian sources told Reuters. The rebels seized Aleppo and Hama in the northwest and center earlier in the lightning offensive that began on November 27. In another ominous sign for Assad in the east, the Syrian Kurdish force said Islamic State -- a group that imposed martial law under its harsh rule before its defeat by a U.S.-led coalition in 2017 -- had taken control of some areas in eastern Syria. Aron Lund, a fellow at think-tank Century Foundation, said Assad's government was 'fighting for their lives at this point.' It was possible the government could hold Homs, 'but given the speed at which things have moved so far, I wouldn't count on it,' he said on Friday. Syrian state TV reported Russian-Syrian airstrikes targeting rebel headquarters in the countryside of Hama, Idlib and Aleppo killed at least 200 insurgents on Friday, citing the Russian Coordination Centre in Syria. A Syrian army source said Iran-backed Hezbollah forces were positioned to bolster government defenses in and near Homs. Syrian state media reported dozens of rebels were killed in the Homs countryside on Friday in an operation by Syrian and Russian air forces, artillery, missiles and armored vehicles. Capturing Homs would solidify a chain of powerful positions under the Islamic insurgents' control from Aleppo on the Turkish border in the north to Daraa on the Jordanian border to the south. Gaining Homs would also increase the rebels' chances of isolating the seat of Assad's regime in Damascus with the ability to block the route northwest from the capital to the sea. Rebels reenergised As the rebels pressed their offensive, Russia and Jordan on Friday urged their nationals to leave Syria. After years locked behind frozen front lines, rebel forces have burst out of their northwestern Idlib bastion to achieve the swiftest battlefield advance by either side since a street uprising against Assad mushroomed into civil war 13 years ago. Syria's conflict killed more than 305,000 people between 2011 and 2021, the United Nations Human Rights Office said in 2022. Assad regained control of most of Syria after key allies -- Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah -- came to his rescue. But all have recently been weakened and diverted by other crises, giving Sunni Muslim militants a window to fight back. Tehran, which has been focused on tensions with arch-foe Israel since the Gaza war began last year, began to evacuate its military officials and personnel from Syria on Friday, a sign of Iran's inability to keep Assad in power, The New York Times reported, citing regional officials and three Iranian officials. The head of the main rebel faction HTS, Abu Mohammed Al-Golani, vowed in a separate interview with The New York Times published on Friday that the insurgents could end Assad's rule. 'This operation broke the enemy,' he said of the rebels’ lightning offensive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7890701.html	2024-12-06T22:43:35-08:00	
Ahead of impeachment vote, Yoon apologizes for anxiety over martial law decree	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday apologized for causing public anxiety and vowed he would not attempt a second martial law decree, in an apparent last-minute bid to save his presidency ahead of an impeachment vote. In a televised address, Yoon said his decision to impose martial law late Tuesday was a 'desperate decision made by me, the president, as the final responsible authority for state affairs.' 'I deeply regret the anxiety and inconvenience this has caused to people. I sincerely apologize to the citizens who were greatly appalled by this,' Yoon added, before bowing in front of the camera. Yoon also said he would take 'full legal and political responsibility' and would 'leave the responsibility of stabilizing the political situation, as well as my term, to our party.' 'The future governance will be jointly handled by our party and the government,' he added. It was not clear how Yoon would yield any presidential authority to his ruling People Power Party, analysts said, since there does not appear to be an established political process for doing so. 'The only way I know of that he can be relieved from duty is impeachment or resignation,' said Ben Engel, who teaches political science and international relations at Dankook University outside Seoul. Yoon, frustrated for months by what he saw as opposition attempts to obstruct his governance, declared martial law late Tuesday, claiming it was necessary to 'crush anti-state forces' and 'protect constitutional order.' Within hours, South Korean lawmakers overturned the decree, after fighting their way through police and military personnel who had been sent to the National Assembly Building. The opposition, which holds a majority in the National Assembly, plans to vote on Yoon's impeachment late Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ahead-of-impeachment-vote-yoon-apologizes-for-anxiety-over-martial-law-decree-/7890651.html	2024-12-06T19:00:45-08:00	
Appeals court upholds law that could ban TikTok in US	A federal appeals court in Washington on Friday upheld a law requiring the wildly popular social media app TikTok to be sold to a non-Chinese owner or face closure in the United States by next month. The court cited 'persuasive' and 'compelling' arguments presented by the federal government that TikTok poses a risk to national security. The ruling could leave the 170 million Americans who regularly use TikTok without access to a social media platform that has enjoyed explosive global growth in recent years. It could also mean that the millions of Americans who create content for TikTok — some of whom rely on monetizing that content for their livelihood — could be cut off from their audiences. The government has argued that TikTok presents a unique danger to national security because it collects vast amounts of information about its users, and because the Chinese government ultimately exercises control over its parent company, ByteDance, and over the algorithm that determines what content TikTok users see. Because ByteDance is in the People's Republic of China (PRC) it is subject to that country's laws, including measures requiring private companies to cooperate with government intelligence agencies. The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the government has a compelling interest in taking steps 'to counter the PRC's efforts to collect great quantities of data about tens of millions of Americans' and 'to limit the PRC's ability to manipulate content covertly on the TikTok platform.' TikTok signals an appeal TikTok immediately signaled that it would appeal the circuit court's ruling to the Supreme Court. In a statement posted to its website, the company said, 'The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue.' The company said that the law underlying the case 'was conceived and pushed through based on inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,' and warned that it 'will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the U.S. and around the world.' The Supreme Court is not obligated to hear the company's appeal, and it was not immediately clear that it would do so. If the high court accepts the case, it is possible that it would block the government from enforcing the law until the case is decided. President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a TikTok ban before changing his mind during the recent presidential election, has suggested that he will act to save the app when he takes office. However, it is unclear what options he might have for doing that. Lack of trust In April, President Joe Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act into law. The measure gave TikTok 270 days to find a way to separate itself from ByteDance before a ban on the application would kick in on January 19, 2025. The federal government made it clear that the only kind of divestiture that it would accept was a complete separation of TikTok from its Chinese parent. The company offered alternatives, and established TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc. (TTUSDS) as a subsidiary in Delaware, to wall off U.S. user data from ByteDance. However, the government cited instances in which U.S. user data that the company claimed to have shielded from the PRC was, in fact, accessible to ByteDance employees in mainland China. It told the court that it lacked 'the requisite trust' that 'ByteDance and TTUSDS would comply in good faith' with any arrangement other than complete separation of TikTok and ByteDance. In Friday's ruling, the judges wrote, 'The court can neither fault nor second-guess the government on these crucial points.' First Amendment concerns TikTok and its supporters have claimed that severing TikTok from ByteDance is both practically impossible for technological reasons and legally impossible because the Chinese government will block the sale of the company. Therefore, they claim, the law constitutes a de facto ban and a violation of the guarantee of free speech enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution. In a sign of how seriously the court took the First Amendment arguments, the panel of judges agreed that the law should be subject to 'heightened scrutiny,' which the Supreme Court has applied to measures restricting fundamental rights. In the end, the panel determined that the law satisfies even the most stringent form of 'strict scrutiny,' which requires that the government 'prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.' Free speech advocates respond The decision came under immediate criticism from free speech advocates. 'Although we're still analyzing the decision, we find it deeply disappointing,' David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a statement emailed to VOA. 'The court appropriately applied strict scrutiny as we have urged it to. But the strict-scrutiny analysis is lacking, relying heavily on speculation about possible future harms. 'Restricting the free flow of information, even from foreign adversaries, is fundamentally undemocratic,' Greene said. 'Until now, the U.S. has championed the free flow of information and called out other nations when they have shut down internet access or banned online communications tools like social media apps.' George Wang, a staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, told VOA that the court accorded 'a shocking amount of deference' to the government's claims about the danger TikTok poses to national security. 'We should be really wary whenever we allow the government to use vague national security arguments as a justification to shut down speech,' Wang said. 'That's a tactic of authoritarian regimes, not democracies. It's usually the job of courts to stand up to the government when it infringes on the constitutional rights of millions of Americans, and I think the D.C. Circuit really didn't do that today.' 'A victory for the American people' Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the senior Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, and one of the original sponsors of the law requiring TikTok's divestiture or ban, released a statement Friday praising the court's decision. 'With today's opinion, all three branches of government have reached the same conclusion: ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, and TikTok's ownership by ByteDance is a national security threat that cannot be mitigated through any other means than divestiture,' Krishnamoorthi said. 'Every day that TikTok remains under the Chinese Communist Party's control is a day that our security is at risk,' Krishnamoorthi added. Representative John Moolenaar, the committee's Republican chairman, said in a statement that the ruling was 'a victory for the American people and TikTok users, and a loss for the Chinese Communist Party, which will no longer be able to exploit ByteDance's control over TikTok to undermine our sovereignty, surveil our citizens and threaten our national security.' Moolenaar also held out hope to the app's users that access to it may, in the end, be preserved under a Trump presidency. 'I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,' Moolenaar said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/appeals-court-upholds-law-that-could-ban-tiktok-in-us/7890647.html	2024-12-06T18:55:47-08:00	
Mexico study finds killer heat hit harder for the young than the elderly	A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50. For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, around 30 degrees Celsius and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older. The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: people between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50. Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits. The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team. 'We found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,' study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. 'As the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.' Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study. 'People of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,' said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team. 'Heat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,' Romanello said in an email. Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said. Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity. Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don’t reach that level. Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher. Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about 5 degrees Celsius cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said. Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did. Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said. 'There is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,' Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover. Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said. 'High humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating – which is how our body primarily stays cool,' said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. 'So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely – causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-study-finds-killer-heat-hit-harder-for-the-young-than-the-elderly/7890626.html	2024-12-06T18:08:11-08:00	
Russia, Iran, Turkey schedule weekend talks on Syrian war	washington — Turkey, Russia and Iran are expected to meet this weekend in Qatar to discuss their response to a shock rebel advance that has dramatically altered the front lines in Syria's 13-year civil conflict. The meeting will take place on the sidelines of the Doha Forum, an annual event that attracts senior officials, academics and business leaders from more than 150 countries to discuss common concerns. Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan 'will meet with the Russian and Iranian ministers ... for a meeting under the Astana process' on the sidelines of the forum, a foreign ministry source told Agence France-Presse. Russia and Iran, which support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, launched the Astana process along with Turkey — which supports some of the rebel factions — in the Kazakh capital, Astana, in 2017. Their goal was to find a political solution to the civil war. Russia and Turkey succeeded in brokering a ceasefire in 2020 that largely quelled the fighting, leaving Assad in control of all major cities and an estimated 70% of Syrian territory. But in a stunning offensive over the past week, Islamist rebels Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) seized Syria's second-largest city, Aleppo, and moved on to capture Hama, inching closer to Syria’s third-largest city, Homs. Hama had remained in government hands since civil war erupted in 2011. According to Kremlin statements reported by Reuters, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke this week with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, insisting on 'the need to end aggression against the Syrian state.' Erdogan, according to reports, expressed Turkish support for Syria’s territorial integrity but underscored the Assad government's obligation to 'engage in the political solutions' to the crisis. Turkey, which does not want an independent Kurdish entity in northeastern Syria, has long supported the Syrian National Army, a coalition of armed opposition groups that is at odds with the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) — a Kurdish-led military alliance that has been a major U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIS. Days after the start of the HTS offensive, clashes broke out between the rival militias. Russia, which changed the course of the war in favor of Assad years ago by providing air power, is now distracted by its assault on Ukraine, while Iran, another key backer of Assad, is weakened by Israel’s war against its proxies in Lebanon and Gaza. While some former U.S. officials with experience in the region say advances by HTS rebels could force Assad and his backers to compromise, others aren't so sure. 'I don’t think Moscow is ready to accept the end of the Bashar al-Assad government,' said former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford. 'I think Iran, too, wants to see Assad survive, although Iran's position is particularly difficult.' James Jeffrey, former U.S. ambassador to Turkey and former special representative for Syria engagement, said the fall of Aleppo was major blow to Assad, and that Iranian and Russian support might no longer be sufficient to retake it. Retired General Joseph Votel, chief of U.S. Central Command from 2016 to 2019, pointed out that neither Russia nor Iran wants to risk compromising strategic positions in the region. 'Syria provides Russia with a foothold in the Middle East and access to warm-water ports,' Votel told VOA, referring to Russia's Tartus naval port on the Mediterranean coast of Syria, along with the Hmeimim airbase near Latakia. 'For Iran, it is crucial to maintain the so-called Shiite Crescent,' he added, describing a predominantly Shiite Muslim area stretching from Tehran through Iraq and Syria to Beirut. 'Losing this access and control would be highly significant for them.' Turkey, for its part, is concerned about any development that would strengthen Kurdish forces in Syria whom it considers to be associated with the PKK — a U.S.-designated terrorist organization that has staged attacks in Turkey in support of that country’s Kurdish population. Within days after the start of the HTS offensive, clashes broke out between the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army and the U.S.-backed SDF. 'When it comes to the Kurds, [Turkey] has some concerns about their own security, which we certainly have acknowledged and have tried to work with them to mitigate any of the risks that they believe they're being posed against them,' said Votel. Ankara, which is hosting 3 million Syrian war refugees, is also seeking conditions that would facilitate the return of some of those people to Syria. 'If there is a ceasefire quickly and we do not have big Russian bombing raids, the liberation of Aleppo is an opportunity for hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees to leave Turkey and return to their homes,' said Ford. US position U.S.-backed SDF fighters on Tuesday began a round of renewed fighting against Syrian government forces in the northeast, opening another front in the battle against Assad's military. Pentagon officials on Tuesday said the U.S. military carried out a strike in self-defense against weapons systems in eastern Syria, calling it unrelated to rebel advances in the country. There are nearly 900 U.S. troops in Syria supporting the SDF in its fight against ISIS militants. White House national security spokesperson Sean Savett said last weekend that the latest turmoil in Syria arose from Assad’s refusal to engage in a political process and his reliance on Russia and Iran. According to Ford, control of Aleppo is not particularly important to American interests so long as it does not trigger a new surge of refugees. 'The Turks, of course, don't want that,' he said. 'And it could even lead to a refugee flow back into Lebanon, especially if the ceasefire holds. So, it seems like the sooner there is a ceasefire, the better.' Another key concern for Washington is a resurgent ISIS that might exploit the chaos. During a NATO meeting Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it remained vital that the 'jihadist caliphate by ISIS is not resurrected.' Votel also expressed concern about this possibility. 'One of the things that we see is that ISIS has retreated into the central part of Syria,' he told VOA. 'This is an area under the control of the Syrian government. Many of the forces that he had originally assigned to this area have now been withdrawn. This is allowing ISIS to regroup, to get reorganized and be prepared to rise again.' This story originated in VOA’s Turkish service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-iran-turkey-schedule-weekend-talks-on-syrian-war-/7890631.html	2024-12-06T18:01:01-08:00	
Satellite images of alleged Iranian nuclear site hit by Israel indicate Tehran tried to hide sensitive debris	washington — New satellite imagery of an Iranian military site that Israel apparently destroyed in October and that some Western analysts said was a nuclear facility shows that Iran made efforts to conceal the debris. Those efforts indicate the site contained something of value, the analysts told VOA. The commercial satellite images from Maxar Technologies published Monday on the X platform by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security show the destroyed building known as Taleghan 2 at Iran's Parchin military base on November 6 and November 24. An archive of Iranian nuclear documents seized by Israel from Tehran in 2018 and later shared by Israel with the institute included what the group has said were pre-2004 images of Taleghan 2, showing the building housing equipment used in nuclear weapons research. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said Iran suspended an active nuclear weapons program in 2003. Iran has denied Israel's allegation that it has covertly continued that program. Israel apparently struck Taleghan 2 in its October 26 aerial assault on Iran, according to Western media citing researchers who examined before-and-after commercial satellite images of the rectangular building, which had been built in a carved-out section of hillside. The new images published by the institute show that by November 6, Iran had covered the demolished building with a makeshift horizontal structure and erected vertical security screens next to debris piles, shielding the site from being viewed from above and on the ground. The images also show that by November 26, the vertical security screens had been removed, while the horizontal structure remained over the building and the debris piles remained visible around the site. The institute identified one pile as probably containing destroyed equipment. In an interview with VOA, the institute's president, American physicist David Albright, said the resolution of the commercial satellite imagery was not high enough to identify what kind of equipment likely had been destroyed inside Taleghan 2. But he said the erecting of two vertical screens at the site for several weeks indicates that some of the debris was of a sensitive nature. 'I think Iran put up the screens because it was nervous that foreign intelligence agents could use a telescope from down the road to figure out what was in the debris,' Albright said. 'They later took down the screens probably because they had hauled away the sensitive stuff and wanted to make it easier to continue the cleanup process at the site.' Olli Heinonen, a researcher at the Washington-based Stimson Center and a former IAEA official who inspected Iran's Parchin base twice in the early 2000s, shared his observations of the latest satellite imagery with VOA in a separate interview. 'Even if the Iranians removed the most valuable equipment from Taleghan 2 for some reason before the October 26 strike, the building still would have equipment left, considering its purpose,' Heinonen said. 'Any valuable material in the rubble certainly could have been taken away.' Heinonen said the temporary vertical screens at the site may have been intended to conceal the debris not only from prying foreign eyes but also from Iranian dissidents and curiosity-seekers. 'It also is logical for authorities to clean up the site, so that the morale of Parchin's thousands of workers is not harmed by them seeing destruction caused by a foreign power,' he said. Israel initially said its October assault on Iran targeted aerial defense and missile production sites. It was the first major Israeli attack on Iran after more than a year of fighting that began with an attack by Iranian proxy group Hamas on the Jewish state and grew into a multifront conflict directly involving Tehran and its other regional proxies. Netanyahu revelation Speaking to Israel's parliament on November 18, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed that the October offensive also 'harmed' what he called a 'certain component' of the Iranian nuclear program, without elaborating. Taleghan 2 was the only site with an alleged link to that program identified by Western media as one of the targets of the Israeli operation. Iran's U.N. mission in New York did not immediately respond to a VOA email, sent on Friday, asking whether the Taleghan 2 building was an undeclared part of the Iranian nuclear program. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told a news conference on November 20 that the U.N. nuclear agency does not see Taleghan 2 as a nuclear site. A November 15 report by U.S. news site Axios cited unnamed U.S. officials and unnamed current and former Israeli officials as saying it was an 'active top-secret nuclear weapons research facility.' Grossi said the site 'could have been involved in the past in some activities' of concern, but he added: 'We don't have any information that would confirm the presence of nuclear material there ... [or] that would substantiate this idea that recently some activities [there] ... could be of relevance for us.' The lack of clarity on the equipment in the rubble of Taleghan 2 makes it difficult to assess the significance of the building's destruction to Iran, researchers told VOA. Albright noted that Netanyahu described Israel as having 'harmed' a component of Iran's nuclear program, rather than saying Israel severely damaged Tehran's bomb-making ability. 'Sometimes in a strike like this, the bomb doesn't damage every important piece of equipment. One piece is in a corner, survives and can be fixed later, or the Iranians have a replacement at some university or other military production site,' Albright said. Andrea Stricker, a nonproliferation researcher at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said regardless of whether serious harm was done to nuclear weapons research at Taleghan 2, the significance of the strike is in the message that Israel apparently was sending. 'The message is that further attacks on more consequential nuclear sites are to come if Tehran does not halt such efforts,' Stricker said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/satellite-images-of-alleged-iranian-nuclear-site-hit-by-israel-indicate-tehran-tried-to-hide-sensitive-debris/7890625.html	2024-12-06T17:58:28-08:00	
Nigerians turn to community savings amid financial struggles	Abuja, Nigeria — As Nigeria grapples with economic challenges, many are turning to Ajo — a community savings system rooted in trust and tradition. For traders and low-income earners, it’s a lifeline, providing lump sums of cash for projects and urgent needs. But without regulation, Ajo users risk losing their savings to fraud. Trader Tessy Ajakaye, 50, is one of the millions of Nigerians relying on Ajo. For her, it’s more than just a savings tool — it’s the backbone of her business. Ajakaye contributes daily, knowing her payout later will help expand her inventory. In the Ajo system, participants make cash contributions daily or weekly to a money holder as part of a savings program. Each participant gets a periodic lump sum that can be used for business needs. 'Ajo means small, small savings that you don't take to the bank,' she said. At year's end, she collects those amounts from Ajo, and 'I use it for next year to boost my business. When you take a loan, you pay back with interest. But Ajo, this is your money. What you save is what they give to you.' Ajo isn’t without its risks. Rose Ojoma, another trader, lost her savings to a fraudulent collector during a festive period — a common problem with unregulated schemes. Ojoma said unscrupulous collectors have taken her money during the Christmas season. Some, she said, will take a month's worth of contributions 'as an opportunity to run away, and you cannot find them.' She said that as a result, she contributes less to reduce her risk. Ajo, a Yoruba term for thrift or microsavings, has existed for generations in Nigeria and across Africa under names like Esusu and Adashe. It thrives in low-income communities, offering a simple way to save and access funds without banks. Economist Jide Ojo said Ajo fills the gap for Nigerians excluded from formal banking systems. He said Ajo is simple and helpful because it lets contributors do projects or access services much easier with their savings. He said it also helps them to be prudent in their spending, because it's a way of putting something aside, rather than using all your income. But the lack of regulation leaves participants vulnerable. Development economist Hauwa Mustapha acknowledges the system's benefits, but he is calling for reforms to improve security. 'The government does not have any role directly to protect informal savings schemes,' Mustapha said. 'The informal savings scheme, as it is, is informal, it's personal, it's about your choice, it's voluntary. I think it will be important, if they can be very well educated and enlightened, to understand how to put some legal form into the concept of Ajo, so that can help to secure the funds more. And I also think that the banks can become more flexible and adopt that principle of Ajo into the bank.' Despite its flaws, Ajo remains a lifeline for millions in Nigeria’s informal economy. Experts say that by blending tradition with regulation, Ajo could become a safer and more powerful tool for financial stability in Nigeria’s challenging economy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerians-turn-to-community-savings-amid-financial-struggles-/7890615.html	2024-12-06T17:30:38-08:00

Former police officer denies leaking information to Proud Boys leader	WASHINGTON — A retired Washington, D.C., police officer charged with lying about his private communications with former Proud Boys national leader Enrique Tarrio testified Friday that he never leaked sensitive police information to the far-right extremist group leader. Taking the witness stand at his federal trial, former Metropolitan Police Department Lieutenant Shane Lamond said he was upset that a prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys 'sympathizer' who acted as a 'double agent' for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020. 'I don't support the Proud Boys, and I'm not a Proud Boys sympathizer,' said Lamond, whose bench trial started Monday and continues next week. Tarrio, who testified Thursday as a witness for Lamond's defense, is serving a 22-year prison sentence for his role in a plot to use force to keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election. Tarrio previously was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the district. Lamond said Tarrio never confessed to him that he burned the banner. He also denies tipping off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been signed before he arrived in Washington on January 4, 2021 — two days before other Proud Boys joined a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol. Lamond's indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the January 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack. 'Of course I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see your group's name and reputation dragged through the mud,' Lamond wrote. Lamond said he considered Tarrio to be a source, not a friend. But he said he tried to build a friendly rapport with the group leader to gain his trust. Justice Department prosecutor Joshua Rothstein pointed to other messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with 'real-time updates' on the police investigation of the December 12, 2020, banner burning. Lamond is charged with one count of obstruction of justice and three counts of making false statements. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson will decide the case after hearing testimony without a jury. Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington. The men exchanged hundreds of messages across several platforms, with Lamond frequently greeting Tarrio as 'brother.' However, Lamond acknowledged that he only sent encrypted messages to Tarrio or met him in person after the banner burning. On the day of his arrest, Tarrio posted a message to other Proud Boys leaders that said, 'The warrant was just signed.' Tarrio testified Thursday that he didn't confess to Lamond or receive any confidential information from him. After the banner burning but before Tarrio's arrest, Lamond told him that the FBI and U.S. Secret Service was 'all spun up' by chatter that Proud Boys planned to dress up as supporters of President Joe Biden for the Democrat's inauguration in January 2021. 'I'm just going to let them get all freaked out. They're idiots,' Lamond wrote of his federal colleagues. 'Lol,' Tarrio responded. Lamond, 48, of Colonial Beach, Virginia, retired in May 2023 after 23 years of service to the police department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-police-officer-denies-leaking-information-to-proud-boys-leader-/7890379.html	2024-12-06T16:15:35-08:00

US state seeks $47.8M fine for air pollution by natural gas processor	SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO — New Mexico environmental regulators issued a $47.8 million fine Friday on allegations of excess air pollution at a natural gas processing facility in a prolific oil production region near the Texas state line. The state Environment Department issued the sanctions including a cease-and-desist order against Houston-based Targa Resources at its processing plant near Jal, New Mexico, alleging permit violations and excess emissions of gases known to cause respiratory issues or contribute to climate change including ozone-producing pollutants. Representatives for Targa could not immediately be reached for comment. Regulators say Targa has 30 days to respond and comply or request a hearing with the agency secretary. Regulators also have ordered a series of corrective actions and improvements to the facilities that process gas for transmission by pipeline. The sanctions are based on allegations of two permit violations, late reporting of emissions and an incomplete requirement for a root cause analysis of excess pollution. The proposed air-pollution fine against Targa would be the largest in state history by the Environment Department, if upheld. The case also was referred to federal regulators. Separately, the New Mexico Court of Appeals last month upheld regulations aimed at crushing air pollution in one of the nation’s top-producing oil and gas states. Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s administration has advanced new restrictions on ozone-precursor pollutants along with regulations to limit methane emissions in its efforts to combat climate change and meet federal clean air standards.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-mexico-seeks-47-8m-fine-for-air-pollution-by-natural-gas-processor-/7890368.html	2024-12-06T15:50:34-08:00

Austin Tice is alive, family of American journalist says	WASHINGTON — American journalist Austin Tice is still alive, more than 12 years after he was detained in Syria, his mother Debra Tice said Friday, citing a source vetted by the U.S. government. 'Austin is alive and being treated well, and I can tell you he is waiting to come home,' Debra told VOA. 'We have a very reliable source that is totally verified.' A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Tice is an award-winning freelance journalist and photographer who works for outlets including The Washington Post, CBS and McClatchy. Tice was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus in August 2012. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been seen or heard of him since. 'He is so ready. And he has known from the very first day that he was detained that he was going to walk free again,' Debra told VOA. 'And so, we want to see him on the tarmac. We want to see that happen.' Tice's father Mark characterized the source as 'unimpeachable' but said the family could not share more details because the intelligence was classified. The U.S. State Department did not immediately reply to VOA's request for comment. The revelation comes as the Tice family met with White House officials on Friday to push for the U.S. government to do more to secure Austin's release. The meeting occurred amid renewed clashes in Syria, as insurgent fighters who have already captured the northern city of Aleppo, one of the country's largest, are pressing their march against President Bashar Assad's forces. At a press conference following the White House meeting, the Tice family criticized Biden administration officials for not providing any updates during their meeting. Debra told VOA she hopes President Joe Biden uses his final weeks in the White House to do everything he can to secure her son's release. The family's update comes the same week that President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would select Adam Boehler to serve as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. The former chief executive officer of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, Boehler was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austin-tice-is-alive-family-of-american-journalist-says-/7890322.html	2024-12-06T14:45:35-08:00	
US-China prisoner swap reunites Uyghur families as work continues to secure others' freedom	WASHINGTON — Lost in much of the debate over 'hostage diplomacy' after last week's rare prisoner swap between the U.S. and China is that in addition to the three Americans, three Uyghurs were on the flight from China. The exchange highlights Beijing's persecution of ethnic minorities prompting renewed international scrutiny. A U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed to VOA that the three Uyghurs were on the flight but declined to provide additional details 'out of respect for their privacy.' 'The Biden-Harris Administration has continuously advocated for cases of humanitarian concern, including Uyghurs,' the spokesperson told VOA. 'We are pleased that these [Uyghur] individuals are home with their families.' Among those freed was 73-year-old Ayshem Mamut, the mother of prominent Uyghur rights advocate and Uyghur American lawyer Nury Turkel. According to Turkel, the last time he saw his mother was 20 years ago, when she traveled to Washington for his graduation from American University. 'Her last trip to the U.S. was in the summer of 2004, when she came to D.C. with my late father for my law school graduation,' Turkel told VOA. Turkel's parents stayed in the U.S. for about five months before returning to China. Since then, his mother had been barred from leaving the country. 'The Chinese authorities never specifically said why my parents couldn't leave the country,' Turkel said. 'However, I believe a travel ban was imposed on my parents because of my decades-long advocacy work and my U.S. government service from 2020 to 2024.' Turkel served as a commissioner and chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) from 2020 to 2024. In response to his advocacy for religious freedom for oppressed communities, he was sanctioned by China in 2021 and Russia in 2022. Turkel described the reunion with his mother as a profoundly emotional moment, crediting years of persistent advocacy by individuals and institutions across multiple U.S. administrations. 'This reunion is a testament to the U.S. government's steadfast commitment to human rights and justice for the Uyghur people,' Turkel said. 'I am so proud of our country and leadership at the highest level — President [Joe] Biden, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Secretary [Antony] Blinken and countless national security professionals invested so much time and energy over the years.' He added that the reunion has been transformative for his mother. 'For my mother, this moment represents a rebirth of joy and humanity,' Turkel said. 'After decades apart, she can finally experience the love and laughter of her grandchildren — a connection that transcends the pain of separation and reminds us of the enduring power of family. She is profoundly grateful to those who made this reunion possible, especially Ambassador Nick Burns, whose compassionate actions reflect the best of humanity.' Advocates push for continued U.S. action Rayhan Asat, a fellow at the Atlantic Council and a Uyghur lawyer whose brother, Ekpar Asat, remains imprisoned in China, welcomed the release but called for continued efforts to secure freedom for other Uyghurs. 'I urge President Biden to secure Ekpar's release and bring him home during the remainder of his presidency. His continued imprisonment sends a chilling message that participating in U.S. programs comes with grave risk,' Asat told VOA. Ekpar Asat was sentenced to 15 years in prison after participating in a U.S.-China cultural exchange program organized by the State Department. 'As the Ambassador emphasized today, the state of U.S.-China relations hinges on the choices China makes, including its support for unjust wars. One of those choices must be to end the ongoing genocide against the Uyghur people,' Asat added. Ferkat Jawdat, another Uyghur American advocate, expressed mixed emotions about the release. Jawdat has lobbied U.S. administrations to secure the freedom of his mother, whom he has not seen since 2006. She has been barred from leaving China for nearly two decades. 'While I'm very happy for @nuryturkel and his family's reunion with their mother, I'm very sad that my mom was excluded from this,' he wrote. 'I've been asking the U.S. government for years for the same when I met with former Secretary of State @mikepompeo and @SecBlinken,' Jawdat said in a tweet on social media platform X. Turkel offered a message of hope and resilience to the global Uyghur community, encouraging them to remain steadfast in their advocacy. 'To my Uyghur communities around the world, I urge you to hold onto hope and faith,' Turkel said. 'My family's reunion is a living testament to the possibility of change, even in the face of immense challenges. Share your stories, advocate for your loved ones, and know that your voices matter.' He emphasized that international attention and tireless efforts are making a difference. 'The world is listening, and there are people tirelessly working for justice and reconnecting families like ours,' he added. 'Together, our resilience and solidarity can pave the way for others to experience similar moments of joy and relief.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-prisoner-swap-reunites-uyghur-families-as-work-continues-to-secure-others-freedom/7890323.html	2024-12-06T14:20:37-08:00	
Lobito Corridor takes center stage, Angolans pin hopes on Biden's visit	U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Angola highlighted the potential of the Lobito Corridor, a 1,300-kilometer, multinational railway project intended to connect markets and jumpstart trade. The presidential visit raised hopes but also drew skepticism from some Angolans who spoke to VOA about their daily struggles and the need for economic development. In Luanda, the capital, Angolans told VOA why they are anxious for the benefits they think will come from the investment. 'We are suffering a lot. We're struggling,' said Albertina Manuel, a street vendor, who expressed frustration over rising living costs. 'School is very expensive; we are not able to pay our children's tuition. It's harder now. We never suffered like this before,' she told VOA's Portuguese Service. Sacamauro Eduardo, a university student, hoped for a meaningful U.S.-Africa relationship. 'I hope to see a strengthened relationship with Africa, and in particular between Angola and the U.S.,' he said. 'I hope they approach the most important issues for the people, like poverty and investment in education. We don't want them to just talk. They need to bring good benefits to the Angolan people.' Others, like Amelia Joao, another market seller, said they hope the investment can bring down the cost of staple food products. 'Lower our prices,' and 'help us produce things,' she said. 'With more production in the country, the prices will lower.' Solia Selende, another Luanda resident, said the United States should look beyond the polished image often presented to foreign leaders. 'If they go deeper into the slums, what they will see will make them very sad,' he said. 'There are people starving to death, not only in Luanda but in all Angolan provinces.' The Lobito Corridor The Lobito Corridor project is at the center of Angola's aspirations for economic renewal. Stretching from the Atlantic port of Lobito through the country's central highlands and into the mineral-rich Democratic Republic of Congo, it could reshape regional trade dynamics, facilitating export of copper, cobalt, and other critical minerals from the DRC and Zambia to global markets. Initially established during Angola's colonial era, the rail infrastructure suffered years of neglect because of decades of civil war. However, with a $5 billion investment backed by partners including U.S. and European companies, the Lobito Corridor is being refurbished. Anthony Carroll, senior study group member on critical minerals at the United States Institute of Peace, pointed to its geopolitical and economic significance. 'The Lobito Corridor is a bold effort to refurbish and construct a rail line,' he said. 'It will speed access to critical minerals for European and U.S. markets, which have been largely dominated by China in the last 20 years,' he said. 'It will also give more value to Africans in terms of the return they'll enjoy for enhanced infrastructure investment and development.' Carroll also cited potential problems, including fluctuating global demand for critical minerals and competition from other infrastructure projects, such as the Chinese-funded refurbishment of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, known as TAZARA, which would carry those minerals to the Indian Ocean for shipping to Asia. Angola's leadership, however, said the projects can complement each other and there should not be a rivalry. Foreign Minister Tete Antonio emphasized the potential of linking the Lobito Corridor to TAZARA. 'Our ambition is to connect the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic,' he told VOA. 'This is not about competition; in Africa, we see this as an opportunity for collaboration.' Beyond minerals, the corridor could improve sectors such as agriculture, logistics, and manufacturing. Antonio mentioned discussions on expanding agricultural production for export through the railway route. Economic integration The corridor is a centerpiece of the Biden administration's focus on infrastructure development in Africa under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, a G7 initiative to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative. Frances Brown, White House director for African affairs, told VOA's English to Africa Service the U.S. is committed to ensuring the project benefits the region. 'The Lobito Corridor is about investment, it's about infrastructure, but it's also about ensuring that it benefits communities more broadly,' she said. 'It's all about sustainable economic development; it's all about a transparent contracting process. It's about ensuring that it boosts regional trade, that it creates quality jobs and improves lives.' For Angola, the corridor could support exports to the United States through the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which allows duty-free access to the U.S. market for certain goods produced in African countries. Anderson Jeronimo, director of planning at Angola's Agriculture Ministry, described the corridor as a way to improve Angola's agricultural exports. 'Opportunities like AGOA can help us export more coffee and fruit products to the U.S.,' he said. 'We need U.S. support to better understand and take full advantage of AGOA.' Hopes and challenges Despite the potential benefits of projects such as the Lobito Corridor, many Angolans face issues such as rising food prices, unaffordable education, and inadequate health care. The country's economy has been hit hard by fluctuating oil prices and its government has struggled to repay more than $17 billion in debt to China. Luanda resident Rosalina Cativa said she sees the corridor as a lifeline for the struggling economy. 'Our country is in really bad shape,' she said. 'A lot of things have to change, especially regarding food prices and education. We look at our country's health, and it's really, really bad. We need help.'

Burkina Faso junta fires prime minister, dissolves government	Burkina Faso's ruling junta has dismissed interim Prime Minister Apollinaire Joachim Kyelem de Tambela and dissolved the government, according to a decree issued Friday by the office of military leader Ibrahim Traore. The decree did not give a reason for the dismissal of Tambela, who was appointed interim premier soon after Traore seized power in September 2022 — one of a string of military coups in West Africa's unstable Sahel region in recent years. Members of the dissolved government will continue in their roles until a new Cabinet is named, the decree said. Burkina has been fighting Islamist insurgents, some with links to al-Qaida and Islamic State, since they spread into its territory from neighboring Mali almost a decade ago. Thousands of Burkinabe have been killed in recent years in militant attacks, and more than 2 million people have been displaced, half of them children. The continued unrest has pushed tens of thousands of Burkinabe to the brink of starvation. Analysts say that at least half of Burkina Faso’s territory is still outside the government’s control. Traore vowed to do better than his predecessors when he assumed command in 2022, but the security situation has deteriorated further under his regime, which has also cracked down on dissent, analysts, rights groups and humanitarian workers say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/burkina-faso-junta-fires-prime-minister-dissolves-government-/7890321.html	2024-12-06T14:15:52-08:00	
Rights groups cautious about Islamist rebels’ pledges to protect Syrian minorities	WASHINGTON — Following its recent capture of major cities in Syria, the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, pledged to respect the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. Rights experts, noting the group’s extremist ideology and history of brutality, caution that these promises must be backed by tangible actions. HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, along with a coalition of Turkish-backed armed groups, has in the past week seized control of Aleppo, Hama and dozens of surrounding towns in northwest Syria amid a complete collapse of forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government. Shortly after capturing Aleppo, which has significant Kurdish and Christian populations, HTS issued statements reassuring both minority groups that they would be protected under its rule. HTS leaders have also met with representatives of Aleppo’s Christian community. Rights groups acknowledge that such statements are a positive step but highlight HTS’s poor human rights record in areas it has governed in recent years, particularly in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province. 'As we watch the HTS-led opposition coalition liberate areas that have been under the Assad regime, we have so far seen the protection of religious and ethnic minorities,' said Nadine Maenza, president of the Washington-based International Religious Freedom Secretariat. 'We pray that continues, as HTS has a troubling history of governing under a harsh version of Islamic law in Idlib,' she told VOA. HTS, formerly known as al-Nusra Front, is a Sunni Islamist group that has been a major actor in Syria’s 13-year conflict. It was the main affiliate of al-Qaida in Syria until 2017, when it formally severed ties with the global terror group. According to The CIA World Factbook, Sunni Muslim Arabs make up 50% of Syria’s nearly 24 million population, while Alawites, Kurds and Christians make up 45%. The remaining percentage comes from Druze, Ismaili and other ethnic and religious groups. In an interview with CNN that aired Friday, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani admitted that 'there were some violations against them [minorities] by certain individuals during periods of chaos, but we addressed these issues.' 'No one has the right to erase another group. These sects have coexisted in this region for hundreds of years, and no one has the right to eliminate them,' he said. 'Time will tell' Hadeel Oueis, a Washington-based Syrian journalist, noted a sense of caution and anticipation among the various communities now living under HTS rule. 'I have been speaking with members of my family in Aleppo, and there seems to be [a] degree of self-control not only toward Christians but also Alawites and other groups,' Oueis, who is a Syriac Christian, told VOA by phone. 'Only time will tell if HTS is truly committed to changing and presenting a different image of itself to both Syrians and the international community,' she said. Experts say that while HTS has demonstrated a degree of tolerance toward minorities with no significant abuses reported in recent days, rights groups should closely monitor the actions of its allied rebel factions. Izzadin Saleh, executive director of the Synergy Association for Victims in Syria, said his group has documented violations committed by the Syrian National Army, or SNA, a coalition of Turkish-backed Islamist militias, against Kurdish residents in other parts of Aleppo province. The SNA was established in 2017 with Turkey’s support. The umbrella organization previously took part in two Turkish-backed offensives against Kurdish forces in 2018 and 2019. Some groups aligned with the SNA have been known for their radical Islamist ideology. Last year, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Suleiman Shah Brigade and the Hamza Division, two main factions within the SNA, for 'serious human rights abuses against those residing in the Afrin region of northern Syria.' Saleh told VOA by phone that 'SNA’s rhetoric explicitly incites violence against the Kurds in particular,' adding that 'they are accusing all Kurdish residents of being terrorists.' Maenza of the IRF Secretariat also stated that SNA militias have targeted Kurds, Christians and Yazidis, particularly those from the Shahba region of Aleppo. Experts say all parties involved in crimes and rights abuses in the Syrian conflict must be held accountable when the country reaches a permanent political settlement. 'If the Syrian war has taught us anything, it is that the Syrian regime is not the only party that has committed horrific crimes against civilians; other groups have equally – and at times even worse – perpetrated crimes in areas they have captured from the regime,' said Bassam Alahmad, executive director of the Paris-based advocacy group Syrians for Truth and Justice. 'It is important to ensure there is a comprehensive path to accountability in the post-conflict era,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-groups-cautious-about-islamist-rebels-pledges-to-protect-syrian-minorities/7890287.html	2024-12-06T14:12:56-08:00	
Former Ukrainian President Poroshenko: We can stop the war in 24 hours	WASHINGTON — Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, now leader of the opposition European Solidarity Party, sat down with Voice of America during a visit to Washington to attend the annual forum of the International Democracy Union, an alliance of center-right political parties. While in the U.S. capital, Poroshenko met with Biden administration officials and members of the incoming Trump administration to share his assessment of the situation Ukraine is facing more than two and a half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion, and his vision of how to end the conflict. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: How would you describe the situation on the front lines in Ukraine? Petro Poroshenko, former Ukrainian president: Every week, I travel to the front lines to deliver needed equipment and armaments. Russia is increasing its pressure. Russia has more sophisticated weapons than even half a year [ago]. Ukrainian soldiers are tired because some have served for over two and a half years, but they still wouldn't allow Russians to break through the Ukrainian positions. At the moment, we shouldn't think about offensive operations but [how] to strengthen fortifications. I appreciate the decision of the United States government to give us anti-infantry mines. Having three, four, five kilometers of a minefield is an excellent response to the new tactics of Russia, which is penetrating Ukrainian positions with small groups of five to 12 persons with the support of Russian artillery, which has an unlimited number of artillery shells. If we have fortifications, minefields and reconnaissance drones, including thermal night drones and [an] unlimited number of FPV drones to destroy these small groups, [an] effective radio-electronic warfare system, including against Russian reconnaissance drones, I'm confident we can keep [the] defense lines. VOA: Ukraine is under pressure to start negotiating. Is this a good time for that? Poroshenko: No other nation in the world wants peace more than Ukrainians because we pay an enormous price. However, the negotiations should start when both sides are ready. Everybody asks if Ukraine is ready, and nobody asks if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is ready for these negotiations. Putin is not ready. We should undertake enormous efforts to prepare Putin for these negotiations. What language should we speak to Putin? The language of strength, including sophisticated and modern weapons for Ukraine. Putin should feel that he is paying a high price. We need stronger sanctions to destroy the shadow fleet. The sanctions should lower Russian exports from $600 [billion] to $200 billion to cut Putin's ability to finance the war. VOA: Do you think the new Trump administration will support your vision? Poroshenko: I strongly believe in the global leadership of the United States. I worked with [President Donald] Trump in 2016-2019. Meeting him was one of my first meetings as president of Ukraine. Our meeting was scheduled for five minutes — just to shake hands and take a photo — and lasted for two and a half hours. As a result, he gave Ukraine the first lethal weapons after three years of the war, the legendary Javelins [anti-tank missiles]. They saved lots of lives in the Donbas region. Even without additional consultation with our European partners, we agreed that the United States introduce sanctions against the company contractor for the North Stream 2 [natural gas pipeline], which was vital. In President Trump’s presence we discussed with [his former CIA Director Mike] Pompeo the coordination of efforts to recognize the Ukrainian independent church. Trump is a person of results, not process. He is decisive enough to make tough decisions. VOA: Trump nominated General Keith Kellogg as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine and Russia. What do you think about him and his ideas? Poroshenko: I've met him several times when he was a member of [then] Vice President [Mike] Pence's team. I welcome President Trump's approach to appoint a special presidential envoy to Ukraine. When President Trump appointed Kurt Volker [as U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations], that was extremely efficient. And now, General Kellogg's level of professionalism gives us careful optimism. We can stop the war in 24 hours, as President Trump promised, and without a single shot [fired] or a dollar spent. We need just one signature for one treaty — the Washington Treaty [the April 1949 treaty establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance]. Inviting Ukraine to join NATO will be a powerful demonstration to Putin that we are not afraid of his blackmail. We are decisive enough, and we want to have sustainable security on the continent. I propose my plan — the 'Poroshenko Plan.' Within one year, partners guarantee that Ukraine will get a full [NATO] membership if it meets specific criteria and fulfills certain conditions. During that year, while we are not in NATO, we will receive the same security guarantees as Finland and Sweden before their full NATO membership. During that year, I also suggest having peacekeepers under the mandate of the United Nations Security Council to guarantee a ceasefire. That's how to stop the war in 24 hours.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-ukrainian-president-poroshenko-we-can-stop-the-war-in-24-hours/7890299.html	2024-12-06T14:08:07-08:00	
Poll: Most Americans want US leadership on global affairs, increased defense spending	PENTAGON — A majority of Americans want the United States to lead on the global stage with a strong military, and a supermajority want to increase national defense spending, according to the latest Reagan National Defense Survey. Despite Americans electing a president who ran on an 'America First' agenda that focused on domestic issues ranging from the U.S. economy to securing the southern U.S. border, 57% of those surveyed said they wanted to see the U.S. more engaged and taking the lead on international events this year, compared with 42% a year ago. Nearly 80% of Americans surveyed supported increased government spending on the U.S. military, a slight increase from last year. Increasing military spending ranked high above some of the other U.S. foreign policy priorities, such as promoting freedom abroad (61%) and providing foreign aid (43%). 'The Reagan National Defense Survey demonstrates yet again that Americans are not pacifists, and we are not isolationists. We want a federal government that serves American interests and protects our country,' Bradley Bowman, a member of the survey's advisory board and the senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told VOA Friday. The Ronald Reagan Institute has surveyed U.S. public opinion on national security for the past six years, and the latest poll, released Thursday, included a bipartisan sample of about 2,500 Americans who were surveyed two days after the November presidential election. Most respondents said they supported continued U.S. security support for Ukraine and allowing Ukraine to fire U.S. weapons inside Russia, with nearly 60% believing the Russia-Ukraine conflict will end with Ukraine negotiating for peace, even if that means giving up some of its sovereign territory. Ukraine support differed widely among voters for the Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Republican candidate, President-elect Donald Trump, with 74% of Harris voters in support of sending aid compared with 42% of Trump voters. A supermajority (80%) sees Russia as an adversary. On Israel, 54% of those surveyed supported continuing U.S. aid, but Americans were split 45% to 45% on whether Israel has a right to continue military action or Israel's military action in Gaza has gone on long enough and needs to transition to a ceasefire. About half of those surveyed think the United States would prevail in a conflict with China, with nearly the same number finding China to be the greatest threat to the United States. If China invaded Taiwan, nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said the U.S. should officially recognize Taiwan as an independent nation, with two-thirds agreeing that the U.S. should respond with economic sanctions against China and more than half supporting sending more military equipment to Taiwan (56%) and moving more military assets such as aircraft carriers into the region (58%). Most Americans surveyed believe the U.S. military should be large enough to win two simultaneous wars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poll-most-americans-want-us-leadership-on-global-affairs-increased-defense-spending/7890284.html	2024-12-06T13:45:06-08:00	
UN chief to visit South Africa as it steps up to helm G20	new york — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will head to South Africa on Wednesday, visiting the first African nation to chair the G20 economic bloc. 'The secretary-general will underscore that with South Africa taking the G20 helm and being the first African country to preside over the G20, there is a significant opportunity for the G20 to help advance Africa’s priorities,' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters Friday in announcing the trip. South Africa assumed the one-year rotating presidency of the bloc on December 1. G20 members include both developing and developed countries, who together make up about 85% of the global gross domestic product, more than 75% of international trade and account for about two-thirds of the world’s population. South Africa’s presidency follows that of two other BRICS members, India in 2023 and Brazil in 2024. South African officials have said they will focus on global solidarity, sustainable development and reducing inequality, and will continue much of Brazil’s agenda. During his one-day visit, Guterres is scheduled to meet with President Cyril Ramaphosa, as well as other South African senior officials. 'Discussions will focus on global and regional issues, but especially on South Africa’s G20 presidency next year, and its leadership on financing for development,' Dujarric said. A senior U.N. official said that South Africa’s presidency will help highlight development challenges on the continent, especially the lack of sufficient financing for development. Highlighting climate impacts Guterres on Thursday will visit neighboring Lesotho, where he will meet with King Letsie III, the prime minister, and address the parliament. The U.N. chief plans to highlight the effects of climate change in the country, which is surrounded on all sides by South Africa. 'The visit to Lesotho is symbolic as it is a small landlocked country that has suffered the dramatic impacts of climate change, which cost African economies billions of dollars each year,' his spokesperson said. According to the U.N., Lesotho is trending toward dryer and hotter weather, which could negatively affect the nation’s water supply. Guterres will visit the Katse Dam, which is central to the Lesotho Highlands Water Project and to water management in the broader area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-to-visit-south-africa-as-it-steps-up-to-helm-g20-/7890275.html	2024-12-06T13:36:58-08:00	
Turkey, Iran, Russia to meet Saturday in Qatar to discuss Syria	ANKARA, TURKEY — The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran and Russia will meet in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday to discuss a lightning rebel advance in Syria, a Turkish diplomatic source said Friday. Syrian rebels have made their biggest battlefield gains since the civil war began 13 years ago, striking a devastating blow to President Bashar Assad. After years of being locked behind frozen front lines, the rebels captured the main northern city of Aleppo last week before pushing as far south as the center of Hama, taking the strategic central city for the first time. Turkey, Russia and Iran have regularly held talks on Syria's future in a trilateral format as part of what is known as the Astana peace process. While NATO member Turkey backs the political and armed opposition, Russia and Iran support Assad. The source said the three ministers were expected to meet on the sidelines of the Doha Forum on Saturday within the framework of the Astana process, but did not provide further information. On Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, speaking alongside Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi after their talks in Ankara, said that a new effort would be made to revive the Astana process. Since the start of the renewed conflict, Ankara has called on Assad to engage with the Syrian people for a political solution. It has denied any involvement in the rebels' operation and said it did not want to see a new migrant wave heading toward its borders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-iran-russia-to-meet-saturday-in-doha-to-discuss-syria/7890277.html	2024-12-06T13:32:54-08:00	
Trump taps forceful ally of hardline immigration policies to head Customs and Border Protection	WASHINGTON — The picture of who will be in charge of executing President-elect Donald Trump's hardline immigration and border policies has come into sharper focus after he announced his picks to head Customs and Border Protection and also the agency tasked with deporting immigrants in the country illegally. Trump said late Thursday he was tapping Rodney Scott, a former Border Patrol chief who has been a vocal supporter of tougher enforcement measures, for CBP commissioner. As acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Trump said he'd nominate Caleb Vitello, a career ICE official with more than 23 years in the agency who most recently has been the assistant director for firearms and tactical programs. They will work with an immigration leadership team that includes South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as head of the Homeland Security Department; former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement head Tom Homan as border czar; and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff. Customs and Border Protection, with its roughly 60,000 employees, falls under the Homeland Security Department. It includes the Border Patrol, which Scott led during Trump's first term, and he essentially is responsible for protecting the country's borders while facilitating trade and travel. Scott comes to the job firmly from the Border Patrol side of the house. He became an agent in 1992 and spent much of his career in San Diego. When he joined the agency, San Diego was by far the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. Traffic plummeted after the government dramatically increased enforcement there, but critics note the effort pushed people to remote parts of California and Arizona. San Diego was also where wall construction began in the 1990s, which shaped Scott’s belief that barriers work. He was named San Diego sector chief in 2017. When he was appointed head of the border agency in January 2020, he enthusiastically embraced Trump's policies. 'He’s well known. He does know these issues and obviously is trusted by the administration,' said Gil Kerlikowske, the CBP commissioner under the Obama administration. Kerlikowske took issue with some of Scott's past actions, including his refusal to fall in line with a Biden administration directive to stop using terms like 'illegal alien' in favor of descriptions like 'migrant,' and his decision as San Diego sector chief to fire tear gas into Mexico to disperse protesters. 'You don’t launch projectiles into a foreign country,' Kerlikowske said. At the time Scott defended the agents’ decisions, saying they were being assaulted by 'a hail of rocks.' While much of the focus of Trump's administration may be on illegal immigration and security along the U.S.-Mexico border, Kerlikowske also stressed the importance of other parts of Customs and Border Protection's mission. The agency is responsible for securing trade and international travel at airports, ports and land crossings around the country. Whoever runs the agency has to make sure that billions of dollars' worth of trade and millions of passengers move swiftly and safely into and out of the country. And if Trump makes good on promises to ratchet up tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada, CBP will play an integral role in enforcing them. 'There’s a huge amount of other responsibility on trade, on tourism, on cyber that take a significant amount of time and have a huge impact on the economy if it’s not done right,' Kerlikowske said. After being forced out under the Biden administration, Scott has been a vocal supporter of Trump's hardline immigration agenda. He has appeared frequently on Fox News and testified in Congress. He's also a senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. In a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, he advocated for a return to Trump-era immigration policies and more pressure on Mexico to enforce immigration on its side of the border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taps-forceful-ally-of-hardline-immigration-policies-to-head-customs-and-border-protection-/7890262.html	2024-12-06T13:22:59-08:00	
Taliban bans women from medical training at private institutes	WASHINGTON — Second-year nursing student Khadija could not sleep the whole night after one of her classmates posted on WhatsApp that the Taliban were planning to bar women from being educated as nurses or midwives. 'The next morning, we were not allowed to attend classes,' said Khadija, 22, who had studied at a private medical training institute in Kabul, Afghanistan. She did not want her family name revealed for security reasons. Overnight, all their studies were suddenly in vain, she said. 'All the girls were crying but couldn't do anything.' The Taliban's Ministry of Health on Monday informed the leaders of medical training institutes in Afghanistan about the new ban on women's education in the institutes, which mainly offered classes in nursing, midwifery, medical laboratory science and dental assistance. The next day, Khadija and the other women were barred from attending their classes. It was the second time that Khadija had been barred from going to a university. Before starting her nursing degree, she had been a second-year economics student at Kabul University. In December 2022, the Taliban imposed a ban on women receiving a university education, saying that female students 'failed to comply' with class gender-segregation rules and dress codes. There was a loophole, however. For the past two years, Taliban had allowed women to take classes at the medical training institutes. That loophole closed Monday. 'After being barred from university, I thought I could continue my education by pursuing a nursing degree,' said Khadija. 'But now I wouldn't be able to complete it. 'All my dreams were tarnished again,' she said. 'The last hope' Another nursing student who requested anonymity told VOA that nursing school 'was the last hope' for her to continue with her education. 'The Taliban banned us from going to the university where I was a political science student and now from medical institutes,' she said. The Taliban imposed repressive restrictions on women in Afghanistan after coming to power in August 2021. Under the Taliban, women are banned from receiving a secondary or university education, working with state and nonstate organizations, traveling long distances without a close male relative, and going to parks, public baths and salons. Afghanistan is listed last — 177th out of 177 countries — on Georgetown University's global Women Peace and Security Index of inclusion, justice and security for women. The United Nations estimated that the annual loss from the Taliban's ban on women's employment was $1 billion, or 5% of the country's gross domestic product. Impact on the health sector A female lecturer at one of the medical training institutes in Kabul, who also requested anonymity, told VOA that the Taliban's new directives would take a high toll on the female teachers at the education centers. 'Now all the female teachers would be staying home,' she said. 'It will affect them and their families financially, and of course, it will have an impact on Afghanistan's economy.' It is not clear how the Taliban make these decisions, she said. 'If they say that it is based on Islam, then why is it different for Afghanistan than other countries?' she asked. Wahid Majrooh, former Afghan minister of public health, told VOA that since 2021, Afghanistan has no female medical school graduates because of the Taliban ban on girls' and women's education. He added that many female physicians left the country because of the Taliban's restrictions. The loss of women in the country's medical sector 'will not be compensated for years to come,' he said. International reaction The Organization of Islamic Cooperation issued a statement Thursday expressing 'grave concern over this unexpected and deeply disappointing directive.' 'Such a decision comes not just as a frustrating blow to the basic rights of Afghan women, but it is also likely to produce a detrimental impact on Afghanistan's healthcare system, which is facing formidable challenges,' read the statement. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan warned of the 'detrimental impact' of the Taliban's ban on health care. UNAMA's statement said that 'if enforced, the ban would further curtail women's rights to education and healthcare, exacerbating existing challenges in the country's medical sector.' Rina Amiri, the U.S. special envoy for Afghan women, girls and human rights, said in a post on X that the ban 'threatens to complete the erasure of women by depriving them of access to health services, including maternal and life-saving medical care.' Khadija calls on the international community to do more. 'They have not done enough. They should stand with Afghan girls and women who are protesting for their rights,' she said. Sahar Azimi of VOA's Afghan Service contributed to this story, which originated in VOA's Afghan Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-bans-women-from-medical-training-at-private-institutes-/7890220.html	2024-12-06T13:17:07-08:00	
Renewed concerns that US adversary behind ‘Havana Syndrome’	WASHINGTON — A series of brain injuries and other serious health ailments that struck hundreds of U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials was almost certainly the work of a U.S. adversary, according to a new report by lawmakers, who accuse U.S. intelligence agencies of trying to hide the truth. The ailments, commonly known as Havana Syndrome, but which the U.S. government calls anomalous health incidents, or AHIs, were first publicly reported among diplomats and other employees at the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. Symptoms range from nausea and dizziness to debilitating headaches and memory problems, with cases having been reported in Russia, China, Poland, Austria and the United States. A March 2023 intelligence assessment concluded that despite some initial suspicions, the illnesses that afflicted, and in some cases incapacitated, U.S. personnel were 'very unlikely' to have been caused by any of America’s enemies. But the report released Thursday by a House Intelligence Subcommittee calls that finding nothing more than an effort to 'create a politically palatable conclusion.' 'It appears increasingly likely, and the chairman is convinced, that a foreign adversary is behind some AHIs,' the report said. 'The IC [intelligence community] has not been a willful participant in Congress’s oversight of this subject, despite the impact AHIs have had on IC personnel,' the report added. 'Instead, the IC has hindered this subcommittee’s efforts to understand AHIs, their cause and effects, and how the IC reached their conclusions.' The report further accuses the U.S. government’s 2023 assessment of using faulty methodology. Lawmakers said the new report is based on dozens of interviews of former intelligence and military officials, as well as of medical experts, and included a review of thousands of pages of documents and evidence provided by U.S. intelligence agencies. 'There is reliable evidence to suggest that some Anomalous Health Incidents (AHIs) are the work of foreign adversaries,' said CIA Subcommittee Chair Rick Crawford, a Republican. 'Our investigative work through the CIA subcommittee will continue until we get full cooperation and thorough answers,' he added. Not all the committee’s lawmakers are in agreement. The ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee skewered the report, describing it as sloppy, while accusing Republicans on the committee of playing games and going so far as to publish the interim report without first sharing it with committee Democrats. The new report 'has uncovered no new evidence to support the conclusion of adversary involvement or evidence of improper analytic process,' Democratic Representative Jim Himes said in a statement. 'I have seen no evidence that the U.S. government was not determined to find the root cause of these incidents and to protect the men and women who go to work around the world every day to safeguard our nation,' Himes added. 'Nor have I observed the IC do anything to impede the subcommittee’s investigation.' In the meantime, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, and the CIA, the country’s leading spy agency, have refuted the committee’s conclusions. 'The [intelligence community] does not agree with many of the report’s interim findings,' an ODNI spokesperson told VOA. 'Most IC agencies assess that it is very unlikely a foreign adversary is responsible for the reported AHIs, and the assertion that we are withholding information that contradicts this analysis or would otherwise illuminate this complex subject is unfounded,' the spokesperson added. The CIA likewise challenged the report’s conclusions while also rejecting accusations that it sought to hinder lawmakers in their investigation. 'Any suggestion that we are withholding information that would shed new light on this complex and difficult issue could not be further from the truth,' a CIA official told VOA, agreeing to share details on the condition of anonymity. 'No one cares more about understanding this than we do,' the official said. 'These are our friends and colleagues.' 'We applied the agency’s very best operational, analytic and technical tradecraft, and our very best personnel to what is one of the largest and most intensive investigations in the agency’s history,' the official added. Yet despite the insistence by U.S. intelligence officials that most cases of Havana Syndrome can be explained by a combination of preexisting medical conditions and environmental and technical factors, experts and outside investigations have raised persistent doubts. A February 2022 report by a panel of experts had warned that the core symptoms in a small number of cases were 'distinctly unusual and unreported elsewhere in the medical literature' and suggested some sort of device must be responsible. 'Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radiofrequency range, plausibly explains the core characteristics,' the 2022 report said. And an investigation this past April by CBS’ '60 Minutes,' Germany’s Der Spiegel and The Insider, also found there is reason to believe that the U.S. intelligence assessment came to the wrong conclusion. The news organizations said a review of travel documents and mobile phone records, along with eyewitness testimony and interviews with multiple U.S. officials and victims, shows that Russia is likely to blame. Specifically, the investigation tied numerous reports of Havana Syndrome with the presence of members of Unit 29155 of Russia’s military intelligence service, known for its role in sabotage and assassinations. It also found members of GRU Unit 29155 received awards and promotions for their work on sound or radio-frequency-based directed energy weapons. But the CIA official who spoke to VOA again rejected the notion that Russia was behind such attacks, despite the CIA director’s initial suspicions. Director William Burns 'had his own assumptions when he became director — so much so, that he even warned his Russian counterparts in late 2021,' the official said. But the official said the CIA’s work 'indicates that some of our assumptions about early AHI reports, including in and after Havana, were incorrect.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/renewed-concerns-that-us-adversary-behind-havana-syndrome-/7890152.html	2024-12-06T11:45:42-08:00	
Trump offers public show of support for Hegseth, his embattled choice to lead Pentagon	WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday offered a public show of support for Pete Hegseth, his embattled choice to lead the Defense Department, whose confirmation by the Senate is in doubt as he faces questions over allegations of excessive drinking, sexual assault and his views on women in combat. 'Pete Hegseth is doing very well,' Trump posted on his social media site. 'He will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense.' The president added that 'Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!' Hegseth, a former Fox News host, Army National Guard major and combat veteran, spent much of the week on Capitol Hill trying to salvage his Cabinet nomination and reassure Republican senators that he is fit to lead Trump’s Pentagon. The effort has quickly become a test of Trump’s clout and of how far loyalty for the president-elect goes with Republican senators who have concerns about his nominees. Trump has already met some resistance. Two of his other choices have stepped aside as they faced intense scrutiny: former Congressman Matt Gaetz, his first choice for attorney general; and Chad Chronister, a Florida sheriff who was Trump’s first choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration. Vice President-elect JD Vance also made a show of support for Hegseth on Friday, part of a full-court press by members of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement. 'If you’re a GOP Senator who voted for Lloyd Austin, but criticize @PeteHegseth, then maybe you’re in the wrong political party!' Vance wrote on X. Hegseth has promised not to drink on the job and told lawmakers he never engaged in sexual misconduct, even as his professional views on female troops have also come under intensifying scrutiny. He said as recently as last month that women 'straight up' should not serve in combat. Two female senators, Republican Joni Ernst of Iowa and Democrat Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, sit on the Armed Services Committee. Both are combat veterans who served in the Iraq war, and Duckworth lost both legs when a Blackhawk helicopter she was piloting was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Ernst, who is also a sexual assault survivor, stopped short of an endorsement after her meeting with Hegseth this week. She said she appreciates his military service and they 'had a frank and thorough conversation.' Hegseth has yet to meet with Duckworth. Trump's transition team has been looking at potential replacements if Hegseth's nomination cannot move forward, including former Trump rival Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. DeSantis plans to attend the Army-Navy football game with Trump on December 14, according to a person familiar with the Florida governor’s plans who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss them before a public announcement. DeSantis and Trump spoke about the defense secretary post when they saw each other Tuesday at a memorial service for sheriff's deputies in West Palm Beach, Florida, according to people familiar with the matter who said Trump was interested in DeSantis for the post, and the governor was receptive. DeSantis also is poised to select a replacement for the expected Senate vacancy to be created by Marco Rubio becoming secretary of state, and Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump is seen as the preferred choice by those in Trump’s orbit. Hegseth is facing resistance from lawmakers as reports have emerged about his past, including the revelation that he made a settlement payment after being accused of a sexual assault that he denies. The New Yorker magazine cited what it described as a whistleblower report and other documents about his time leading a veterans advocacy group, Concerned Veterans for America, that alleged multiple incidents of alcohol intoxication at work events, inappropriate behavior around female staffers and financial mismanagement. The New York Times obtained an email from his mother, Penelope, from 2018, in which she confronted him about mistreating women after he impregnated his current wife while he was married to his second wife. She went on 'Fox & Friends' this week to defend her son.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-offers-public-show-of-support-for-hegseth-his-embattled-nominee-to-lead-pentagon/7890091.html	2024-12-06T11:37:46-08:00	
US urges China to act as North Korea cozies up to Russia	As North Korean troops bolster Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, the U.S. is urging China to rein in its allies’ provocative actions. This comes amid indications that Beijing is increasingly uneasy about the expanding partnership between Russia and North Korea. VOA State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching reports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-urges-china-to-act-as-north-korea-cozies-up-to-russia/7889305.html	2024-12-06T11:30:21-08:00	
China arms sales experience slight growth globally as challenges remain	LOS ANGELES — China’s drive to buttress its military modernization through increased international arms sales has slowed, according to a new report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or SIPRI, with experts citing Chinese-made weapons systems’ lack of combat experience as one key obstacle. The SIPRI report issued this week shows significant growth in total international arms sales driven by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Revenues earned by the world’s 100 largest defense companies grew by 4.2% to a total of $632 billion in 2023. But the growth for Chinese companies in 2023 was only 0.7%, the smallest since 2019. The United States was the world's largest arms exporter last year with 41 American companies in the top 100, earning $317 billion in arms revenue. Only nine of the top 100 enterprises were from China, with total arms revenue amounting to $103 billion, according to the survey. The slowdown comes despite China’s efforts to find overseas markets for its weapons to support its geopolitical objectives. Over the past year, Chinese defense contractors participated in a number of defense exhibitions overseas. More than 60 defense firms participated in the Eurosatory — one of Europe’s biggest defense expos — in France in July. Chinese defense companies also participated in events in Vietnam, Singapore, Qatar and together with Russia at an arms fair in Pakistan. Analysts say Beijing still faces a range of obstacles as it seeks to grow its reputation as a major arms seller. They say Beijing’s close ties to Moscow and the fact that many of its systems — while advanced — have not been battle-tested, are some of the reasons China’s weapons sales appear to be lagging behind other countries. Technology transfer For many countries allied with the West, China's perceived support for Russia and its war in Ukraine are a key deterrent to purchasing Chinese arms. Fenix Chiang, a senior military reporter for Taiwan's China Times newspaper, says that nations such as Poland, which see Russia as a primary threat, are unlikely to buy Chinese or Russian-aligned weaponry, opting instead for more reasonably priced South Korean alternatives. 'Poland would never choose military weapons from China or those aligned with Russia, as they would offer little security,' Chiang said. Wendell Minnick, a former journalist for the Defense News website, said China's lack of after-sales support and unwillingness to share critical technologies with buyers weakens its position in the global arms market. 'They will sell you a fighter jet, but they don’t provide very in-depth training opportunity for the country they sell them to,' Minnick told VOA's Mandarin Service in a webcam video interview. 'That’s a huge problem.' Minnick said that by contrast, Washington supplies training for Taiwan’s F-16 pilots in the United States. 'They are getting face-to-face, boot on the ground experience with real U.S. fighter pilots and training. China doesn’t really provide much in the way of training,' Minnick said. Lack of maintenance and spare parts support is another problem for China in promoting its weapons to the international market, he added. 'You just don’t deliver an advanced weapon system and then say thank you, so long, goodbye, good luck. You have to supply them with continued maintenance and upgrade and spare parts,' Minnick said. 'You also have to provide manuals that are in the local languages, not in Chinese.' Not battle-tested Analysts say the biggest challenge Chinese weapons face abroad is their lack of real combat experience. 'Nobody likes to buy an advanced weapon system that has not seen combat,' said Minnick, 'So that’s a huge problem for China until their systems begin to actually be deployed to combat with a proven combat record.' Erich Shih, a Taiwanese military expert, also believes that a lack of combat experience is a weakness of Chinese weapons. 'When it comes to the export of mainland China's fighter jets, if there's one thing they lack, it's real combat experience,' Shih said. 'In other words, from the perspective of buyers, the question is whether these weapons are truly reliable.' The use of Western technology in Chinese weapons has become another obstacle for China in selling arms overseas. Chang Ching, a senior researcher at the Taipei-based think tank Society for Strategic Studies, notes that there have long been rumors that China is interested in selling its J-10 fighter jet to Argentina, and that Argentina is interested as well. 'However, the ejection seats used in the jets are produced by Martin-Baker, and the U.K. does not approve the export of Martin-Baker’s zero-zero ejection seats to Argentina,' Chang said. 'Unless China can replace them with domestically developed ejection seats, any equipment with components from other countries will face restrictions and limitations when sold abroad.' Dual-use advantage On the positive side for Chinese arms companies, Chinese military drones perform well in the global market due to fewer export restrictions compared to U.S. and European counterparts, according to a report from the Mercator Institute for China Studies, or MERICS, Fenix Chiang says drones from Da-Jiang Innovations, a Chinese technology company, can be easily adapted for military use after being exported to Ukraine. China has reportedly exported dual-use technologies to both sides of the conflict in Ukraine. Highlighting one example, Chiang pointed to China’s sale to Russia last year of 10,000 'DesertCross 1000-3' off-road vehicles that were made for civilian use but can be useful on the battlefield. In another example, China retired its Type 056 missile frigate and transferred the vessel to the Chinese Coast Guard. 'Several of these vessels have been sold to other countries,' Chang said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-arms-sales-experience-slight-growth-globally-as-challenges-remain-/7890130.html	2024-12-06T11:28:29-08:00	
Future of Namibia’s red line goes on trial next month	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Namibia’s newly elected president is setting out the agenda for her coming administration, and one of the priorities may be removal of the red line, a remnant of Namibia’s colonial period that divides the country and restricts the movement of agricultural products, especially beef, between north and south. The outbreak of cattle disease in the 1890s prompted Namibia’s colonial German rulers to block the free movement of livestock between northern and southern Namibia. The practice extended into the era of South African rule. In the 1960s, authorities built a fence across the width of the country, about 1,000 kilometers long. People can cross the fence freely but cannot transport agricultural products such as beef, fruit and vegetables. The AR Movement, a political party that finished third in last month’s National Assembly elections, is suing the state, hoping to force the removal of the fence, which is commonly called the red line. The party says the government has maintained the fence to the economic disadvantage of Namibia’s majority black population, which lives mostly in the north. AR Movement legislator George Kambala told VOA the party’s campaign message calling for the removal of the red line resonated with voters in the north. 'There have been three feasibility studies done on the red line, and all three are recommending the removal of the redline,' he said. 'Once you remove the red line, the agricultural sector will contribute three times what it contributes now to the economy.' Beef is one of Namibia’s chief exports. In January 2024, 42% of Namibia’s beef exports went to the European Union. However, this beef is sourced only south of the red line. Responding to questions posed by VOA at a press conference Thursday, Namibia’s president-elect, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, said removal of the red line was agreed to at the country’s second national land conference six years ago. She said the issue is being hijacked by the AR Movement to score political points. 'It can have an economic impact, and that’s why now as a government, we have a plan on how to gradually … and we have already started … reach that,' she said. Right now, there is no date for when the red line would be eliminated. Former Prime Minister Nahas Angula — who is also a commercial farmer in the south of Namibia — said removal of the red line is complicated by the fact that northern Namibian farmers sometimes graze their cattle in Angola. He said the red line, although a relic of colonial Namibia, still plays a role in assuring the European market that beef from Namibia is free from foot and mouth disease, which periodically breaks out in parts of northern Namibia. 'Northern Namibia is overcrowded, and some farmers go to graze their cattle in Angola,' Angula said. 'So, if you want to open up borders — open up the red line — you must actually work with Angola to make sure that vaccination is carried out in Angola. ... that all the ... animals are properly vaccinated from time to time. 'It’s a complicated situation,' he said. Hearings on the AR Movement’s lawsuit to eliminate the red line are scheduled to begin January 21 and are expected to last 10 days. Given the complexity of the case, judges may take several months to issue a ruling.	https://www.voanews.com/a/future-of-namibia-s-red-line-goes-on-trial-next-month/7890127.html	2024-12-06T11:18:56-08:00	
Zelenskyy reveals new medium-range Peklo drone missile	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday introduced new long-range Peklo drone missiles being manufactured in a Ukrainian factory, the first batch of which, he said, already has been delivered to the nation’s armed forces. In footage released by his office, Zelenskyy could be seen touring the factory in an undisclosed location alongside Ukraine Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi and other officials. In a post to his X social media account, Zelenskyy said the hybrid drone-missile Peklo — which means 'hell' in Ukrainian — has a range of 700 kilometers and a speed of 700 kilometers per hour. He said it already has proven its combat effectiveness. Ukrainian officials said the drones are cost-effective and comparable to some Russian-made cruise missiles in terms of performance. 'It is crucial that our defenders receive such modern, Ukrainian-made weaponry,' Zelenskyy said in the recording. 'Now the task is to continue ramping up its production and deployment.' The announcement comes a day after Ukraine's Defense Ministry announced plans to supply their armed forces with more than 30,000 long-range attack drones in 2025, with funding supplied by international partners. In a statement, the ministry said the drones operate autonomously and can strike enemy targets with high precision. The ministry made those arrangements in light of U.S President Joe Biden’s term winding down and the uncertainty presented by the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has voiced skepticism about continued support and said he would resolve the war before his January 20 inauguration, but did not say how. A U.S. National Security Council spokesperson in a background briefing told reporters that National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president’s office, at the White House for meetings on Thursday to discuss the future of U.S. support for Ukraine. The spokesperson said the meeting lasted more than an hour with Sullivan focused on Biden’s theory that improving Ukraine’s position in its war against Russia would allow Ukraine to enter negotiations from a position of strength. The spokesperson said Sullivan and Yermak discussed the four-part U.S. strategic support for Ukraine, which involves increased military assistance, economic pressure on Russia through sanctions, addressing Ukraine’s manpower challenges and sustaining support for Ukraine’s economy. To implement the strategy, the spokesperson noted the U.S. will provide Ukraine’s military with hundreds of thousands of additional artillery rounds, thousands of additional rockets and hundreds of additional armored vehicles between now and January. They also pointed to the sweeping set of U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russia’s financial sector and said that more sanctions would follow in the coming weeks, all designed to make it more difficult for Russia to sustain its war against Ukraine. Sullivan and Yermak reportedly discussed a U.S. offer to prepare newly mobilized soldiers at training sites outside of Ukraine. And to help sustain Ukraine’s economy in the months ahead, the spokesperson said the U.S. is finalizing the $20 billion Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration loan agreement between the governments, backed by the profits of immobilized Russian sovereign assets. The NSC spokesperson said the strategy is designed to improve Ukraine’s position in war for the coming year and lay the foundation for a negotiated settlement 'that provides for an independent, sovereign and democratic Ukraine.' Mykhailo Komadovsky of VOA’s Russian Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-reveals-new-medium-range-peklo-drone-missile/7889978.html	2024-12-06T10:48:08-08:00	
Federal appeals court upholds law requiring sale or ban of TikTok in US	A federal appeals court panel on Friday upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in a few short months, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the law, which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January, is constitutional, rebuffing TikTok’s challenge that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and unfairly targeted the platform. 'The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,' said the court's opinion. 'Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States.' TikTok and ByteDance — another plaintiff in the lawsuit — are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term and whose Justice Department would have to enforce the law, said during the presidential campaign that he is now against a TikTok ban and would work to 'save' the social media platform. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, culminated a years-long saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat because of its connections to China. The U.S. has said it’s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect. However, a significant portion of the government’s information in the case has been redacted and hidden from the public as well as the two companies. TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn’t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing’s benefit in the U.S. They also have argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government. Friday's ruling came after the appeals court panel heard oral arguments in September. Some legal experts said at the time that it was challenging to read the tea leaves on how the judges would rule. In a court hearing that lasted more than two hours, the panel — composed of two Republican and one Democrat appointed judges — appeared to grapple with how TikTok’s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. The judges pressed Daniel Tenny, a Justice Department attorney, on the implications the case could have on the First Amendment. But they also expressed some skepticism at TikTok’s arguments, challenging the company’s attorney — Andrew Pincus —on whether any First Amendment rights preclude the government from curtailing a powerful company subject to the laws and influence of a foreign adversary. In parts of their questions about TikTok’s ownership, the judges cited wartime precedent that allows the U.S. to restrict foreign ownership of broadcast licenses and asked if the arguments presented by TikTok would apply if the U.S. was engaged in war. To assuage concerns about the company’s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data. The company also argues the government’s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient. Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it’s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm — the platform’s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan — would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content. Still, some investors, including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok’s U.S. business. This week, a spokesperson for McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. TikTok’s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators — for which the company is covering legal costs — as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. If TikTok appeals and the courts continue to uphold the law, it would fall on Trump’s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The penalties would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services that would be barred from supporting it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-appeals-court-upholds-law-requiring-sale-or-ban-of-tiktok-in-us/7889936.html	2024-12-06T09:28:20-08:00	
Doctors want urgent action on DRC’s yet-to-be identified disease outbreak	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Africa’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention — Africa CDC — says it is working to identify a new disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has claimed at least 79 lives and infected hundreds more. Dr. Jean Kaseya, director-general of Africa CDC, told reporters Thursday from the DRC that his organization is working with Kinshasa authorities to identify the disease and its causes. Kaseya made it clear that he wants fast results from doctors, researchers and medical organizations. 'How can we accept to have five to six weeks of delay?' he said. 'It’s just because the surveillance system is weak. We are still waiting to know what is going on. We do not want to see another disease that will be another five to six weeks before official notification. Regarding this Disease X, we say we are waiting for results from the lab — either tomorrow [Friday] or on Saturday, to know what is going on.' The Africa CDC is calling it Disease X until lab results can reveal more. The disease was identified in late October in the Panzi district of Kwango province on the border with Angola. The World Health Organization’s Regional Office for Africa said Friday it is sending experts to help investigate. The disease causes flu-like symptoms. WHO says the cause is unknown, but it will be investigating influenza, COVID-19, malaria or measles as possibilities. Dr. Norman Matara, secretary-general of Southern African Association of Doctors for Human Rights, urged people in the DRC and the region to remain calm but improve their hygienic practices. 'We also encourage governments to strengthen their surveillance at ports of entries, so that unusual illnesses can be reported to health authorities. We also call for a coordinated approach led by the African CDC so that we can quickly identify this disease and prevent further loss of lives through a global outbreak,' Matara said. Dr. Akili Cishugi Francis, the coordinator of a Kinshasa-based NGO, Action Asante, said stronger action is needed, especially when symptoms of the disease appear. 'This includes rigorous hygiene, drinking water, the isolation of suspected cases, and compliance with the instructions given by medical teams present. We also raise awareness of the importance of quickly reporting any suspicious symptoms like fever, cough, running nose, anemia, to health authorities,' Francis said. People with the disease also experience headaches and breathing difficulties. The Africa CDC says the disease is affecting mainly young people, many of them children younger than 5 years old. Kaseya noted that having labs in different parts of the DRC is important, not just for Disease X but for subsequent outbreaks. 'You see the difference between the number of cases and confirmed cases, because we have a major issue regarding the lab. We need to have a strong lab capacity in DRC but also the distance — the DRC is a big country, but infrastructure is not at the ideal level,' he said. 'Less than 35% of all samples are reaching labs in the 48 hours recommended. It means we are facing the quality [issues] of the samples, and this one is a major issue we need to address quickly.' Meanwhile, the DRC continues to fight the mpox outbreak, which has affected 20 African countries, according to the Africa CDC. Since January 2024, 62,171 cases and 1,200 deaths have been recorded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doctors-want-urgent-action-on-drc-s-yet-to-be-identified-disease-outbreak/7889825.html	2024-12-06T09:14:56-08:00	
US rebounds, adds 227,000 jobs in November	WASHINGTON — America’s job market rebounded in November, adding 227,000 workers in a solid recovery from the previous month, when the effects of strikes and hurricanes sharply diminished employers’ payrolls. Last month’s hiring growth was up considerably from a meager gain of 36,000 jobs in October. The government also revised up its estimate of job growth in September and October by a combined 56,000. Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.1% in October to a still-low 4.2%. Hourly wages rose 0.4% from October to November and 4% from a year earlier — both solid figures and slightly higher than forecasters had expected. The November employment report provided the latest evidence that the U.S. job market remains durable even though it has lost significant momentum from the 2021-2023 hiring boom, when the economy was rebounding from the pandemic recession. The job market’s gradual slowdown is, in part, a result of the high interest rates the Federal Reserve engineered in its drive to tame inflation. The Fed jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Defying predictions, the economy kept growing despite much higher borrowing rates for consumers and businesses. But since early this year, the job market has been slowing. Thomas Simons, U.S. economist at Jefferies, wrote in a commentary that the recovery from October’s strikes and hurricanes likely increased last month's payrolls by 60,000, suggesting that the job market is strong enough to absorb most jobseekers but not enough to raise worries about inflation. Across industries last month, manufacturing companies added 22,000 jobs, reflecting the end of strikes at Boeing and elsewhere. Health care companies added 54,000 jobs, government agencies 33,000, and bars and restaurants 29,000. But retailers shed 28,000 jobs in November. Americans have been enjoying unusual job security. This week, the government reported that layoffs fell to 1.6 million in October, below the lowest levels in the two decades that preceded the pandemic. At the same time, the number of job openings rebounded from a 3½-year low, a sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has cooled. The overall economy has remained resilient. The much higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses that resulted from the Fed’s rate hikes had been expected to tip the economy into a recession. Instead, the economy kept growing as households continued to spend and employers continued to hire. The economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace from July through September on healthy spending by consumers. Annual economic growth has topped a decent 2% in eight of the past nine quarters. And inflation has dropped from a 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 2.6% last month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-rebounds-adds-227-000-jobs-in-november/7889922.html	2024-12-06T09:13:48-08:00	
Israeli-Hamas peace talks resume in Egypt	Officials of Hamas and Israel say Gaza peace talks have resumed in Egypt after mediators from Qatar and the United States suspended them in frustration last month. Hamas political official Bassem Naim told The Associated Press Thursday there has been a 'reactivation' of efforts in recent days to end the fighting, release hostages from Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Another source told the AP that Qatari mediators had returned to Egypt. The Washington Post reported Friday that negotiators had signaled 'serious efforts' are underway to reach a ceasefire deal in Gaza. The Post report said Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a meeting in Malta that Israel perceives an opportunity to advance a deal for the release of hostages in Gaza and is committed to pursuing it. Following a meeting of Israel’s Cabinet late Thursday, Israel’s Channel 12 cited government officials saying that the Qataris and the Egyptians believe that because of a series of new conditions in the region, Hamas would be willing to 'enter into accelerated discussions even if it is a partial deal and even if Israel does not declare an end to the war in advance.' Reports said such a ceasefire deal would include the 'humanitarian' release of women and children and wounded hostages. Israeli officials said, in exchange, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israel. The report said a senior Israeli delegation will leave for Cairo early next week, to discuss the new proposal.' The Golan Heights Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, said Friday, it was reinforcing aerial and ground forces in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Syria and was prepared for all scenarios. In a statement from its official account on the X social media platform, the IDF said it 'follows the events and is prepared for any scenario in attack and defense, will not allow a threat near the border of Israel, and will work to thwart any threat to the citizens of the State of Israel.' Reuters video showed troops and military vehicles stationed along the border Friday. Strikes on Syria-Lebanon border Israel's military also said Friday it carried out strikes overnight targeting Hezbollah 'weapon-smuggling routes' on the Syria-Lebanon border. Official media in Lebanon and Syria reported that the air raid put the Arida border crossing out of service, days after it reopened following being hit earlier in the conflict. In a statement, the IDF said the Israeli air force 'conducted strikes on weapon-smuggling routes and terror infrastructure sites located near the Syrian regime's crossings at the Syrian-Lebanese border.' The statement included a map identifying one of the targets as the Arida crossing. Hamas leader killed The IDF also reported Friday it had 'eliminated' the head of Hamas' aerial unit in Gaza, Nidal Al-Najar. The report said he was taken out in a joint 'and precise' operation with the Israeli Security Authority. The IDF said Al-Najar was one of the masterminds of the aerial infiltration into Israel on October 7, 2023, and had helped lead attacks against Israel and the IDF operating in central Gaza throughout the war, employing explosive drones to target troops. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7 terror attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed about 44,500 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

Hunt for gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare's CEO heads into 3rd day	NEW YORK — As the investigation into a masked gunman who stalked and killed the head of one of the largest U.S. health insurers moved into its third day Friday, possible leads emerged about his travel before the shooting and a message scrawled on ammunition found at the crime scene. UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was killed in a dawn ambush Wednesday as he walked from his midtown hotel to the company’s annual investor conference across the street, blocks from tourist draws such as Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. But days later, the gunman was still at large and the reason for the killing remained unknown, with New York City police saying evidence firmly points to it being a targeted attack. Investigators worked to piece together more of the timeline of the gunman’s whereabouts before the shooting, examine security camera footage and even test a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper in a hunt for his DNA. The words 'deny,' 'defend' and 'depose' were found emblazoned on the ammunition, echoing a phrase used by insurance industry critics, two law enforcement officials said Thursday, speaking to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation. The messages mimic the phrase 'delay, deny, defend,' which is commonly used by lawyers and insurance industry critics to describe tactics used to avoid paying claims. It refers to insurers delaying payment, denying a claim and then defending their actions. Health insurers like UnitedHealthcare have become frequent targets of criticism from doctors and patients for denying claims or complicating access to care. Investigators also now believe the suspect may have traveled to New York last month on a bus that originated in Atlanta, one of the law enforcement officials said. Police and federal agents have been collecting information from Greyhound in an attempt to identify the suspect and are working to determine whether he purchased the ticket to New York in late November, the official said. Investigators were also trying to obtain additional information from a cellphone recovered from a pedestrian plaza through which the shooter fled. A tip that the shooter may have stayed at a hostel brought police Thursday morning to at least two such establishments on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, according to one of the law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation. The photos made public Thursday were taken in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel. 'We are fully cooperating with the NYPD and, as this is an active investigation, cannot comment at this time,' hostel spokesperson Danielle Brumfitt said in an emailed statement. Police released new photos Thursday of a person wanted for questioning in connection with Thompson’s killing. The images, showing an unmasked man smiling in the lobby of a Manhattan hostel, add to a collection of photos and video that have circulated since the shooting — including footage of the attack itself, as well as still frames of the suspected gunman stopping at a Starbucks beforehand. Investigators believe the suspect used a fake New Jersey identification card when he checked in at the hostel, said one of the officials who spoke with the AP. Employees who work at the hostel told investigators they remembered a man who almost always wore a mask when interacting with them or passing by the front desk. That person wore a jacket that looked like the one worn by the man pictured in surveillance images released after the shooting, the official said. After the shooting, police said the gunman fled on a bicycle and was last seen riding into Central Park. Based on surveillance video and evidence from the scene, investigators believe the shooter had at least some firearms training and experience with guns and that the weapon was equipped with a silencer, one of the law enforcement officials told the AP. Investigators were also looking into whether the suspect had pre-positioned a bike as part of an escape plan, the official said. Security video shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, leveling his pistol and firing several shots, barely pausing to clear a gun jam while the executive tumbled to the sidewalk. Cameras showed him fleeing the block across a pedestrian plaza before getting on the bicycle. Police released several images of the man wearing a hooded jacket and a mask that concealed most of his face — a look that would not have attracted attention on a chilly morning. Thompson, a father of two sons who lived in a Minneapolis suburb, had been with Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years. His wife, Paulette, told NBC News on Wednesday that he told her that 'there were some people that had been threatening him.' She didn’t have details but suggested the threats may have involved issues with insurance coverage. The insurer’s parent company, UnitedHealth Group Inc., was holding its annual meeting in New York to update investors on its direction and expectations for the coming year. The company ended the conference after Thompson’s death. UnitedHealthcare provides coverage for more than 49 million Americans and brought in more than $281 billion in revenue last year. It is the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S. and manages health insurance coverage for employers and state and federally funded Medicaid programs. In October, UnitedHealthcare was named along with Humana and CVS in a Senate report detailing how its denial rate for prior authorizations for some Medicare Advantage patients has surged in recent years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hunt-for-gunman-who-killed-unitedhealthcare-s-ceo-heads-into-3rd-day-as-new-clues-emerge/7889740.html	2024-12-06T07:30:38-08:00	
Romanian top court annuls presidential election result	BUCHAREST — Romania's top court annulled the result of the first round of the country's presidential election on Friday, adding that the entire election process would have to be rerun. The second round had been scheduled for Sunday, and voting is already underway in polling stations abroad. Having polled in single digits before the first presidential election round on November 24, Calin Georgescu — who wants to end Romanian support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion — surged to a victory that raised questions over how such a surprise had been possible in a European Union and NATO member state. Documents declassified by Romania's top security council on Wednesday said the country was a target of 'aggressive hybrid Russian attacks' during the election period. 'The electoral process to elect Romania's president will be fully re-run, and the government will set a new date and ... calendar for the necessary steps,' the court said in a statement. The second round of the presidential contest that had been set to take place on Sunday would have pitted Georgescu, a far-right, pro-Russian candidate, against pro-EU centrist leader Elena Lasconi. Far-right parties also performed well in last Sunday's parliamentary election in Romania, though the ruling Social Democrats emerged as the largest grouping and hope to cobble together a pro-E.U. coalition government. The court has not called into question the integrity of the parliamentary vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-top-court-annuls-presidential-election-result-/7889719.html	2024-12-06T07:07:14-08:00	
US farmers, economists weigh in on impact of tariffs	Through social media posts, President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to imposed tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico – three of the top trading partners for the United States. VOA’s Kane Farabaugh has more about the potential economic impact if Trump follows through.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-farmers-economists-weigh-in-on-impact-of-tariffs/7889629.html	2024-12-06T05:53:58-08:00	
China fine tunes economic stimulus as it braces for new US administration	BANGKOK — China is fine-tuning policies to rev up its economy as it braces for uncertain relations with the United States under President-elect Donald Trump, giving manufacturers a 20% made-in-China price advantage in sales to the Chinese government. The moves come ahead of a top-level annual economic planning conference scheduled for next week that will help set China's strategy for the coming year. The Ministry of Finance announced it is seeking public comment on the made-in-China plan until Jan. 4. To qualify, products have to be made entirely in China, from the raw materials stage to the finished products, it said, although some components must just meet standards for a share of domestic-based production. Farm, forestry, minerals and fisheries products are excluded, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Friday. Government procurement generally amounts to about 10% or more of business activity in major economies. Under the program, companies will be given a 20% price advantage, with the government making up the difference, part of a series of moves to underpin stronger sales that also includes promoting insurance underwriting and easier access to financing for e-commerce and small- and mid-sized 'little giants' and 'hidden champions.' Shares in China have surged this week on expectations that the planning meeting will yield more support for the slowing economy as a revival in exports helps to compensate for a sluggish property market and subdued consumer spending. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite index both gained more than 2% this week. Before that closed-door meeting convenes in Beijing, Premier Li Qiang was due to hold a conference Monday with heads of 10 major international organizations including the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization, the Foreign Ministry said in a notice on its website. The themes of the gathering focus on promoting 'global common prosperity,' 'upholding multilateralism' and making advances in China's own reforms and modernization, it said. Major changes may be unlikely as China's leaders wait to see what Trump does. 'The policymakers would likely reserve policy room for the four-year period of the Trump administration,' economists at ANZ Research said in a report. Key areas to focus on will be boosting consumer spending and more help for the property sector, it said. China's leaders set a target for economic growth of 'about 5%' for this year. In the first three quarters, growth averaged 4.8%, and has gradually slowed. Over the past few months, regulators have rolled out a slew of policies meant to help reverse the downturn in the housing market and encourage more spending by Chinese households that have been tightening purse strings since the pandemic. Setting the tone ahead of next week's meetings, a commentary in the ruling Communist Party's newspaper The People's Daily downplayed the usual focus on meeting growth targets, noting that the industrial boom that has made China the world's second-largest economy came at a 'huge price in resources and the environment.' 'If we do not break with the worship of speed ... even if we temporarily increase the speed, we will detract from future growth,' it said. 'It is not that we cannot go faster, but that we do not want to.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-fine-tunes-economic-stimulus-as-it-braces-for-new-us-administration-/7889599.html	2024-12-06T05:34:52-08:00	
North Gaza hospital director says Israeli strikes hit facility	Beit Lahia, Palestinian Territories — The director of north Gaza's Kamal Adwan hospital and the territory's civil defense agency said Israel conducted several strikes on Friday that hit the facility, one of the last functioning health centers in the area. 'There was a series of air strikes on the northern and western sides of the hospital, accompanied by intense and direct fire,' Hossam Abu Safieh said, adding that four staff were killed and no surgeons were left at the site. The Israeli army has not yet responded to AFP requests for comment on the strikes. Mahmud Bassal, Gaza's civil defense spokesman, told AFP on Friday morning that the Israeli army entered Kamal Adwan hospital, evacuated patients and arrested several Palestinians. The city of Beit Lahia has been the site of an intense Israeli military operation for the past two months that has intensified in recent days, forcing thousands to flee amid bombing, the civil defense agency said. The Israeli army has stormed Kamal Adwan on several occasions since the start of the war nearly 14 months ago, while the hospital said that its intensive care unit director Ahmad al-Kahlut was killed in an air strike late last month. The army's storming of Kamal Adwan comes just days after the UN's World Health Organization said an emergency medical team had reached it for the first time in 60 days. With little to no aid reaching Kamal Adwan since the start of the Israeli operation in Gaza's far north in early October, the hospital had run out of most supplies, including fuel. The Israeli army says its operation in the north aims to keep Hamas militants from regrouping there. Rights groups have accused it of pursuing a plan to evacuate or starve all those remaining there, which it denies. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said on Thursday that residents of the north would not be allowed to move back there as long as the military operations are ongoing. The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas's surprise October 7, 2023 attack which resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official data. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, Britain, the European Union and others. Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has resulted in at least 44,580 deaths, mostly civilians, according to data from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which the U.N. considers reliable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-gaza-hospital-director-says-israeli-strikes-hit-facility-/7889535.html	2024-12-06T04:49:01-08:00	
Former Pakistan PM Khan threatens civil disobedience movement from prison	Islamabad — Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister, Imran Khan. has threatened to start a nationwide civil disobedience movement this month following a government crackdown on his supporters that resulted in the deaths of several. Khan urged supporters in a message posted Thursday night on the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, to assemble in the northwestern city of Peshawar on December 13 for a 'grand gathering to pay homage to the martyrs.' The city is the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, governed by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party. The former Pakistani leader demanded that a judicial investigation be conducted into the deaths of at least 12 of his supporters during a November 26 government crackdown on what he termed 'peaceful' PTI protesters in the national capital, Islamabad. Additionally, he called for a probe into the violent police onslaughts against his party workers during nationwide protests in May of last year, which resulted in several fatalities, and sought the release of hundreds of his party workers detained during the antigovernment protests. 'If these two demands are not met, a civil disobedience movement will be launched from December 14, and the government will bear responsibility for any consequences,' warned Khan, rated as the most popular politician in Pakistan. 'Hundreds of our workers are still missing,' he stated. The Pakistani government did not immediately comment on Khan’s threat but has repeatedly warned the PTI against resorting to violent street agitation. It has consistently denied any fatalities during last month’s PTI-led protest march. Government ministers say security forces did not use 'firearms' but instead employed tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters, and they have confirmed the arrest of nearly 1,000 protesters. Officials claim that during the May 9, 2023, protests, Khan’s supporters attacked and ransacked key state buildings, including military installations, charges PTI leaders rejected as politically motivated. On Thursday, an anti-terrorism court indicted Khan for allegedly directing the May 9 attacks against the military. The 72-year-old politician and his co-defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges. The special court convened the hearing and announced the indictment at Adiala Jail, the detention facility near Islamabad, where Khan, prime minister from 2018 to 2022, has been held since August of last year. Since his ouster as prime minister through an opposition vote of no-confidence in parliament, Khan has been entangled in a staggering 188 state-backed lawsuits, as reported to a federal high court by the Pakistani Interior Ministry this week. The legal challenges encompass a broad spectrum of charges, including sedition, terrorism, murder, and corruption. The deposed Pakistani prime minister claims that the cases are fabricated charges intended to prevent his return to politics at the behest of the powerful military, a claim denied by the government and army officials. Appeals courts have overturned or suspended all his convictions and sentences, citing a lack of evidence or trial transparency. However, authorities have prevented Khan from leaving the prison by launching new charges against him each time a court orders his release on bail. The former cricket star-turned-prime minister’s removal from power has plunged the South Asian nation of more than 240 million people into lingering political turmoil. Since Pakistan gained independence in 1947, the military has staged three coups against elected governments, resulting in over three decades of dictatorial rule. In recent years, prominent national politicians, including Khan, have increasingly and publicly accused army generals of influencing elected governments when not in power and orchestrating the removal of prime ministers who challenge the military’s interference. The Pakistani military and its intelligence agencies, collectively referred to as 'the establishment,' deny the allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-pakistan-pm-khan-threatens-civil-disobedience-movement-from-prison-/7889520.html	2024-12-06T04:31:18-08:00	
Ghana’s election expected to be highly competitive	Nairobi — Former Ghanaian President John Mahama is one of the main challengers of ruling party candidate Mahamudu Bawumia in the West African nation’s December 7 national elections. If he wins, Mahama vows to cultivate a 24-hour business environment to bolster job creation and improve an economy recovering from a $30 billion external debt default in 2022. Bawumia, the current vice president, says despite the recent woes associated with the post-COVID pandemic and some internal pressures he too is committed to strengthening the economy. Candidates Since 1992, the country has been governed by either the National Democratic Congress or the New Patriotic Party, and that is not likely to change, University of Ghana senior lecturer Kwame Asah Asante told VOA. 'It’s the dominant parties; one of them is going to carry the day. … From 1992 up to 2020, the minor parties, if you put all their performance together, on average … they have not gone up to 5%. ... But it’s also true … if they can hit more than 4% of their strength … they are able to push the election to a second round.' On the streets of the capital, Accra, billboards of the various candidates in the December presidential election are everywhere, and voters’ excitement is palpable. Some say they are tired of the two parties and have not decided yet for whom they’ll vote. 'Since 1992 to this year, we haven’t changed parties … every day it’s NPP NDC … we want [to] change to [a] different party so that we would see more improvements,' Angela Ofori, an undecided voter told VOA. John Taden, an international political economist and an assistant professor of international studies at Pepperdine University in Los Angeles, said that outside the main two political parties, there are newcomers that 'appear to be exciting to the youth … [Nana] Kwame Bediako also known as Cheddar. He’s popular…but he hasn’t gained that much ground to make an impact in the outcome of the election…the best he can do this time might be to force a runoff.' The 44-year-old Bediako who calls himself a visionary is running as an independent candidate. In addition to focusing on improving the everyday lives of Ghanaians, the vision in his manifesto includes developing 'eco-friendly policies that ensure Ghana’s progress is not only economically sound but also environmentally responsible.' Issues/economy Ghana is the second largest cocoa producer in the world according to the United Nations Development Program, but the country defaulted on most of its $30 billion external debt in 2022 after the effects of years of borrowing were made worse by the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The grain supply disruption caused by the war in Ukraine also had its effects. It triggered a shortage of about 30 million metric tons of grain in Africa in the first year of the war alone, according to the Atlantic Council, a policy research organization based in Washington. Asante said there are many critical issues at stake in this year’s elections, including infrastructure development, health, education, corruption, and unemployment, but many voters are zeroing in on one matter. 'The economy will play an important role because it’s a bread-and-butter issue; we’ve seen time and again that anytime you have a very difficult economy, campaigning becomes difficult for the government of the day,' he said. A view echoed by Taden. 'In the U.S., we saw [President-elect Donald] Trump come back to power because of inflation and, in Ghana, inflation at some point was at a historic 54% over the last 18 months …but domestically, they have faced a lot of sustained protests over illegal mining, a crisis that has taken place in the south, where people without mining licenses have engaged in consistent destruction of the environment without any government oversight or restriction,' Taden said. Illegal mining, known locally as 'galamsay', is affecting forest cover and arable land for agriculture purposes, and now poses a serious threat to the cocoa production, Asante said. These issues have pushed some voters, such as Wisdom Gavor and Janet Bawah, to say they will not vote for the current government. Instead, they want Mahama, the former president who has made a comeback and promises a 24-hour economy. 'Currently we are using a one shift system. So, if the 24-hour economy comes, it’s going to be three shifts. For example, a hundred staff is working in one organization, so if the 24-hour economy comes, it’s going to be 300 staff,' Gavor said. 'The suffering is too much for us … today you go to buy this, the price is different. The next day, different prices. So, we want a change in the system,' Bawah told VOA. Others say they will stick with the ruling NPP candidate and current Vice President Bawumia, giving him full credit for some of the policy changes his party brought to the country. 'One policy I am very happy about is the digitization policy. … This policy is about creating jobs online, making everything more accessible and taking it away from the traditional ways of doing things, to the modern way,' NPP voter Ivan Duke told VOA. Taden agreed with that assessment saying 'Dr. Bawumia is called Mr. Digital because he did promise to digitize the Ghanaian economy and to some extent he has delivered on a lot of those promises. He has introduced some digitization into the health sector and to government operations that have created a lot of efficiency. They have eliminated some backlogs in some government operations and some ghost names in government payrolls.' Ghana is generally viewed as a stable democracy in a region plagued by coups. Despite some polls suggesting the results could sway one way or the other, this year’s election is expected to be highly competitive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-s-election-expected-to-be-highly-competitive-/7889499.html	2024-12-06T03:55:33-08:00	
Russia takes villages in key areas of east Ukraine front	Moscow — Russia said Friday its forces had captured a village near the embattled supply hub of Pokrovsk and another near the industrial town of Kurakhove, gaining ground in two key areas of the east Ukraine front line. Moscow has been advancing in east Ukraine for months, pressing its advantage against overstretched and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers. Russian army units 'liberated the settlements' of Sukhi Yaly and Pustynka in the eastern Donetsk region, Moscow's defense ministry said in a daily briefing. Sukhi Yaly is about 13 kilometers southwest of Kurakhove, a strategic industrial town on the banks of a reservoir that Moscow is trying to encircle. Pustynka lies just south of Pokrovsk, an embattled logistics hub at the intersection of rail and road routes supplying Ukrainian troops across the front line. The nearly three-year conflict has escalated sharply in recent months, with Kyiv deploying U.S. and British-supplied long-range missiles in attacks on Russian soil and Moscow firing an experimental hypersonic weapon at Ukraine in response. Ukraine has been trying to put itself in as secure a position as possible ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House in January. The Republican has promised to swiftly end the conflict once in power, raising concerns in Kyiv that Ukraine will be forced to make massive territorial concessions to Moscow. Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones struck the Russian-occupied town of Oleshky on Friday, killing three people and seriously wounding three others, the region's Moscow-appointed governor said. Images shared by Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of Ukraine's southern Kherson region, showed what appeared to be bodies lying on a street and outside a building, covered with blankets. 'This morning, Alyoshki was subjected to an inhumane kamikaze drone attack,' Saldo said, using the Russian spelling of the town's name. He said the drones targeted an aid distribution point in the town, accusing Kyiv of directing the attack 'exclusively at the civilian population.' 'As a result... three people were killed. Three more citizens were seriously injured,' he said. Kyiv did not immediately comment but denies targeting civilians in Russian-occupied areas of the country. Oleshky had a population of about 20,000 people before Moscow launched its military assault on Ukraine in February 2022. It lies in Ukraine's southern Kherson region, on the Russian-occupied eastern bank of the Dnipro river. The river acts as a de facto front line between Moscow's and Kyiv's forces, with both sides regularly accusing each other of firing artillery and drones across the vast waterway.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7889485.html	2024-12-06T03:40:37-08:00	
Iran launches heaviest space payload into orbit: media	Tehran, Iran — Iran successfully launched on Friday its heaviest space payload, which includes a satellite and a space tug, using a domestically developed satellite carrier, official media reported. Weighing 300 kilograms, the payload consisted of the Fakhr-1 telecommunications satellite and the Saman-1 space tug, according to state television. The Saman-1 is an 'orbital transmission system' designed to transport satellites from lower orbits to higher ones, as described by the Iran Space Research Center when it was unveiled in 2017. The launch marks an 'operational step' toward transferring satellites into higher orbits, the TV report said. The system was first introduced in February 2017 at a ceremony attended by Iran's then-president, Hassan Rouhani, and was test-launched in 2022. The payloads were launched using the homegrown Simorgh satellite carrier from the Imam Khomeini launch base in Semnan province. Named after a mythical Iranian bird, the Simorgh is a two-stage, liquid-fueled satellite launch vehicle developed by Iran's defense ministry. In September, Iran said it successfully put the Chamran-1 research satellite into orbit using the Ghaem-100 carrier, which is produced by the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace division. Western governments, including the United States, have repeatedly warned Iran against such launches, arguing technology used for satellites could be applied to ballistic missiles, potentially capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Iran denies it wants nuclear weapons. It has consistently stated that its satellite and rocket launches are focused on civil and defense applications. Last month, Russia launched 55 satellites, including two built by Iran -- Koswar and Hodhod -- reflecting the deepening political, economic and military relations between the two nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-launches-heaviest-space-payload-into-orbit-media/7889425.html	2024-12-06T01:06:55-08:00	
Thousands flee fighting in Syrian cities of Homs, Hama	BEIRUT — Airstrikes targeted a bridge on the highway linking the Syrian cities of Homs and Hama, a war monitor said Friday, as government forces scramble to secure Homs after Islamist-led rebels captured Hama and commercial hub Aleppo. 'Fighter jets executed several airstrikes, targeting Al-Rastan bridge on (the) Homs-Hama highway ... as well as attacking positions around the bridge, attempting to cut off the road between Hama and Homs and secure Homs,' the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The rebels led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched their offensive a little more than a week ago, just as a ceasefire in neighboring Lebanon took hold between Israel and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's ally Hezbollah. To slow the rebel advance, the Observatory said Assad's forces erected soil barriers on the highway north of Homs, Syria's third-largest city which lies just 40 kilometers south of Hama. Tens of thousands of members of Assad's Alawite minority community were fleeing Homs on Thursday, for fear that the rebels would keep up their advance, the Observatory said earlier. The rebels captured Hama on Thursday following street battles with government forces, announcing 'the complete liberation of the city' in a message on their Telegram channel. Rebel fighters kissed the ground and let off volleys of celebratory gunfire as they entered Syria's fourth-largest city. Many residents turned out to welcome the rebel fighters. An AFP photographer saw some residents set fire to a giant poster of Assad on the facade of city hall. The army admitted losing control of the city, strategically located between Aleppo and Assad's seat of power in Damascus. Defense Minister Ali Abbas insisted that the army's withdrawal was a 'temporary tactical measure.' 'Our forces are still in the vicinity,' he said in a statement carried by the official SANA news agency. 'Massive blow' Aron Lund, a fellow of the Century International think tank, called the loss of Hama 'a massive, massive blow to the Syrian government' because the army should have had an advantage there to reverse rebel gains 'and they couldn't do it.' He said HTS would now try to push on towards Homs, where many residents were already leaving on Thursday. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman reported a mass exodus from the city of members of Assad's Alawite minority community. He said tens of thousands were heading towards areas along Syria's Mediterranean coast, where the Alawites, followers of an offshoot of Shiite Islam, form the majority. 'We are afraid and worried that what happened in Hama will be repeated in Homs,' said a civil servant, who gave his name only as Abbas. 'We fear they (the rebels) will take revenge on us,' the 33-year-old said. Until last week, the war in Syria had been mostly dormant for years, but analysts have said it was bound to resume as it was never truly resolved. In a video posted online, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani said his fighters had entered Hama to 'cleanse the wound that has endured in Syria for 40 years,' referring to a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood in 1982, which led to thousands of deaths. In a later message on Telegram congratulating 'the people of Hama on their victory,' he used his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, instead of his nom de guerre for the first time. Fierce fighting The Observatory, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, said 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed in the country since the violence erupted last week. It marks the most intense fighting since 2020 in the civil war sparked by the repression of pro-democracy protests in 2011. Key to the rebels' successes since the start of the offensive last week was the takeover of Aleppo, which in more than a decade of war had never entirely fallen out of government hands. While the advancing rebels met little resistance earlier in their offensive, the fighting around Hama has been especially fierce. Assad ordered a 50% raise in career soldiers' pay, state news agency SANA reported Wednesday, as he seeks to bolster his forces for a counteroffensive. Rebels drove back the Syrian armed forces despite the fact that the government sent in 'large military convoys,' the Observatory said. The rebels launched their offensive in northern Syria on November 27, the same day a ceasefire took effect in the war between Israel and Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon. Both Hezbollah and Russia have been crucial backers of Assad's government but have been mired in their own conflicts in recent years. HTS is rooted in Syria's Al-Qaeda branch. The group has sought to moderate its image in recent years, but experts say it faces a challenge convincing Western governments it has fully renounced hardline jihadism. The United States maintains hundreds of troops in eastern Syria as part of a coalition formed against Islamic State group jihadists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-flee-fighting-in-syrian-cities-of-homs-hama/7889421.html	2024-12-06T00:55:44-08:00	
Cameroon truck drivers ask military to protect goods destined for CAR	GAROUA-BOULAI, CAMEROON — Road transport has failed to fully resume between Cameroon and the landlocked Central African Republic after a top-level crisis meeting this week to reopen borders sealed by Cameroon following escalating violence in C.A.R. Hundreds of truck drivers say they will cross into C.A.R. when government troops protect them from rebels. Several hundred truck drivers who left Cameroon's Douala seaport for Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic, say they are stranded in Garoua-Boulai, a town on Cameroon's eastern border with C.A.R. C.A.R. is a conflict-ridden landlocked country that depends on the Douala seaport for about 95% of its goods and humanitarian aid. One of the stranded truck drivers, 49-year-old Kum Innocent, said all of the drivers who have been in Garoua-Boulai for over two weeks have agreed to stop shipping goods and humanitarian assistance into C.A.R. because their lives are regularly threatened by armed gangs operating there. 'We can't enter Bangui right now because of the insecurity on the way,' he said. 'Armed gangs put [up] road barricades on the way. They even kidnap some of us, and they ask us [for] ransom. Our lorries are blocked down. Many of our merchandise [is] getting rotten, and we are losing a lot. That's what we go through when we leave Garoua-Boulai for Bangui.' Kum said that late last month, C.A.R. rebels killed a Cameroonian truck driver and abducted at least two mechanics hired to carry out truck maintenance along the Douala-Bangui road corridor. Cameroonian truck drivers say they want an immediate release of their kidnapped peers before they resume the shipment of goods to C.A.R. El Hadj Oumarou, head of Cameroon's land freight transportation bureau, said several hundred truck drivers stationed in Garoua-Boulai want assurances that the C.A.R. government will take responsibility for their security and safety, as well as the security and safety of their goods and trucks. He said the C.A.R. government is responsible for the safety of every civilian in its territory. The angry drivers refused to fully resume work after a crisis meeting Wednesday of top Cameroon and C.A.R. government and military officials in Garoua-Boulai. Officials say the crisis meeting was to plead with the striking truck drivers to resume activity. Cameroon said it had agreed to open the border. Gontrand Djono Ahaba, C.A.R. minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, attended the crisis meeting. He said he was surprised that drivers are still reluctant to ship goods and humanitarian assistance to C.A.R. Ahaba said he has informed C.A.R. President Faustin-Archange Touadéra that truck drivers along the Douala-to-Bangui road want assurances of their safety before shipping goods to C.A.R. He said Touadera has given assurances that the central African state’s military will organize convoys for drivers who feel threatened by armed gangs operating in C.A.R. and attacking truck drivers for supplies. Speaking on C.A.R. state TV on Thursday, Ahaba said the C.A.R. military had located the trucks abandoned by drivers, adding that the trucks will be restituted, but he did not say when. Cameroon’s transport minister, Jean Ernest Messena Ngale Bibehe, told Cameroon state TV on Thursday that negotiations have continued for truck drivers to suspend their protest. He assured them that C.A.R. officials have agreed to protect trucks daily and free of charge from Garoua-Boulai to Bangui and back. C.A.R. descended into violence in 2013, when a rebel group forced then-President Francois Bozize out of office. Violence among C.A.R. armed groups since then has forced close to a million Central Africans to flee to Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-truck-drivers-ask-military-to-protect-goods-destined-for-car/7889420.html	2024-12-06T00:20:51-08:00	
Trump picks former Sen. David Perdue of Georgia to be ambassador to China	WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday he is choosing former Sen. David Perdue of Georgia to be ambassador to China. Trump said in a social media post that Perdue, a former CEO, 'brings valuable expertise to help build our relationship with China.' Perdue pushed Trump's debunked lies about electoral fraud during his failed bid for Georgia governor. Perdue lost his Senate seat to Democrat Jon Ossoff four years ago and ran unsuccessfully in a primary against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Economic tensions will be a big part of the U.S.-China picture for the new administration. Trump has threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The Chinese Embassy in Washington cautioned earlier this week that there will be losers on all sides if there is a trade war. 'China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature,' embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu posted on X. 'No one will win a trade war or a #tariff war.' He added that China had taken steps in the last year to help stem drug trafficking. It is unclear whether Trump will actually go through with the threats or if he is using them as a negotiating tactic. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products. The United States is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent U.S. Census data. Trump also filled out more of his immigration team Thursday, as he promises mass deportations and border crackdowns. He said he’s nominating former Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott to head U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Scott, a career official, was appointed head of the border agency in January 2020 and enthusiastically embraced then-President Trump’s policies, particularly on building a U.S.-Mexico border wall. He was forced out by the Biden administration. Trump also said he’d nominate Caleb Vitello as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that, among other things, arrests migrants in the U.S. illegally. Vitello is a career ICE official with more than 23 years in the agency and most recently has been the assistant director for the office of firearms and tactical programs. The president-elect named the head of the Border Patrol Union, Brandon Judd, as ambassador to Chile. Judd has been a longtime supporter of Trump’s, appearing with him during his visits to the U.S.-Mexico border, though he notably supported a Senate immigration bill championed by Biden that Trump sank in part because he didn’t want to give Democrats an election-year win on the issue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-names-former-sen-david-perdue-of-georgia-to-be-ambassador-to-china-/7889367.html	2024-12-05T20:05:53-08:00	
Amnesty International accuses Israel of genocide in Gaza	LONDON — The human rights group Amnesty International accused Israel of committing acts of genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza, in a report published on Thursday. It's the first time the organization has leveled such an accusation during an active conflict. Israel strongly rejected Amnesty's claim, labeling its investigation 'fabricated.' Genocide claims Amnesty's report says that since the Hamas deadly cross-border attack on October 7, 2023, Israel 'has carried out relentless aerial and ground attacks, many of them with large explosive weapons, which have caused massive damage and flattened entire neighborhoods and cities across Gaza, along with their life-supporting infrastructure, agricultural land, and cultural and religious sites and symbols deeply engrained in Palestinians' collective memory.' 'Israel's military offensive has killed and seriously injured tens of thousands of Palestinians, including thousands of children, many of them in direct or indiscriminate attacks, often wiping out entire multigenerational families,' the report said, adding that 90% of Gaza's 2.2 million inhabitants have been forcibly displaced. '[Israel] has deliberately obstructed or denied the import and delivery of life-saving goods and humanitarian aid,' according to the report, which concludes that 'there is sufficient evidence to believe that Israel's conduct in Gaza following the 7 October 2023 amounts to genocide.' Gaza casualties More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in 14 months of fighting in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The figure does not differentiate between militants and civilians, but Hamas says the number of dead includes more than 13,000 children. 'These crimes were and continue to be deliberate actions, deliberately calculated to bring about the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza. They have also been perpetrated with total impunity. The conclusion that Israel is committing genocide is unequivocal, evidence based,' Amnesty International's Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said Wednesday in a news conference in the Netherlands. Israel's response Israel strongly denies committing genocide. Israel's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that the Amnesty report 'is entirely false and based on lies.' The Israeli military blames the high casualty rate in Gaza on Hamas, accusing its fighters of hiding in schools and hospitals and using civilians as human shields. It also disputes the casualty figures, accusing Hamas of deliberately inflating the numbers. The claims are difficult to verify as Israel has not allowed foreign journalists into the Gaza Strip since its offensive began last year. Israel also accuses Hamas of carrying out a genocidal massacre in its cross-border attacks on October 7 last year, which killed more than 1,200 people. More than 240 people were taken hostage, with over 100 still in Gaza. Israel believes around half of them are still alive. The Israeli government has consistently maintained that it is acting in self-defense and within international law against Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by most Western countries. 'We will never waver in our determination to defend our people, protect our future, and bring all of our hostages back home,' said Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, ahead of an emergency U.N. session on Gaza on Wednesday. 'Dehumanizing language' Amnesty International also cited the language used by some Israeli officials. 'Senior Israeli military and government officials intensified their calls for the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza, using racist and dehumanizing language that equated Palestinian civilians with the enemy to be destroyed,' the report said. 'In a widely publicized statement made at a press conference on 12 October 2023, President Isaac Herzog held all Palestinians in Gaza responsible for Hamas's attacks: 'It's an entire nation out there that is responsible. It's not true, this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved,'' according to the Amnesty report. That language was reflected on the battlefield, said Callamard. 'We found statements calling for genocidal acts and other crimes under international law,' she told reporters. 'We verified videos of soldiers replicating those narratives, calling for the erasure of Gaza or to make it uninhabitable.' Evidence 'daunting' The United Nations' special rapporteur to the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, said in March there are 'reasonable grounds to believe' that Israel is committing genocide. The International Court of Justice is also investigating accusations of genocide by Israel in Gaza, in a case brought by South Africa. Amnesty's report adds another layer of evidence, said Andreas Krieg, a Middle East analyst at Kings College London. 'The evidence that we have is daunting in terms of atrocities being committed, war crimes being committed, there's overwhelming evidence for ethnic cleansing, there is evidence for crimes against humanity,' Krieg told VOA. 'But to say that … this is a genocide, I'm not sure whether the NGO is able to actually establish that case,' Krieg added. 'Genocide is a contested concept that has to be established based on a tribunal. The term is being used quite loosely, in this case by an NGO.' Krieg also questioned whether the report is likely to have an immediate and palpable impact on the war in Gaza. 'There are two centers of gravity for this war in Israel, for the Israelis,' said Krieg. 'One is the support of the U.S. government. The other is domestic public opinion and the pressure on the government. I think this report will have no impact on either of these centers of gravity. It won't shape decision-making in the United States — certainly not of the [incoming] Trump administration.' Callamard of Amnesty said Wednesday that Israel's allies, including the United States, could be complicit in the alleged genocide and urged them to stop supplying weapons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7889356.html	2024-12-05T19:30:04-08:00	
Tokyo-Beijing forum aims to warm chilly relations	KYOTO, JAPAN — The Tokyo-Beijing Forum was held in person this week in Japan for the first time since it went virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the two-day forum from December 4 through 5, officials from Japan and China expressed hopes to warm their frosty relations. Analysts pointed to China sending a higher-level delegation than at past forums as a sign that Beijing wants closer trade ties with Japan. Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya attended in person, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi addressed the forum via video. Both expressed hopes for improving China-Japan relations, which cooled after Tokyo’s support for Washington’s restricted exports of advanced microchips to China amid its increasingly assertive military, and attacks this year on Japanese citizens living in China. Huang Wei-hsiu, a project researcher at the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at the University of Tokyo, told VOA Mandarin the attendance of former Finance Minister of China Lou Jiwei and former Governor of the People's Bank of China Yi Gang was a sign of China's need for better economic relations. 'Because foreign capital has been leaving, raising the level of economic officials’ attendance symbolizes China’s emphasis on the economic field with Japan,' he said. China’s economic growth has been slowing amid a slump in property prices and low domestic demand. Despite a raft of government stimulus measures, economists say it could drop below 5% growth this year. China is Japan’s top trade partner. In 2022, China exported $178 billion to Japan, while Japan’s exports to China was $135 billion. The ministry said Japan invested $3.4 billion in China in 2020, the most recent year listed, while China invested half a billion dollars directly in Japan. Cold at the bottom? Sachio Nakato, a professor of international relations at Ritsumeikan University, told VOA Mandarin that both sides want to see better relations. 'In this sense, [Japan’s] Prime Minister [Shigeru] Ishiba and [China’s] President Xi [Jinping] have the will to improve relations within the current difficult situations,' Nakato said. However, a joint survey released before the forum by Genron NPO, a Japanese think tank, and state media China International Publishing Group showed the Japanese public generally dislike China, while there is a growing sense of hostility toward Japan among the Chinese public. 'The proportion of Japanese people with a negative view of China has remained consistently above 80% since 2012,' Huang said. 'One of the factors contributing to the deterioration of the Japanese people’s views on China is the killing, detention and prosecution against Japanese nationals in China for unknown reasons,' said Professor Hiromoto Kaji of Aichi University. 'The Chinese government has not explained or responded on the motives of the perpetrators. Japanese public opinion is growing increasingly distrustful of this uncertainty,' Kaji said. Another factor is China’s restrictions on the import of Japanese food and other products since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident and release of treated water from the nuclear plant. In August 2023, China temporarily banned the import of Japanese food and feed. The public opinion survey also showed a sharp drop in the number of Chinese who believe that 'Japan-China relations are important' — from 60.1% to 26.8%, the first time it ever dropped below 60%. To address some of the tension and attract more tourist dollars, China in late November resumed 30-day visa-free travel for Japanese visiting China, which had been halted during the pandemic. But the action is so far temporary and will expire at the end of 2025 if relations between the two countries don’t improve.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tokyo-beijing-forum-aims-to-warm-chilly-relations/7889361.html	2024-12-05T19:28:58-08:00	
Biden lights National Christmas Tree	U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris attended the annual National Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony Thursday night on the Ellipse, south of the White House. 'During this season of reflection,' Biden said, 'may we continue to seek the light of liberty and love, kindness and compassion, dignity and decency.' The president said the event is a favorite of his wife's and that she was sorry to miss this year's event. First lady Jill Biden is in Qatar for her initiative on women's health. Country singing star Mickey Guyton hosted this year's event. The tree lighting was launched in 1923 when first lady Grace Coolidge allowed the District of Columbia Public Schools to erect a 48-foot balsam fir on the Ellipse. Three thousand people attended the ceremony that year when President Calvin Coolidge lit the tree, which came from Middlebury College in Vermont. This year's tree, a 30-foot red spruce from Virginia, is anchored by steel cables after strong winds blew over last year's tree. Americans from every U.S. state and territory and the District of Columbia create the one-of-a-kind ornaments that adorn the tree as it glows with thousands of lights. Trisha Yearwood, James Taylor, Stephen Sanchez and Trombone Shorty were among the musical guests who performed at this year's holiday event. The show will be broadcast on December 20 on CBS-TV.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-lights-national-christmas-tree-/7889336.html	2024-12-05T18:53:33-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon faces impeachment as key ally turns against him	Seoul, South Korea — The head of South Korea's ruling party has announced support for suspending the duties of President Yoon Suk Yeol – a stunning, last-minute move to abandon his fellow conservative leader that analysts say greatly increases the chances of Yoon's impeachment over his failed attempt at martial law. At a party meeting on Friday, People Power Party (PPP) leader Han Dong-hoon called for the 'swift suspension' of Yoon's duties, citing 'newly revealed facts' that suggest Yoon had attempted to use intelligence agencies to arrest prominent lawmakers, accusing them of being 'anti-state forces.' 'President Yoon has not acknowledged that the illegal martial law was a mistake. If President Yoon continues to carry out his duties, there is a significant risk of a recurrence of such extreme actions … which could pose a great threat to the Republic of Korea and its people,' Han said. Yoon, frustrated for months by what he saw as opposition attempts to obstruct his governance, declared martial law late Tuesday, claiming it was necessary to 'crush anti-state forces' and 'protect constitutional order.' Within hours, South Korean lawmakers overturned the decree, after fighting their way through police and military personnel who had been sent to the parliament building. Opposition lawmakers, who hold a majority in the National Assembly, plan to vote on Yoon's impeachment late Saturday. To succeed, they will need eight defections from the conservative PPP. If Yoon is impeached, he would be immediately suspended while the Constitutional Court deliberates on whether to remove him from office, a process that could take weeks or even months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-faces-impeachment-as-key-ally-turns-against-him-/7889344.html	2024-12-05T18:46:07-08:00	
Iran more comfortable with nuclear saber-rattling, US intelligence warns	WASHINGTON — Iran is likely to respond to new attacks from Israel or additional Western sanctions by edging ever closer to crossing the nuclear threshold, according to a just-released U.S. intelligence assessment. The unclassified report, issued Thursday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, finds that while Tehran is not currently poised to build a nuclear weapon, it is undertaking activities 'that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses.' The report states that since July, Iran has continued to increase its stockpiles of 20% and 60% enriched uranium while also manufacturing and operating a growing number of advanced centrifuges. The U.S. intelligence assessment further warns that Iranian officials have been increasingly willing to 'publicly discuss the utility of nuclear weapons.' 'Tehran has the infrastructure and experience to quickly produce weapons-grade uranium at multiple underground facilities, if it so chooses,' the report says. 'Iranian leaders recognize that this bolsters the credibility of threats to develop nuclear weapons.' The ODNI report estimates that Iran's existing stockpiles of enriched uranium far exceed what it needs for civilian purposes and that Tehran could build 'more than a dozen nuclear weapons if its total uranium stockpile were further enriched.' A U.S. intelligence assessment of Iran's capabilities issued this past July similarly said that officials in Tehran were becoming more comfortable talking about the use of nuclear weapons. But the new report suggests Tehran is now prepared to push back against Western pressure, attacks or other threats with more nuclear activity. 'Iran probably will consider installing or operating more advanced centrifuges, further increasing its enriched uranium stockpile, enriching uranium up to 90 percent, or threatening to withdraw from the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons,' according to the latest ODNI assessment. U.S. officials have previously warned that Tehran could produce a nuclear warhead in as little as one to two weeks, though they have also said the Pentagon has options to stop an Iranian nuclear breakout. The Iranian mission at the United Nations has yet to respond to a request for comment. U.S. intelligence analysts say that their concerns extend beyond nuclear weapons to include Iran's ballistic missile and drone capabilities. The U.S. assessment says Iran 'almost certainly is incorporating lessons learned from its missile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attack against Israel in April and from Russia's operational use of Iranian UAVs against Ukraine.' U.S. intelligence additionally 'expects Tehran will incorporate performance data from the close-range ballistic missiles it transferred to Russia once they are used in operational conditions.' And help from Russia could also boost Iran's work on multiple space-launch missiles, possibly shortening the timeline for Tehran to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, the ODNI report warns. A second unclassified intelligence report released Thursday detailed additional Iranian support for Moscow. Iran 'probably is training and assisting Russian soldiers in UAV [drone] operations,' it said, adding, 'Moscow and Tehran also have agreed to establish a joint production line in Russia for lethal UAVs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-more-comfortable-with-nuclear-saber-rattling-us-intelligence-warns/7889337.html	2024-12-05T18:32:11-08:00	
Paraguay expels Chinese envoy over Taiwan 'interference'	ASUNCION, PARAGUAY — Paraguay canceled a low-level Chinese diplomat's visa and ordered him to leave the country, Paraguay's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, after the envoy appeared to push lawmakers to reconsider Paraguay's friendly relationship with Taiwan. The Foreign Ministry accused Xu Wei of 'interference in domestic affairs,' while Taiwan's embassy in the country accused him of having 'infiltrated' Paraguay to try to undermine its relationship with Chinese-claimed Taiwan. Paraguay's ministry did not specify what Xu Wei's interference had been but said he had violated the terms of his visa after traveling to Paraguay as part of a Chinese group for a UNESCO meeting. Xu was given 24 hours to leave the country. In comments recorded at Paraguay's Congress and shared with Reuters, Xu urged Paraguay to recognize China over Taiwan, saying that the choice would benefit the soy-producing nation. Xu made the comments after meeting with two opposition lawmakers who share sympathetic views toward China. 'Having diplomatic relations with China, you can earn more, save more, lower your costs,' Xu said in the recording. 'My purpose of this visit is to promote, accelerate the process of filling the gap in the map of Paraguay. That gap is gigantic, which is called the People's Republic of China.' He added that Paraguay had to make a choice. 'There is no 'and' option. With China and Taiwan it's just 'or': China or Taiwan.' Paraguay's long-standing diplomatic support for Taiwan has held back local farmers' grain exports to China. Paraguay is the only remaining South American country with formal relations with Taiwan. China considers democratically governed Taiwan its own territory. Taipei rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future. 'This gentleman had a parallel agenda. He came to do internal politics that were not appropriate,' said Juan Baiardi, deputy minister of administration and technical affairs of Paraguay's Foreign Ministry. China's Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside normal Chinese business hours.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paraguay-expels-chinese-envoy-over-taiwan-interference-/7889308.html	2024-12-05T18:29:49-08:00	
Ethiopia's escalating conflicts leave civilians in crossfire	ADDIS ABABA / WASHINGTON — Ethiopia, home to the African Union, is grappling with intensified military operations, rebel attacks, drone strikes on villages, unverified reports of beheadings, abductions, school and hospital closures, and growing calls for peace — all unfolding simultaneously. On November 5, residents of the town of Gojam in the Amhara region were enjoying a quiet day when they heard a drone overhead. In quick succession, they said, the drone dropped bombs on a market and a health center. Locals said more than 40 people were killed. One resident told VOA's Horn of Africa Service that the bomb that hit the health center landed on a waiting room for pregnant mothers. 'It hit that room and killed five mothers and two assistants. Seven people died in that single room,' he said. Locals blame the attack on the federal government, which has been fighting Fano rebels in the region, though the government denies responsibility. The incident underscored the chaos and violence that have engulfed much of Ethiopia despite promises of peace from Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed when he took power in 2018. Abiy brought a formal end to the country's long-running conflict with Eritrea, but his time in office has been marked by ethnically driven conflicts in the Oromia, Tigray and Amhara regions, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands and the displacement of millions. A country divided internally The conflict in the Oromia region began when the Oromo Liberation Army, or OLA, refused to disarm and split from the Oromo Liberation Front, or OLF, which had returned from neighboring Eritrea after Abiy came to power. The OLA claims it is fighting for the self-determination and rights of the Oromo people. This conflict was followed by a two-year war in the Tigray region, which ended with a 2022 Cessation of Hostilities Agreement concluded in Pretoria. In the Amhara region, the conflict has been ongoing since April last year, after the government attempted to disarm regional paramilitary forces. That sparked resistance from the Fano militias, who had previously allied with the government during the brutal war in Tigray. Clashes between Ethiopia's army and Fano militias surged in October, according to the independent data collecting organization Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, or ACLED, which said drone strikes in the Amhara region have resulted in over 430 fatalities since April 2023. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said human rights abuses affected more than 8,200 victims in Ahmara and Oromia in 2023, a 56% increase over the year before. It accused state actors of responsibility for most of the incidents. The rights office also said the use of drones by the Ethiopian National Defense Force resulted in disproportionate levels of civilian casualties. The OLA is also blamed for deadly attacks, including an incident last week in which nine civilians were rounded up and killed in Arsi Zone of Oromia region. The OLA denied attacking civilians. Ethiopian Communications Service Minister Legesse Tulu denied that the government is targeting civilians, saying its actions have been falsely portrayed by media outlets that weren't identified. In a statement, Legesse said the government's actions against 'the extremist forces' in the Amhara region were 'measured and planned.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone with Abiy last month, expressing concern about the 'growing violence' in the region. Targeting of civilians denied In August 2023, Ethiopia declared a state of emergency in the Amhara region, which is home to around 23 million people. All parties involved in the conflict have been accused of human rights violations, though each has denied responsibility. Many schools in Amhara have been closed, leaving millions of children without education. On September 18, two teachers were killed in Sinan district of East Gojam, causing fear and concern among local educators. The regional administration, without naming specific groups, accused armed factions 'claiming to represent the Amhara people' of being responsible for the killings. Fano militias have also been accused of killing civilians in the Oromia region, where two attacks in June and July left a total of 39 civilians dead. They were also accused in the deaths of a judge and other civilian officials in Amhara. Eskinder Nega, a former journalist, an activist and now one of the leaders of the Fano militia, denied that the group targets civilians. 'Of course not,' he said in an interview with VOA last week. 'We are fighting the government because civilians were attacked.' Eskinder acknowledged that there are multiple factions of the Fano militia operating in the Amhara region. When asked about the group's justification for closing schools and opposing their reopening, he said it was for the safety of students and the community. Ethiopian officials, including Legesse, did not respond to repeated VOA requests for comment regarding the interview with the Fano official. An independent Ethiopian analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said the conflict in the Oromia and Amhara regions was becoming more intense and complex. 'The government mainly controls cities and towns, while the rural areas are contested by insurgents and pro-government forces,' he said. 'The government's strategy remains the same in both regions: using its military and local police to eliminate the insurgency. The OLA has remained fairly cohesive until recently. Fano, however, is highly fragmented.' Mixed results On the fifth anniversary of his Prosperity Party's foundation last week, Abiy reiterated his call for rebels to engage in peace talks. 'As I have repeatedly stated, our brothers in the Amhara and Oromia regions will not defeat us, even if they fight for a thousand years. They will not bring about change, no matter how many times they rise and fall. I once again call on them, at this esteemed conference, to abandon that path and seek peace,' he said. Just hours after his remarks, the Oromia regional government signed a peace agreement with Jaal Segni Negassa, a renegade commander of the Oromo Liberation Army who broke ties with OLA's overall commander, Jaal Marroo. OLA official Jiregna Gudeta dismissed the peace agreement, saying it was made with individuals who had been 'expelled' from the organization. In the Amhara region, the Fano militia group also rejected the government's peace efforts, calling them 'insincere.' Government officials 'believe in a military victory. Unless they change their approach fundamentally, it's very difficult to take them seriously when they speak about peace,' Eskinder said.

Dozens reported killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza	The Israeli military killed at least 39 Palestinians in strikes across Gaza, medics said on Thursday, including at least 20 people killed in an attack that set ablaze tents sheltering displaced families in a camp. Israeli strikes also hit a hospital in the north, killing a 16-year-old boy who used a wheelchair, among others, according to the hospital's director. Strikes were also reported in Gaza City, medics said. And in Rafah, near Egypt, an Israeli strike killed three Palestinians on Thursday, medics said. Three others were killed in a strike on the eastern city of Shejaia, the medics said. The strikes came as Amnesty International, in a report released Thursday, accused Israel of committing genocide in the territory. The London-based group concluded that Israel and its military have violated the 1948 U.N.-backed Genocide Convention, which defines genocide as 'acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.' The nearly 300-page report covered a nine-month period beginning in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to capture of about 250 hostages. Israel has since carried out a massive ground and aerial campaign on the Palestinian enclave. There are still about 100 hostages held in Gaza, with about one-third believed to be dead. Israel said the report was 'entirely false and based on lies' and denounced Amnesty International as a 'deplorable and fanatical organization.' Amnesty International said it came to its conclusion based on hundreds of 'dehumanizing and genocidal statements' by Israeli officials, as well as ground reports from Gaza. The report said 15 Israeli airstrikes carried out from October 2023 through April 2024 killed 334 civilians, including 141 children. Amnesty said there was no evidence that any of the strikes were directed at military objectives. The group said Israel's actions, including mass evacuation orders that have displaced most of Gaza's 2.3 million people, and the restriction of humanitarian aid deliveries are deliberately bringing about the destruction of the Palestinians through a 'slow, calculated death.' The U.S., Israel's main arms supplier, said it disagreed with the Amnesty International conclusions, with the State Department adding, 'We have said previously and continue to find that the allegations of genocide are unfounded.' Agnes Callamard, Amnesty's secretary-general, said in the report that the group's findings 'must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide.' Callamard said the United States and other nations that provide Israel with weapons are at risk of being complicit with genocide. In a statement posted on the social media platform X, Israel's Foreign Ministry slammed the report as 'fabricated' and said that it was Hamas that carried out a 'genocidal massacre' on October 7. The statement said that since then, Israel has been defending itself against 'daily attacks from seven different fronts' while 'fully in accordance with international law.' The Washington Post said it had received a statement from the Israeli military saying Amnesty's 'allegations of genocide and intentional harm are not only unfounded but also ignore Hamas' violations of international law, including its use of civilians as human shields and its deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians.' Amnesty's branch in Israel also disputed the accusations levied by its parent group, saying there was no solid evidence of genocide taking place. The Israeli office said it did not take part in the research for the report, but also said an investigation needed to be conducted into possible crimes against humanity committed by Israel. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,500 Palestinians, with more than half of those women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Israel says that the death toll includes thousands of militants it has killed. Israel says the Hamas militants frequently use residential buildings, schools and hospitals for operational cover. Hamas denies this, accusing Israeli forces of indiscriminate attacks. Amnesty's report joins a growing chorus of voices across the international community accusing Israel of human rights violations in its war on Gaza. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last month for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, including starvation as a method of warfare. South Africa has brought charges of genocide against Israel in the U.N.-backed International Court of Justice in The Hague. Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that while fighting was raging in Gaza, the fragile Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire in Lebanon was 'holding,' even as the warring parties have continued to periodically target each other with new strikes in recent days. Israel and Hezbollah have accused each other of violating the week-old truce aimed at ending 14 months of fighting that has killed thousands of people in Lebanon and sparked mass displacement of residents on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanon border. Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in late September after nearly a year of cross-border exchanges by Hezbollah in support of its ally Hamas, following the Palestinian group's October 2023 attack on Israel. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, United Kingdom and other Western countries.

Georgian opposition leader arrested, beaten unconscious as Tbilisi protests continue	Prominent Georgian opposition leader and former journalist Nika Gvaramia is recovering after being beaten unconscious by police Wednesday amid pro-Europe protests in Tbilisi, according to his lawyer. Gvaramia, head of the Akhali party under the Coalition for Change umbrella, was detained Wednesday during police searches of opposition parties’ headquarters in the Georgian capital, according to media reports. Gvaramia was repeatedly hit in the stomach until he lost consciousness before being dragged into a police vehicle, according to local media reports. Gvaramia is Georgia’s former justice minister and the founder of the pro-opposition broadcaster Mtavari Arkhi. He was jailed from 2022 to 2023 on charges he and press freedom experts rejected as retaliatory. The high-profile arrest comes amid protests that have been continuing since the ruling Georgian Dream party said it was halting the country’s bid to start talks on joining the European Union. Opinion polls show that about 80% of Georgians support joining the EU. Gvaramia’s lawyer, Dito Sadzaglishvili, said Thursday that Gvaramia’s health is now 'satisfactory.' 'He believes that now, of course, is the time for the Georgian people to calmly, firmly and courageously continue to protest and fight against the Russian regime,' the lawyer said, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Gvaramia was arrested for 'petty hooliganism' and not complying with police orders, his lawyer said. A court hearing is expected to take place within 48 hours of his arrest, according to Sadzaglishvili. Police have also detained Aleko Elisashvili, a leader of the Strong Georgia opposition party, as well as a leader of the youth protest movement, and at least six other members of opposition parties. The detentions come as thousands of pro-EU protesters continue to gather in Tbilisi, even as police respond with water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets. More than 330 protesters have been arrested, with rights groups saying many have been beaten in detention. Governments, including the United States, have condemned the excessive use of force and criticized Georgian Dream for putting EU accession on hold. Journalists attacked, NGOs raided At least 50 journalists have been injured during violent police dispersals of demonstrations since they began on November 28, according to multiple reports. 'The protection of journalists is a hallmark of democratic societies,' Gulnoza Said, the Europe and Central Asia program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement. 'Georgian authorities’ failure to address the extensive and shocking police violence against journalists covering ongoing mass protests signals a clear departure from democratic values,' Said added. In addition to raiding the offices of opposition parties, police have raided the offices of various nongovernmental organizations, according to local media reports. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the Georgian Dream party said the raids targeted those who fostered violence during protests in an effort to overturn his government. 'I wouldn’t call this repression; it is more of a preventive measure than repression,' he said. Protests initially erupted in late October after a contested election that allowed the Georgian Dream party to remain in power, even as monitoring groups said the vote was marked by an array of violations. Opposition parties and rights groups accuse Georgian Dream of pushing Georgia — which was once lauded as among the freest former Soviet republics — away from the West and closer to Russia. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili refused to recognize the official election results and contested them in the constitutional court, which rejected her appeal on Tuesday. Gvaramia warned that the elections would be rigged when he spoke with VOA last October. 'Either we have democracy on the ground, or we are Russia. There is no third option from my perspective,' Gvaramia told VOA at the time. Last year, Gvaramia was recognized with an International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists in New York. 'Democracy will never die,' he told VOA last year. 'I don’t need anything except democracy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-opposition-leader-arrested-beaten-unconscious-as-tbilisi-protests-continue/7888983.html	2024-12-05T15:29:05-08:00	
Rights groups, Western governments urge Azerbaijan to release human rights defender	Baku, Azerbaijan / Washington — International rights organizations and Western governments are calling on the Azerbaijani government to release prominent human rights defender Rufat Safarov. 'The arrest of Rufat Safarov on trumped-up fraud and hooliganism charges is another glaring example of the Azerbaijani authorities' relentless efforts to silence dissenting voices in the country,' Amnesty International said in a Wednesday statement. Safarov, a former prosecutor who heads the Defense Line human rights organization, was detained Tuesday and charged with fraud and hooliganism. He has been put on four months of pretrial detention. Azerbaijan's Ministry of Internal Affairs told VOA that Safarov's detention was related to a conflict between him and an individual over a land purchase. However, in a statement on social media written at his request, Safarov attributed his detention to being nominated for a human rights award in the United States. 'I was supposed to travel to the United States in two days because I had been recognized as the 'Human Rights Defender of the Year,' ' the statement reads. 'From the outset, I express my deep gratitude to U.S. Ambassador Mr. [Mark] Libby, for nominating me, and to U.S. Secretary of State Mr. [Antony] Blinken for supporting my candidacy.' U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has confirmed that Safarov was due to meet with several senators next week to receive the State Department's Human Rights Defender Award. 'But the Azeri regime jailed him on bogus charges,' Cardin wrote on X. 'His fight for justice transcends prison walls. He must be released immediately.' Libby called on the Azerbaijani government to release all those unjustly imprisoned and to abide by its international human rights obligations. The ambassador spoke Thursday at an event organized in the capital, Baku, which was also attended by the ambassadors of Britain, the European Union and Switzerland, as well as Azerbaijani human rights defenders, members of the civil society and public activists. The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry on Wednesday denounced criticism by the ambassadors, calling their comments an interference with the country's judicial system. 'We strongly reject the claims of the ambassadors of the U.S., U.K., Switzerland and the European Union regarding the detention of 'journalists' and 'political activists' in Azerbaijan. These statements are a clear attempt to undermine the independence of the Azerbaijani judicial system,' the ministry said in a statement. Rapporteurs at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe have called Safarov's arrest another example of a growing crackdown on human rights defenders and activists in Azerbaijan. 'This alarming development is part of an ongoing pattern of repressing critical voices and targeting those speaking up to defend fundamental freedoms and democratic values,' Thorhildur Sunna Aevarsdottir and Emanuelis Zingeris said in a statement. The head of the opposition Musavat Party, Isa Gambar, condemned Safarov's arrest and called the charges against him politically motivated. 'It aims to both hamper and halt his activities, and to once again threaten the society by using him. This is unacceptable,' he told VOA, calling on authorities to release Safarov and all other political prisoners. Azer Gasimli, head of Azerbaijan’s Institute of Political Management, believes there are only a handful of human rights defenders left in Azerbaijan who are not behind bars. 'The government has declared a war on the nation, on its active and enlightened part. On the one hand, it drowns people with social problems, tramples on their rights. And on the other hand, it tries to destroy dignified members of the society. I know, without doubt, that sooner or later, the people will win in this fight,' he told VOA. Bahruz Maharramov, a member of the Azerbaijani Parliament, told VOA that Safarov's detention and criminal prosecution are being carried out in compliance with all the procedural requirements and in accordance with the law. 'A person's position, beliefs, affiliation with political or other public associations, or being a social media phenomenon cannot exempt them from legal responsibility,' Maharramov said. Safarov resigned from the Zardab District Prosecutor's Office in 2015 after accusing the Azerbaijani authorities of human rights violations and lawlessness. He was subsequently arrested on charges of accepting bribes, which he denied, and was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2016. He was later pardoned by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and released in 2019. This story originated in VOA's Azerbaijani Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-community-calls-on-azerbaijan-to-release-human-rights-defender/7888986.html	2024-12-05T15:09:31-08:00	
Emerging anti-US axis worrisome but 'not acting as a bloc'	WASHINGTON — Washington's most dangerous adversaries may be working together more closely than ever before, but U.S. intelligence analysts think that for now, they are falling short of forming a tight-knit alliance that could more effectively counter the United States. Concerns among the United States and its allies about growing cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have been increasing steadily since Moscow launched its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine — sustained by intelligence showing Beijing, Tehran and Pyongyang providing Russia with technology, missiles, drones and even troops for the war effort. The former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific earlier this year went as far as to describe the growing ties between the four U.S. adversaries as a nascent 'axis of evil.' Yet U.S. intelligence officials believe the axis, in some ways, has been bogged down by its own shortcomings. 'They're not acting as a bloc,' said Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, speaking Thursday in Washington at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'We don't see them as a sort of four-part alliance or something along those lines,' she said. 'We don't see them likely as becoming allies in the same way that we are allies with our NATO partners, for example — that kind of level of interoperability and military collaboration.' U.S. intelligence analysts, however, still see the axis as a concern on several fronts. Haines said the increased cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea has contributed to a further erosion of international norms around weapons of mass destruction. Where Russia and China were once more willing to cooperate with the United States and the West on nuclear counterproliferation, Moscow and Beijing now seem more inclined to give Iran and North Korea additional leeway. 'In large part, that's because Russia is now beholden to some extent to both the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] and to Iran for advanced weapons, for ammunition, for things that they need in the context of their fight with Ukraine,' Haines said. 'They're less likely to push back,' she said. 'And of course, we've been watching the degree to which they actually, for example, accept DPRK as a nuclear weapon power.' Haines said the increased cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea has helped all four countries to evade sanctions. And she said there are even some indications that Russia is willing to take action that would allow Beijing to surpass the U.S. in critical areas. 'They're willing to potentially put more on the table with China to give them things that could actually make China sort of leapfrog in certain technology areas or in other spaces that are of concern to us,' Haines said. Washington's NATO allies have sounded similar alarms in recent months, with some NATO officials telling VOA the axis has already sparked the beginnings of a new global arms race. Russian sabotage There are also ongoing concerns about the willingness of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea to engage in so-called gray zone activity. A declassified U.S. National Intelligence Estimate issued in July warned that the next five to six years are 'likely to feature more frequent, diverse and damaging acts of coercion and subversion — particularly by China, Iran, Russia and North Korea — below what constitutes armed conflict but outside the bounds of historically legitimate statecraft.' Haines on Thursday said Russian gray zone activities — including efforts at sabotage in Europe — have been 'increasing across the board.' 'Russia has just invested money, personnel, just an extraordinary amount of effort in this area and just will continue to do so,' she said. 'And even though we are getting a little better at disrupting some of this activity, we're certainly not, I think, where it makes anybody really comfortable.' US presidential transition U.S. intelligence analysts are keeping a close watch on how other countries are behaving as Washington prepares for President-elect Donald Trump to take office in January. 'There are certain actors that are trying to pre-position themselves for a next administration,' Haines said. She said intelligence analysts are preparing reports on the activity to share with the incoming Trump administration, as well as keeping an eye out for the potential that some countries may seek to escalate tensions during the transition period. 'Typically, for example, the DPRK engages in some provocative action during transitions,' Haines said. 'This is sort of one of the classic things we're constantly looking at.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/emerging-anti-us-axis-worrisome-but-not-acting-as-a-bloc-/7888967.html	2024-12-05T14:27:49-08:00	
Interpol operation seizes 3,400 bombs in South America	The International Criminal Police Organization — or Interpol — announced Thursday that an operation involving law enforcement from nine South American countries has resulted in the arrest of 45 people and the seizure of more than 3,000 homemade bombs and tons of explosive material linked to regional criminal groups. The collaborative effort, known as Operation Claymore, was carried out August 11 to October 11 and focused on the illegal flow of chemicals and other components used to make explosives in South America, according to a statement. Interpol said it had seen a particularly high trade in the materials in the region and found it to be closely linked to organized crime and armed groups. The organization said improvised explosive devices, also known as IEDs, are used for a range of criminal activities, from terrorist attacks and territorial violence to robberies and strikes on security forces. Because of their unpredictability and anonymity, the group said, IEDs are frequently used to inflict maximum harm and devastation while instilling fear and chaos. Interpol said the operation led police in Ecuador to a site where a criminal organization was found storing eight blocks of C-4 explosives, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, hand grenades and heroin. The C-4 explosives are malleable or flexible and are a particularly deadly component of IEDs. In Colombia, the investigation led police to raid an improvised explosives factory, yielding 3,000 IEDs and 5 tons of explosive materials and other equipment. Interpol said two people were arrested in that raid, including one person identified as a bombmaker for an armed organization. The operation also led to the arrest of a suspect in Argentina wanted in connection with the detonation of an IED at a private residence in the United States that seriously injured two people. As well as organized crime, Interpol said, the illicit trade of explosive materials in South America can also be linked to illegal mining. The activity not only has devastating environmental effects but also puts the lives of workers and local communities at risk. Operation Claymore led to the arrest of 22 people and the seizure of 16 tons of explosive material at a site in Peru. In the statement, Interpol Secretary-General Valdecy Urquiza said, 'The black-market trade in explosive materials is a major security risk. We're seeing a disturbing rise in terror groups, organized crime and gangs using explosives — from violent attacks to illegal mining operations.' He said the operation in South America shows they are making progress, 'but the threat is real, and global.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/interpol-operation-seizes-3-400-bombs-in-south-america/7888915.html	2024-12-05T13:36:01-08:00	
At America’s oldest pet cemetery, humans spend eternity with faithful companions	HARTSDALE, NEW YORK — On most days, Mark Lindenberg either drives by or walks over to visit with Boots, his beloved pet cat who died in August 2020 at the age of 17. The New York man had his black-and-white tuxedo cat buried at the Hartsdale Pet Cemetery, a picturesque spot with rolling, grassy hills near the main road. The epitaph on Boots’ tombstone reads, 'You taught me how to love and be loved.' Other tombstones are engraved with phrases such as 'A truer friend we never had' and 'Our beloved queen.' 'Human cemeteries are sad,' Lindenberg says. 'This is one of the most cheerful places. When you look at the love that goes behind every plot here — the sayings, the toys, the pinwheels — it's just, I can't think of a better place.' Hartsdale is America’s oldest working pet cemetery and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Lindenberg says he paid about $7,000 to bury Boots at Hartsdale. Those costs include the plot, casket, tombstone, burial and site maintenance in perpetuity. 'What have I worked for if I'm not going to do the things that matter most, and this mattered most,' Lindenberg says. 'I got instant closure the day I decided I was going to bury her here.' Pet burials started in Hartsdale in 1896 when veterinarian Samuel Johnson allowed a client to bury her dog in his apple orchard, a hillside spot located about 30 kilometers north of New York City. Since then, about 70,000 animals have been laid to rest in the 2-hectare cemetery. Most of the pets buried at Hartsdale are cats and dogs, but there are a few more exotic animals. 'There's reptiles that are buried here. Mice,' says Edward Martin III, vice president of the Hartsdale Pet Cemetery. 'There's a lion cub that was buried here in 1912 by a Russian princess. There's the ashes of Ming, who's a Bengal tiger that was buried here a few years ago. There are some monkeys.' There’s also Hudson the horse, some birds and singer Mariah Carey’s cat, Clarence. The oldest headstone, dating to 1898, commemorates the life of a dog named Blague. Martin runs the place alongside his father, Edward Martin Jr., who purchased the cemetery in 1974. The younger Martin is a lawyer and certified public accountant, who eventually opted to help oversee the cemetery, where he once worked as a teenager. 'I've seen what people go through, and they lose their pets, and I feel like I'm in a good position where I can help them,' he says. 'And I have helped them, and it makes me want to continue helping them.' Between 250 and 300 burials are conducted at Hartsdale each year. The cemetery never runs out of space because not all of the graves are permanent. People can pay a one-time forever maintenance fee of $3,500 or an annual fee of $105. If the annual fee stops being paid, that gravesite is eventually offered for sale. 'The pet in the grave will be removed from that plot so someone else who wants it can pay the maintenance. And the pets are taken out, and they're cremated, and they don't leave the cemetery,' says Martin Jr., Hartsdale’s president. 'Their remains are scattered over the cemetery grass.' A centerpiece at the cemetery is the war dog memorial at the top of a hill. Unveiled in 1923, the monument was originally dedicated to World War I service dogs. But these days, the memorial honors service dogs of all kinds. Although Hartsdale is primarily a resting place for animals, the cremated remains of about 800 humans are buried here with their pets. There’s even a Martin family plot, where the elder Martin plans to eventually be laid to rest with other relatives. 'I have to be buried somewhere. And why would I go to any place other than this?' he says. 'My mother and father, and my mother-in-law or father-in-law are buried here, and so, that's a good reason by itself to do it.' Lindenberg also likes the idea. He has already arranged to be cremated and buried alongside Boots when the time comes. 'I'm single. I don't know if I'll ever get married, and I can't think of a better place,' he says. 'I lived with my cat every day for almost 17 years. Why stop now?' In the meantime, Lindenberg, who lives a 10-minute walk away, will continue to visit his old friend almost daily.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-america-s-oldest-pet-cemetery-humans-spend-eternity-with-faithful-companions-/7888899.html	2024-12-05T13:25:07-08:00	
At America’s oldest pet cemetery, humans spend eternity with faithful companions	Americans love their pets, and nowhere is that more apparent than at the oldest pet cemetery in the United States. More than 70,000 animals have been buried at the Hartsdale Pet Cemetery, located about 30 kilometers outside of New York City. Grieving owners often pay thousands of dollars to lay their pets to rest. And sometimes, as VOA’s Dora Mekouar reports, the owners make plans to eventually join them.

Indigenous Kenyan men campaign against female genital mutilation	NAIROBI, KENYA — Naomi Kolian recounts the ordeal at her parents' house at the age of 13. Kolian, now a mother of five, said her parents arranged for her genital mutilation during a school break. She had just taken her national examination. ''They stripped off my clothes, poured cold water on me. I passed out,' she said. 'When I recovered, I realized that a certain woman was already cutting me, out of pain I tried to jump so they tied both of my legs with ropes.'' As of 2021, at least 14.8% of Kenyan women like Kolian had undergone female genital mutilation, or FGM, according to the Britain-based FGM/C Research Initiative; 45.6% are cut between 5 and 9 years of age. It is seen as a rite of passage for girls and considered a compulsory step before marriage. Now men are stepping up to end the practice. Through a movement called 'MenEndFGM,' they are educating others on the dangers of FGM and sensitizing communities where cultural norms and traditions such as FGM run deep. The movement's executive director, Tony Mwebia, said most men in the communities that support FGM are ignorant of what the cut entails and are always providing resources and guarding the FGM ceremonies. ''As MenEndFGM, what we do is we go and have conversations with men,' said Mwebia. 'We show the visual materials, we use a lot of chats, we use videos, photos of complications in labor wards.'' At least 600 men like Noah Sampeke, a senior chief in Kenya's Kajiado County, have joined the movement that started as an online campaign. Sampeke said he regrets keeping the tradition of marrying only women that have undergone the cut. Sampeke said he comes from a community where 'it was compulsory for women to get the cut and if she got pregnant without the cut, she was considered an outcast. But now I will not force my girls to get the cut.'' In November, Kenyan women's rights activists began 16 days of activism against Gender Based Violence, among which female genital mutilation is the most egregious violation, according to advocates. They said a collective movement for change is crucial. Ajra Mohamed is country representative for Nguvu Collective, a women's advocacy group. ''They might [say] that because we have very strict regulations, people will avoid FGM, while on the ground, people are actually hiding it and community leaders are supporting that,' said Mohamed. 'So, if you have connected them with grassroots activists, they will be able to inform them to be the whistleblowers.'' Kenya ratified the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act in 2011 and established an anti-FGM board, an agency that spearheads campaigns to eradicate FGM. The agency's CEO, Bernadette Loloju, told VOA that the board is promoting alternative rites of passage such as training girls into adulthood without a cut. FGM rates slightly declined from 21% to 15% in a 2022 demographic health survey. Officials believe that the approach of incorporating men will help eradicate FGM.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indigenous-kenyan-men-campaign-against-female-genital-mutilation-/7888868.html	2024-12-05T13:06:28-08:00	
Pakistan court charges ex-PM Khan with instigating violence against military	islamabad — An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan indicted jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and several close associates Thursday for allegedly inciting supporters to attack military installations during anti-government protests in 2023. The special tribunal convened the hearing and announced the indictment at Adiala Jail, the detention facility near Islamabad where Khan has been incarcerated for more than a year in connection with various legal proceedings and charges against him. The 72-year-old former prime minister and his co-defendants asserted their innocence of Thursday’s charges stemming from the violent protests that occurred on May 9, 2023. The nationwide demonstrations, spearheaded by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party, erupted in response to his brief arrest on corruption allegations. The ensuing clashes with riot police resulted in the deaths of at least 10 protesters. Authorities also accused PTI supporters of attacking and ransacking key state buildings and military facilities, including the General Headquarters, or GHQ, in Rawalpindi. Local media quoted the public prosecutor as arguing before the court Thursday that pressuring the government through violent protests 'falls under the category of terrorism' and that the attack on the GHQ 'was carried out with the intention of inciting the Pakistani army to revolt.' Khan and his party have consistently accused state intelligence agency operatives of infiltrating protests and orchestrating the May 9 violence against military installations to justify a subsequent monthslong security crackdown against the PTI and a roundup of hundreds of its members. Dozens of detainees also have been handed over to military custody in connection with the riots, as reported by relatives of the detainees. A statement from the PTI expressed confidence Thursday in its legal team’s ability to challenge the indictment in appropriate courts, 'and hopefully justice will be served.' Khan, prime minister from 2018 to 2022, has been entangled in dozens of legal proceedings and prosecutions since his ouster from power through an opposition parliamentary vote of no confidence. He asserts that the legal challenges are fabricated charges intended to prevent his return to politics at the behest of Pakistan’s powerful military, a charge the government denies. In August 2023, the cricket star-turned-prime minister was sentenced and arrested in a corruption case he dismissed as politically motivated. Subsequently, in several other lawsuits, Khan was convicted and sentenced to multiple prison terms just days before parliamentary elections in February 2024. Appeals courts have overturned or suspended all his convictions and sentences, citing a lack of evidence or trial transparency. However, authorities have prevented Khan from leaving the prison by launching new charges against him each time a court orders his release on bail. Last month, the police notified a federal high court that more than 70 cases had been registered against Khan in Islamabad alone. In the run-up to general elections on February 8, 2024, Pakistan’s election commission, through disputed rules, blocked the PTI from contesting the vote. Candidates nominated by Khan were eventually compelled to contest the elections as independents and secured the highest number of seats, primarily owing to his growing popularity. Nevertheless, their tally fell short of the threshold required to establish a government independently. The PTI has staged repeated nationwide street protests to demand Khan’s release from what it asserts is 'unlawful' detention. It also has called for the resignation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government, contending that it is an outcome of rigged elections and the PTI’s 'stolen mandate.' Late last month, Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, the former first lady, led thousands of supporters into Islamabad to advocate for their demands. The government carried out a crackdown on November 26 to disperse what the PTI called a 'peaceful protest' march. The ensuing clashes resulted in the deaths of at least 12 protesters, according to PTI leaders and relatives of several victims. They say most of the victims were killed by gunfire from law enforcement personnel, while hundreds of others sustained bullet wounds. Pakistani officials have persistently denied the allegations, asserting that no protesters were killed. They say security forces did not use 'firearms' and instead employed tear gas and rubber bullets. The government has accused protesters of ramming a vehicle into security force members, resulting in the deaths of four of them. However, the charges have been disputed by PTI officials and journalists covering the protest march both for local and foreign media. 'The government had shown restraint, as law enforcement agencies were only equipped with water cannons and tear gas, not live ammunition,' Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Wednesday in an unusual meeting with foreign diplomats in Islamabad. The state TV broadcast live parts of his speech to foreign guests, including envoys from the United States, China, Britain and Japan. The meeting to address a domestic political crisis was a first in Pakistan's diplomatic history, a foreign ministry official told VOA anonymously because of the lack of authority to discuss the matter with the media. Critics argued that the unusual briefing to foreign diplomats reflected increasing pressure on the Pakistani government following the violent crackdown on the opposition party, the country’s largest and most popular political force.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-court-charges-ex-pm-khan-with-instigating-violence-against-military/7888857.html	2024-12-05T12:29:52-08:00	
France's Macron to serve out office term, name new prime minister soon	PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron vowed Thursday to stay in office until the end of his term, due in 2027, and announced that he will name a new prime minister within days following the resignation of ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier. Macron came out fighting a day after a historic no-confidence vote at the National Assembly left France without a functioning government. He laid blame at the door of his opponents on the far right for bringing down Barnier's government. They chose 'Not to do but to undo,' he said. 'They chose disorder.' The president said the far right and the far left had united in what he called 'an anti-Republican front' and stressed: 'I won't shoulder other people's irresponsibility.' He said he'd name a new prime minister within days but gave no hints who that might be. Earlier in the day, Macron 'took note' of Barnier's resignation, the Elysee presidential palace said in a statement. Barnier and other ministers will be 'in charge of current affairs until the appointment of a new government,' the statement said. The no-confidence motion passed by 331 votes in the National Assembly, forcing Barnier to step down after just three months in office — the shortest tenure of any prime minister in modern French history. Macron faces the critical task of naming a replacement capable of leading a minority government in a parliament where no party holds a majority. Yael Braun-Pivet, president of the National Assembly and a member of Macron's party, urged the president to move quickly. 'I recommend he decide rapidly on a new prime minister,' Braun-Pivet said Thursday on France Inter radio. 'There must not be any political hesitation. We need a leader who can speak to everyone and work to pass a new budget bill.' The process may prove challenging. Macron's administration has yet to confirm any names, though French media have reported a shortlist of centrist candidates who might appeal to both sides of the political spectrum. Macron took more than two months to appoint Barnier after his party's defeat in June's legislative elections, raising concerns about potential delays this time. The no-confidence vote has galvanized opposition leaders, with some explicitly calling for Macron's resignation. 'I believe that stability requires the departure of the President of the Republic,' said Manuel Bompard, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, on BFM TV Wednesday night. Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, whose party holds the most seats in the Assembly, stopped short of calling for Macron's resignation but warned that 'the pressure on the President of the Republic will get stronger and stronger.' Macron, however, has dismissed such calls and ruled out new legislative elections. The French constitution does not call for a president to resign after his government was ousted by the National Assembly. 'I was elected to serve until 2027, and I will fulfill that mandate,' he told reporters earlier this week. The constitution also says that new legislative elections cannot be held until at least July, creating a potential stalemate for policymakers. The political instability has heightened concerns about France's economy, particularly its debt, which could rise to 7% of GDP next year without significant reforms. Analysts say that Barnier's government downfall could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-macron-to-serve-out-office-term-name-new-prime-minister-soon-/7888797.html	2024-12-05T11:41:34-08:00	
Earthquake strikes off California; tsunami warning issued	EUREKA, CALIFORNIA — A strong earthquake was felt widely across Northern California on Thursday and authorities have issued a tsunami warning. The quake struck at 10:44 a.m. local time, west of Ferndale, a small city in coastal Humboldt County near the Oregon border, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was felt as far south as San Francisco, where residents felt a rolling motion for several seconds. It was followed by smaller aftershocks.

US judge rejects Boeing's plea deal in conspiracy case stemming from fatal plane crashes	DALLAS — A federal judge on Thursday rejected a deal that would have allowed Boeing to plead guilty to a felony conspiracy charge and pay a fine for misleading U.S. regulators about the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed, killing 346 people. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas creates uncertainty around the criminal prosecution of the aerospace giant in connection with the development of its bestselling airline plane. Boeing and the Justice Department could try to negotiate a new plea agreement. The Justice Department and Boeing did not comment immediately. Paul Cassell, an attorney for families of passengers who died in the crashes, called the ruling an important victory for the rights of crime victims. 'No longer can federal prosecutors and high-powered defense attorney craft backroom deals and just expect judges to approve them,' Cassell said. 'Judge O'Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns — holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.' Many relatives of the passengers who died in the crashes, which took place off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia less than five months apart, have spent years pushing for a public trial, the prosecution of former company officials and more severe financial punishment for Boeing. The deal the judge rejected would have let Boeing plead guilty to defrauding regulators who approved pilot training requirements for the 737 Max nearly a decade ago. Prosecutors did not allege Boeing's deception played a role in the crashes. The Justice Department first charged Boeing in January 2021 with defrauding Federal Aviation Administration regulators who approved pilot training requirements for the 737 Max. The department simultaneously announced it would drop the charge after three years if the company stayed out of trouble and paid a $2.5 billion settlement — mostly money the company would have paid airline customers anyway due to the FAA grounding the 737 Max fleet for 20 months. Families of the victims were outraged. O'Connor ruled last year that the Justice Department broke a victims-rights law by not telling relatives that it was negotiating with Boeing, but said he had no power to overturn the deal. The 2021 deferred-prosecution agreement was due to expire when a door plug blew off a 737 Max early this year during an Alaska Airlines flight over Oregon. The incident renewed concerns about manufacturing quality at Boeing and put the company under intense scrutiny. After determining that Boeing had violated terms of the 2021 settlement, the Justice Department revived its prosecution of the conspiracy charge. That led to new negotiations and the plea deal that O'Connor rejected. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly deceiving the FAA about how much training pilots would need before flying the Max. Boeing had downplayed the significance of a new flight-control system called MCAS. Acting on Boeing's incomplete disclosures, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training instead of more intensive training in flight simulators. Simulator training would have increased the cost for airlines to operate the Max and might have pushed some to buy planes from rival Airbus instead. Because of Boeing's actions, airlines and pilots didn't even know about MCAS until it was implicated in the first crash, in 2018 in the Java Sea. Despite knowing about MCAS, Ethiopian Airlines pilots were unable to control the system and prevent another crash in 2019 near Addis Ababa. Prosecutors told the judge the conspiracy charge was the toughest they could prove against Boeing. Crucially, the Justice Department said that if the case went to trial, it would not present any evidence that Boeing's deception caused the crashes. The plea agreement included a fine of up to $487.2 million but would give/have given Boeing credit for $243.6 million in penalties it paid as part of the 2021 settlement. Under the deal, Boeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, also would invest $455 million in compliance and safety programs, and be placed on probation and overseen by an independent monitor for three years. At an October 11 hearing, Boeing lawyer Ben Hatch defended the plea deal, saying Boeing 'is a pillar of the national economy and the national defense' and needed to know its punishment before agreeing to plead guilty. The lawyer's argument stunned relatives of the victims, who were in the courtroom. 'Boeing is too important for the economy — they're too big to jail. That's what he's saying,' said Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in the second crash. 'It allows them to kill people with no consequences because they're too big and because their shareholders won't like it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-rejects-boeing-s-plea-deal-in-a-conspiracy-case-stemming-from-fatal-plane-crashes-/7888754.html	2024-12-05T11:16:06-08:00	
Displaced Syrian Kurds face dire conditions amid intensified fighting	Humanitarian aid efforts are underway for tens of thousands of Syrians displaced by a surge in fighting between rebels and the government in northwest Syria. Many of the internally displaced persons, or IDPs, come from the Aleppo, Afrin and Shahba regions and are fleeing to Raqqa and Tabqa in the north and east of Syria. Resources are stretched thin, though, according to an official from the Kurdish Red Crescent in the region and an official from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, or AANES. The IDPs, who are mostly Kurds, are at risk not only from the fighting and airstrikes but also reported death threats. Syrian opposition groups launched their campaign hoping to take over Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city, which had been under the control of the Syrian army. A member of the Kurdish Red Crescent Refugee Council in Tabqa, Ahmed Ibrahim, says that, so far more than 100,000 IDPs have taken very dangerous routes to reach Raqqa and Tabqa. 'Due to the threat of massacre by jihadists, the fleeing of civilians to Raqqa and Tabqa continues. According to our initial data, the number of people who have arrived has exceeded 100,000, most of whom are women and children,' he told VOA. Ibrahim stressed that his group is expecting the number of fleeing civilians to increase in the coming days. He explained that his organization, Red Crescent, is mobilizing all of its resources to meet the most urgent and vital needs of IDPs. 'We have mobilized our health teams to provide basic health services even with very limited resources, because people are arriving after a very tough journey, in freezing weather, under harsh and unsafe conditions, ' he said. Ibrahim stated that most of the IDPs have been placed in local schools by AANES, while Kurdish Red Crescent has set up more than 150 tents. He said his organization provides food, clean water, winter clothes and blankets for the IDPs. But the combination of limited resources, freezing temperatures and high numbers of arrivals means current assistance is far below what is needed. 'Most of them remain outside or in cars for 48 to 72 hours, including children and the elderly. There is no room for them, until a shelter has been set up or we can arrange for a family to host them,' Ibrahim said. Ibrahim urges international humanitarian aid organizations to help meet the immediate needs of the IDPs. Several armed insurgency groups are involved in the latest offensive in northwest Syria. Leading the effort is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, formerly a branch of the al-Nusra Front Syria, until 2017, when it was designated as a terrorist organization globally and changed its name. The Syrian National Army, or SNA, is the second main group in the offensive, an umbrella organization of several Turkish-backed groups. The Rojava Information Center, or RIC, is an independent, volunteer-staffed organization based in northeast Syria. It issued a report Wednesday announcing that the Sheikh Maqsood and Ashrafiyeh neighborhoods remain under siege by HTS, facing imminent assault. More than 100,000 civilians live in these areas, which are primarily Kurdish. Sheikhmous Ahmad, co-chair of the Office of IDPs and Refugees Affairs of the AANES, said Wednesday that his group had received more than 30,000 IDP families, totaling more than 120,000 people, from the town Shahba region and northern Aleppo. 'Autonomous Administration has suspended education in Raqqa and Tabqa to provide temporary shelters to host our people who sought safe refuge. Also, two reception centers have been set up, in addition to the tent camps, and gymnasium,' Ahmad told VOA. He highlighted that all institutions of AANES are working with all of their resources to meet the IDPs’ vital needs, such as health services, beds, clean water, stoves and gas, but he said their current resources are not sufficient. 'The international community should pay more attention to gravity of the situation,' he said. The ANNES official criticized the lack of adequate support from international aid organizations and issued a reminder about an 'urgent humanitarian appeal' that his administration announced on Tuesday. Quoting from that appeal, he said, 'Providing emergency aid is crucial to saving lives and alleviating human suffering. So, we urge on all relevant parties to urgently support our humanitarian work on the ground.' David Carden, the U.N. deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, visited Idlib this week to assess the situation. 'More than 115,000 people have now been newly displaced across Idlib and northern Aleppo,' he told Agence France-Presse afterward. The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria Chairman Paulo Pinheiro urged all parties involved in the war to uphold the protection of civilians, human rights and the Geneva Conventions. U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen also announced that he would soon go to the region to speak with senior officials and seek a de-escalation. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/displaced-syrian-kurds-face-dire-conditions-amid-intensified-fighting-/7888678.html	2024-12-05T10:25:13-08:00	
UN chief: Time for serious negotiations in Syria	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday that developments in Syria over the last week are 'grave and dramatic,' and it is 'high time' for all parties in the country to 'engage seriously' to resolve the nearly 14-year-long conflict. 'Tens of thousands of civilians are at risk in a region already on fire,' Guterres told reporters. 'We are seeing the bitter fruits of a chronic collective failure of previous de-escalation arrangements to produce a genuine nationwide ceasefire or a serious political process to implement Security Council resolutions. This must change.' On November 27, multiple rebel groups aligned under the leadership of U.N.-designated terror group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, launched their biggest challenge in years to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. They swept into Aleppo, which the government had held since 2016, stunning the Syrian army and capturing the airport, a military academy and much of the city. They also took towns and villages in Idlib governorate, and on Thursday were reported to be inside the central city of Hama. The United Nations says that tens of thousands of people have been displaced in northwest Syria in the latest fighting. Guterres said he had just spoken by telephone with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey backs the rebel Syrian National Army, or SNA, and also has taken in millions of Syrian refugees since the war began in 2011. 'I emphasized the urgent need for immediate humanitarian access to all civilians in need, and a return to the U.N.-facilitated political process to end the bloodshed,' Guterres said he told the Turkish leader. The secretary-general told reporters it is time 'to chart a new, inclusive and comprehensive approach' to ending the war. 'In other words, restoring Syria’s sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity — and meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people,' he said. Guterres urged the parties to recommit to a nearly 10-year-old Security Council resolution that calls for U.N.-facilitated dialogue and to 'engage seriously' with his Special Envoy Geir Pedersen. Pedersen warned in a briefing to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that without de-escalation and a swift move to talks, 'Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration and destruction.' Syria’s civil war grew out of peaceful anti-government protests that the Assad regime brutally sought to put down. It has spawned a massive humanitarian crisis, with some 7 million Syrians internally displaced and more than 5 million living as refugees outside the country. The U.N. humanitarian office said that 16.7 million Syrians this year are expected to require assistance — the largest number since the beginning of the crisis in 2011.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-time-for-serious-negotiations-in-syria-/7888644.html	2024-12-05T10:02:35-08:00	
US Secret Service chief touts reforms after Trump assassination attempts	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Secret Service’s acting director told a U.S. House of Representatives panel on Thursday that he has overhauled the agency's security practices after a gunman shot President-elect Donald Trump in July. Acting Director Ronald Rowe testified to a House task force consisting of seven Republicans and six Democrats that has been investigating two failed assassination attempts on Trump during this year's presidential campaign. Things grew heated at times. The panel is expected to vote on the approval of a final report later on Thursday. 'It is essential that we recognize the gravity of our failure on July 13, 2024. I personally carry the weight of knowing that we almost lost a protectee and that our failure cost a father and husband his life,' Rowe testified. 'This entire incident represents the failure to meet the expectations and responsibilities of the Secret Service.' The Secret Service has faced questions over its staffing levels and communication capabilities following the Trump assassination attempts. A gunman fired eight shots during a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July, wounding Trump in the ear and killing another attendee. The gunman was shot and killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. Two months later, a man with a gun holed himself up near a Trump-owned golf course in Florida with what prosecutors have said was an intent to kill the then-Republican candidate while he golfed. The suspect, Ryan Routh, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges and is awaiting trial. Rowe earned praise from many Republican lawmakers for cooperating with the investigation, but he erupted at Republican Representative Pat Fallon after the congressman questioned Rowe's appearance at a ceremony this year commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 'Do not invoke 9/11 for political purposes!' Rowe yelled, adding that he responded to the World Trade Center site following the attack and attended the ceremony to represent the Secret Service. 'You are out of line, Congressman.' Fallon said he was asking 'serious questions' about whether Rowe was there to provide protection for high-level officials at the ceremony. Rowe has said he was 'ashamed' of security lapses surrounding the Pennsylvania shooting. He defended the agency’s response in the Florida incident, commending an agent who spotted the gunman before he could open fire. Rowe said he has made a series of changes following the shooting, including increasing training for agents, streamlining communication with local law enforcement and boosting the size of Trump's security detail. Rowe testified that he has sought to eliminate what he called a 'do-more-with-less mindset' at the Secret Service, which he said had a 'degrading effect' on the agency. He said the agency was remedying its staffing shortage of recent years and was on pace to hire 650 special agents and 350 uniformed officers in the coming months. The rally shooting shook confidence in the Secret Service, damaging its elite 'zero fail' reputation for protecting presidents and high-level dignitaries to the U.S. The Secret Service has largely been exempt from Trump’s criticisms of federal law enforcement and vows to overhaul government, but the agency’s response to the Pennsylvania shooting drew bipartisan condemnation. An interim report from the House task force, released in October, found a lack of planning between the Secret Service and local law enforcement ahead of the July rally. Republican Representative Mike Kelly, the chair of the task force, credited Rowe with implementing reforms and calling out what he called a culture of complacency in the agency. Kelly said when Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, for another rally in October, the difference in the security posture was 'like the difference between day and night.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-secret-service-chief-touts-reforms-after-trump-assassination-attempts-/7888616.html	2024-12-05T09:53:50-08:00	
Visa freeze exacerbates US nursing shortage	WASHINGTON/RIO DE JANEIRO — Vivian Barbosa lives in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and has worked as a registered nurse for more than 20 years. She is applying for a visa to work in the United States as a nurse. 'There are many reasons why I want to leave, but the main one you'll hear from most Brazilians is the lack of professional recognition and the undervaluation of nursing professionals in Brazil,' Barbosa told VOA. The United States is facing a growing shortage of registered nurses as the baby boomer generation ages, increasing the demand for health care. Many hospitals and nursing homes have recruited nurses from outside the U.S. to help fill vacancies estimated at nearly 200,000 a year, as burned-out nurses leave the field, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And because of high demand, the State Department stopped taking applications for employment-based visas, known as EB-3, which included nurses and other skilled workers for the remainder of the fiscal year that ended in September. Each year, about 40,000 of these visas are available, a cap unchanged since the category's creation in 1990. In its latest update, the U.S. government said the annual visa limits on EB-3 would reset with the fiscal year that began October 1. That would allow embassies and consulates to resume taking applications for these visas. The number of visas issued in October is not available. In September, no EB-3 visas were issued. In a statement, Patty Jeffrey, president of the American Association of International Healthcare, said freezing visa applications is exacerbating staffing shortages across the U.S. health care system. She said part of the problem is not enough U.S.-educated nurses. 'Until we can correct capacity issues that force [U.S.] nursing schools to reject thousands of qualified applicants annually, international nurses will remain essential to safe nurse staffing,' she said in a statement to the media. 'This latest visa freeze halts the flow of qualified international nurses when American hospitals need them most, and the only way to correct it is through congressional action.' For Barbosa, it means she does not know how long it will take to receive authorization to work in the U.S. as a nurse. Foreign nurses In Brazil, where Barbosa lives, there is a high number of nursing graduates. According to Semesp, an organization representing higher education institutions in Brazil, nursing ranks fifth on the latest list of unemployed graduates, with nearly 1 in 4 graduates unable to find paid employment. The International Council of Nurses, or ICN, has raised the alarm over countries losing their nursing workforce because of low pay and poor working conditions. Howard Catton, CEO of ICN, also called for a global recruitment code to stop predatory recruitment. 'We are told that recruiters are [showing] up on graduation day to recruit nurses, but there isn't a return for the countries that are losing them. … If you're going to recruit nurses from a low-income country that's already challenged in terms of its health care, one of the real meaningful ways to give back is to say, 'We'll commit to build a nursing school so that the country can educate more nurses and meet its own needs,'' he said. At the recent G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, the ICN urged world leaders to commit to long-term investments in nursing education, improved working conditions and better pay. The outcome was a summit declaration that officially addressed recruitment practices that lure skilled professionals from vulnerable nations, aligning with the ICN's call for ethical workforce management. 'We support strengthening health workforce training, including through the WHO Academy,' the declaration said, adding there is a need for better working conditions, education, and gender equity in health care professions. At the G20 in Rio, the president of Brazil's national health council, Fernando Zasso Pigatto, recognized the need for improvement and said it is important that countries keep their workforce. 'Because ideally, countries should train professionals to address their local realities,' he said. 'These individuals live in those contexts and understand the specific needs of their communities.' Pigatto agrees that people should be allowed to move to other countries to work as nurses if they wish to do so, but he emphasized the need to address the root causes of nurse shortages and better pay. 'We know there are countries that do not invest [enough],' he said. Catton of the ICN said that until nations address poor pay, working conditions, and lack of investment in education, the flow of health care professionals across borders will continue, with long-term consequences for both sending and receiving countries. 'Nobody stands in the way of the right of individual nurses to move and migrate. … That's a freedom we absolutely support. … But when they move, as well as the loss of the nurse to provide care, there's an investment that those counties have made, which they are also losing,' he said. Barbosa's situation highlights a broader challenge faced by health care systems worldwide. But she won't wait any longer. 'It gets to a point, and it happens to every nurse practitioner here in Brazil, that we just get tired,' Barbosa said.

Police seek suspect in UnitedHealthcare shooting	New York City police investigators continue to search for the suspect in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was attacked by a gunman who apparently was waiting for him on a New York sidewalk early Wednesday. Police say multiple surveillance cameras captured the shooting and the moments after. In one video taken closest to the shooting at about 6:45 a.m., Thompson, 50, can be seen walking on a sidewalk to UnitedHealthcare’s annual investor conference at a Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan. A moment later, a figure wearing a hooded jacket, dark glasses and a backpack steps out from behind a parked vehicle and raises a handgun that appears to have a noise suppressor, or silencer, attached and fires several shots. Thompson was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. Other cameras caught the gunman mounting an e-bike and heading into the city’s Central Park. Police are now investigating whether the vehicle was an unmarked e-bike or one that is part of the city’s Citi Bike share system, as initially reported. Police on Thursday revealed the words 'Deny,' 'Defend' and 'Depose' were printed on the 9-millimeter shell casings found at the scene. Some analysts believe the words may have been a reference to strategies insurance companies use to avoid paying claims. At an initial news conference on Wednesday, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said that while it was clear the attack on Thompson was premeditated, the motive is unclear. She said the cameras showed that the suspect waited for several minutes for Thompson, and that he had at least some prior firearms training. Thompson had been with Minneapolis-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years. The New York Times reported that the company, which offers insurance to companies and individuals, has a market valuation of $560 billion, making it one of the country’s largest publicly traded companies. The Times also reported the company has come under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators, who accused it of systematically refusing to authorize health care procedures and treatments. The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a report in October documenting insurance companies' refusal to pay for the care of older people who had suffered strokes or medical emergencies. UnitedHealthcare in particular was cited for a surge in denials in post-acute care when it increased to 22.7% in 2022 from 10.9% in 2020. Thompson’s wife, Paulette, told U.S. broadcaster NBC News that he had received death threats.

Congo says it's 'on alert' over mystery flu-like disease that killed dozens	KINSHASA, CONGO — Public health officials in Africa urged caution Thursday as Congo's health minister said the government was on alert over a mystery flu-like disease that in recent weeks killed dozens of people. Jean Kaseya, the head of Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters that more details about the disease should be known in the next 48 hours as experts receive results from laboratory samples of infected people. 'First diagnostics are leading us to think it is a respiratory disease,' Kaseya said. 'But we need to wait for the laboratory results.' He added that there are many things that are still unknown about the disease — including whether it is infectious and how it is transmitted. Authorities in Congo have so far confirmed 71 deaths, including 27 people who died in hospitals and 44 in the community in the southern Kwango province, Health Minister Roger Kamba said. 'The Congolese government is on general alert regarding this disease,' Kamba said, without providing more details. Of the victims at the hospitals, 10 died due to lack of blood transfusion and 17 because of respiratory problems, he said. The deaths were recorded between November 10 and 25 in the Panzi health zone of Kwango province. There were around 380 cases, almost half of which were children under the age of 5, according to the minister. The Africa CDC recorded slightly different numbers, with 376 cases and 79 deaths. The discrepancy was caused by problems with surveillance and case definition, Kaseya said. Authorities have said that symptoms include fever, headache, cough and anemia. Epidemiological experts are in the region to take samples and investigate the disease, the minister said. The Panzi health zone, located around 700 kilometers from the capital, Kinshasa, is a remote area of the Kwango province, making it hard to access. The epidemiological experts took two days to arrive there, the minister said. Because of the lack of testing capacity, samples had to be taken to Kikwit, more than 500 kilometers away, said Dieudonne Mwamba, the head of the National Institute for Public Health. 'The health system is quite weak in our rural areas, but for certain types of care, the ministry has all the provisions, and we are waiting for the first results of the sample analysis to properly calibrate things,' Kaseya said. Mwamba said that Panzi was already a 'fragile' zone, with 40% of its residents experiencing malnutrition. It was also hit by an epidemic of typhoid fever two years ago, and there is currently a resurgence of seasonal flu across the country. 'We need to take into account all this as context,' Mwamba said. A Panzi resident, Claude Niongo, said his wife and 7-year-old daughter died from the disease. 'We do not know the cause, but I only noticed high fevers, vomiting ... and then death,' Niongo told The Associated Press over the phone. 'Now, the authorities are talking to us about an epidemic, but in the meantime, there is a problem of care [and] people are dying.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-says-it-s-on-alert-over-mystery-flu-like-disease-that-killed-dozens/7888566.html	2024-12-05T09:13:16-08:00	
In Southeast Asia’s scam centers, human trafficking worsens	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — The young man has been handcuffed to the ceiling, beaten until his buttocks turned purple, and received electric shocks to his feet. That’s how his captors treat him inside a scam compound in Myanmar where he has been trapped since October, according to his mother, who showed VOA a photograph sent by her son’s captors of what she says is his beaten body. The mother, who asked that her name and that of her son not be published for fear of retaliation by the captors, says her 24-year-old Malaysian son traveled to Thailand for a vacation. She doesn’t know how he ended up in neighboring Myanmar. However, a few weeks ago, his family expected his release after they paid about $16,000 in ransom, but his mother said that they were tricked by the criminal syndicate and that there’s no end in sight for this ordeal. 'I lost all my money and still did not get him back,' the mother said. 'It’s very heartbreaking. I have been crying for many days.' In parts of Southeast Asia, this story has become all too common. 'Over the last several years, hundreds of thousands of people have been brought to the region, many of them via various forms of coercion, deception and human trafficking, to be involved in a very lucrative global industry of organized cybercrime,' said Jake Sims, a visiting expert at the Washington-based United States Institute of Peace. 'The main hubs for these scam compounds are in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos because of corruption, governance gaps and an absence of effective rule of law,' he said. The governments of Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos have not replied to VOA requests for comments. Sims said the trafficking victims come from around the world, but most are from East Asia and Southeast Asia. The United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime has described Southeast Asia as 'ground zero for the global scamming industry.' Last year, the United Nations estimated that more than 200,000 people were forced to work in scam centers in Cambodia and Myanmar alone. According to the U.N.’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the scam centers 'generate revenue amounting to billions of U.S. dollars each year.' And despite warnings by human rights advocates as well as reports in local and international media, the problem is worsening, according to Sims. 'This industry is growing and will likely continue to grow for some time,' Sims said. 'This industry is defrauding the world to the tune of tens of billions of dollars per year. So, there’s a lot of incentive for these criminal organizations to keep operating.' Victims are often lured by a false promise of a good job opportunity, only to find themselves trapped inside a guarded compound where they’re forced to work 15 hours a day, seven days a week, befriending people on social media and dating apps and persuading them to invest their money in cryptocurrency scams. Those who refuse risk violence. 'There are widespread reports of torture, mysterious deaths — all kinds of issues that are emerging for people who either fail to comply or fail to succeed at the tasks that have been given to them,' Sims said. He added that some victims are completely unaware of the scam syndicates until they’re trapped. In other cases, Sims said, victims understand the risks but are so financially desperate that they’re willing to take them. One Malaysian father, who insisted on anonymity, has a 27-year-old son trapped in a compound in Myanmar. The parent told VOA he received videos of his son being tortured. The family is now paying almost $1,000 a month in ransom to prevent further violence to him. Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates, a Bangkok-based consultancy, said other countries in the region are not putting enough pressure on the governments of Cambodia and Laos and the junta in Myanmar. 'They need to find levers that really bring pain to these governments and force them to have another approach,' Robertson said. 'Without that, these criminal networks in these countries will continue to have impunity.'

Symptom of Germany's faltering economy, Volkswagen's crisis deepens	The German carmaker Volkswagen plans to make massive cuts, triggering a warning strike by workers. The crisis at VW is another symptom of deepening troubles in the German economy — the EU's largest — in recent years burdened by high energy costs, the war in Ukraine, and Chinese competition.

Former Ethiopia state minister released after rearrest	Ethiopia’s former state minister for peace was released from jail Thursday, a day after he was rearrested by security forces just minutes after a court cleared him to be freed on bail. Taye Dendea was taken by security forces wearing police uniforms shortly after he walked out of prison Wednesday, according to his family. Taye’s wife, Sintayehu Alemayehu, told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service that he was released a second time Thursday. She said he was taken to a federal police facility where she met him and gave him food this morning. 'We visited him at the facility in the morning hours and no one explained to us why they took him after the court granted him bail,' she added. Sintayehu says after she left him at the station, her husband called her on the phone and asked to be picked up. 'He is at home now,' she said. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission also has confirmed his release. The family and politicians expressed concern for Taye’s safety after his rearrest as he stepped out of the Kilinto Prison Center in Addis Ababa at about 4:30 p.m. local time Wednesday. 'Before he could reunite with his family, they intercepted him right at the gate, with his personal belongings still in his hands,' Sintayehu said in a phone interview. 'It happened so abruptly that it's difficult to say he was truly released.' Taye was arrested in December last year after he posted comments criticizing Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and his government. Following the post, he was initially charged with collaborating with groups aiming to destabilize Ethiopia. He also was charged with using social media platforms to endorse violence. A judge later dropped those charges without requiring him to present a defense but ordered him to defend against a third charge concerning the 'illegal' possession of firearms. Ethiopia’s Supreme Court rejected his request for bail but after a lengthy hearing, the Federal Appeals Court on Monday ruled Taye was to be released on bail of 20,000 birr (about $158) pending his gun charge case. He is to appear at the Lideta Federal High Court on December 10 on the firearm charge. Prominent Ethiopian politician and activist Jawar Mohammed welcomed the release. 'Taye Dendea’s release is good news for the family and friends after he was abducted yesterday by security forces while leaving prison after he was granted bail,' he wrote on social media platform X. 'The lawless act of abducting people after they are released by the court of law has become a common pattern of intimidation and violence by security forces. We all must fight back to end is to allow a meaningful exercise of the rule of law by the judiciary.' Ethiopian communications officials did not immediately respond to VOA requests for comment. Rebel defections Taye’s original criticism included blaming the government for the failure of peace talks with the Oromo Liberation Army, or OLA, in Tanzania last year. On Sunday, authorities in Ethiopia’s Oromia region announced signing a peace deal with a commander belonging to the OLA. Shimelis Abdisa, president of the Oromia regional state, announced the agreement with Jaal Segni Nagassa, a former member of the OLA executive committee and former commander of the group in the central region. The details of the agreement have not been released but the state media outlets described the deal as 'one of the steppingstones to solve the ongoing insecurity crisis across Oromia.' In his televised speech on state-run outlets, Shimelis said the region appreciated the step taken by Segni 'to take such measures to bring normalcy to the region.' Segni said he decided to take the peace deal after 'seeing the suffering of the people of Oromo.' It was in late September that Segni announced during a teleconference arranged by the Ethiopian military officials that he was 'ready to resolve the conflict in the Oromia region peacefully,' and had broken ties with overall OLA commander Jaal Marroo, who also is known as Kumsa Diriba. An official with the OLA, Jiregna Gudeta, dismissed the peace agreement as a 'meme.' Jiregna said the government entered an agreement with individuals 'expelled' from the organization. On Monday, federal communications minister Legesse Tulu was among officials who shared photos of reported defection of OLA fighters following the peace agreement with Segni. 'Bravery means understanding the current needs of the people and taking a peaceful stand and standing firm for peace,' Legesse posted on Facebook. Girma Lelo, a local administrator for Kelbe Kebele, in Jeldu Wereda of West Shewa Zone, says OLA fighters are gathering in small towns and entering designated areas set aside for them. 'This is good for our area where recently over 19 militiamen were killed after fighting with OLA forces,' Girma said. 'It is a relief for the residents, people are being killed day in and day out, and no one is held accountable due to this crisis,' said another resident, Jaleta Bekele.

China faces backlash over subpar quality of sanitary pads	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — The subpar quality of sanitary pads has triggered a heated debate in China recently, with women speaking out online and raising concerns about what they say are loose government regulations and subpar manufacturing of the product that is a necessity for hundreds of millions of women in the massive country. On social media platforms some have dubbed the uproar 'Sanitary Pad Chaos' as they have focused on alleged false advertising about the size of pads, as well as concerns that a contaminated material known as 'black cotton' is being used in sanitary napkins. Lax regulatory standards On China’s microblogging social media platform Weibo, the topic 'Sanitary Pad Scandal' was one of many to go viral in recent weeks, with the topic garnering upwards of 170 million views. One microblogger on Weibo from the southeastern province of Fujian pointed to the problem of lax business regulations. 'The business environment for women’s products in China has become excessively lenient, leading to unchecked practices in product development, quality, and public relations,' the post said. Another from Jilin, in China’s northeast, argued that the sanitary pad industry is a lucrative industry with low costs and high demand. In many cases, products are often marketed under the guise of promoting female independence, the microblogger said. Amid the controversy, a customer service representative for the well-known sanitary pad brand ABC drew backlash for suggesting dissatisfied customers should simply stop buying the products. In response, the founder of ABC, Deng Jingheng, later issued a public apology on November 22. Insect infestations When reports about concerns with sanitary pads began circulating on social media earlier last month, many female consumers in China began examining the products they use more closely and posting their findings online. Concerns that surfaced online ranged from the use of substandard cotton to health-threatening levels of chemical contamination. Chinese media reports have highlighted cases where consumers have found foreign objects like needles and insect eggs in sanitary pads, further raising public anxiety. The Chinese government has not responded to the controversy. Some state media outlets have reported on the topic, noting the need to update national standards and condemning manufacturers. Sanitary pads sold in the Chinese market are regulated by two standards. The first one is the Recommended National Standard issued on July 1, 2019, which covers product specifications such as length deviations, absorption capacity, and pH levels. It also includes guidelines for packaging and labeling requirements. Another regulation standard is the Mandatory National Standard issued on Sept. 1, 2002. This standard focuses on hygiene conditions during production, including sterilization requirements. Toxicological testing also is carried out to ensure product safety. Despite the standards, critics argue that their leniency allows room for non-compliance, fueling distrust among consumers and highlighting the need for stricter regulations and enforcement. For example, the recommended national standard allows sanitary pads to deviate in length by 4%. State-backed online news site The Paper tested 24 different brands and found that 21 of them were at least a centimeter shorter than advertised. That is still within the permitted range but surprising that so many were smaller than advertised. Suppression of feminism The uproar over sanitary pads is but the latest in recent years to highlight concern among women over their status in society and the suppression of feminism in China, some argue. 'The sanitary pad incident and the strong reactions from women largely reflect the profound oppression and gender inequality faced by women under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party,' said Mengxing Ren, a young female member of the China Democracy Party, who relocated from China last year to Los Angeles. 'Through years of governance, the regime has systematically neglected women's basic needs and rights, embedding gender discrimination deeply within the social and economic structures.' Fang, a 35-year-old office worker from Shanghai who was unwilling to disclose her full name citing security concerns, said she doesn’t expect authorities to do much in response to the uproar. Fang said that when public discontent reaches a certain level, local government agencies typically issue statements in white text with a blue background to highlight the seriousness of the issue and then claim they are 'conducting thorough investigations' or promising 'punishments after verification.' When asked whether she believed that sanitary pad manufacturers should bear responsibility, another woman surnamed Chen, a 30-year-old who lives in Hangzhou, also voiced her frustration. 'It’s only when public opinion grows louder that brands, distributors, or even government regulatory agencies will come forward to apologize,' she said. When asked by VOA whether there are connections or ironies drawn between this latest sanitary pad controversy and China's attempt to encourage women to have more children, Ren said many women face not only economic pressures and barriers to career advancement but are often forced to make difficult choices between childbirth and personal development. 'The sanitary pad issue is a microcosm of this predicament, reflecting the status of women within the nation's population,' she said. 'It highlights a dual policy dilemma: on the one hand, women are expected to bear children, yet on the other, they encounter unfair treatment even in meeting basic living needs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-faces-backlash-over-subpar-quality-of-sanitary-pads/7888420.html	2024-12-05T08:11:45-08:00

Sierra Leone begins nationwide rollout of Ebola vaccine	FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE — Authorities in Sierra Leone on Thursday started a nationwide rollout of the single-dose Ebola vaccine, the first such campaign in West Africa, where a deadly outbreak 10 years ago resulted in the death of thousands. The 2014 Ebola outbreak — the deadliest in history — was primarily in West Africa but affected Sierra Leone the most, with nearly 4,000 deaths out of the more than 11,000 recorded globally. The country also lost 7% of its health care workforce to the outbreak. The nationwide vaccine campaign, implemented by the government in partnership with the global vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization and the United Nations children's agency, will target 20,000 front-line workers across the country, officials said. 'This is an investment in the safety of our people and a healthier Sierra Leone,' Health Minister Austin Demby said. There had been no approved vaccine at the time of the 2014 outbreak, which recorded up to 28,000 cases, starting in Guinea before spreading across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia, the other two countries affected the most. Three years have passed since the last case was recorded in Guinea, although officials have spoken of remaining threats in endemic regions. Among those killed by the disease during the 2014 outbreak were nine relatives of Hassan Kamara, a resident of Freetown. Of the 11 people he was living with at the time, only he and his baby daughter survived. 'They died in front of me,' he said. 'I feel bad sometimes speaking about this because of what I went through.' Thursday's campaign, which launched in the capital, Freetown, was welcomed by health workers. Collins Thomas, a community health worker in Freetown, remembers losing many colleagues in 2014 as they managed patients during the outbreak in Freetown. 'It was scary, because we knew nothing about the disease and learned along the line. With this vaccine, we know we are protected,' Thomas said. Gavi Chief Executive Sania Nishtar said the organization is 'incredibly proud' of how its support for timely and equitable access to vaccines has helped save lives and protect communities. 'To have the first nationwide preventive vaccination campaign take place in the country most deeply impacted by the 2014 outbreak makes this historic milestone even more meaningful,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sierra-leone-begins-nationwide-rollout-of-ebola-vaccine/7888331.html	2024-12-05T07:11:50-08:00

Syrian rebels capture second major city	Syria’s military said it has withdrawn its forces from the central city of Hama after intense fighting with insurgent forces, marking another major defeat for President Bashar al-Assad in the country’s ongoing civil war. The army issued a statement Thursday that it was redeploying its troops outside Hama to protect the city’s civilian population. The rebels said earlier Thursday they had entered the city and seized its prison, freeing detainees. The capture of Hama comes days after the rebels seized the main northern city of Aleppo, the largest in Syria. It was the first major attack on Aleppo since 2016, when Syrian government forces, supported by Iranian-backed militias and the Russian air force, pushed out rebel factions from the eastern parts of the city during the height of Syria’s civil war. The insurgents are made up of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. Their capture of Aleppo and Hama has reignited the civil war that broke out in 2011 following a popular uprising and comes as Assad’s allies are preoccupied with their own wars — Russia with its invasion of Ukraine, and Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighting Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. Hama is strategically located about 200 kilometers north of the capital, Damascus, between Aleppo and Damascus. The city was the scene of an Islamist uprising in 1982 against then-President Hafez al-Assad, the current president’s father and predecessor, which ended with a brutal crackdown by Syrian security forces that left thousands of people dead. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-rebels-capture-second-major-city/7888298.html	2024-12-05T06:54:16-08:00	
With another government collapsing, France faces uncertain future	Paris — French President Emmanuel Macron was set to address his nation later Thursday (19:00 UTC), a day after his government fell in a no-confidence vote— a first in more than 60 years. The country’s prime minister, Michel Barnier, was expected to resign Thursday. It didn’t take long for Michel Barnier’s three-month-old government to become the shortest in the history of France’s Fifth Republic. On Wednesday, National Assembly lawmakers from the far left and far right passed a no-confidence measure. It’s left France without a functioning government for the second time this year. The move came after Barnier used a constitutional tool to force through an unpopular budget proposal that he said was key to addressing France’s sizable economic troubles. Far right leader Marine Le Pen told French TV that Barnier’s proposed spending cuts and tax increases were profoundly unjust for ordinary people — expressing optimism a better budget could be passed under a new government. Mathilde Panot from the far-left France Unbowed (La France Insoumise) party said it was time for Macron himself to leave office. Macron said he’s not going anywhere. But after losing legislative and European elections earlier this year, he’s a weakened president. France is struggling with a high debt and budget deficit, and stagnant growth. Public sector workers went on strike Thursday over salaries and working conditions, disrupting schools, city halls, hospitals and transportation. A rail workers’ strike is expected next week. France’s turmoil comes at a challenging time for Europe. Another European Union heavyweight, Germany, is also struggling economically and politically. The bloc faces internal divisions, an emboldened Russia, a struggling Ukraine and an incoming Trump administration in the U.S., which Europeans fear will be less inclined to support Kyiv, free trade and the transatlantic alliance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-another-government-collapsing-france-faces-uncertain-future/7888309.html	2024-12-05T06:51:00-08:00

Biden caps Angola visit with stop at train terminal at western port	LOBITO, ANGOLA — In the blistering midday heat at Angola’s largest port, U.S. President Joe Biden beamed Wednesday as he shook hands, one by one, with nine smiling hard-hatted workers. He had journeyed all the way from Washington to meet them at the terminus of an ambitious 1,300-kilometer, U.S.-financed rail line that brings critical minerals out of Africa’s remote interior. On this December afternoon, there wasn’t much activity: The usually bustling port of Lobito had been cleared of most workers for his visit. A nearby black and red rail engine was still shiny and new, as were the long chains of blue half-containers that stretched behind it. Still, said a smiling Biden, this is Africa’s future. 'When I launched this project with our G7 partners last year, I said our goal was to build a better future,' Biden said. 'And folks, the future is here. It's now. The future is here.' The U.S. has invested about $4 billion to refurbish the dilapidated cross-continental Lobito Corridor track, which runs from copper-rich Zambia, through mineral-rich Congo and then to the port. Once the full route is completed — which officials say will happen by the end of this decade — the system will cut a road journey of some 45 days to a rail trip of 45 hours. On Wednesday, Biden announced the United States will invest $600 million more to upgrade the rail, develop the corridor and expand agriculture. And while this project is small compared to China’s sprawling Belt and Road Initiative, Biden emphasized that the U.S. seeks true partnership with African nations. 'The United States understands that how we invest in Africa is just as important as how much we invest in Africa,' he said, flanked by the leaders of Angola, Congo, Zambia and the vice president of Tanzania, who met with Biden to tout the project and plot a path forward. Angolan President Joao Lourenco said: 'This will be a linchpin for the economic development that will provide the participation of small and medium enterprises in the business value chain, mainly in agriculture, industry and mining in order to increase trade and economic growth of SADC [Southern Africa Development Community] region and the Eastern African region.' And from Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, whose massive, mineral-rich nation has much to gain: 'The corridor is way more than just a transportation access,' he said. 'It is a unique opportunity for regional integration, economic transformation, and to improve the living conditions of our fellow citizens.' Analysts are quick to note that this is no charity. 'From the U.S. and an EU point of view, it's like if we don't have access to the critical minerals for the green economy, we'll lag behind in terms of greening the global economy,' said E.D. Wala Chabala, an independent economic policy and strategy consultant. A top Angolan agricultural official told VOA that Angola hopes to use this boost to one day export higher-value items duty free to the U.S. through the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act. 'We are also very focused on promoting internal production, effectively solving our need to feed and as the process allows us to effectively evolve towards opportunities such as AGOA,' said Anderson Jeronimo, who heads the Planning Statistics Studies Office of the Ministry of Agriculture.

Ukraine, Russian diplomats trade barbs at Malta summit	Ta'Qali, Malta — Ukraine's foreign minister called Russia's top diplomat Sergei Lavrov a 'war criminal' Thursday as they both attended an international summit in Malta, the latter's first visit to an EU member since the 2022 invasion. Ukraine's Andriy Sybiga also accused Moscow of being 'the biggest threat to our common security' as the two foreign ministers sat on the same huge table at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also in Ta'Qali, near Valetta, for the talks, though officials said he had no plans to meet Lavrov. 'Russia is not a partner; it is the biggest threat to our common security. Russia's participation in the OSCE is a threat to cooperation in Europe,' Sybiga told ministers from the 57-member body. 'When Russians say they want peace they lie,' he said, adding: 'Ukraine continues to fight for its right to exist.' 'And the Russian war criminal at this table must know: Ukraine will win this right and justice will prevail.' 'Destabilizing' Lavrov, who has been sanctioned by the European Union, had not visited an EU country since a December 2021 trip to Stockholm, again for an OSCE meeting, Russian media reported. Sitting between the representatives of San Marino and Romania, he railed against the EU, NATO and in particular the United States. He said the West was behind a 'reincarnation of the Cold War, only now with a much greater risk of a transition to a hot one,' according to a transcript of his remarks from RIA Navosti. He also accused Washington of military exercises in the Asia-Pacific region that sought to 'destabilize the entire Eurasian continent.' The OSCE was founded in 1975 to ease tensions between the East and the West during the Cold War, and now counts 57 members from Turkey to Mongolia, including Britain and Canada as well as the United States. It helps its members coordinate issues such as human rights and arms control, but Lavrov at the last ministerial summit a year ago in North Macedonia accused the OSCE of becoming an 'appendage' of NATO and the EU. Ukraine has called for Russia to be excluded from the organization, and boycotted the Skopje summit over Lavrov's attendance. Summit host Ian Borg, Malta's foreign minister, opened proceedings Thursday with a call for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. Blinken also accused Lavrov -- who at that point was no longer in the room -- of spreading a 'tsunami of misinformation' and blamed Moscow for an escalation in Ukraine. Many other participants railed against Moscow's aggression at a delicate time for Kyiv. U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to press for a quick deal to end the war, leaving Kyiv scrambling to obtain security guarantees from Western allies and supplies of key weaponry before the January inauguration. 'Channels of communication' In 2022, OSCE host Poland refused to let Lavrov attend their summit, and Poland's minister questioned why Moscow was still allowed to be part of the organization. A spokesman for Malta told AFP on Wednesday that while he faces an EU asset freeze, there was no travel ban on Lavrov, and he was invited to 'keep some channels of communication open.' Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Wednesday that a number of Western countries were 'using this platform for their own interests,' arguing that the body had been 'Ukrainianized.' But German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Malta that the OSCE 'stands for security and freedom and we will defend it.' The OSCE has been paralyzed since the Ukraine invasion, as Russia has vetoed several major decisions, which require consensus. The posts of secretary general and three other top officials have been vacant since September because of a lack of agreement over their successors. Ambassadors have reached agreement on Turkish diplomat Feridun Sinirlioglu as new secretary general to replace Germany's Helga Maria Schmid, a diplomatic source told AFP. The ministers in Malta will also be seeking to agree which country will chair the OSCE in 2026 and 2027. Russia had blocked NATO member Estonia from holding the chairmanship this year. Finland, which joined NATO last year, is up for the post in 2025. The OSCE sends observers to conflicts as well as elections around the world. It also runs programs that aim to combat human trafficking and ensure media freedom. But its efforts have been hampered by an inability to agree a budget since 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-russian-diplomats-trade-barbs-at-malta-summit/7888230.html	2024-12-05T05:52:21-08:00	
Amid rubble, residents in Lebanon's city of Tyre struggle to rebuild shattered lives	Southern Lebanon's ancient city of Tyre, one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world, now bears the scars of weeks of Israeli airstrikes. Once vibrant and bustling, displaced residents are returning to a landscape of rubble and despair. Elizabeth Cherneff narrates this report from Ethel Bonet.

On its 30th anniversary, Ukraine calls 1994 Budapest Memorandum ‘a monument to short-sightedness’	WASHINGTON — Thirty years ago, leaders of the United States, Britain Russia and Ukraine met in Budapest, Hungary, and signed a memorandum that provided security assurances to Ukraine in exchange for it giving up its nuclear arsenal, then the world's third largest. Today, nearly three years after Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian officials are calling the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances 'a monument to short-sightedness in strategic security decision-making' and seek NATO membership for their country. Presidents Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Bill Clinton of the U.S., along with British Prime Minister John Major, signed the memorandum on December 5, 1994. Steven Pifer, a veteran diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 1998 to 2000, helped negotiate the memorandum. 'In that document, basically, the United States, Britain and Russia committed to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and existing borders, and committed not to use force or threaten to use force against Ukraine,' Pifer told VOA’s Ukrainian Service. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine inherited the world`s third-largest nuclear arsenal and agreed to transfer all the nuclear munitions on its territory to Russia for dismantlement, and to decommission nuclear missile launch silos. All parties to the memorandum agreed to 'refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of the signatories to the memorandum.' However, in 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and fueled a separatist movement in eastern Ukraine. In February 2022, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In a December 3 statement marking the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry called the agreement 'a monument to short-sightedness in strategic security decision-making.' Clutching a copy of the memorandum after arriving in Brussels for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrii Sybiha called the pact a reminder that any long-term decisions made at the cost of Ukrainian security are 'inappropriate and unacceptable.' 'This document, this paper, failed to secure Ukrainian security and transatlantic security,' Sybiha said. 'So, we must avoid repeating such mistakes. That's, of course, why we will discuss with my partners the concept of peace through strength, and we have a clear understanding which steps we need from our friends.' In its December 3 statement, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said, 'The only real guarantee of security for Ukraine, as well as a deterrent to further Russian aggression against Ukraine and other states, is Ukraine's full membership in NATO.' That view was echoed by former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, now an opposition leader, in an interview with VOA. 'Please consider the signature on [an] invitation to [join] NATO as a continuing obligation of our partners, including the United States, on the Budapest Memorandum,' Poroshenko said. 'This is the precondition when Ukraine voluntarily gives up the third biggest nuclear arsenal in the world, and everybody said that if Ukraine now [had] this nuclear arsenal, there would be no war and no occupation,' he told VOA. Russian officials accuse Ukraine and its partners of having violated the Budapest Memorandum by expanding NATO — which, they say, threatens Russia’s security interests. Pifer recalled that in the early 1990s, Ukrainian officials asked what the U.S. would do if Russia violated the Budapest Memorandum. 'We said the United States will do things; we will take an interest,' Pifer told VOA. 'However, we were clear: We said, ‘We’re telling you now — that does not mean we'll send American military force to defend Ukraine.’ That's why the document is the memorandum on security assurances, not security guarantees.' Mariana Budjeryn, an author and senior research associate with the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center, believes that Ukraine and its Western partners failed to fully recognize the Russian threat. Those were different times, she said. 'There was this narrative that Ukraine is a peaceful country and it's not really threatening anyone, and it was to join the international community on good terms,' she told VOA. 'The Cold War was over, the Soviet Union fell apart, and the whole issue of weapons, including nuclear weapons, became passé, became a thing of the past.' After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Pifer and others called on the Obama administration to provide defense assistance to Ukraine to fulfill its obligations under the Budapest Memorandum. 'I thought the Obama administration should have done more in terms of providing defense assistance to Ukraine,' Pifer said. 'But if you look at the last two and a half years, the Biden administration has provided well over a hundred billion dollars in military and financial assistance to Ukraine. That's certainly consistent with what we were saying 30 years ago.' Budjeryn noted that the nuclear weapons Ukraine inherited in 1991 did not amount to a 'fully fledged nuclear deterrent that it could just grab and use to deter Russia.' 'It was a chunk of a nuclear arsenal developed by a different country, the Soviet Union, for the strategic purposes of that country. And the strategic kind of aim of the Soviet Union was to deter NATO and the United States,' she said. 'But ultimately, to have a credible nuclear deterrent, Ukraine would have needed to invest a lot more into an independent nuclear program, which it did not have,' Budjeryn said. Budjeryn said Ukraine could have invested more in its conventional military capabilities after it signed the memorandum. In the end, 'the main lesson for any country is that no single document, no matter how legally binding or well written and robust, is a sufficient basis for national security. You have to be able to really invest in your own defense and national security,' she said. The Budapest Memorandum is not the only document Russia signed and violated, which raises questions about future agreements with Moscow, Pifer said: 'It was also in the 1997 Russian-Ukrainian Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Peace. It was several other documents where the Russian government clearly said, ‘We recognize Ukraine in the borders of 1991. We will recognize and accept Ukrainian sovereignty and independence.’' According to Budjeryn, there is a larger lesson for the global community. 'It's a story about just how fragile our system of international law — of international agreements — is, and that its credibility, its existence, a continued existence, and its workings are as much dependent on states observing voluntarily, but also on states reacting adequately and sufficiently to violations,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-its-30th-anniversary-ukraine-calls-1994-budapest-memorandum-a-monument-to-short-sightedness-/7887918.html	2024-12-05T05:14:41-08:00	
Amnesty International says Israel committing genocide in Gaza	Israel says a new report by Amnesty International accusing it of committing genocide in Gaza is 'entirely false and based on lies,' while denouncing the human rights watchdog as a 'deplorable and fanatical organization.' The London-based group released a report Thursday in which it concluded that Israel and its military have violated the 1948 United Nations-backed Genocide Convention, which defines genocide as 'acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.' The nearly 300-page report covered a nine-month period beginning in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel by Hamas militants that ended with 1,200 people killed and 250 others taken hostage. Israel launched a massive ground and aerial campaign on the Palestinian enclave in response. Amnesty said it came to its conclusion based on hundreds of 'dehumanizing and genocidal statements' by Israeli officials, as well as ground reports from Gaza. The report said 15 Israeli airstrikes carried out between October 2023 through April 2024 killed 334 civilians, including 141 children, but Amnesty said there was no evidence that any of the strikes were directed at military objectives. The group said Israel’s actions, including mass evacuation orders that have displaced most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and the restriction of humanitarian aid deliveries, are deliberately bringing about the destruction of the Palestinians through a 'slow, calculated death.' Agnes Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary-general, said in the report that the group’s findings 'must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide.' Callamard said the United States, Israel’s major international ally, and other nations who provide Israel with weapons are at risk of being complicit with genocide. In a statement posted on the social media platform X, Israel’s foreign ministry slammed the report as 'fabricated,' and that it was Hamas that carried out a 'genocidal massacre' on October 7. The statement said since then, Israel has been defending itself against 'daily attacks from seven different fronts' while 'fully in accordance with international law.' The Washington Post said it received a statement from the Israeli military calling Amnesty’s 'allegations of genocide and intentional harm are not only unfounded but also ignore Hamas’ violations of international law, including its use of civilians as human shields and its deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians.' Amnesty’s branch in Israel also disputed the accusations levied by its parent group, saying there was no solid evidence of genocide taking place. The Israeli office said it did not take part in the research for the report, but also said an investigation needs to be conducted into possible crimes against humanity committed by Israel. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,500 Palestinians, more than half those of women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Israel says that the death toll includes thousands of militants it has killed. Israel says the Hamas militants frequently use residential buildings, schools and hospitals for operational cover. Hamas denies this, accusing Israeli forces of indiscriminate attacks. Amnesty’s report joins a growing chorus of voices across the international community accusing Israel of human rights violations in its war on Gaza. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last month for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, including starvation as a method of warfare. South Africa has brought charges of genocide against Israel in the U.N.-backed International Court of Justice in The Hague. Israeli offensive in Gaza continues Israel launched more attacks on targets in Gaza Wednesday, with Palestinian officials reporting dozens of deaths and injuries. One Israeli strike that hit a tent camp housing displaced people killed at least 21 and wounded 28 in southern Gaza, according to the director of Nasser Hospital, Atif al-Hout, in the nearby city of Khan Younis. The Israeli military said its aircraft struck senior Hamas militants 'involved in terrorist activities' in the area. At least 15 bodies were brought to the hospital, but reaching a precise number of dead was difficult because many were dismembered, some without heads or badly burned. The strike hit the Muwasi area, a sprawling coastal camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people. Earlier, strikes elsewhere in Gaza killed eight people, including four children, health officials said. Residents in the Khan Younis area said Israeli tanks advanced a day after the Israeli military issued new evacuation orders, saying there had been rocket launches by Palestinian militants in the region. With shells crashing near residential areas, families headed westward toward the nearby humanitarian-designated area of Al-Mawasi. Palestinian and United Nations officials say there are no safe areas left in Gaza and that most of its 2.3 million people have been displaced multiple times. Further north, another Israeli airstrike hit three houses in Gaza City, killing at least 10 people and wounding many others, the territory's emergency service said. Many victims were still trapped under the rubble with rescue operations underway. Medics said 11 people were killed in three airstrikes on areas in central Gaza, including six children and a medic. Five of the dead had been lining up outside a bakery, they said. A further nine Palestinians were killed by tank fire in Rafah, near the border with Egypt, medics said. Israel's military did not immediately comment on the information given by Palestinian medics. Meanwhile, Israel's Shin Bet domestic security agency said Wednesday that Israeli forces have recovered the body of a hostage held in Gaza. Itay Svirsky was captured alive from southern Israel during Hamas' 2023 attack. Israel believes that he was killed while in captivity. The Shin Bet did not disclose details of the mission to recover Svirsky's body. The Israeli military said Wednesday it made several arrests after Israeli settlers attacked towns in the occupied West Bank. The Israel Defense Forces said the violence included settler attacks on the village of Beit Furik, where settlers hurled stones and wounded two border police. Settler violence has surged in the West Bank since Hamas launched its attack on Israel, and Israeli forces have carried out numerous raids on West Bank villages as part of a campaign the military says is aimed at disrupting militant activities. U.S. and other officials expressed hope in recent days that last week’s ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah could help to push along efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. But months of talks brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza have yet to yield an agreement between Israel and Hamas. Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that while fighting rages in Gaza, the fragile Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire in Lebanon is 'holding,' even as the warring parties have continued to periodically target each other with new strikes in recent days, and Israel launching new strikes in Lebanon Wednesday. Blinken told journalists on the sidelines of a NATO meeting in Brussels, 'The ceasefire is holding, and we're using the mechanism that was established when any concerns have arisen about any alleged or purported violations.' Both Israel and Hezbollah have accused each other of violating the week-old truce to end 14 months of fighting that has killed thousands of people in Lebanon and sparked mass displacement of residents on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanon border. 'I think fundamentally, both parties, that is to say Israel and Hezbollah, through the Lebanese government, wanted and continue to want the ceasefire,' Blinken said. 'But we have to make sure that it's upheld. And we're determined to do that.' A committee including France, United Nations peacekeepers, Israel, Lebanon and chaired by the United States is tasked with maintaining communication among the various parties and ensuring violations are identified and dealt with to avoid any escalation. 'The mechanism that we established with France to make sure that the ceasefire is effectively monitored and implemented is working, and we want to make sure it continues to work,' Blinken said. 'If there are concerns that one party or the other is violating the ceasefire, it comes to us, and one way or another, we engage the parties. That's exactly what's happened.' Under terms of the ceasefire, the two sides are supposed to pull back from the border area, with Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers maintaining a buffer zone. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said Wednesday that the Israel-Hezbollah war has killed at least 4,047 and wounded more than 16,600 others. Abiad said most of the casualties have occurred since September 15, and that the actual number of dead is believed to be higher. Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in late September after nearly a year of cross-border exchanges by Hezbollah in support of its ally Hamas, following the Palestinian group's October 2023 attack on Israel. There are still about 100 hostages held in Gaza, with about one-third believed to be dead. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, United Kingdom and other Western countries.

Chinese online retailer Temu suspended in Vietnam	HANOI, Vietnam — Vietnam has suspended the operations of Chinese online retailer Temu after it failed to meet a government deadline to register the company by the end of November. It is unclear if Temu, a unit of Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, will be allowed to resume its business once it registers. The suspension comes after the ministry had raised concerns about the authenticity of Temu's extremely cheap products and their impact on Vietnamese manufacturers. Temu said Thursday it was working with the Vietnam E-commerce and Digital Economy Agency and the Ministry of Industry and Trade to register its e-commerce services and had submitted required documents. Temu began selling goods in Vietnam in October with aggressive discounts and free shipping. The government had warned the company that its app and website would be blocked if it did not register before an end-of-November deadline, official Vietnam News Agency cited the Ministry of Industry and Trade as saying. On Thursday, Vietnamese language options were removed from Temu's website. A notification on the site said that Temu was working 'with the Vietnam E-commerce and Digital Economy Agency and the Ministry of Industry and Trade to register its provision of e-commerce services in Vietnam.' Temu is being investigated in Europe over suspicions it was failing to prevent the sale of illegal products.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-online-retailer-temu-suspended-in-vietnam/7888146.html	2024-12-05T04:22:58-08:00	
Bitcoin storms above $100,000 as bets on Trump fuel crypto euphoria	Bitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday's Asian morning, boosted by U.S. President-elect Trump's nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was soon at an all-time high of $103,619, a surge of about 6% on the day. It was last fetching $102,650. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record just shy of $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple AAPL.O alone is worth about $3.7 trillion. Bitcoin's march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularized the concept of 'decentralized finance' in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump's sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress. 'We're witnessing a paradigm shift,' said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of U.S. crypto firm Galaxy Digital. 'Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fueled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.' Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the 'crypto capital of the planet' and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. 'We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, U.S. investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,' said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund. Bitcoin's proponents cheered Trump's nomination of Atkins to the SEC. A former SEC commissioner, Atkins has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to 'develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms,' and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. 'Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,' said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith. 'We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation.' A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council. Part of the landscape Bitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns. Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed. Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally. U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election. 'Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money,' said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. 'Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalized,' he said. 'If you fast forward a number of years on trading floors you'll have a sales and trading desk... which will sit alongside FX and rates and commodities.' It is already becoming increasingly financialized, with the launch of bitcoin futures BTCc1 in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock's ETF IBIT.O in November. Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings MARA.O and exchange operator Coinbase COIN.O each up around 65% in November. Software firm Microstrategy MSTO.O, which has repeatedly raised funds to buy bitcoin and held an aggregate of about 402,100 bitcoins as of Dec. 1, has gained around 540% this year. Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. 'Who can prohibit it' The cryptocurrency industry has been criticized for its massive energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, and the underlying technology is yet to deliver a major revolution in the way money moves around the globe. The U.S. and Britain announced on Wednesday they had disrupted what they described as a global money laundering ring which used cryptocurrency to help rich Russians to evade sanction and launder cash for drug traffickers. Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: 'Who can prohibit it? No one.' And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience. 'As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the financial landscape,' said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney. 'I find it very hard to value it ... it's anyone's guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bitcoin-storms-above-100-000-as-bets-on-trump-fuel-crypto-euphoria/7888136.html	2024-12-05T04:09:54-08:00	
Syrian rebels say they have begun to enter crucial city of Hama	AMMAN, Jordan — Syrian rebels said on Thursday they had started pushing into Hama, a major city where pro-government forces backed by intense Russian airstrikes are trying to stave off a new rebel victory and halt the insurgents' lightning advance. Rebel commander Hassan Abdul Ghany posted on social media that the insurgents had begun to penetrate Hama. State media had earlier reported that pro-government forces had repelled an attack. The Syrian military said Thursday there is ‘no truth to reports by rebels saying they entered any neighborhood in Hama.’ Insurgents have been battling to try to enter Hama since Tuesday and there was heavy fighting overnight with the Syrian army and allied Iran-backed militia groups supported by a Russian bombardment, both sides said. Last week, the rebels took the main northern city Aleppo and have since pushed south from their enclave in northwest Syria, reaching a strategic hill just north of Hama on Tuesday and advancing towards the city's east and west flanks on Wednesday. Hama has stayed in government hands throughout the civil war, which erupted in 2011 as a rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad. Its fall to a revived insurgency would send shockwaves through Damascus and its Russian and Iranian allies. The city lies more than a third of the way from Aleppo to Damascus and its capture would open the road to a rebel advance on Homs, the main central city that functions as a crossroads connecting Syria's most populous regions. Hama is also critical to the control of two major towns with big minority religious communities. Those towns are Muhrada, which is home to many Christians, and Salamiya, where there are many Ismaili Muslims. The most powerful rebel faction is the militant Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. Its leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has pledged to protect Syria's religious minorities but many remain fearful of the insurgents. On Wednesday Golani visited Aleppo's historic citadel, a symbolic moment for rebels who were driven out of the city in 2016 after months of siege and intense fighting, their biggest defeat of the war. Aleppo was Syria's biggest city before the war. HTS and the other rebel groups are trying to consolidate their rule in Aleppo, bringing it under the administration of the so-called Salvation Government they established in their northwestern enclave. Aleppo residents have said there are shortages of bread and fuel, and that telecoms services have been cut. Russia and Iran were crucial to Assad's success in recovering most Syrian territory and all main cities from 2015-20, and they have sworn to help him again. But Moscow has been focused on the war in Ukraine, while Iran's most important regional ally Hezbollah, which for years played a critical role shoring up Assad in Syria, has suffered heavy losses to Israel in Lebanon over the past two months. Russian airstrikes across rebel-held areas of northern Syria have sharply intensified over the past week. Iran-backed militia groups from Iraq reinforced front lines after bringing fighters across the border on Monday, Iraqi and Syrian sources said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-rebels-say-they-have-begun-to-enter-crucial-city-of-hama/7888097.html	2024-12-05T03:24:43-08:00	
The troubled history of South Korean presidents	Seoul, South Korea — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is now facing impeachment after a shock bid to suspend civilian rule. But he is far from the first South Korean president to see his rule descend into acrimony and scandal. Here is a recap of the downfalls of previous South Korean leaders. 2016: Park impeached, jailed In December 2016, Park Geun-hye, president since 2013, was impeached by Parliament in a decision confirmed in March 2017 by the Constitutional Court, leading to her indictment and imprisonment. The daughter of the former dictator Park Chung-hee, she was the first woman president of South Korea and had presented herself as incorruptible. But she was accused of receiving or requesting tens of millions of dollars from conglomerates, including Samsung. Additional accusations included sharing classified documents, putting artists critical of her policies on a 'blacklist', and dismissing officials who opposed her. Park was sentenced in 2021 to 20 years in prison and slapped with heavy fines. But at the end of that year she was pardoned by her successor, Moon Jae-in. Yoon, the current president, was a Seoul prosecutor at the time and played a key role in her dismissal and subsequent incarceration. Lee Myung-bak: 15 years in prison In power from 2008 to 2013, Park's conservative predecessor Lee Myung-bak was sentenced in October 2018 to 15 years in prison for corruption. Most notably, he was found guilty of having received bribes from Samsung in exchange for favors to the conglomerate's then chairman, Lee Kun-hee, who had been convicted of tax evasion. The former leader was pardoned by President Yoon in December 2022. Roh Moo-hyun: suicide President from 2003 to 2008 and a strong supporter of rapprochement with North Korea, liberal Roh Moo-hyun killed himself by throwing himself off a cliff in May 2009. He had found himself the target of an investigation into the payment by a wealthy shoe manufacturer of $1 million to his wife and $5 million to the husband of one of his nieces. 1987: autocrat Chun retires Military strongman Chun Doo-hwan, known as the 'Butcher of Gwangju' for ordering his troops to put down an uprising against his rule in the southwestern city, agreed to step down in 1987 in the face of mass demonstrations. He handed over power to his protege Roh Tae-woo. Roh and Chun had been close for decades, first meeting as classmates at military academy during the Korean War. In 1996 both men were convicted of treason over the 1979 coup that brought Chun to power, the Gwangju uprising in 1980, corruption and other offences. Roh was sentenced to 22.5 years in jail, reduced to 17, while Chun was condemned to death, commuted to life in prison. They were later granted amnesty in 1998 having spent just two years behind bars. 1979: dictator Park assassinated Park Chung-hee was assassinated in October 1979 by his own spy chief during a private dinner. The events of that night have been long a subject of heated debate in South Korea, particularly over whether the murder was premeditated. Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo were army generals at the time and took advantage of the political confusion to plot a coup in December 1979. 1961: Yun overthrown in a coup President Yun Po-sun was overthrown in 1961 by a coup led by army officer Park Chung-hee. Park kept Yun in his post but effectively took control of the government, and then replaced him after winning an election in 1963. 1960: exile of first president South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, elected in 1948, was forced to resign by a popular student-led uprising in 1960, after attempting to extend his term through rigged elections. Rhee was forced into exile in Hawaii, where he died in 1965.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-troubled-history-of-south-korean-presidents/7888069.html	2024-12-05T02:29:28-08:00	
China urges US to 'stop sending wrong signals' over Taiwan after Lai-Johnson call	BEIJING — China on Thursday urged the United States to 'stop sending wrong signals' over Taiwan, after the announcement that Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson held a call with the self-ruled island's President Lai Ching-te. Lai is currently visiting the American territory Guam during a Pacific tour that has angered China. Taiwan's Presidential Office confirmed to AFP Thursday that the call had taken place, without elaborating on the discussion. Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to bring the self-governed island under its control one day. Beijing's foreign ministry on Thursday urged Washington to 'deliver on the promises of American leaders not to support Taiwan independence, to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and to stop sending wrong signals to Taiwan separatist forces.' Spokesperson Lin Jian said the U.S. should 'clearly recognize the serious danger that separatist acts of Taiwan independence pose to peace and security across the Taiwan Strait.' 'The Taiwan issue is the very core of China's core interests,' he said at the regular press briefing, adding that China would take 'resolute and effective measures' to defend its sovereignty. The United States does not have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan but has an arrangement to provide the island with the means to defend itself. In a separate statement on Thursday, China's foreign ministry announced sanctions on U.S. companies and individuals for selling arms to Taiwan. The sanctions target 13 firms engaged in the production of drones, unmanned aerial systems, and other military products. They also cover six top executives at companies including Raytheon and BAE Systems. The sanctioned companies will have their assets in China frozen and be banned from trading with Chinese firms, while the executives will also be banned from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macau, the statement said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-us-to-stop-sending-wrong-signals-over-taiwan-after-lai-johnson-call/7888052.html	2024-12-05T02:00:31-08:00	
Millions in Cuba remain in dark after nationwide blackout	HAVANA — Cuba said it was generating only enough electricity to cover about 1/6th of peak demand late on Wednesday, hours after its national grid collapsed leaving millions without power. The National Electric Union (UNE) said it was producing 533 MW of electricity by evening, still just a fraction of typical dinnertime demand of between 3,000 and 3,200 megawatts, leaving a majority of Cubans in the dark as night fell across the Caribbean island. Earlier, the communist-run government said it would prioritize returning power to hospitals and water pumping facilities. Schools and non-essential government services were closed until further notice. Lights flickered on across parts of the capital Havana late on Wednesday. The local electric company said more than 260,000 clients had seen power restored. It was the latest in a string of nationwide blackouts of Cuba's antiquated and increasingly frail power generation system. This year, Cuba's grid fell into near-total disarray, stressed by fuel shortages, natural disaster and economic crisis. Dwindling oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico pushed the island's obsolete and struggling oil-fired power plants into full crisis several months ago. Hours-long rolling blackouts and severe shortages of food, medicine and water have made life increasingly unbearable for many Cubans, who in recent years have fled the island in record-breaking numbers. Cuba blames the crisis on U.S. sanctions, which complicate financial transactions and the purchase of fuel. Plant failure The Wednesday morning blackout was triggered by a failure at the Antonio Guiteras power plant in Matanzas, the island's top electricity producer, which shut down at around 2 a.m. local time. Several other major power plants were undergoing maintenance and were offline when the Matanzas plant failed, starving the grid of electricity and leading to the nationwide collapse, the energy minister said. Havana hotel worker Danielis Mora woke up frustrated and confused, like many Havana residents, who experience regular blackouts. 'I didn't know it was a total blackout again,' Mora said. 'Where I am living ... there is no gas either, if there is no electricity there is no way to make food, it has to be with firewood, or charcoal.' Scattered protests have erupted over the past two months over the repeated power failures as well as water, gas and food shortages. Cuba's decrepit and long obsolete grid collapsed multiple times in October as fuel supplies dwindled and Hurricane Oscar struck the far eastern end of the island, then again in November with the passage of Hurricane Rafael. Cuba`s government last week issued a decree ordering state and private businesses to generate more of their own electricity from renewable resources. The regulations also require businesses to limit their use of air conditioning, among other measures, as the country wrestles with the increasingly dire energy crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/millions-in-cuba-remain-in-dark-after-nationwide-blackout/7888055.html	2024-12-05T01:58:32-08:00	
Prime Minister Barnier to resign as France's political crisis deepens	PARIS — French Prime Minister Michel Barnier will resign on Thursday after far-right and leftist lawmakers voted to topple his government, plunging the euro zone's second-largest economy deeper into political crisis. Barnier, a veteran politician who was formerly the European Union's Brexit negotiator, will be the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history after he hands in his resignation at around 10 a.m. No French government had lost a confidence vote since Georges Pompidou's in 1962. The political turmoil further weakens a European Union already reeling from the implosion of Germany's coalition government, and comes weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The hard left and far right punished Barnier in a no-confidence vote on Wednesday evening for trying to push an unpopular budget through an unruly hung parliament without a vote. The draft budget had sought $63 billion in savings in a drive to shrink a gaping deficit. Barnier's resignation caps weeks of tensions over the budget, which Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally said was too harsh on working people. It also further weakens the standing of President Emmanuel Macron, who precipitated the ongoing crisis with an ill-fated decision to call a snap election in June. Macron, who faces growing calls to resign, has a mandate until 2027 and cannot be pushed out. Still, the long-running political debacle has left him a diminished figure. An online poll carried out just after the no-confidence motion showed 64% of voters want Macron to resign. 'The main culprit for the current situation is Emmanuel Macron,' Le Pen told TF1 TV late on Wednesday. 'The dissolution (of parliament in June) and censorship (of the government) are the consequence of his policies and of the considerable divide which exists today between him and the French.' A small majority of voters approved parliament bringing down Barnier, but many were still worried about its economic and political consequence, the Toluna Harris Interactive poll for RTL broadcaster showed. France now risks ending the year without a stable government or a 2025 budget, although the constitution allows special measures that would avert a U.S.-style government shutdown. Three sources told Reuters that Macron aimed to install a new prime minister swiftly, with one saying he wanted to name a premier before a ceremony to reopen the Notre-Dame Cathedral on Saturday, which Trump is due to attend. But any new prime minister will face the same challenges as Barnier in getting bills, including the 2025 budget, adopted by a divided parliament. There can be no new parliamentary election before July. 'Until potential new elections, ongoing political uncertainty is likely to keep the risk premium on French assets elevated,' SocGen analysts said in a note. 'Political uncertainty is likely to dampen both investment and consumer spending.' The political uncertainty has already been unnerving investors in French sovereign bonds and stocks for weeks. French conservative politician Xavier Bertrand said he felt a mix of anger and shame over the no-confidence vote. 'It's as if the two extremes, (the hard left) France Unbowed and the National Rally, have become the center of political life,' he told BFM TV.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prime-minister-barnier-to-resign-as-france-s-political-crisis-deepens/7888048.html	2024-12-05T01:45:36-08:00	
South Korea’s ruling party opposes impeachment of president over martial law debacle	Seoul, South Korea — Leaders of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s political party say they will not back a motion by the opposition party to impeach the embattled president over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law. Han Dong-hun, the leader of the conservative People Power Party, called Yoon’s shock decision this week 'unconstitutional' when speaking to reporters Thursday, and said he had asked the president to leave the party. But both he and Choo Kyung-ho, the PPP’s parliamentary floor leaders, said none of the party’s 108 members will vote on the resolution brought by the Democratic Party. The impeachment resolution is expected to come up for a vote Saturday. The Democratic Party and its allies hold a huge majority in the 300-seat National Assembly, and need only a few defectors from the PPP to pass the resolution. Eighteen PPP lawmakers who are part of an internal anti-Yoon faction were among the 190 lawmakers who voted to rescind the president’s martial law decree early Wednesday morning, just hours after the announcement. If Yoon is impeached, he will be suspended from office and replaced by Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. The case will then go to the Constitutional Court, which will decide on whether or not Yoon should remain in office. If he is convicted, new elections will be held within 60 days to replace him. In a late Tuesday address, Yoon justified his decree by citing the need to eradicate 'anti-state forces' and 'protect the constitutional democratic order.' Less than six hours later, after the country's parliament overturned the martial law decree, Yoon backed down saying the decree would be lifted and martial law forces withdrawn. The developments stunned political observers in South Korea, a U.S. ally accustomed to political gridlock but unaccustomed to such drastic measures. It marked the first declaration of martial law in South Korea since the country made the transition to democracy in the 1980s. The decree — which sought to ban political activities and place media under military control — triggered a frantic response at the unicameral National Assembly. Shortly after his address, South Korean military forces descended on the legislative compound, with some reportedly arriving by helicopter, according to a VOA reporter on the scene. Security forces attempted to bar entry to lawmakers and others. Despite minor scuffles at the main gate, opposition lawmakers eventually forced their way inside, with some livestreaming on social media as they climbed over gates and through windows to reach the legislative chambers. Less than three hours after Yoon's declaration, the lawmakers voted to lift the decree. Under South Korea's constitution, the president is required to comply when a majority of lawmakers vote to overturn martial law. The presidential office said Thursday that Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who reportedly proposed the idea of martial law to President Yoon, had resigned and would be replaced by retired general Choi Byung Hyuk, who is currently serving as South Korea’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho, who is currently serving as acting defense minister, told a parliamentary committee Thursday that Kim Yong-hyun also made the decision to deploy troops to the National Assembly. The Democratic Party has also submitted a resolution to impeach Kim Yong-hyun. South Korea’s national police said Thursday they were investigating Yoon and Kim Yong-hyun on charges of treason for their roles in the martial law decree. Also under investigation are Army Chief of Staff General Park An-su and Interior Minister Lee Sang-min. Prosecutors have imposed a travel ban on Kim Yong-hyun. Since taking office in May 2022, Yoon, a former chief prosecutor known for his blunt rhetoric, has faced fierce political battles with the opposition and suffered from persistently low approval ratings. His critics have seized on corruption allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon-hee, and accused him of mistreating the media. In turn, Yoon has frequently portrayed his critics as North Korea sympathizers and 'anti-state' forces. Yoon's position in the legislature was further weakened in April when the PPP suffered a major defeat in legislative by-elections. A poll released on Thursday by Realmeter, a Seoul-based public opinion research organization, suggested that 74% of South Koreans support impeaching Yoon over the martial law incident. However, crucially, 50% of conservatives oppose the impeachment, suggesting that Yoon still holds the support of many conservatives. Protests that began almost immediately after Yoon’s declaration are continuing to expand. A series of activist and civil society groups have called for nightly 'candlelight protests' until Yoon resigns. The protests are expected to be biggest on the weekend.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-ruling-party-opposes-impeachment-of-president-over-martial-law-debacle/7888017.html	2024-12-04T23:47:01-08:00	
Azerbaijan denounces diplomatic criticism of human rights	Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry denounced on Wednesday criticism by Western ambassadors of the country's human rights record, saying the diplomats' comments amounted to interference in its judicial system. A ministry statement posted on the Telegram messaging app said ambassadors from the United States, European Union and Switzerland made the comments at an event in Baku, referring to the detention of journalists and 'political activists.' The statement followed news that a veteran human rights advocate, Rufat Safarov, had been placed in pre-trial detention for four months following his arrest on Monday. It was the latest of a series of cases in Azerbaijan that have prompted Western concern about free speech and human rights. 'These statements are an open attempt to undermine the independent judicial system in Azerbaijan,' the foreign ministry statement said. 'Interference in the course of an investigation is unacceptable and interference in the judicial process contradicts the principle of the rule of law, the fundamental principle of a law-based state.' It was not immediately possible to determine what the ambassadors had said at the event. Earlier on Wednesday, a lawyer for Safarov told Reuters that Safarov had pleaded not guilty in a Baku court to charges of fraud and hooliganism and intended to appeal. Safarov was detained a little more than a week after the close in Baku of the major U.N. climate change conference COP29. In the run-up to the conference, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev denounced as 'disgusting' a letter from U.S. lawmakers criticizing his country's human rights record and calling for the release of political prisoners. Safarov, a former prosecutor, served three years in prison on bribery charges before being pardoned by Aliyev and released in 2019. Media reports said he had been due to leave within days for the United States to be presented with a human rights award. U.S. State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told a news briefing in Washington on Tuesday that Washington was 'deeply concerned' by his detention. 'And we continue to urge Azerbaijan to release all of those unjustly detained and to cease its crackdown on civil society, including human rights defenders and journalists,' Patel said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijan-denounces-diplomatic-criticism-of-human-rights/7888014.html	2024-12-04T23:24:55-08:00	
ASEAN ministers to discuss Myanmar at Thailand meeting, Indonesia says	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Members of the Southeast Asian regional bloc ASEAN are planning to hold a ministerial meeting in Thailand later this month to discuss the crisis in member-nation Myanmar, Indonesia's foreign ministry spokesperson Roy Soemirat told reporters Thursday. At the invitation of current ASEAN host Laos, the meeting will talk about ways to approach the crisis which has gripped Myanmar since a 2021 military coup, including on the implementation of ASEAN's five-point consensus plan, he said. The consensus has made scant progress since its unveiling in April 2021, just months after Myanmar's military unseated the elected government. The junta has been battling a rebellion that erupted after it seized power. The military government the past two years largely has ignored calls by its Southeast Asian neighbors to cease hostilities and enter into dialogue with its opponents. During an ASEAN summit in October, the bloc called for 'an immediate cessation' of violence and the creation of a 'conducive environment for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and inclusive national dialogue' that is 'Myanmar-owned and –led.' The meeting is expected to start on December 20, Roy said, and Indonesia's foreign minister is expected to attend.	https://www.voanews.com/a/asean-ministers-to-discuss-myanmar-at-thailand-meeting-indonesia-says/7888006.html	2024-12-04T22:53:08-08:00	
Hong Kong leader sacks 2 senior officials in aim to 'do better'	HONG KONG — Hong Kong leader John Lee said on Thursday he had replaced two senior officials in an unexpected move that he said would maximize social and economic benefits and help the city 'catch up' with other tourism destinations. Hong Kong has struggled to revive its appeal among international tourists after sometimes violent mass protests in 2019 and strict travel rules imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee told reporters at a press conference that he had been 'observing the situation for quite some time' before deciding to replace Kevin Yeung, secretary for culture, sports and tourism and Lam Sai-hung, secretary for transport and logistics. 'We have gone through the epidemic, protests in 2019, we need to catch up. I want to create the biggest societal and economic benefit for Hong Kong,' Lee said. Mable Chan will take over as transport secretary, while Rosanna Law will be the new sports, culture and tourism secretary, Lee said. Both women have worked for the government for more than 30 years. 'We strive to do better all the time,' Lee added. 'The two new secretaries will make good use of their leadership and their ability to explain policies clearly.' The government has been trying to draw international visitors with a series of sporting and cultural events as well as large scale conferences. Authorities are planning a large-scale panda carnival from December 11-21 to capitalize on the six pandas currently living at a theme park in the city. Two were born in Hong Kong earlier this year, while Beijing loaned two more to the city in September. Some 36.68 million tourists have visited Hong Kong in the 10 months to the end of October 2024, according to latest government data. Authorities have said they hope to reach 46 million arrivals this year. The numbers remain below the highs seen before the protests and the pandemic. In 2018, Hong Kong recorded more than 65 million arrivals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-leader-sacks-2-senior-officials-in-aim-to-do-better-/7887999.html	2024-12-04T22:36:04-08:00	
Japan's sake joins UNESCO's cultural heritage list	LUQUE, PARAGUAY — Sake is perhaps more Japanese than the world-famous sushi. It's brewed in centuries-old mountaintop warehouses, savored in the country's pub-like izakayas, poured during weddings and served slightly chilled for special toasts. The smooth rice wine that plays a crucial role in Japan's culinary traditions was enshrined on Wednesday by UNESCO on its list of the 'intangible cultural heritage of humanity.' At a meeting in Luque, Paraguay, members of UNESCO's committee for safeguarding humanity's cultural heritage voted to recognize 45 cultural practices and products around the world, including Brazilian white cheese, Caribbean cassava bread and Palestinian olive oil soap. Unlike UNESCO's World Heritage List, which includes sites considered important to humanity like the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Intangible Cultural Heritage designation names products and practices of different cultures that are deserving of recognition. A Japanese delegation welcomed the announcement in Luque. 'Sake is considered a divine gift and is essential for social and cultural events in Japan,' Kano Takehiro, the Japanese ambassador to UNESCO, told The Associated Press. The basic ingredients of sake are few: rice, water, yeast and koji, a rice mold, which breaks down the starches into fermentable sugars like malting does in beer production. The whole two-month-long process of steaming, stirring, fermenting and pressing can be grueling. The rice — which wields tremendous marketing power as part of Japan's broader cultural identity — is key to the alcoholic brew. For a product to be categorized Japanese sake, the rice must be Japanese. The UNESCO recognition, the delegation said, captured more than the craft knowledge of making high-quality sake. It also honored a tradition dating back some 1,000 years — sake makes a cameo in Japan's famous 11th century novel, The Tale of Genji, as the drink of choice in the refined Heian court. Now, officials hope to restore sake's image as Japan's premier alcoholic drink even as the younger drinkers in the country switch to imported wine or domestic beer and whiskey. 'It means a lot to Japan and to the Japanese,' Takehiro said of the UNESCO designation. 'This will help to renew interest in traditional sake elaboration.' Also, Japanese breweries have expressed hope that the listing could give a little lift to the country's export economy as the popularity of sake booms around the world and in the United States amid heightened interest in Japanese cuisine. Sake exports, mostly to the U.S. and China, now rake in over $265 million a year, according to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, a trade group. Japan's delegation appeared ready to celebrate on Wednesday — in classic Japanese style. After the announcement, Takehiro raised a cypress box full of sake to toast the alcoholic brew and cultural rite.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-sake-joins-unesco-s-cultural-heritage-list/7887968.html	2024-12-04T20:10:23-08:00	
Analysts: China's push for peace in Myanmar draws skepticism	WASHINGTON — Offers from two armed resistance groups in Myanmar to participate in Chinese-brokered peace talks with the ruling junta are seen by analysts as the result of mounting pressure from Beijing and unlikely to end the wider insurgency. The Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) credited China's mediation efforts when it announced its readiness for peace talks on November 25, shortly after junta leader Min Aung Hlaing visited Beijing. The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) made a similar announcement on Tuesday. Both groups are members of the Brotherhood Alliance, which has been involved in a broad offensive against the junta since October 2023. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Wednesday that Beijing welcomed the MNDAA's 'positive remarks,' but he emphasized the need to protect Chinese interests. 'Relevant parties must avoid endangering the security of China's border areas, Chinese nationals and projects in Myanmar,' Lin said, adding that China will continue supporting the peace process. China's approach to Myanmar's crisis China maintains close ties with Myanmar's military and the rebel groups near its border. The MNDAA represents a Mandarin-speaking Han Chinese ethnic group native to the region and known as Kokang. Recent reports indicate Beijing is exerting greater control over the rebel groups, known as ethnic armed organizations, or EAOs. Allegations surfaced that the leader of the MNDAA had been placed under house arrest in China — a claim Chinese officials deny. Myanmar-based political analyst Than Soe Naing attributed China's evolving stance to its concern over resistance forces' recent victories. 'The fall of the Northeastern Command of the Myanmar military exposed the junta's vulnerability,' he said. 'This realization pushed China to prevent a potential collapse of the regime.' Than Soe Naing added: 'The military council agrees to everything China demands, guaranteeing Beijing access to its goals.' Hla Kyaw Zaw, a China-based expert on China-Myanmar relations, said Beijing is pressuring both the junta and EAOs to negotiate. 'Beijing's goal is to bring all parties to the table,' she said, noting that a recent call for 'eternal peace' from the junta leader notably lacked his usual demand that the rebels lay down their arms. She said that likely reflected Chinese influence. The MNDAA's and TNLA's willingness to negotiate comes as China blocks critical supply routes for items such as food and medicine. According to various observers, this has weakened the rebels both militarily and politically, making them more likely to comply with Beijing's demands. The International Institute for Strategic Studies noted in a July report that China had restricted cross-border trade in response to EAO offensives. A Myanmar doctoral candidate and researcher specializing in regional conflict studies, who requested anonymity for safety reasons, described China's current pressure on the EAOs as 'the most formidable in recent times.' The pressure 'is particularly intense on groups near the Chinese border, such as the TNLA and MNDAA,' the researcher said. Economic and political stakes China's economic interests, particularly its investments in the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor and Belt and Road Initiative projects in Rakhine State in western Myanmar, are key drivers of its peace initiatives. However, analysts say Beijing's influence on EAOs is not absolute. Than Soe Naing and Hla Kyaw Zaw both noted that the Rakhine-based Arakan Army (AA) is less vulnerable to Chinese pressure than the border groups because of its location, control over key interests, and strategic ties with India and Bangladesh. 'This combination of geographical distance — about 2,000 kilometers — and its autonomous military and economic stance makes China approach the AA with significant caution,' said Than Soe Naing. Hla Kyaw Zaw also noted that the AA's resilience stems from strong local support. 'Unlike border groups, the AA isn't shielded by China, making it vulnerable to military aerial attacks, but its backing from the Rakhine people gives it legitimacy,' she said. The AA continues its offensive in western Myanmar, claiming control of 10 townships and fighting to secure seven more, including four largely under its control. According to the Institute for Strategy and Policy - Myanmar, an independent think tank, the AA had gained partial control over nine out of 11 Chinese projects in Rakhine State as of August 18. Hla Kyaw Zaw and Than Soe Naing also pointed out that the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), another major EAO in northern Myanmar, continues its offensive against the junta and has taken control of key border crossings to China. Although China exerts the same pressure on the KIA, the Kachin group retains leverage due to its economic independence and stronghold in resource-rich regions. Both analysts remain unconvinced that peace can be achieved under external pressure. 'The truce calls by the EAOs address immediate survival needs but fail to tackle long-term aspirations like federalism,' said Than Soe Naing. Hla Kyaw Zaw echoed these doubts. 'The junta's refusal to share power remains the primary obstacle,' she said. 'Peace brought about by pressure cannot last long.' 'The KIA's control over jade mining in Kachin and the AA's position in Rakhine give them leverage to resist Chinese demands,' said Than Soe Naing. 'These groups are not entirely dependent on Beijing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-china-s-push-for-peace-in-myanmar-draws-skepticism/7887961.html	2024-12-04T19:49:38-08:00

VOA Exclusive: US House Speaker Mike Johnson speaks with Taiwan president	State Department — The United States has dismissed Chinese objections to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's stopovers in Hawaii and Guam during a Pacific tour, reaffirming that transits through the U.S. by Taiwan’s democratically elected leaders are routine and consistent with long-standing bipartisan U.S. policy. Amid China’s criticism, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and former Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi each spoke separately with Lai, underscoring steadfast U.S. support for Taiwan. Johnson held a call Wednesday afternoon with Lai, who had recently arrived in Guam following a visit to Taiwan’s Pacific ally, Tuvalu, according to sources who spoke with VOA on the condition of anonymity. First call The call marked the first direct conversation between the House speaker and Lai since the latter assumed office in May. Johnson had previously congratulated Lai upon his election in January and renewed the United States’ commitment to the security and democracy of its Indo-Pacific partners. Lai arrived in Guam on Wednesday night for a brief layover and is set to depart Thursday afternoon for Palau, the final stop on his weeklong Pacific tour. The trip, which began on November 30, also included stops in Hawaii and the Marshall Islands. This marks Lai's first overseas trip as president. VOA has reached out to Johnson’s office for comment. Bipartisan US policy 'Every democratically elected Taiwan president has transited the United States,' a State Department spokesperson told VOA this week. Guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three U.S.-China Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances, the spokesperson added that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has remained consistent across administrations for 45 years. Senior U.S. officials have also noted that these documents — the foundations of Washington’s 'One China' policy — contain no language explicitly prohibiting a Taiwan president from stopping over in a U.S. city. Beijing opposition Beijing, however, accused Washington of interfering in what it calls its 'internal affairs.' Chinese officials said they 'firmly oppose' any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province. 'Nothing will deter China from upholding national sovereignty and territorial integrity,' Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters this week. Taiwan has said China's threats over Lai’s visit are counterproductive. Garnering US support Lai's transits through Hawaii and Guam come as he seeks to garner support from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has said Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection. In a closed-door address at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Lai expressed Taiwan’s commitment to deepening cooperation with the U.S. and contributing to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the broader Indo-Pacific region. Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a prominent China hawk, has sponsored legislation supporting high-level visits by Taiwanese officials to the U.S. and advocating stronger U.S. policy toward Taiwan amid mounting Chinese military and diplomatic pressure. When asked by VOA if he would maintain his support for Taiwan, Rubio said, 'The president sets foreign policy, and our job at the State [Department] will be to execute it.' Despite facing sanctions from China, Rubio expressed confidence in finding solutions to engage with Beijing if confirmed. Restrictions on Washington Under long-standing, self-imposed restrictions by the State Department, a stopover in the capital by a sitting Taiwanese president is considered highly provocative to Beijing. No sitting Taiwan president, vice president, premier or ministers of foreign affairs and defense has visited Washington for formal meetings while in office. 'I know there's some diplomatic rules related to leaders of Taiwan coming to the United States,' Republican Representative Andy Barr, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told VOA. 'I think we need to remove any of those impediments. I think President Lai should be able to come to the United States, and we should welcome him.' The Communist Party-led People’s Republic of China has never governed Taiwan but claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democracy. The U.S. has 'acknowledged' but never endorsed China’s sovereignty claim over Taiwan. Washington maintains a 'One China' policy distinct from Beijing’s One China principle, taking no official position on Taiwan’s sovereignty and not supporting Taiwan independence. VOA’s congressional correspondent Katherine Gypson and Mandarin Service reporter Yihua Lee contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-exclusive-us-house-speaker-mike-johnson-speaks-with-taiwan-president/7887888.html	2024-12-04T16:35:51-08:00

Analysts troubled by trend of internet, social media shutdowns in Africa	WASHINGTON — Amid widespread protests in Kenya this summer over a controversial finance bill, the country's Communications Authority announced it did not intend to shut down internet access. The next day, however, Kenya experienced a countrywide loss in internet connectivity. The main internet service providers said the outage on June 25 was caused by an issue with undersea cables. But the incident caught the attention of digital rights groups, who said the timing of the outage 'strongly suggests' an intentional action. Various governments have used such shutdowns to maintain control, these groups say. Many governments justify the shutdowns as moves to promote public order and safety, Nompilo Simanje, Africa advocacy and partnerships lead at the International Press Institute, told VOA. 'The key reasons really are to restrict communication, restrict free expression, restrict online mobilization, restrict online freedom of assembly and association, and also restrict access to information,' she said. Access 'could be about life and death' Digital watchdogs have documented several cases across the African continent in recent months where access to the internet or social media was blocked or cut off at crucial moments. It isn't always clear if the cases are the result of a direct order, but the timing often suggests it is, analysts say. Within the past year, digital rights group Access Now has documented shutdowns in Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Mauritius and Equatorial Guinea. Nearly all take place alongside events such as protests or elections. But these shutdowns can be harmful to the country's residents, Felicia Anthonio, campaign manager at Access Now, told VOA. 'It not only disrupts the flow of information, it also makes it impossible for people to access information in a timely manner,' Anthonio said. 'When we are talking about crisis situations, information can be like a lifeline, and so, disrupting access could be about life and death in conflict situations.' Governments that restrict internet access in one instance are likely to do so again, Anthonio said. Before the June incident in Kenya, access to the messaging app Telegram was blocked in November 2023 during national examinations. At the time, the move was presented as a way to prevent cheating during exams. Access to Telegram was stifled again last month during national examinations, which lasted over three weeks and extended into the week after examinations finished, according to James Wamathai, advocacy director for the Bloggers Association of Kenya. 'It was really a huge inconvenience,' Wamathai, who lives in the capital, Nairobi, told VOA. Local media reported that Kenya's Communications Authority had ordered the block to prevent cheating. Many people were unable to contact friends or relatives who lived in countries that had banned WhatsApp. Kenyans do not have a lot of experience with internet shutdowns, Wamathai told VOA, and many residents do not know how to install workarounds like virtual private networks or VPNs. The current government under President William Ruto is the first to enact such restrictions, he said. Kenya is a part of the Freedom Online Coalition, a group of 42 countries that advocate for online freedom around the world. Anthonio said it is 'depressing and sad' to see a member of the coalition engage in such practices. The Kenyan Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Anthonio said democratic and repressive regimes alike have enforced restrictions similar to those experienced in Kenya. 'It's really hard to tell what the motivation is, aside from the fact that the government just wants to exert control to show that they are in authority and can restrict people's rights when they please,' Anthonio said. Mauritius for example, planned to impose an internet shutdown for 10 days ahead of its November election. Authorities said the block was an effort to control illegal publications that may 'threaten national security and public safety,' Anthonio said. She added that this rationale is just 'jargon' that governments use to justify shutdowns. The shutdown in Mauritius came as a direct order from the government. After protests from media and opposition parties, the ban was lifted after 24 hours. The ban was troubling to rights groups. Simanje of IPI said Mauritius 'has generally had a very good track record of internet access, online safety and promotion of digital rights.' Periodic outages Other African countries have experienced shutdowns on several occasions. In Tanzania, Access Now has documented several internet and social media outages or blocks. Access to the social media platform X was blocked in late August, around the same time that online activists began a campaign highlighting murders, kidnappings and disappearances within the country. This suggested the block was an official order, Access Now reported at the time. Tanzania's embassy in Washington refutes that claim. 'We would like to assure you that this information is false,' a spokesperson told VOA via email. In July and August, the island of Annobon in Equatorial Guinea experienced a total internet shutdown, leaving its residents 'completely cut off from the world,' according to Access Now. This came as a response to protests against the deterioration of the country's environment due to mining activities, Anthonio said. Similarly in late October, Mozambique experienced internet connectivity problems after national election results were announced. These shutdowns took place in the middle of violent protests against the reelection of the party in power, which left at least 11 people dead, according to a report by Al Jazeera. The Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique and Mauritius embassies in Washington did not respond to VOA's requests for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-troubled-by-trend-of-internet-social-media-shutdowns-in-africa/7887615.html	2024-12-04T15:31:34-08:00	
US senators vow action after briefing on Chinese Salt Typhoon telecom hacking	WASHINGTON — U.S. government agencies held a classified briefing for all senators on Wednesday on China's alleged efforts known as Salt Typhoon to burrow deep into American telecommunications companies and steal data about U.S. calls. The FBI, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, Federal Communications Commission Chair Jessica Rosenworcel, the National Security Council and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency were among the participants in the closed-door briefing, officials told Reuters. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden told reporters after the briefing he was working to draft legislation on this issue, while Senator Bob Casey said he had 'great concern' about the breach and added it may not be until next year before Congress can address the issue. Republican Senator Rick Scott expressed frustration with the briefing. 'They have not told us why they didn't catch it; what they could have done to prevent it,' he said. Chinese officials have previously described the allegations as disinformation and said Beijing 'firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cyber theft in all forms.' Separately, a Senate Commerce subcommittee will hold a December 11 hearing on Salt Typhoon and how 'security threats pose risks to our communications networks and review best practices.' The hearing will include Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan. There is growing concern about the size and scope of the reported Chinese hacking into U.S. telecommunications networks and questions about when companies and the government can assure Americans over the matter. A U.S. official told reporters a large number of Americans' metadata has been stolen in the sweeping cyber espionage campaign, adding that dozens of companies across the world had been hit by the hackers, including at least eight telecommunications and telecom infrastructure firms in the United States. 'The extent and depth and breadth of Chinese hacking is absolutely mind-boggling — that we would permit as much as has happened in just the last year is terrifying,' Senator Richard Blumenthal said. Incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr said Wednesday he will work 'with national security agencies through the transition and next year in an effort to root out the threat and secure our networks.' U.S. officials have previously alleged the hackers targeted Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Lumen and others and stole phone audio intercepts along with a large tranche of call record data. T-Mobile said it does not believe hackers got access to its customer information. Lumen said there is no evidence customer data was accessed on its network. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg, AT&T CEO John Stankey, Lumen CEO Kate Johnson and T-Mobile took part in a November 22 White House meeting on the issue. Verizon said 'several weeks ago, we became aware that a highly sophisticated, nation-state actor accessed several of the nation’s telecom company networks, including Verizon' adding the incident was focused on a very small subset of individuals in government and politics. AT&T said it is 'working in close coordination with federal law enforcement, industry peers and cyber security experts to identify and remediate any impact on our networks.' CISA told reporters on Tuesday that it could not offer a timetable for ridding America's telecom networks of all hackers. 'It would be impossible for us to predict when we'll have full eviction,' CISA official Jeff Greene said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senators-vow-action-after-briefing-on-chinese-salt-typhoon-telecom-hacking/7887625.html	2024-12-04T15:29:47-08:00	
Concerns grow in Iraq over escalating violence in Syria	WASHINGTON — With Syria’s second largest city of Aleppo now under control of rebel forces and militants, officials in neighboring Iraq are expressing concerns about potential spillover effects in their already unstable country. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said Tuesday during a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Iraq will not be a mere spectator regarding the grave developments in Syria,' adding that his country 'will make all efforts to preserve its security and that of Syria.' Other senior Iraqi officials have voiced support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government since it faced swift advances by rebel forces in the northwestern part of the country last week. Reports have emerged of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, mostly with the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Forces, or the PMF, moving into Syria in support of the Damascus government. Rasha al Aqeedi, research associate at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said official statements and verified footage 'indicate Iraqi forces have moved en masse to the borders, but nothing yet shows that any factions have actually entered Syria.' PMF leaders and other Iraqi officials have denied that any Iraqi armed groups have entered Syria. Iraq, which shares a roughly 600-kilometer border with Syria, has maintained close ties with the Syrian government throughout 13 years of civil conflict. Baghdad is also a close ally of Iran, itself a key backer of the Syrian government. Islamic State Foremost among Iraqi concerns is a resurgent Islamic State, which once controlled vast swaths of territory in both Iraq and Syria. That group, which also goes by IS, ISIS, ISIL and Daesh, could be motivated to reassert its presence, 'to show the world it still exists as its rival factions are active,' said Aqeedi. However, Aqeedi also told VOA that Iraq would be unwise to move security forces to the Syrian border because that could create a vacuum for IS to exploit in places like Nineveh and Kirkuk, which could become vulnerable to hit-and-run attacks. According to Mohammed Kakai, member of the Nineveh Provincial Council’s Security Committee, Iraqi military officials in Mosul and its Nineveh Province have already expanded security measures along the Syrian border to prevent violence from spilling over. 'Thermal security cameras have been installed on the entire border of Nineveh Province with Syria,' he told VOA, adding that Iraqi 'border guards are ready for any threat on Mosul and Iraq as a whole.' Kakai added that Iraqi authorities have stepped up coordination efforts with Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, who control part of the Syrian side of the border. 'There is a joint operation room between our forces and the SDF. We share intelligence on any threat,' he said. Saif al-Saadi, a Baghdad-based Iraqi affairs analyst, says there are legal limitations to Iraq’s engagement in the Syrian conflict. 'According to Article 8 of the Iraqi constitution, Iraq must adhere to neighborly relations and not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and seek to resolve conflicts peacefully,' he told VOA. He added that the prime minister of Iraq, 'who is the head of the armed forces, is required by law to protect the border and prevent armed groups such as the PMF from going to Syria, because this could have adverse effects on Iraq.' Kawa Omar in Mosul, Iraq, and Balen Salih in Washington contributed to this story, which originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/concerns-grow-in-iraq-over-escalating-violence-in-syria/7887624.html	2024-12-04T15:23:10-08:00

Chad activists fight violence against women	Yaounde, Cameroon — Activists in Chad have launched a campaign to educate clerics and traditional rulers against early marriages, female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices on women. The campaign is part of the United Nations '16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence.' Government officials in Chad say about 70% of girls under 16 are forced into marriage to men who are at times older than their parents. More than 25% of women in the conflict-ridden country say they have been sexually abused. That’s why 27-year-old Voyang Claudine told a crowd at the N'djamena Central Market to fearlessly denounce all forms of abuses on women and girls. She said women activists in Chad strongly condemn early marriages and what she calls a culture of gang rape spreading through conflict-ridden towns and villages in Chad. Claudine is a victim of sexual violence and spokesperson for the Association of Chad’s Indigenous Women. She said more than half of the women who asked the association for help were either sexually assaulted or raped, while about 80 were forced into early marriages by their parents. She said all the women and girls who resisted abuses on their rights were physically assaulted. Activists in the central African nation say they are using the ongoing 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence to educate civilians, especially traditional rulers and religious leaders, against traditional practices they say are harmful to women. Epiphanie Dionrang is president of the Chadian Women's Rights League, a non-governmental organization that fights to empower women with rights, freedoms and opportunities. She said this year's theme for the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence in Chad is 'Fight Back and Rebuild after Violence.' It is a clarion call, Dionrang said, to all civilians to amplify voices of survivors, give moral, psychological and financial support to women and girls and strengthen feminist movements to reduce and prevent all forms of violence against women and girls, and protect women’s rights. Speaking on state TV, Dionrang said her organization is part of several dozen humanitarian and rights groups that are visiting towns and villages in Chad to raise awareness, educate civilians and make sure women are protected. She said their aim is to encourage communities to give equal access to education for boys and girls and stop female genital mutilation, which some men erroneously think makes women remain faithful in marriage. Amina Priscille Longoh, Chad's Women’s and National Solidarity minister, spoke on Chad state TV Tuesday. She said Chad President Mahamat Idriss Deby, who has a strong political will to end all forms of violence, has ordered his government to make sure women who are abused or whose rights are violated have free access to justice and medical and psychological care. She said Deby has ordered his government to prosecute troops and rebels who sexually abuse women. The government of Chad said it will also persecute traditional and religious leaders who promote the use of outdated and harmful cultural practices on women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-activists-fight-violence-against-women/7887573.html	2024-12-04T14:44:17-08:00

Journalists in Bolivia face attacks, verbal assaults	WASHINGTON — Fearing for his life, Josue Chube Choque remembers shouting that he was a journalist as protesters attacked him in Bolivia last month. The reporter was working for TV station Unitel, covering widespread protests by supporters of Bolivia’s former president as they blocked roads across the country. Choque said he received multiple hits to his body and face after being ambushed while covering confrontations between the police and protesters in the town of Mairana. 'At some point we saw people coming from every side of the road. We were being ambushed — the police, other colleagues and me,' he told VOA, adding that he was prevented from leaving. 'All I did was cover my face, eyes, nose, pray to God.' Choque identified himself multiple times as a journalist but, he said, 'No one paid attention to what I was saying, and protesters continued hitting me.' The reporter was held against his will for several hours, and his equipment was taken. Finally, with the assistance of some women in the community, he was able to leave. The journalist is one of around two dozen media workers attacked while covering the protests. Their cases reflect a worsening environment for the press in Bolivia, according to analysts who say verbal attacks from officials, physical assaults and withholding of advertising revenue are making journalism more challenging. Zulema Alanis Bravo, president of the National Association of Journalists in Bolivia, said that journalists are being attacked more frequently. She referenced the latest report of the Human Rights Observatories in Bolivia, which says that on average, a reporter is attacked every three days in the country. 'Unfortunately, in none of the cases we have seen a transparent investigation, a reparation and no justice,' said Bravo. 'Belligerence against journalists and the media has increased in recent years.' An independent investigation commissioned by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights earlier this year found that in Bolivia, 'there are worrying conditions of threats and extreme risks for journalistic work.' The country fell seven points on the World Press Freedom Index. It currently ranks 124 out of 180, where 1 shows the best media environment. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which compiles the index, has documented at least 25 cases of reporters being attacked while covering last month’s protests. A VOA crew was among those harassed, while working in the town of Parotani. Raul Penaranda, who in 2018 co-founded the independent news outlet Brujula Digital, said the environment for journalists has worsened amid a political crisis. Former President Evo Morales is calling on his supporters to protest the current government, which leaves journalists caught in clashes between protesters and police. During his presidency and since leaving office, Morales regularly targeted the press and singled out individual journalists and their outlets, including Penaranda. Morales has 'constantly [been] against journalists and their work,' Penaranda said. But under President Luis Arce, Penaranda said, the allocation of state advertising is a tool of 'reward and punishment,' with media perceived to be aligned with the government being favored. Meanwhile, media viewed as critical miss out on funds and potential sponsors. The government 'pressures the private sector not to advertise,' Penaranda said. The adversarial rhetoric from political leaders has a knock-on effect. 'There is a lot more challenges nowadays to work as a journalist,' said Choque. 'It looks like there is a similar motto around the country. Colleagues have heard in multiple places while covering protests that people who are supporters of the former president scream at reporters, ‘Let’s burn them alive.’' Arce’s media team did not respond to VOA's request for comment. VOA attempts to reach a current spokesperson for Morales and to reach a legislator who worked for his party were unsuccessful. When it comes to physical attack, Bravo said that a lack of justice, coupled with journalists being wary of reporting incidents to authorities, combine to make the situation worse. In Choque’s case, he says he reported the incident to police. But after receiving multiple threats, he left the country while an investigation takes place.	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalists-in-bolivia-face-attacks-verbal-assaults/7887566.html	2024-12-04T14:29:53-08:00

Ukraine demands Russia return 'kidnapped' children	UNITED NATIONS — Ukraine demanded Wednesday that Russia end what Kyiv called 'the largest kidnapping campaign in modern history' and return Ukrainian children forcibly transferred from its territory during the ongoing war. 'Ukraine is searching for nearly 20,000 children who were subjected to illegal deportation and forced transfer,' said Daria Zarivna, an adviser to Ukraine's president and a senior official at his Bring Kids Back Ukraine initiative. 'Yet the actual figure could be much higher, but we can't find it out — Russian officials systematically refuse to provide information,' Zarivna added. Zarivna told a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, convened to discuss the situation, that so far 1,022 children have been repatriated, and she urged the international community to pressure Moscow to cooperate. 'Russia must be forced to meet its obligations under international law,' Zarivna said. 'It must be compelled to allow access to occupied territories, stop deportations and forced citizenship and political indoctrination of children, provide information about transferred kids, [and] cooperate to bring them home.' Russia denies it has forcibly transferred children. 'There is no program in Russia on adopting children from the area of the special military operation,' Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, using the Kremlin term for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 'Those who are orphans or those who are without relatives were only transferred onto temporary preliminary guardianship or temporary wardship, with Russian citizens,' he said. 'Nor is there any basis for the allegation about the forced naturalization of Ukrainian children.' He said a decree streamlining citizenship simply provides 'an opportunity to obtain Russian citizenship for humanitarian reasons' and does not require an individual to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. But the International Criminal Court disagrees. In March 2023, the court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, Russian commissioner for children's rights. The ICC pretrial chamber said it 'considered that there are reasonable grounds to believe that each suspect bears responsibility for the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation, in prejudice of Ukrainian children.' 'We call on member states to execute these warrants and ensure accountability,' Ukraine's Zarivna said. In June 2023, the U.N. secretary-general added Russia to its blacklist of perpetrators of grave violations against children for Moscow's actions in Ukraine, including the killing and maiming of children and attacks on schools. US to sanction abusers The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, announced that the Biden administration is pursuing visa restrictions for five Russian officials and authorities backed or installed by Russia, for their involvement in human rights abuses in Ukraine, including the forced deportation, transfer, and confinement of Ukrainian children. 'Make no mistake: Russian officials and Russian forces have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity,' she said, chastising Moscow for being 'intransigent and unrepentant, frustrating international efforts' to identify, locate, and reunite missing children with their families. Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale University Humanitarian Research Lab, presented his group's findings that at least 314 Ukrainian children have been placed in the Kremlin's 'program of coerced adoption and fostering' since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He said 67 of the children have been formally naturalized as Russian citizens, while 208 have been placed with Russian families through adoption or some form of permanent or temporary guardianship. 'The children the Humanitarian Research Laboratory could find were exclusively, we believe, from Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, but information reviewed by HRL analysts indicates children from Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Kharkiv oblasts as well — areas captured by Russia after February 2022 — are likely included in the program as well,' Raymond said. He said that the full number of children from Ukraine that Russia has placed in its adoption and fostering program is not known and his team could not determine it from the data they analyzed. 'Russia must provide Ukraine, the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF, and other relevant authorities a full list of the children it has taken, including those in the database systems that we have reviewed,' Raymond said. 'Until Russia gives up this information, which it is legally and morally required to do, it will be impossible to fully assess how many children exactly from Ukraine are waiting to go home.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-demands-russia-return-kidnapped-children/7887512.html	2024-12-04T14:15:22-08:00	
Blinken: Ukraine must make hard, but necessary, decisions	In his final appearance at NATO headquarters as U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken spoke about Ukraine and what he said are the hard, but necessary, decisions it must make about mobilizing its forces on the front lines to 'deal with Russian aggression.' At the meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, the top U.S. diplomat said the alliance has made a commitment 'for every person, every soldier that Ukraine mobilizes.' He said NATO is 'committed' to ensuring that Ukraine has 'the training and the equipment they need to effectively defend the country.' Separately, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is urging the Atlantic alliance to provide Ukraine with enough support to change what he called the 'trajectory' of the war with Russia. He made his comments after meeting with the foreign ministers. Additionally, Rutte urged European countries to boost their defense spending. He said spending 2% of GDP on military budgets is not enough for deterrence. During former U.S. President Donald Trump’s first term in office, he criticized NATO for not spending more money on defense. Trump also has refused to say he wants Ukraine to defeat Russia and voiced skepticism about continued U.S. military aid. Trump has said he will resolve the war before he takes office January 20 but has not explained how that would happen. In addition to the war in Ukraine, the foreign ministers Tuesday discussed what Rutte said was an 'escalating campaign' of Russian hostile actions toward NATO countries, including acts of sabotage and cybercrimes. Drone attacks Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it shot down 29 of 50 drones that Russia launched in its latest round of overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Ternopil regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Kharkiv reported damage to a business from a downed drone, while officials in Sumy said Russian shelling damaged several buildings. Russia’s defense ministry said Tuesday it shot down 24 Ukrainian drones overnight, and 11 more early in the day. Officials in Russia’s Ryazan region said a drone damaged four houses but caused no casualties. Ukrainian drones were also shot down over the Rostov, Bryansk, Belgorod, Krasnodar, Kursk and Kaluga regions, the ministry said. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-ukraine-must-make-hard-but-necessary-decisions/7887535.html	2024-12-04T14:07:06-08:00	
Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick to lead Pentagon, says he is fighting on for confirmation	Pete Hegseth, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s embattled choice to lead the Defense Department, said Wednesday he is continuing his fight to win Senate confirmation, even as news accounts say Trump is considering whether to name someone else. The nomination of Hegseth, a 44-year-old decorated military officer and Fox News talk show host, to lead the Pentagon has run into headwinds in the Senate, which must confirm his nomination, as he faces questions about allegations of sexual misconduct and excessive drinking. With no history of managing a large organization, either in the military or corporate world, Hegseth is an unconventional choice to oversee the country’s nearly 2.9 million active duty and reserve troops across the world, along with another 700,000 civilians who work for the military. But Hegseth said he is not backing down, even as several U.S. news accounts say Trump is reconsidering the appointment, possibly in favor of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis or Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, a former military officer. DeSantis is a Navy veteran who unsuccessfully ran against Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination before withdrawing in January. On social media platform X, Hegseth said, 'I’m doing this for the warfighters, not the warmongers. The Left is afraid of disrupters and change agents. They are afraid of @realDonaldTrump — and me. So they smear w/ fake, anonymous sources & BS stories. They don’t want truth. Our warriors never back down, & neither will I.' At the U.S. Capitol, as he headed to meet with senators faced with deciding whether to confirm him, Hegseth told reporters, 'I spoke to the president-elect this morning. He said, ‘Keep going, keep fighting. I’m behind you all the way.’ … Why would I back down?' NBC News reported Tuesday that 10 current and former Fox employees told the network that Hegseth’s co-workers at Fox had been concerned by his alcohol consumption, including occasions when he showed up at work smelling of alcohol and talking about being hung over. Other news accounts have raised questions about Hegseth’s partying and drinking at veterans’ groups he oversaw. Hegseth is also facing questions about a 2017 encounter at a Republican women’s conference in California where a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her after extensive drinking. He told police investigating her claim that the encounter was consensual, and no charges were filed. A couple of years later, however, Hegseth paid the woman an undisclosed amount to keep her from filing a lawsuit that Hegseth feared would get him fired from his weekend show at Fox. One Trump ally, Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, on Tuesday called the allegations against Hegseth 'very disturbing,' and he said that some of them are 'going to be difficult' for some senators considering his nomination. Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the incoming Senate majority leader, said Hegseth must address the troubling allegations he faces. 'There are hard questions being raised, so he’ll have to answer those,' Thune said. Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate in January, meaning Hegseth can lose the support of no more than three Republicans, with Vice President-elect JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote, if necessary. Hegseth is unlikely to win any Democratic support. In other presidential transition news, Trump on Wednesday named Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser in his first White House term, to be his senior counsel for trade and manufacturing when he is inaugurated January 20. Navarro served four months in prison earlier this year for defying a congressional subpoena investigating the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol as about 2,000 Trump supporters tried to block lawmakers from certifying that Trump had lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump described Navarro, 75, as 'a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it.' The president-elect also named Daniel Driscoll, a former soldier and Iraq war veteran, as secretary of the Army. Additionally, Trump plans to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees securities markets and investments. So far, two of Trump’s choices for top-level jobs — Chad Chronister to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration and Matt Gaetz for U.S. attorney general — have dropped out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pete-hegseth-trump-pick-to-lead-pentagon-says-he-is-fighting-on-for-confirmation/7887538.html	2024-12-04T13:48:37-08:00	
French lawmakers oust PM in first successful no-confidence vote since 1962	PARIS — France's far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together Wednesday to pass a no-confidence motion prompted by budget disputes that forces Prime Minister Michel Barnier to resign. The National Assembly approved the motion by 331 votes. A minimum of 288 were needed. President Emmanuel Macron has insisted he will serve the rest of his term, which ends in 2027. However, he will need to appoint a prime minister for the second time after July's legislative elections led to a deeply divided parliament. Macron, on his way back from a presidential visit to Saudi Arabia, said discussions about him potentially resigning were 'make-believe politics,' according to French media reports. 'I'm here because I've been elected twice by the French people,' Macron said. He was also reported as saying, 'We must not scare people with such things. We have a strong economy.' The no-confidence motion rose from fierce opposition to Barnier's proposed budget. The National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament, is deeply fractured, with no single party holding a majority. It comprises three major blocs: Macron's centrist allies, the left-wing coalition New Popular Front, and the far-right National Rally. Both opposition blocs, typically at odds, united against Barnier, accusing him of imposing austerity measures and failing to address citizens' needs. Barnier, a conservative appointed in September, could become the country's shortest-serving prime minister in France's modern Republic. In last-minute efforts to try to save his government, he called on lawmakers to act with 'responsibility' and think of 'the country's best interest.' 'The situation is very difficult economically, socially, fiscally and financially,' he said, speaking Tuesday evening on national television TF1 and France 2. 'If the no-confidence motion passes, everything will be more difficult and everything will be more serious.' Speaking at the National Assembly ahead of the vote, National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, whose party's goodwill was crucial to keeping Barnier in power, said, 'We've reached the moment of truth, a parliamentary moment unseen since 1962, which will likely seal the end of a short-lived government.' 'Stop pretending the lights will go out,' hard-left lawmaker Eric Coquerel said, noting the possibility of an emergency law to levy taxes from January 1, based on this year's rules. 'The special law will prevent a shutdown. It will allow us to get through the end of the year by delaying the budget by a few weeks.' While France is not at risk of a U.S.-style government shutdown, political instability could spook financial markets. France is under pressure from the European Union to reduce its colossal debt. The country's deficit is estimated to reach 6% of gross domestic product this year and analysts say it could rise to 7% next year without drastic adjustments. The political instability could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-lawmakers-oust-pm-in-first-successful-no-confidence-vote-since-1962/7887488.html	2024-12-04T12:51:28-08:00	
Global outcry grows over new Taliban decree targeting Afghan women	ISLAMABAD — The United Nations called on Afghanistan’s radical Taliban leaders Wednesday to refrain from implementing a recently reported decree that prohibits women from pursuing medical education in the crisis-ridden country. The U.N. call comes amid a growing chorus of voices condemning and demanding that the Taliban reverse the directive, which critics said effectively removed the last remaining opportunity for Afghan women and girls to seek higher education. 'If implemented, the reported directive poses further restrictions on women and girls’ rights to education and access to healthcare,' the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) cautioned in a statement. It added that UNAMA is 'extremely concerned' about the reported ban and is verifying it through official Taliban channels, but formal confirmation has not yet been received. The directive issued by reclusive Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada took effect Tuesday, a day after it was communicated to heads from all medical schools at a meeting in Kabul, health officials and participants told VOA. They spoke anonymously because they were told not to discuss the matter publicly. Taliban officials at the Public Health Ministry have not yet commented on the reported decree or the meeting that took place in the Afghan capital on Monday. The U.N. cautioned the decree would have a 'detrimental impact' on the Afghan health care system and the development of the impoverished South Asian country. 'UNAMA urges the de facto authorities to reconsider implementing the reported directive in view of its negative implications on the lives of Afghan women and girls and all people across the country,' the organization said in the statement. Local media reported that more than 30,000 women and girls were enrolled in Afghan medical institutions nationwide, and many were scheduled to take their exams starting Tuesday when the ban abruptly took effect. Women training as midwives and nurses were ordered not to return to classes. Human rights activists have warned the ban will deprive millions of women of essential health care services, including midwives and female nurses, in the male-dominated Afghan society where the Taliban have prohibited male doctors in several provinces from treating women. 'This week, the Taliban in Afghanistan closed one of the last remaining loopholes in their ban on education for older girls and women by forbidding them from attending institutions offering medical education,' Human Rights Watch said in a statement. The global watchdog warned that stopping the training of new female health care workers under the controversial decree 'will result in unnecessary pain, misery, sickness, and death for the women forced to go without health care, as there won’t be female healthcare workers to treat them.' The Associated Press quoted a senior Afghan health official as warning that the country would face significant challenges beyond the control of the Taliban government if the suspension became permanent. 'If women are not trained as staff, the mortality rate of mothers and children will increase in remote areas,' the official stated on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss the matter with the media. 'There will not be enough staff to provide services to female patients. Those NGOs that provide services in distant provinces and districts are still facing a shortage of doctors, midwives, nurses and other female staff,' the health official said. The European Union expressed 'strong concerns' over the reported directive and its potential to deepen the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and worsen the suffering of its people. 'This decision represents yet again another appalling violation of fundamental human rights and an unjustifiable attack on women’s access to education in Afghanistan,' the EU said in a statement Wednesday. 'We urge the Taliban to reverse this discriminatory policy and uphold their commitments under international law, including ensuring equal access to education and to basic healthcare for all Afghans,' the EU said in the statement. Rashid Khan, captain of the Afghan national cricket team, also urged the Taliban leadership to reconsider the decision. 'It is with deep sadness and disappointment that I reflect on the recent closures of educational and medical institutions for the sisters and mothers of Afghanistan,' Khan said on the X social media platform. 'The country desperately needs professionals in every field, especially the medical sector. The acute shortage of female doctors and nurses is particularly concerning, as it directly impacts the healthcare and dignity of women,' Khan wrote. Since sweeping back to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban have banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and suspended female university and other higher education. Afghan women also are prohibited from working in all sectors except for a few, including health care, immigration and law enforcement. U.N. officials and aid groups say dozens of decrees issued by Hibatullah have severely limited women’s access to work and education in a country that is facing one of the most severe humanitarian crises attributed to years of war and climate change-induced weather disasters. The de facto government in Kabul, which is not officially recognized by any country, justifies its policies as being consistent with the Taliban’s interpretation of Islamic law, known as Shariah. It dismisses criticism of its governance as interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-outcry-grows-over-new-taliban-decree-targeting-afghan-women/7887435.html	2024-12-04T12:44:15-08:00	
China's new drone draws debate over its potential uses	Taipei, Taiwan — China's recent unveiling of its prototype of a 6-ton tiltrotor unmanned aerial vehicle is stirring up debate over its potential use in combat. The drone, the Lanying R6000, is purportedly intended for nonmilitary uses, but concept drawings that displayed Chinese military logos on the wings and body of the aircraft sparked worries that it may be used for military transportation, surveillance, reconnaissance or attacks. Tiltrotor aircraft such as the Lanying R6000 combine the flying speed of airplanes with the takeoff and landing maneuverability of helicopters, providing them with the advantages of both systems. The new drone, displayed at the Zhuhai air show in November, has a cruising speed of 550 kilometers per hour, a range of up to 4,000 kilometers, a maximum take-off weight of 6,100 kilograms and a maximum payload of 2,000 kilograms according to the website of United Aircraft, a Shenzhen-based company. The business was born in 2014 after the Chinese government began efforts to integrate civil companies into defense technology development. In 2023, United Aircraft received funding from state-backed investment firms totaling nearly $276 million. The company website describes the R6000 drone as a 'car in the sky,' that can seat up to 12 people with additional applications that include 'urban air traffic, logistics transportation, emergency rescue' and others. But some observers say printed designs of the drone with military markings suggest that the company is looking toward military applications of the Lanying system. The drone could serve to increase the efficiency of military logistics and transportation in the event of conflict in the Taiwan Strait, with its long range and rapid deployment capabilities, military analysts tell VOA. The drone does not need a runway 'making it particularly suitable for special terrains such as mountainous areas and islands,' stated the United Aircraft website's product description. Hong Kong-based Asia Times reported in October, 'China's UR6000 may perform rapid resupply missions to support airfield seizure operations during a potential invasion of Taiwan.' Yao Cheng, a former lieutenant colonel staff officer of the Chinese Navy Command who is now based in Los Angeles, told VOA that the Lanying R6000's advantages lie in its fast speed, unmanned operation and strong emergency response capabilities. These advantages, he confirmed, would be useful if a conflict were to break out over Taiwan. 'If there is fighting in the Taiwan Strait, because its speed is 550 [kilometers per hour], it can deliver the materials to the battlefield in about half an hour,' Yao said. Taiwan is located 180 kilometers from China. With a range of 4,000 kilometers, the Lanying R6000 could make more than 10 round trips from China to Taiwan before refueling. Yao said the drone's wide range covers the Western Pacific, giving it the ability to reach locations throughout the South China Sea and U.S. military bases in Japan and South Korea. Given the trend of warfare toward unmanned and intelligent warfare, Yao expects the Lanying R6000 to become an important force in military transportation. However, Su Tzu-yun director of the Institute of National Defense Strategy and Resources at the Taipei-based National Defense Security Research Institute, told VOA that the Lanying R6000 has more value in commercial transportation than in the military. The drone has low stealth capabilities given that helicopters and other similar aircraft that make use of tiltrotors tend to be noisy and produce radar signatures, Su said, making the drone an easy target for air defense missiles. The size of the Chinese army's helicopter force, coupled with the limitations of Lanying system's stealth capabilities, makes it unrealistic for the drone to be considered as an ideal option in high-risk military operations, Su said. He added that China possesses close to 1,000 helicopters, including the Z-20, China's version of the American Black Hawk helicopter. This number still trails behind that of the U.S., which has around 5,500 helicopter units. Su said the drone could still play a limited role in the Chinese Navy. With its compact size and high speed, it is suitable for carrier-based tasks, such as rapid anti-submarine patrols or replenishment missions. The Luying R6000 model could also develop into technology that is more appropriate and valuable for military use in the future, Su added.

China, Pakistan agree to trade buffalo milk, stirring concerns	Peshawar/Karachi, Pakistan — Milk from buffalo is creating controversy in Pakistan as the country finalizes an agreement with China to export the product. Much of Pakistan’s milk production comes from buffalo. And recently, Pakistani milk producer Fauji Foods Limited, which is owned by the military, agreed to an export deal with China’s Royal Group. The deal comes at time of rising inflation in Pakistan, sparking concerns about the impact the deal could have on supply and prices. It is also rekindling a longstanding debate over the military’s role in the country’s economy. The first shipments of buffalo milk from Pakistan are expected to occur in early 2025. It is unclear how much milk Fauji Foods has agreed to export to China. When compared to cow’s milk, buffalo milk is higher in protein, calcium and fat but lower in cholesterol. The cost of buffalo milk products tends to be higher, Islamabad-based dairy expert Abdul Sattar told VOA. Pakistan typically suffers from seasonal milk shortages from April to October, due to low productivity and demand from a growing population, said Sattar. The price of buffalo milk is exacerbated by inflation and an 18% tax on packaged milk that went into effect in July of this year. About 80% of the milk in Pakistan comes from small-scale farmers rather than large companies like Fauji Foods. This leads to concerns that the military may have sidelined these types of producers in the deal with China’s Royal Group. The Pakistani military has not responded to VOA’s request for comment at time of publication. Muhammad Asif Khan, president of the Livestock Farmers Welfare Association in Peshawar, expressed concern regarding Fauji Foods’ ability to meet Chinese demand, suggesting that the company might need to use milk from small-scale farms for export. 'It will be difficult for a sole company to meet the growing milk demand of the Chinese market. Alternatively, they would default on supply or procure milk from the small-scale dairy farms, which always have enough stock readily available,' Khan told VOA. Khan argues that, despite being good for businesses involved in the export deal, this would dramatically increase the price of milk in the country. Chinese interest in Fauji Foods In addition to the buffalo milk deal, China’s Royal Group has also imported some 10,000 buffalo embryos from Pakistan’s Fauji Foods since June, and the two sides have plans to increase the sale to at least 300,000 embryos over the next 10 years. In 2017, Chinese state-owned dairy giant, Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group, attempted to acquire a 51% stake in Fauji Foods. However, the Chinese company pulled away from the deal in 2019 without providing a reason. Fauji Foods stated the two sides were unable to complete negotiations before the established deadline. Pakistani military’s economic dominance The latest milk deal between the military-run Fauji Foods and China’s Royal Group has reignited concerns over Pakistani military’s control and influence over the economy. Critics claim the military’s ability to leverage state resources, political influence and commercial infrastructure allows it to dominate local and international business. 'The military’s institutional strengths and advantages are well known. Backed by these strengths, the military's commercial wings consistently employ unfair tactics to compete with other competitors, acquire commercial enterprises and secure contracts in a nontransparent manner,' Farhatullah Babar, a former senator affiliated with the Pakistan People’s Party, told VOA. The military’s privilege in the market extends from military-directed subsidies to an ease of contract approval that circumvents established governmental processes. Dr. Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani military scientist and author of the book 'Military Inc.,' told VOA that the military has had previous involvement in China’s agriculture industry, supplying meat to Chinese producers. The Pakistani military has also been on the receiving end of Chinese products with more than 60% of Chinese defense exports going to the Pakistani military, according to a Mercator Institute for China Studies report.

Despite US benefactor, funds dwindling for HIV/AIDS fight in Zimbabwe	RUSAPE, ZIMBABWE — The U.S. has provided over $1 billion in the past 5 years to Zimbabwe's fight against HIV/AIDS, but experts say reduced funding may hamper the African country’s target of ending the epidemic by 2030. Pamela Tremont, the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe, was among the delegates to this year’s World AIDS Day in Rusape, about 200 kilometers east of Harare. She said the U.S. would continue supporting HIV/AIDS programs in the southern African nation. 'Zimbabweans are living longer, healthier lives. We have been combating HIV in Zimbabwe through our PEPFAR [the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief] program for over 21 years,' she said. 'In the past five years, the United States government has invested over $1 billion to fight HIV and AIDS, and $200 million in the last year alone.' Zimbabwe is one of the countries hit hardest by HIV/AIDS. In 1999, Zimbabwe introduced an AIDS levy, a 3% tax on income and business profits which is managed by the National AIDS Council. That money, combined with international funds, has been used to run programs aimed at ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030 in Zimbabwe. But at this year’s World Aids Day commemorations, Dr. Bernard Madzima, the executive officer of the Zimbabwe National AIDS Council, painted a grim picture of dwindling funds. He spoke of the U.N.’s target to identify, treat and suppress the virus in 95% of patients. 'For us not to go backwards in terms of the 95-95-95 targets and epidemic control, we have to have discussion(s) around the issue of sustainability to ensure that we don’t reduce the gains which we have recorded and slide backwards,' he said. 'The AIDS levy is there, but it’s just a small piece in terms of providing funding, which is domestic. If we are going to respond to health issues, we have to guard against donor fatigue.' Dr. Douglas Mombeshora, Zimbabwe’s health minister, said the country continues to see lower rates of new infections. 'These are pleasing results, but we are not yet on an irreversible path towards ending AIDS by 2030,' he said. 'These results have indicated that the pace of reversing HIV infections is slower, and we may miss the target of ending AIDS if we continue doing the same things, the same way we have [been] doing them. While our HIV prevention interventions have been robust and led to identification of 95% of HIV positive people, we have to be more strategic in identifying the remaining 5% to ensure optimal use of resources.' While officials are worried about funding for HIV programs, some people are happy with the way Zimbabwe is fighting the epidemic. Among them is schoolteacher Simon Chere, who is living with HIV. When the infection started, Chere visited traditional healers and prophets, fearing he had been bewitched. He later visited a hospital and tested HIV positive. He said he thought his world had collapsed, but then got counseling and met other men who were HIV positive. Chere said is much improved after starting medication, together with his wife. Chere expressed hope that other people living with HIV will learn to live positively and take medication.	https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-us-benefactor-funds-dwindling-for-hiv-aids-fight-in-zimbabwe/7887346.html	2024-12-04T11:19:15-08:00	
Native American students found to miss school at higher rates	SAN CARLOS, ARIZONA — After missing 40 days of school last year, Tommy Betom, 10, is on track this year for much better attendance. The importance of showing up has been stressed repeatedly at school — and at home. When he went to school last year, he often came home saying the teacher was picking on him and other kids were making fun of his clothes. But Tommy's grandmother Ethel Marie Betom, who became one of his caregivers after his parents split, said she told him to choose his friends carefully and to behave in class. He needs to go to school for the sake of his future, she told him. 'I didn't have everything,' said Betom, an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Tommy attends school on the tribe's reservation in southeastern Arizona. 'You have everything. You have running water in the house, bathrooms and a running car.' A teacher and a truancy officer also reached out to Tommy's family to address his attendance. He was one of many. Across the San Carlos Unified School District, 76% of students were chronically absent during the 2022-2023 school year, meaning they missed 10% or more of the school year. Years after COVID-19 disrupted American schools, nearly every state is still struggling with attendance. But attendance has been worse for Native American students — a disparity that existed before the pandemic and has since grown, according to data collected by The Associated Press. Out of 34 states with data available for the 2022-2023 school year, half had absenteeism rates for Native American and Alaska Native students that were at least 9 percentage points higher than the state average. Many schools serving Native students have been working to strengthen connections with families, who often struggle with higher rates of illness and poverty. Schools also must navigate distrust dating back to the U.S. government's campaign to break up Native American culture, language and identity by forcing children into abusive boarding schools. History 'may cause them to not see the investment in a public school education as a good use of their time,' said Dallas Pettigrew, director of Oklahoma University's Center for Tribal Social Work and a member of the Cherokee Nation. On-site health, trauma care The San Carlos school system recently introduced care centers that partner with hospitals, dentists and food banks to provide services to students at multiple schools. The work is guided by cultural success coaches — school employees who help families address challenges that keep students from coming to school. Nearly 100% of students in the district are Native and more than half of families have incomes below the federal poverty level. Many students come from homes that deal with alcoholism and drug abuse, Superintendent Deborah Dennison said. Students miss school for reasons ranging from anxiety to unstable living conditions, said Jason Jones, a cultural success coach at San Carlos High School and an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Acknowledging their fears, grief and trauma helps him connect with students, he said. 'You feel better, you do better,' Jones said. 'That's our job here in the care center is to help the students feel better.' In the 2023-2024 school year, the chronic absenteeism rate in the district fell from 76% to 59% — an improvement Dennison attributes partly to efforts to address their communities' needs. 'All these connections with the community and the tribe are what's making a difference for us and making the school a system that fits them rather than something that has been forced upon them, like it has been for over a century of education in Indian Country,' said Dennison, a member of the Navajo Nation. In three states — Alaska, Nebraska and South Dakota — the majority of Native American and Alaska Native students were chronically absent. In some states, it has continued to worsen, even while improving slightly for other students, as in Arizona, where chronic absenteeism for Native students rose from 22% in 2018-2019 to 45% in 2022-2023. AP's analysis does not include data on schools managed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education, which are not run by traditional districts. Less than 10% of Native American students attend BIE schools. Schools close on days of Native ceremonial gatherings At Algodones Elementary School, which serves a handful of Native American pueblos along New Mexico's Upper Rio Grande, about two-thirds of students are chronically absent. The communities were hit hard by COVID-19, with devastating impacts on elders. Since schools reopened, students have been slow to return. Excused absences for sick days are still piling up — in some cases, Principal Rosangela Montoya suspects, students are stressed about falling behind academically. Staff and tribal liaisons have been analyzing every absence and emphasizing connections with parents. By 10 a.m., telephone calls go out to the homes of absent students. Next steps include in-person meetings with those students' parents. 'There's illness. There's trauma,' Montoya said. 'A lot of our grandparents are the ones raising the children so that the parents can be working.' About 95% of Algodones' students are Native American, and the school strives to affirm their identity. It doesn't open on four days set aside for Native American ceremonial gatherings, and students are excused for absences on other cultural days as designated by the nearby pueblos. For Jennifer Tenorio, it makes a difference that the school offers classes in the family's native language of Keres. She speaks Keres at home but says that's not always enough to instill fluency. Tenorio said her two oldest children, now in their 20s, were discouraged from speaking Keres when enrolled in the federal Head Start educational program — a system that now promotes native language preservation — and they struggled academically. 'It was sad to see with my own eyes,' said Tenorio, a single parent and administrative assistant who has used the school's food bank. 'In Algodones, I saw a big difference to where the teachers were really there for the students, and for all the kids, to help them learn.' Over a lunch of strawberry milk and enchiladas on a recent school day, her 8-year-old son Cameron Tenorio said he likes math and wants to be a policeman. 'He's inspired,' Tenorio said. 'He tells me every day what he learns.' Home visits In Arizona, Rice Intermediate School Principal Nicholas Ferro said better communication with families, including Tommy Betom's, has helped improve attendance. Since many parents are without working phones, he said, that often means home visits. Lillian Curtis said she has been impressed by Rice Intermediate's student activities on family night. Her granddaughter, Brylee Lupe, 10, missed 10 days of school by mid-October last year but had missed just two days by the same time this year. 'The kids always want to go — they are anxious to go to school now. And Brylee is much more excited,' said Curtis, who takes care of her grandchildren. Curtis said she tells Brylee that skipping school is not an option. The district has made gains because it is changing the perception of school and what it can offer, said Dennison, the superintendent. Its efforts have helped not just with attendance but also morale, especially at the high school, she said. 'Education was a weapon for the U.S. government back in the past,' she said. 'We work to decolonize our school system.' This story is part of a collaboration on chronic absenteeism among Native American students between The Associated Press and ICT, a news outlet that covers Indigenous issues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/native-american-students-found-to-miss-school-at-higher-rates/7887225.html	2024-12-04T10:56:57-08:00	
Canadians push back on Trump's tariff threat	Vancouver, British Columbia — President-elect Donald Trump’s threat to introduce 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada is getting reaction, not surprisingly, in both countries. The threat of tariffs on everything coming across the world’s largest undefended border from Canada to the United States got attention but has not been met with overwhelming surprise. University of British Columbia political scientist Stewart Prest said it is a return to Trump World, where the world is responding to his social media posts. He said Canadian authorities should know from the previous Trump administration to take the threat seriously but not literally. 'But the other piece of it is then to find ways to respond to, address what Mr. Trump is saying, but to do so without simply giving in and waving the white flag,' Prest said. 'That the need to push back in creative ways is, I think, an important lesson, as well.' Trump says he will impose this tariff if Canada and Mexico do not get control of illegal migrants and fentanyl distribution. According to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, just under 20 kilograms of fentanyl was seized along the Canada-U.S. border in the last fiscal year. During the same time, 9,500 kilograms were seized along the U.S.-Mexican border. Canada is the largest trading partner of the United States, with goods valued at an average $2.7 billion crossing the almost 9,000-kilometer-long border every day in 2023. Canada is the United States of America’s largest source of foreign oil. Prest said the proposed tariffs on that would increase costs on everything, and this needs to be effectively communicated. '[Make] it clear that there are interests that unite the two countries and that they're far greater than whatever divides us,' Prest said. 'Those messages need to be put forward in a variety of formats.' Andreas Schotter, a professor of global strategy at the Ivey Business School at Western University in Ontario, said the proposed tariffs will hurt both countries. But, he added, they can be avoided if Canada makes serious commitments with tangible results. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is suggesting it could deploy more law enforcement resources to the border, including personnel, helicopters and unmanned drones. Schotter’s concern is that the most recent demand from Trump may go beyond fentanyl and migration and lead to the cancellation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated in his first term to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. 'I think he will not wait for 2026 to reopen USMCA,' Schotter said. 'I think he will say, ‘Well, you can talk to me now, or I will not talk to you in 2026, and I just cancel it, right?’ So I think he will not respect even the agreed upon timelines, necessarily. And this is worrying me.' This past weekend, Trudeau, his chief of staff Katie Telford and Minster of Public Safety Dominic LeBlanc flew from Ottawa to Trump’s home in Florida for direct talks. LeBlanc has told multiple media outlets the dinner meeting went well, with Trump emphasizing the prevalence of fentanyl as a main concern. Also discussed was the large trade deficit between United States and Canada. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, this amounted to $53.5 billion in 2022. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce predicts that if the threatened tariffs are put in place, they would shrink Canada’s Gross Domestic Product by 2.6%, and the GDP of the United States by 1.6%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canadians-push-back-on-trump-s-tariff-threat/7887209.html	2024-12-04T10:55:15-08:00	
Africa's women-led startups struggle to find investors	NAIROBI, Kenya — Businesses started by women have received less than 5% of venture capital funding in Africa over the past decade, according to a new report. The report says investment in female-started businesses decreased further last year, frustrating businesswomen and those who want investors to give them greater consideration. Female-founded businesses are the driving force behind innovation and inclusive growth in Africa, but those businesses face many challenges when seeking investment, according to the report by business research platform Briter Bridges and non-profit organization V54 Open Impact. Akosua Lefty, a Ghanaian businesswoman who specializes in developing products for natural hair, said she has struggled to attract interest from potential investors over her two years in business. An investor will express interest then never reach out again, she said, or will want to make money immediately, which may not be possible. Briter Bridges and V54 Open Impact say that of all the capital venture funding across Africa in the past 10 years, less than 5% went to women founders. Elizabeth Mwangi, founder of Gwiji, which connects women cleaners to clients, got her first funding in 2020, which helped her develop an app that could help support and empower women to make a living. She said the next funding she got was in 2023, when she was nearly giving up on Gwiji. She earned the Aurora Tech Award, a global honor that focuses on women. Following that, she was able to get $30,000 in funding that enabled the company to get an office and launch secondary programs that help women. Mwangi said she is partnering with more organizations, like the U.K. government-backed Transform, to widen her reach beyond Nairobi. The aim, she said, is to empower more women from informal settlements, because every day she gets calls from women across Kenya who want to join Gwiji and earn a decent income. Partnering with Transform, she said, allows Gwiji to diversify its services and employ more women. African women face more challenges beyond funding, including gender bias, lack of access to support networks, culture and policy changes. Lefty said she is ready to be patient and build a business that can withstand the challenges of being a woman. Mwangi and Lefty are urging other women in business not to be discouraged, but to build businesses that help solve community problems and to keep seeking opportunities and investors who support their dreams.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-women-led-startups-struggle-to-find-investors/7887191.html	2024-12-04T10:47:04-08:00	
Notre Dame reopens amid French political turmoil	PARIS — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and U.S. first lady Jill Biden are among global dignitaries expected in Paris Saturday as the city’s iconic Notre Dame Cathedral reopens five years after a massive fire. Trump’s visit to Paris is expected to be his first foreign trip since winning the election last month. U.S. President Joe Biden is not expected to attend. It has taken five years, 2,000 artisans and workers, and hundreds of millions of dollars to restore the medieval Gothic masterpiece. It was nearly destroyed during a fire in April 2019. French President Emmanuel Macron visited the restored cathedral Friday and said the reconstruction workers had participated in an unprecedented project. Macron will join the archbishop of Paris, along with Catholic and other dignitaries, for official opening ceremonies Saturday. The cathedral will open its doors to the public on Sunday as part of weeklong reopening events. Even covered with scaffolding and closed to visitors, Notre Dame has attracted hordes of tourists during the years of reconstruction. Manuele Monica, a visitor from Italy, said, 'I can understand why people in the past created buildings such as this one, because it’s so huge. It’s really tall — like it’s going up in the sky.' The event offers a short reprieve for France, which is facing pre-Christmas strikes, soaring debt and an uncertain political future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/notre-dame-reopens-amid-french-political-turmoil/7887104.html	2024-12-04T08:58:29-08:00	
Report: Africa's civic space remains mostly repressive	NAIROBI — Forty-three out of 50 countries and territories in sub-Saharan Africa have 'restricted' or 'shut down' civic spaces, according to a report released Wednesday by a global alliance of civil society organizations. The annual report, titled 'People Power Under Attack 2024,' says civic space has improved over the past year in Botswana and Liberia, but gotten worse in Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Ethiopia and Kenya. Conditions for civil society have deteriorated over the past year in nine countries, four of which are in Africa, and general civic space conditions in the African continent remain 'repressive,' according toCIVICUS, which tracks the state of civic freedoms of 198 countries. Sylvia Mbataru, a human rights lawyer and CIVICUS researcher, said almost 900 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live in politically repressed societies. 'Almost 70 percent of the population in Africa south of the Sahara is now living within a repressed civic space,' Mbataru said. 'That means a big majority of the continent are not able to access their rights, are not able to speak out anymore, are not even able to engage in meaningful democracy efforts and governance efforts. So this is a really concerning figure to have.' Many governments in Africa have curtailed people's rights, the report says, and their security forces have committed violations against protesters, human rights defenders, and journalists. Authorities are accused of disrupting peaceful protests by force, detaining demonstrators, and prosecuting human rights defenders, protesters and journalists. Kenya’s ranking was downgraded from 'obstructed' to 'repressed' due to the government crackdown on nationwide protests in June and July, which were sparked by a proposed finance bill that sought to raise taxes. According to rights groups, more than 60 people were killed during the protests in Kenya and dozens more are missing. They blame the killings on Kenyan security agencies, a claim denied by the government. Thirty-eight-year-old Edith Kamau lost her son during anti-tax protests in Kenya. She agrees with the report that her country's human rights record and civic space are not good, saying that no one — rich or poor — is safe and secure. Even well-to-do people are being abducted, she said, and the current president is not good for his people. Kamau said her son's body was recovered from a government building, per a police report, but she and her family have yet to get justice. The post-mortem report showed her son was shot at close range during the protests, and officers told her the weapons used were carried exclusively by special forces, but she said she has been kept in the dark about what really happened. The CIVICUS report downgraded Burkina Faso’s status from 'obstructed' to 'repressed.' Eswatini and Ethiopia were downgraded from 'repressed' to 'closed,' meaning authorities there tolerate almost no public dissent or demonstrations. Despite many African countries restricting civic space, some are making progress in allowing political expression and defense of human rights. According to the researchers, civic space and freedom are 'open' in seven African countries, including Botswana and Liberia, which have improved their conditions in the past year. Liberia witnessed a peaceful power transfer late last year, and CIVICUS says it noted fewer violations in press freedom and peaceful assembly areas. In Botswana, the ruling party, which had governed the country since 1966, was voted out in the October presidential elections. Even before then, says CIVICUS, civil society groups were allowed to push back against proposed constitutional changes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-africa-s-civic-space-remains-mostly-repressive/7887040.html	2024-12-04T08:16:38-08:00	
Russia-related sanctions target illicit digital finance network, US says	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration issued a fresh round of Russia-related sanctions on Wednesday, taking aim at what it called an illicit finance network that allowed Russian elites to leverage digital assets to avoid sanctions. In a statement, the U.S. Department of Treasury said it was targeting five people and four entities tied to 'a sprawling international network of businesses and employees that have facilitated significant sanctions circumvention' known as the TGR Group. The targets also include an entity based in Wyoming that is owned in part by a sanctioned individual, the department said. 'Through the TGR Group, Russian elites sought to exploit digital assets — in particular U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins — to evade U.S. and international sanctions, further enriching themselves and the Kremlin,' Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley Smith said in a statement. The international network actions include 'the laundering of funds associated with sanctioned entities; providing an unregistered service to exchange cash and cryptocurrency; the receipt of cash and making the value available to clients in the form of cryptocurrency; providing a prepaid credit card service; and obfuscating the source of funds to allow high-net-worth Russian nationals to purchase property in the United Kingdom,' according to the department's statement. Such sanctions generally prohibit any U.S. persons or entities from conducting any transactions with sanctioned targets and freeze any U.S.-held assets belonging to the sanctioned people or entities. Among those targeted in Wednesday's action are George Rossi, a Russian-born Ukrainian national born in Russia that the Treasury Department said is believed to control the TGR Group, and Rossi's direct subordinate, Russian national Elena Chirkinyan, among others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-related-sanctions-target-illicit-digital-finance-network-us-says/7887042.html	2024-12-04T08:09:39-08:00	
Reports: UnitedHealthcare CEO shot dead outside New York hotel	NEW YORK — Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a hotel in midtown Manhattan where he was scheduled to speak at an investor meeting Wednesday morning, according to a person briefed on the investigation. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the investigation. Police did not release the victim's name but said a 50-year-old was shot around 6:45 a.m. outside a Hilton before the shooter fled. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital but could not be saved. UnitedHealthcare is the insurance arm of the health care giant UnitedHealth Group Inc. The Minnetonka, Minnesota-based company was scheduled to have its annual meeting with investors in New York City to update Wall Street on the company's direction and expectations for the coming year, according to a company media advisory. An announcement was made to attendees Wednesday morning that the conference was ending early. The Hilton is in a bustling part of Manhattan, a short walk from tourist sites such as the Museum of Modern Art and Rockefeller Center, and often dense with tourists and office workers on weekday mornings. The popular Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree lighting is set to take place Wednesday evening. Part of the block where the shooting took place was cordoned off with police tape, with a large contingent of police officers at the scene. Many security cameras are nearby. Thompson had served as CEO for more than three years and had been with the company since 2004. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz tweeted that the state is 'sending our prayers to Brian's family and the UnitedHealthcare team.' 'This is horrifying news and a terrible loss for the business and health care community in Minnesota,' he wrote. UnitedHealthcare is the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S. and manages health insurance coverage for employers and state- and federally funded Medicaid programs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/reports-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shot-dead-outside-new-york-hotel/7887014.html	2024-12-04T07:59:58-08:00	
Police in Georgia arrest opposition leader as mass protests continue	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Georgian police on Wednesday raided the offices of an opposition party and arrested its leader in an apparent attempt to squelch a wave of mass protests triggered by the governing party's decision to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union. During the past six nights, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital's central boulevard. More than 300 protesters have been detained since Thursday, and over 100 people have been treated for injuries. On Wednesday, the Coalition for Change opposition party said that police raided its offices and detained its leader, Nika Gvaramia. It shared a video showing several officers dragging Gvaramia into a car. Georgian media reported that police also raided the offices of several other opposition groups and nongovernment organizations. The ruling Georgian Dream party retained control of parliament in the disputed October 26 election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia's EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia's help and boycotted parliament sessions. Mass opposition protests sparked by the vote gained new momentum after the governing party's decision on Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili refused to recognize the official election results and contested them in the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal on Tuesday. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to lead the opposition demand for a new parliamentary election. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc's recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. It requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Georgian government's announcement of the EU accession talks' suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October's election as neither free nor fair. On Monday, the EU reiterated its 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of Georgian Dream declared Tuesday that the government is willing to open EU accession talks if the bloc ends its 'blackmail.' 'I want to remind European bureaucrats and politicians, including those who are artificially hindering our country's European integration, to bring negotiations to the table, and we will sign immediately, on the same day, at that very moment,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-in-georgia-arrest-opposition-leader-as-mass-protests-continue/7886990.html	2024-12-04T07:50:01-08:00	
Transgender rights case lands at Supreme Court	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Wednesday in just its second major transgender rights case, which is a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming health care for minors. The justices' decision, not expected for several months, could affect similar laws enacted by 25 other states and a range of efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use. The case is coming before a conservative-dominated court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people. There were dueling rallies outside the court in the hours before the arguments. Speeches and music filled the air on the sidewalk below the court's marble steps. Advocates of the ban bore signs like 'Champion God's Design' and 'Kids Health Matters,' while the other side proclaimed 'Fight like a Mother for Trans Rights' and 'Freedom to be Ourselves.' Four years ago, the court ruled in favor of Aimee Stephens, who was fired by a Michigan funeral home after she informed its owner that she was a transgender woman. The court held that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace. The Biden administration and the families and health care providers who challenged the Tennessee law are urging the justices to apply the same sort of analysis that the majority, made up of liberal and conservative justices, embraced in the case four years ago when it found that 'sex plays an unmistakable role' in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate. The issue in the Tennessee case is whether the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same. Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors, but not 'across the board,' lawyers for the families wrote in their Supreme Court brief. The lead lawyer, Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, is the first openly transgender person to argue in front of the justices. The administration argues there is no way to determine whether 'treatments must be withheld from any particular minor' without considering the minor's sex. 'That is sex discrimination,' Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in her main court filing. The state acknowledges that the same treatments that are banned for transgender minors can be prescribed for other reasons. But it rejects the claim that it is discriminating on the basis of sex. Instead, it says lawmakers acted to protect minors from the risks of 'life-altering gender-transition procedures.' The law 'draws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes. And boys and girls fall on both sides of that line,' Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in the state's Supreme Court brief. While the challengers invoke the 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County for support, Tennessee relies on the court's precedent-shattering Dobbs decision in 2022 that ended nationwide protections for abortion and returned the issue to the states. The two sides battled in their legal filings over the appropriate level of scrutiny the court should apply. It's more than an academic exercise. The lowest level is known as rational basis review and almost every law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well within their authority. The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, that applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it. If the justices opt for heightened scrutiny, they could return the case to the appeals court to apply it. Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association. But Tennessee is pointing to health authorities in Sweden, Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom that found the medical treatments 'pose significant risks with unproven benefits.' None of those countries has adopted a ban like the one in Tennessee, and individuals can still obtain treatment, Prelogar wrote in response. The Williams family of Nashville, Tennessee, are among those challenging the state law. Brian Williams said that because of puberty blockers and hormone treatments, his transgender daughter, L.W., is a '16-year-old planning for her future, making her own music and looking at colleges.' But because of Tennessee's ban, she has to travel to another state to receive the health care that 'we and her doctors know is right for her.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/transgender-rights-case-lands-at-supreme-court/7886938.html	2024-12-04T07:23:19-08:00	
Many former X users migrate to Bluesky social media platform	Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform, recently experienced significant growth, surpassing 22 million users. The surge is attributed to users migrating from X due to their dissatisfaction with changes under Elon Musk's ownership. Andrei Dziarkach has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

Syrian forces battle insurgents north of strategic city of Hama	BEIRUT — Syria said Wednesday its counteroffensive has pushed back insurgents attempting to advance to the strategic central city of Hama, while the insurgency says it captured more Syrian troops and Iran-backed militants in fierce battles. The latest flareup in Syria's long civil war comes after forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad over the past few days captured large parts of the northern city of Aleppo, the country's largest, as well as towns and villages in southern parts of the northwestern Idlib province. The offensive is being led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadi group, as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. For years, both have entrenched themselves in northwest Idlib province and parts of northern Aleppo, as the battered country reeled from years of political and military stalemates. The war between Assad and his foreign backers and the array of armed opposition forces seeking his overthrow has killed an estimated half-million people over the past 13 years. Syrian state media SANA on Wednesday said insurgents retreated some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from government-held Hama, Syria's fourth-largest city, as government troops backed by Russian airpower entrenched themselves in the outskirts. Fierce fighting has raged for days as Damascus fears that the insurgents will make their way into the city like they did over the weekend into Aleppo. A Syrian photographer working for the German news agency dpa was killed in an airstrike near the city of Hama, the agency said Wednesday. Anas Alkharboutli, 32, has long documented Syria's civil war, which started after a brutal crackdown on a popular uprising against Assad in 2011. He had worked for dpa since 2017. The insurgency, through its Military Operations Department channel on the Telegram app, said it captured five Iran-backed militants, of whom two were from Afghanistan, as well as three Syrian troops from its 25th Special Mission Forces Division in eastern Hama. The claims could not be independently confirmed. If the insurgents seize Hama city and control the province, it could leave the coastal cities of Tartous and Lattakia isolated from the rest of the country. Lattakia is a key political stronghold for Assad and Syria's Alawite community and a strategic Russian naval base. Tens of thousands have been displaced by the fighting, which started last week, Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said Tuesday. 'If we do not see de-escalation and a rapid move to a serious political process, involving the Syrian parties and the key international players, then I fear we will see a deepening of the crisis,' Pedersen said in an address the U.N. Security Council. 'Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration and destruction.' Turkey, which backs Syria's opposition, has called on Assad to reconcile with opposition forces and include them in any political solution to end the conflict. Ankara has been seeking to normalize ties with Syria to address security threats from groups affiliated with Kurdish militants along its southern border and to help ensure the safe return of more than 3 million Syrian refugees. Assad has insisted that Turkey's withdrawal of its military forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries. Damascus views the insurgents as terrorists, and Assad has vowed to respond to the insurgency with an iron fist. Turkish and Iranian officials met earlier this week in a bid to reach a solution to de-escalate the flareup. Arab countries bordering Syria that once backed groups trying to overthrow Assad have expressed their concern of the conflict's regional impact and have backed the president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-forces-battle-insurgents-north-of-strategic-city-of-hama/7886860.html	2024-12-04T06:29:37-08:00	
China grows global influence through partnership with Russia in 2024	Taipei, Taiwan — In the past year an economic downturn, persistent youth unemployment and a property crisis have plagued China at home. Abroad, Beijing has expanded its cooperation with Russia despite warnings from Western leaders that a closer alliance between the two countries is a source of growing concern. In 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin held three bilateral meetings. The two militaries also conducted several joint exercises in different parts of the world this year. From Ukraine and BRICS to bilateral economic ties and the multilateral system, the 'no limits' relationship that Beijing and Moscow announced just before Russia invaded Ukraine continued to live up to its name said analysts. Their 'frequent engagement shows that both countries are focused on their relationship and despite many barriers and issues that they had to deal with,' said Philipp Ivanov, a non-resident senior fellow at Asia Society told VOA on November 28. During their meetings, Xi and Putin repeatedly highlighted the importance of their bilateral cooperation. 'With the concerted efforts of the two sides, China-Russia relations have been moving forward steadily, with enhanced comprehensive strategic coordination and further cooperation on economy and trade, investment, energy, people-to-people exchanges, at the subnational level and in other fields,' Xi said during his meeting with Putin in Beijing on May 16. Ivanov said the relationship between the two neighboring countries has been mutually beneficial. 'Russia has become quite dependent on China in terms of the supplies of electronics and manufacturing equipment,' he told VOA in a video interview last Thursday. 'Beijing has been benefiting from the discounted energy prices that Russia provides.' Promoting a multipolar world order China and Russia have also been seeking to promote an alternative 'multipolar' world order that challenges the global system led by the United States in 2024. Part of that effort to promote the multipolar world order has come through the expansion of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, also called SCO, and BRICS, an informal group of states that originally included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. BRICS has since expanded to include other countries from Africa and the Middle East. In 2024, Belarus became the latest country to join SCO and in July, Minsk held joint military exercises with China near the border of Poland and Ukraine. Meanwhile, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia formally applied to join BRICS this year. Experts say the push has been appealing to some middle-power countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Brazil. These countries 'feel they can increase their own power through multilateral institutions like BRICS and SCO because they can play bigger roles in these organizations,' Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told VOA on November 28. As the idea of a multipolar world order appeals to more Global South countries, Arho Havren said it strengthens China’s efforts to portray itself as the leader of the Global South. 'During the G20 Summit in Brazil, Xi Jinping portrayed China’s governance model as a model for developing countries, and I think that reflects China’s growing confidence in presenting itself as a leader of the Global South,' she told VOA by phone. The Global South generally refers to countries listed as 'developing' by the United Nations but also includes China and several wealthy Gulf states. China and Russia have stepped up their use of the grouping to highlight efforts to support the developing world and grow the political, military and economic influence. While more countries express interest in joining multilateral institutions like BRICS, some analysts say their motivation may not be the same as Beijing and Moscow’s anti-West agenda. China and Russia 'are trying to shift BRICS into some sort of anti-Western grouping, but not many countries in the Global South are on board with the idea,' said Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Program at the Takshashila Institution in India. 'A lot of countries enter BRICS because they see it as [a platform that gives them] a collective voice to share their grievances with regard to lack of representation in global governance and the ability to shape global rules,' he told VOA in a Zoom interview on November 29. Deterring the US and its allies China and Russia also increased joint military exercises in 2024, holding military drills and patrols in the South China Sea, the Arctic, the Mediterranean and the Sea of Japan. Ivanov at the Asia Society said China and Russia are trying to use the joint military drills to 'demonstrate that they have sufficient military capabilities to deter the U.S.' He added, 'The exercises are also opportunities for China and Russia to test the limits of their military cooperation.' 'As they exercise together more and do it in different places, it creates a certain connection between the two militaries, which is the most important ingredient that’s currently missing in the China-Russia relations,' Ivanov said. Despite increased military cooperation with Russia in different parts of the world, Ivanov said China is still largely focused on modernizing its military and preparing for contingency scenarios in Taiwan and the South China Sea. 'The exercises with Russia are essentially experiments for the Chinese military to operate far away from its borders and it’s too early to assess how ambitious China’s global military strategy may be,' he said. As countries around the world prepare for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, Arho Havren said China will seek to grow its influence in different parts of the world where Washington might reduce its presence. 'Wherever the U.S. takes a less-strong position, China will be ready to fill the vacuum,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-grows-global-influence-through-partnership-with-russia-in-2024/7886776.html	2024-12-04T06:06:34-08:00	
Jailed Iranian Nobel Peace laureate gets 3-week medical release	Iranian Nobel Peace laureate Narges Mohammadi has been temporarily released from prison on medical grounds, her lawyer said Wednesday. Mostafa Nili said on the social media platform X the release would last three weeks and was connected to an operation Mohammadi had last month to remove a benign tumor. Mohammadi has been imprisoned since November 2021 in relation to her work against the wearing of mandatory hijab by women. Rights groups appealed last month for Iranian authorities to grant her a medical furlough, expressing concerns that she was quickly returned to prison following the surgery. Mohammadi has been sentenced to more than 13 years in prison on charges of colluding against the state and engaging in propaganda against the government. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7886763.html	2024-12-04T04:36:08-08:00	
Deadly Israeli strikes hit central Gaza	Palestinian medics said Israeli airstrikes killed at least five people Wednesday in the central Gaza Strip. The Israeli military also said Wednesday it made a number of arrests after Israeli settlers attacked several towns in the occupied West Bank. The Israel Defense Forces said the violence included settler attacks on the village of Beit Furik where settlers hurled stones and wounded two border police. Settler violence has surged in the West Bank since Hamas launched its October 2023 attack on Israel, and Israeli forces have carried out numerous raids on West Bank villages as part of a campaign the military says is aimed at disrupting militant activities. Israel forces carried out fresh airstrikes Wednesday in southern Lebanon, a week after Israel and the militant group Hezbollah began a ceasefire. The halt in fighting after a year of cross-border clashes and months of intensified fighting that included Israeli troops going into southern Lebanon has been threatened by continued Israeli airstrikes and Hezbollah rocket fire. The two sides are supposed to pull back from the border area under the ceasefire agreement, with Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers maintaining a buffer zone. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said Wednesday that the Israel-Hezbollah war has killed at least 4,047 and wounded more than 16,600 others. Abiad said most of the casualties took place since September 15, and that the actual number of dead is believed to be higher. U.S. and other officials expressed hope in recent days that the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah could help to push along efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. Months of talks brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza have yet to yield an agreement between Israel and Hamas. The war in Gaza began with Hamas killing about 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage in its 2023 attack. There are still about 100 hostages held in Gaza, with about one-third believed to be dead. In its counteroffensive in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 44,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-israeli-strikes-hit-central-gaza/7886732.html	2024-12-04T04:00:39-08:00	
Namibia elects Nandi-Ndaitwah as first female president	WINDHOEK, Namibia — Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah of Namibia's ruling SWAPO party has been elected president and will be the country's first female leader, results released by the country's electoral commission showed on Tuesday. Nandi-Ndaitwah, 72, is the current vice president. Her victory will extend SWAPO's 34 years in power since it led Namibia to independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990. She received roughly 57% of valid votes in the presidential race, according to a breakdown given by the Electoral Commission of Namibia. Nandi-Ndaitwah needed to secure more than 50% of the votes to secure a win. 'The Namibian nation has voted for peace and stability,' Nandi-Ndaitwah said after being declared president-elect. She joined SWAPO in the 1960s when it was fighting for independence and has served in numerous senior roles including foreign minister in the democratic era. Her main challenger in this election was Panduleni Itula from the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC) party, who came second with roughly 26% of votes. Namibians voted separately for the National Assembly. SWAPO won a majority there, securing 51 of the 96 elected seats. The IPC won 20 seats and will be the official opposition. The IPC has said it will challenge the results in court, calling the electoral process 'deeply flawed.' The Nov. 27 vote was marred by technical difficulties and ballot paper shortages, leading to a delay in results as voting was extended in some places. Political analysts had said a SWAPO victory was uncertain due to growing frustration with high levels of unemployment and inequality, but that the party retained strong roots in rural areas and loyalty among older voters due to the national liberation struggle. Analyst Rakkel Andreas said Nandi-Ndaitwah had managed to unite different factions within SWAPO and that her reputation had not been tarnished by corruption allegations, unlike other party members. 'She is a stateswoman. She has been in some form of leadership since we gained independence,' Andreas said.

Death toll rises to 29 in southern Thailand floods	BANGKOK — More than 30,000 people have been forced to flee their homes due to severe flooding in southern Thailand, where the death toll climbed to 29, officials said Wednesday. Days more heavy rain are forecast in the area, which has already been battered by torrential floodwaters, with more than 155,000 households currently affected, according to the Thai government's public relations department. Five southern provinces have been hit -- -- Pattani, Narathiwat, Songkhla, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Phatthalung -- forcing more than 33,000 people to leave their homes, the spokesperson for Thailand's ministry of public health said in a statement. The death toll now stands at 29, up from 25 reported on Tuesday. The spokesperson for Ministry of Public Health said mental health teams have been deployed to provide support and care for those affected. A woman from Tak Bai district, Narathiwat province, told state broadcaster Thai PBS that she had not returned home for three days, choosing to stay in a temporary shelter at a local temple after her house was inundated by floodwaters. The Thai Meteorological Department warned Wednesday morning that low pressure moving from the South China Sea across Malaysia and the Andaman Sea was expected to bring heavy rainfall and further flooding to southern Thailand. The Department of Mineral Resources also warned of potential landslides and flash floods until December 5. Disaster response teams were working to drain floodwater and evacuate flood victims to dry areas, the country's disaster agency said on its Facebook page Wednesday morning. The government has deployed rescue teams to assist affected residents and designated $1.5 million in flood relief for each province. On Tuesday the Thai cabinet approved a $260 payment per family to support those affected. The floods have also affected neighboring Malaysia, where tens of thousands of people have been forced from their homes. While Thailand experiences annual monsoon rains, scientists say climate change is causing more intense weather patterns that can make destructive floods more likely. Widespread flooding across the country in 2011 killed more than 500 people and damaged millions of homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-rises-to-29-in-southern-thailand-floods/7886658.html	2024-12-04T02:17:57-08:00	
Second major Myanmar rebel group calls for talks with junta	BANGKOK — A second major Myanmar ethnic rebel group has said it is ready for Beijing-mediated talks with the junta to end more than a year of renewed fighting that has ravaged areas along the Chinese border. The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), with about 8,000 available fighters, has fought the Myanmar military for more than a decade for autonomy for the Kokang ethnic minority in northern Shan state. Last year, it and two other allied rebel groups launched an offensive against the military and seized swathes of Shan state, including ruby mines and a lucrative trade highway to China. Last week, MNDAA ally the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) said it was ready for talks with the military. 'From today onwards we will cease fire immediately, and will not actively attack the Myanmar army,' the MNDAA said in a statement released late Tuesday. 'Under the mediation of China, we are willing to engage in peace talks with the Myanmar army on issues such as Lashio,' it said, referring to the city its fighters captured in August in a huge blow to the junta. The MNDAA was 'willing to send a high-level delegation to engage in dialogue and consult with the Myanmar military and resolve conflicts and differences through political means,' it said. A junta spokesman did not respond when contacted for comment on the MNDAA statement. AFP has contacted China's embassy in Myanmar for comment. The junta has not publicly responded to the TNLA offer, and local media outlets have reported continued air strikes on TNLA-held territory. The Arakan Army (AA), the third group in the rebel alliance, is still fighting the military in coastal Rakhine state in Myanmar's west, home to China and India-backed port projects. AFP has contacted an AA spokesman for comment. China is a major ally and arms supplier of the junta but also maintains ties with ethnic rebel groups that hold territory near its border. It has repeatedly called for fighting to stop in Shan state, a key link in its trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative. Earlier this month, Beijing said the head of the MNDAA had come to China for 'medical care' after news reports in Myanmar said he had been arrested on China's orders. Myanmar is home to about a dozen ethnic rebel groups that have battled the military for decades for autonomy and control of lucrative resources including jade, timber and opium. Some, including the TNLA, have given shelter and training to newer 'People's Defense Forces' that sprang up to battle the military after it seized power in a 2021 coup.	https://www.voanews.com/a/second-major-myanmar-rebel-group-calls-for-talks-with-junta/7886657.html	2024-12-04T02:12:26-08:00	
German firms' China market sentiment falls to record low, survey shows	Beijing — Business sentiment among German companies in China is at an all-time low, a German business lobby group said on Wednesday, as they face rising Chinese competition and a slowing economy. Over half of German companies said conditions in their industry had worsened this year, the German Chamber of Commerce in China said citing a survey, while only 32% forecast an improvement in 2025 - the lowest since records began in 2007. 'This year has been difficult for the majority of German companies, prompting a downward adjustment of their business outlook,' said Clas Neumann, chair of the German Chamber of Commerce's east China chapter, while adding that 92% of German companies planned to maintain their operations in the $19 trillion economy. Germany is China's biggest European partner, and prominent German firms with large investments in China include automakers Volkswagen as well as BMW and auto parts supplier Bosch. The German survey comes just a day after a British sentiment survey of companies operating in China painted a downbeat picture. While foreign direct investment, seen as a signal of confidence in China, represents only 3% of the country’s total investment, it has been falling for two straight years. The chamber said investing to keep up with local competitors was the primary motivation for 87% of the 51% of German companies planning to step up their investment in China over the next two years, an annual eight percentage point increase. The chamber also said that companies were, for the first time, reporting that they were contending with a 'Buy China' trend, with Chinese President Xi Jinping's self-sufficiency drive 'Made in China 2025' resulting in local customers opting to buy from local producers. An official factory activity survey released on Saturday showed that new import orders for parts and components used in finished goods fell for an eighth consecutive month in October, while new orders expanded for the first time in seven months. The chamber called on Berlin to place more emphasis on Beijing as a partner and revise its China strategy to better align with German industry's desire to invest more in localization in China, over boosting exports to the market. Berlin opposed the European Commission's tariffs of up to 45.3% on Chinese-built electric vehicles in an October vote. German automakers have heavily criticized the EU measures, aware that possible higher Chinese import duties on large-engined gasoline vehicles would hit them hardest. Volkswagen signaled last week that it was doubling down on its China investment by extending its partnership with Chinese partner SAIC by a decade, though it sold its operations in Xinjiang after years of mounting pressure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-firms-china-market-sentiment-falls-to-record-low-survey-shows/7886649.html	2024-12-04T01:58:04-08:00	
Australia urges greater internet user choice amid Google dominance, genAI	Australia's competition watchdog said there was a need to revisit efforts to ensure greater choice for internet users, citing Google's dominant search engine market share and its competitors' failure to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. A report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said that while the integration of generative AI tools into search engines is still nascent, Big Tech's deep pockets and dominant presence give it an upper hand. The commission said it was concerned Google and Microsoft could integrate generative AI into their search offerings, including through commercial deals, which raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of search queries. 'While some consumers may find the generative AI search experience more useful and efficient, others may be concerned about the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated responses to search queries,' Commissioner Peter Crone said. Google and Microsoft did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Australia has intensified the spotlight on the tech giants, which are mostly domiciled in the U.S. It was the first country to make social media platforms pay media outlets royalties for sharing their content. Last month, it passed a law that banned social media for children aged under 16, and proposed a law earlier this week that could impose fines of up to $32.28 million on tech giants if they suppress competition and prevent consumers from switching between services. The Australian watchdog on Wednesday urged the use of service-specific codes that help prevent anti-competitive behavior, address data advantages and allow consumers to switch between services freely. These proposed measures have been agreed to in principle by the government, ACCC said, and it will close its enquiry by next March.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-urges-greater-internet-user-choice-amid-google-dominance-genai/7886627.html	2024-12-04T01:15:01-08:00	
NATO chief says Russia weaponizing winter in its war in Ukraine	NATO chief Mark Rutte said Tuesday he is confident that whatever military aid allies can supply to Ukraine in the coming months will be provided, as he warned that Russia is again using the onset of winter as a weapon in its war in Ukraine. Rutte told reporters in Brussels ahead of talks with NATO foreign ministers that there is a priority on protecting Ukrainian energy infrastructure and ensuring Ukrainian forces have the air defenses necessary to defend against Russian attacks. In addition to the war in Ukraine, the foreign ministers are also discussing what Rutte said was an 'escalating campaign' of Russian hostile actions toward NATO countries, including acts of sabotage and cybercrimes. Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it shot down 29 of 50 drones that Russia launched in its latest round of overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Ternopil regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Kharkiv reported damage to a business from a downed drone, while officials in Sumy said Russian shelling damaged several buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down 24 Ukrainian drones overnight, and another 11 drones early Tuesday. Officials in Russia’s Ryazan region said a drone damaged four houses, but caused no casualties. Ukrainian drones were also shot down over the Rostov, Bryansk, Belgorod, Krasnodar, Kursk and Kaluga regions, the ministry said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-chief-says-russia-weaponizing-winter-in-its-war-in-ukraine/7886632.html	2024-12-04T01:12:27-08:00	
Biden to visit US-financed Angolan rail hub	Luanda/Lobito, Angola — U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday headed to a U.S.-financed African development project that weaves together his personal love of railroads with his desire to leave a legacy on the continent that will outlive his administration. The Lobito Corridor is a 1,300-kilometer rail line stretching from copper-rich Zambia to the port of Lobito in the southwest nation of Angola. The network will form a 'strategic economic corridor' under the Biden administration’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment – an initiative meant to counter China’s well-established, sprawling Belt and Road initiative. So far, the Biden administration says it has committed nearly $4 billion towards the project. Biden, in Angola’s capital on Tuesday, cast the project through his love of passenger rail. As a U.S. senator, he commuted to Washington from Wilmington, Delaware – logging, he said, nearly 340 kilometers on every trip. 'I must tell you up front, with American press here, I’m probably the most pro-rail guy in America,' Biden said Tuesday in Angola’s capital, to laughter from the audience gathered to hear him speak at the nation’s slavery museum. Same, or different? Senior administration officials said this rail line will, by the end of the decade, be extended to its full length, stretching from Africa’s Indian Ocean coast to the Atlantic port. Initially, it will transport critical minerals like cobalt and copper from the continent’s deep interior to the coast. When the corridor is completed, a journey that now takes more than 40 days by road can zip across the continent in 40 hours. 'The premise behind the corridor is to be able to take American support and financial capabilities that are limited, and to focus them more deeply in one area, versus spreading that financial support and effort across many countries,' said a senior Biden administration official, who was not identified as is common practice when briefing reporters. VOA asked the official whether this repeats the age-old colonial narrative of exploiting the continent’s rich, raw resources while not adding value and providing steady work for local populations. A burgeoning youth population on the continent has created an urgent need for jobs, putting strain on many African governments. 'I disagree with the premise that this is for raw products,' the official replied. 'Right now, only raw product is coming out. But I think what this rail does – in order to get to higher value products, you need a few things. One of them is affordable and reliable and abundant energy. So the build out of the energy system allows you to then build the value added.' And others questioned whether this U.S. effort, coming more than a decade after China launched its ambitious Belt and Road initiative, can compete. 'Upon closer inspection, it appears to be a mimic of China’s playbook, one that tacitly acknowledges that Washington lags behind Beijing in terms of its investments in Africa but does little to fill the void that exists in China’s footprint,' said Chris O. Ògúnmọ́dẹdé, an editor, consultant, and analyst of African politics, security, and international relations. Wang Peng, a researcher at Renmin University of China, published on a Chinese state thinktank, International Cooperation Center, that Western international projects like the Lobito Corridor don’t pose a challenge to China’s initiative because the United States 'can’t provide sufficient funds and material conditions to truly implement its ambitious global infrastructure plan.' Wang Peng also noted the U.S. could undermine it by exerting diplomatic pressure on host countries to force them to tear up cooperation agreements with China; exaggerate the negative impact of the 'Belt and Road' project on the local ecological environment and water resources…. and hype up the so-called 'debt trap' issue.' Mounting Chinese debt among African nations is something Biden also mentioned indirectly in his remarks Tuesday, in seeking to cast the U.S. as a reliable partner. 'We’ve also pushed to ensure that developing nations do not have to choose between paying down unsustainable debt and being able to invest in their own people,' he said. But, as Biden also said, his time is running short as he prepares to leave office, for president-elect Donald Trump. Analysts say this project may be well received by Trump, as it suits his more transactional approach to the continent, and appeals to one of Trump’s biggest backers, billionaire Elon Musk. 'The money has been earmarked already after all,' said James Murphy of Clark University in Massachusetts. 'Continuing the Lobito project is a smart idea – Trump does not have to own it except in the sense that it gives him a talking point about our strategic/resource-driven interests in Africa, particularly as a strategy to acquire minerals essential for Elon’s Teslas, as it were.'

UN seeks $47 billion in aid as donor appetite shrinks while crises multiply	GENEVA — The United Nations on Wednesday sought $47 billion in aid for 2025 to help around 190 million people fleeing conflict and battling starvation, at a time when this year's appeal is not even half-funded and officials fear cuts from Western states including the top donor, the U.S. Facing what the new U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher describes as 'an unprecedented level of suffering,' the U.N. hopes to reach people in 32 countries next year, including those in war-torn Sudan, Syria, Gaza and Ukraine. 'The world is on fire, and this is how we put it out,' Fletcher told reporters in Geneva. 'We need to reset our relationship with those in greatest need on the planet,' said Fletcher, a former British diplomat who started as head of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) last month. The appeal is the fourth largest in OCHA's history, but Fletcher said it leaves out some 115 million people whose needs the agency cannot realistically hope to fund: 'We've got to be absolutely focused on reaching those in the most dire need, and really ruthless.' The U.N. cut its 2024 appeal to $46 billion from $56 billion the previous year as donor appetite faded, but it is still only 43% funded, one of the worst rates in history. Washington has given over $10 billion, about half the funds received. Aid workers have had to make tough choices, cutting food assistance by 80% in Syria and water services in cholera-prone Yemen, OCHA said. Aid is just one part of total spending by the U.N., which has for years failed to meet its core budget due to countries' unpaid dues. While incoming president Donald Trump halted some U.N. spending during his first term, he left U.N. aid budgets intact. This time, aid officials and diplomats see cuts as a possibility. 'The U.S. is a tremendous question mark,' said Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, who held Fletcher's post from 2003-2006. 'I fear that we may be bitterly disappointed because the global mood and the national political developments are not in our favor.' Project 2025, a set of conservative proposals whose authors include some Trump advisers, takes aim at 'wasteful budget increases' by the main U.S. relief agency, USAID. The incoming Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment. Fletcher cited 'the disintegration of our systems for international solidarity' and called for a broadening of the donor base. Asked about Trump's impact, he said: 'I don't believe that there isn't compassion in these governments which are getting elected.' One of the challenges is that crises are now lasting longer - an average of 10 years, according to OCHA. Mike Ryan, World Health Organization emergencies chief, said some states were entering a 'permanent state of crisis.' The European Commission - the European Union executive body - and Germany are the number two and three donors to U.N. aid budgets this year. Charlotte Slente, Secretary General of the Danish Refugee Council, said Europe's contributions were also in doubt as funds are shifted to defense: 'It's a more fragile, unpredictable world [than in Trump's first term], with more crises and, should the U.S. administration cut its humanitarian funding, it could be more complex to fill the gap of growing needs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-seeks-47-billion-in-aid-as-donor-appetite-shrinks-while-crises-multiply/7886595.html	2024-12-03T22:35:43-08:00	
Backlash grows against South Korea’s Yoon after martial law decree	Seoul, South Korea — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s brief declaration of martial law appeared to backfire Wednesday, as lawmakers prepared to begin impeachment proceedings and one of the country’s largest labor unions launched an indefinite general strike demanding his resignation. In a late-night televised address, Yoon announced martial law, claiming it was necessary to 'eradicate anti-state forces' and 'protect constitutional order.' The declaration marked the first use of martial law since South Korea transitioned to democracy in the 1980s. Hours later, the edict was overturned after lawmakers pushed past military and police forces that had surrounded parliament and rescinded the decree by a vote of 190-0. Facing overwhelming resistance, Yoon announced that martial law would be lifted. The dramatic overnight events left many Seoul residents stunned and analysts scrambling to understand Yoon’s strategy, as well as the extent of the political fallout he now faces. Early Wednesday, South Korea’s main opposition Democratic Party announced it would begin impeachment proceedings if Yoon did not resign immediately. South Korea's largest umbrella labor group, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, vowed to organize major anti-Yoon rallies and announced an indefinite strike until Yoon steps down. Conservative backlash In a particularly ominous sign for Yoon, many members of his conservative camp fiercely criticized the martial law declaration, with 18 members of his own People Power Party joining the parliamentary effort to overturn the decree. In an editorial, the conservative Chosun Ilbo, the country’s largest newspaper, called the situation 'absurd and unprecedented,' noting that 'hardly anyone' agrees with Yoon’s rationale that the country was facing a national emergency. 'This martial law controversy has cast doubt on President Yoon's ability to remain in office,' said an editorial in the Joongang Ilbo, another conservative paper. 'The previously unthinkable discussion of the president's impeachment has now become inevitable.' Yoon has not publicly responded to calls for his resignation. But Yoon’s senior aides, including his chief of staff and national security adviser, offered to resign on Wednesday, after the country’s ruling party chief called for them to step down. Yoon weakened Since taking office in May 2022, Yoon, a former chief prosecutor known for his blunt rhetoric, has faced fierce political battles with the opposition and suffered from persistently low approval ratings. His critics have seized on corruption allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon-hee, and accused him of mistreating the media. In turn, Yoon has frequently portrayed his critics as North Korea sympathizers and 'anti-state' forces who are trying to disrupt the normal operation of the government. In April, Yoon's conservative party suffered a major defeat in legislative by-elections, further weakening his political standing. As a result, only eight conservative lawmakers would need to abandon Yoon in order for an impeachment motion against him to succeed. The developments suggested to many analysts that Yoon may not be able to serve out the remainder of his single, five-year presidential term. 'This is the end of Yoon's presidency. Full stop,' said Karl Friedhoff, who focuses on Korea for the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. 'The only question is how his presidency will end and how much violence it will entail.' Impeaching a South Korean president requires the support of two-thirds of the National Assembly, after which the Constitutional Court determines whether to uphold the decision. Choi Jong-kun, a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University who served as first vice foreign minister under former South Korean President Moon-Jae-in, said that Yoon's impeachment is 'definitely' inevitable. 'South Korea's democracy is solid and unshakeable,' he added. 'It's a republic backed by the organized power of aware and active citizens who are ready to stand up for its values.' Dramatic scenes The decree — which sought to ban political activities and place media under military control — triggered a frantic late night response at South Korea's National Assembly, the unicameral legislature controlled by Yoon's opponents. Shortly after his address, South Korean military forces descended on the legislative compound, with some arriving by helicopter, according to a VOA reporter on the scene. Security forces attempted to bar entry to lawmakers and others. Despite minor scuffles at the main gate, opposition lawmakers eventually forced their way inside, with some livestreaming on social media as they climbed over gates and through windows to reach the legislative chambers. In an emergency session less than three hours after Yoon's declaration, lawmakers voted to lift the decree. Under South Korea's constitution, the president is required to comply when a majority of lawmakers vote to overturn martial law. Kim Joon-hyung, a member of the opposition Rebuilding Korea Party, described wrestling through security forces to enter the National Assembly. 'I'm sore all over,' he said in a text message to VOA, noting that the military seemed 'confused' and ultimately refrained from aggressive actions to block lawmakers. Videos of civilian resistance against the military circulated widely in South Korean media. In one clip, dozens of people surrounded an armored vehicle outside parliament, preventing further access. In another, aides and civilians sprayed fire extinguishers at military personnel attempting to breach an entrance, forcing them to retreat under the glare of journalists’ cameras. As South Korean martial law troops left South Korea's National Assembly early Wednesday, one of the soldiers repeatedly bowed his head and said, 'I'm sorry,' according to a video posted on YouTube by a local journalist. The dramatic scenes evoked memories of South Korea's authoritarian past, underscoring public resistance to any return to military rule and adding further pressure to Yoon’s already embattled presidency. 'I’m stunned by the news. I feel like I’ve been surrealistically teleported back to the Korea I first experienced as a U.S. diplomat in 1984,' said Rob Rapson, a former U.S. diplomat who served in numerous senior positions at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. 'I can’t fathom what possessed Yoon to announce martial law and think that he could get away with it in the dark of night. His stated reasons about eradicating ‘anti-state’ forces have little credibility [and] are indefensible,' he added. The developments create an awkward dilemma for the outgoing Biden administration, which had closely aligned with Yoon on a shared vision of 'values-based diplomacy.' Together, they often stood in concert against authoritarian adversaries like China and Russia, emphasizing democracy, human rights, and the rule of law as central to their foreign policies. On Tuesday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell expressed 'grave concern' over the situation and said he was actively engaging with South Korean counterparts. In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed Yoon’s decision to rescind martial law but stopped short of criticizing the South Korean leader. South Korea, home to about 28,000 U.S. troops, remains one of Washington’s most critical allies in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/backlash-grows-against-south-korea-s-yoon-after-martial-law-decree/7886594.html	2024-12-03T22:28:19-08:00	
New militias sow future danger for war-weary Sudan	Cairo, Egypt — Mohamed Idris, 27, has despaired of ever finding a job in war-torn Sudan. Instead, he's now set his sights on a training camp on the Eritrean border, hoping to join a militia. 'I got my university degree but there aren't any job opportunities, if I get into a training camp I can at least defend my country and my people,' he told AFP from Kassala in Sudan, the nearest city to the border. Analysts say the growing role such militias and armed groups are playing in the war will only prolong the country's suffering. Sudan's war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began in April 2023, sparking what the United Nations calls the world's worst displacement crisis. More than 8 million people have been uprooted internally and more than 3 million have fled abroad. The northeast African country is on the brink of famine, according to aid agencies, and a UN investigation found both sides committed rights abuses with the RSF particularly implicated in sexual violence. In Sudan's east, Kassala and Gedaref have so far been spared the chaos of war, but host more than a million people who have fled fighting elsewhere. In both cities, AFP correspondents have seen convoys of four-wheel drives mounted with anti-aircraft weapons speed through the streets. Each vehicle, blasting its horn as it went, was manned by a handful of young men waving assault rifles -- though the nearest battles are hundreds of kilometers away. The men, like Idris, are part of a generation who have lost their futures to the flames of Sudan's war. Now, they represent recruiting potential for new armed groups being formed, particularly along ethnic and tribal lines in the country's army-controlled east. 'The forces I want to join are from my tribe and my family,' said Idris. According to Sudanese analyst and former culture and information minister Faisal Mohammed Saleh, 'these groups haven't yet joined the fray in the current war.' 'But the fear is that they could be preparing for future rounds,' he told AFP. Sudan, which has only known brief interludes of civilian rule since independence from Britain in 1956, is rife with armed groups, some with the capacity of small armies. For decades, many were locked in wars with the central government, claiming to champion the rights of marginalized ethnic minorities or regions. In 2020, most signed a peace agreement with the government in Khartoum, and several rebel leaders subsequently became senior officials in the government of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. 'In the first months of the war, many of these groups were neutral, but have since declared allegiance to the army,' Sudanese policy researcher Qusay Hamrour told AFP. They established the so-called joint forces to fight on the army's side, while other groups 'wavered, before throwing their weight behind the RSF,' Hamrour said. According to former information minister Saleh, 'what's new now is the eastern Sudanese groups, most of which are training inside Eritrea.' Eyewitnesses told AFP earlier this year that they saw Sudanese fighters being trained in at least five locations in neighboring Eritrea, which has not commented on the allegations. The witnesses said the camps were linked to Burhan's army or to figures from the former Islamist-backed regime of ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir. Historically, though ethnic or tribal armed groups 'may ally themselves with the regular army, they remain essentially independent,' according to Ameer Babiker, author of the book 'Sudan's Peace: A Quagmire of Militias and Irregular Armies.' Khartoum has long relied on armed groups to fight its wars in other parts of Sudan. In response to an uprising in Darfur in 2003, Bashir unleashed the Janjaweed militia, leading to war crimes charges against him and others. The RSF, formalized by Bashir in 2013, are descended from the Janjaweed. In 2021, army chief Burhan led a coup that derailed a fragile civilian transition that followed Bashir's own ouster. By April 2023, a long-running power struggle between Burhan and his deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, erupted into all-out war. Now, what Babiker calls 'the weakness of the Sudanese state' has compelled it to again to depend on militias to secure territory. He said this strategy would 'only lead to these groups growing stronger, making them impossible to bypass in the future.' Already, there have emerged 'multiple centres of decision-making within the army,' he told AFP. According to a May report from the International Crisis Group think tank, 'both main belligerents are struggling with command and control.' Burhan, increasingly reliant on powers from the Bashir regime 'as well as communal militias and other armed groups ... risks losing his hold on the various factions.' Meanwhile the RSF is 'an ever more motley assortment of tribal militias and warlords,' according to Crisis Group, which says that both wartime coalitions have become more unwieldy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-militias-sow-future-danger-for-war-weary-sudan/7886564.html	2024-12-03T20:08:18-08:00	
To save a dying swamp, Louisiana aims to restore the Mississippi River's natural flow	GARYVILLE, La. — Louisiana has long relied on a vast levee system to rein in the Mississippi River and protect surrounding communities from flooding. But cutting off the natural flow of the river with man-made barriers has been slowly killing one of the nation's largest forested wetlands. The 456 square kilometers of Maurepas Swamp just to the west of New Orleans holds Louisiana's second-largest contiguous forest, a state wildlife refuge filled with water tupelo and bald cypress trees, their branches adorned by wisps of Spanish moss. A beloved recreation site, the swamp also houses bald eagles, ospreys, black bears and alligators and serves as a waystation for hundreds of different migratory birds. Deprived of nutrients from the stanched Mississippi River, the swamp's iconic trees are dying in stagnant water. Yet they're now set to receive a life-saving boost. State and federal authorities on Tuesday celebrated breaking ground on an ambitious conservation project intended to replenish the ailing trees by diverting water from the Mississippi back into the swamp. 'This is about reconnecting a natural system, actually fixing it to what it used to be,' said Brad Miller, who has shepherded the project for the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority since 2006. Miller likened the $330 million river diversion to watering a garden: 'The swamp needs river water to be a good swamp.' The River Reintroduction into Maurepas Swamp will allow for a maximum of 57 cubic meters per second to flow out of a gated opening to be built in the levee system and routed along a 9 9-kilometer diversion channel. The project expects to revitalize around 182 square kilometers of swamp in an area where less than a third of the forest is considered healthy according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Besides injecting much-needed nutrients and oxygen into the swamp, river water will leave thin layers of sediment deposits that mitigate the effect of subsidence — a natural phenomenon on Louisiana's fragile coast exacerbated by fossil fuel extraction — and climate change-induced sea level rise, said Nick Stevens, a researcher at Southeastern Louisiana University's wetlands ecology and restoration lab. Healthier forests bolster the swamp with decomposing matter from branches and leaves, he added. 'All of that is completely hindered by not having the Mississippi River attached to it anymore,' Stevens said. 'You've got all this land sinking as a result of just not getting nutrients.' The swamp's diminishing health has had ripple effects on biodiversity, says Erik Johnson, director of conservation science at Audubon Delta, an organization focused on bird ecology in the Mississippi River delta. Some migratory birds like the yellow-throated warbler, prothonotary warbler and the northern parula have had their populations plummet by nearly 50% in the past two decades, Johnson said. These birds rely on caterpillars who are dependent on water tupelo and bald cypress foliage. When there are fewer healthy leaves for the caterpillars to gorge on, there's less food for the birds. 'That's driving a really rapid decline in these bird populations that depend on this one forest,' Johnson said. 'The whole system has shifted.' Scientists say they expect to start seeing an increase in canopy cover and new tree growth within a few years of the project's anticipated completion in 2028. Unlike the state's controversial $3 billion river diversion project intended to combat coastal land loss, the Maurepas project has received widespread support from elected officials and local communities. The Maurepas project is primarily funded by the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, a multi-state and federal program managing settlement funds from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that devastated the Gulf Coast. The Maurepas project benefits from an innovative partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is building an adjacent 30-kilometer levee system to protect several southeast Louisiana parishes. The Corps will count 36 square kilometers of Maurepas Swamp restoration towards offsetting environmental damage caused by the new levee construction, meaning it can direct additional federal funds toward the diversion program. 'For every dollar the state can save here, they have more to invest' in other coastal restoration projects, said John Ettinger, director of policy and environmental compliance with Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council. And conservationists say the Maurepas reintroduction project highlights the importance of coastal protection and wetlands restoration going hand in hand in a hurricane-prone region. 'You're going to have a healthier ecosystem on the outside of that levee, which means you're going to have a better buffer for storm surge and it's going to allow the levees to be more effective,' said Amanda Moore, National Wildlife Federation's Gulf Program senior director. 'This is how we need to be thinking at large about what's possible and how we can how we can do more effective conservation by working with nature.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/to-save-a-dying-swamp-louisiana-aims-to-restore-the-mississippi-river-s-natural-flow/7886560.html	2024-12-03T19:53:25-08:00	
Demonstrators converge on Georgia's parliament, protest EU bid delay	TBILISI, Georgia — Thousands of demonstrators in the Georgian capital converged on parliament again on Tuesday, venting outrage against the governing party's decision to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union. Like on five previous nights, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to push back the protesters, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital's central boulevard. Nearly 300 protesters have been detained, and 26 people, including three police officers, have been hospitalized with injuries. 'The more force they use, the angrier people become, because everyone they arrest has relatives, and everyone understands that this is injustice,' said Tamar Kordzaia, a member of Unity National Movement opposition group. Kordzaia voiced confidence that the protesters will achieve their goal of calling new elections and joining the EU, noting that police on Monday 'looked very tired. I am sure we need to withstand a little longer.' The ruling Georgian Dream party retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia's EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia's help and boycotted parliament sessions. Mass opposition protests sparked by the vote gained new momentum after the governing party's decision on Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. 'We are fighting for our democracy, to protect human rights, human dignity,' said Rusudan Chanturia, who attended Tuesday's protest. Another demonstrator, David Jandieri, said the daily protests must continue until the demonstrators achieve their goal. 'In fact, we do not have another choice,' he said. Georgia's Interior Ministry said Tuesday that 293 protesters were detained on administrative charges and five arrested on criminal charges. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has refused to recognize the official election results and contested them in the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal on Tuesday. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to lead the opposition demand for a new parliamentary election. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc's recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. It requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Georgian government's announcement of the EU accession talks' suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October's election as neither free nor fair. On Monday, the EU reiterated its 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of Georgian Dream declared Tuesday that the government is willing to open EU accession talks if the bloc ends its 'blackmail.' 'I want to remind European bureaucrats and politicians, including those who are artificially hindering our country's European integration, to bring negotiations to the table, and we will sign immediately, on the same day, at that very moment,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/demonstrators-converge-on-georgia-s-parliament-protest-eu-bid-delay/7886557.html	2024-12-03T19:46:50-08:00	
Taiwan says China's threats over president's US visit are counterproductive	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan's top China policymaker on Wednesday said Chinese military threats would only drive the two sides further apart, as state media in the island's giant neighbor warned of a strong response to a U.S. visit by Taiwan's president. China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has expressed anger at President Lai Ching-te's weekend trip to Hawaii on his way to three countries in the Pacific that maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. Lai, who is also due to spend one night in the U.S. territory of Guam on Wednesday, is making what are formally only stopovers. However, he spent two days in Hawaii where he met the governor, gave speeches and visited a World War II memorial. Security sources have told Reuters that China could stage new war games around Taiwan as early as this weekend in response to the trip. Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Mainland Affairs Council minister Chiu Chui-cheng said Lai's trip to consolidate friendship with other countries was supported by the Taiwanese public. 'But the Chinese communists threaten Taiwan with military hegemony, which I think is something our citizens do not agree with,' he said. 'This will only cause cross-strait relations to drift further and further away, and which will not be helpful to ties in the future.' The international community should take China's military drills and threats seriously, he added. Lai and his government reject Beijing's sovereignty claims and say they have a right to engage with the rest of the world. China calls Lai a 'separatist' and has staged two rounds of war games around Taiwan since he took office in May. China's military also operates around Taiwan on a daily basis. In a commentary on its website on Wednesday, Chinese state television said the real purpose of Lai's transits was to 'rely on the United States to seek independence' which shows he is the real destroyer of peace in the Taiwan Strait. 'Lai is well aware that his 'transit' in the United States is bound to meet with resolute opposition and strong countermeasures from the mainland side, which will only aggravate the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait,' it said. Taiwan presidents customarily make transit stops in the United States on the way to and from far flung allies in the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean in what the United States says is a routine practice done for safety and convenience reasons. Chinese state television said that was merely an excuse for Taiwan to 'legitimize' the trip. 'It is pushing Taiwan step by step into an even more dangerous situation,' it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-china-s-threats-over-president-s-us-visit-are-counterproductive/7886556.html	2024-12-03T19:40:33-08:00	
Philippine Coast Guard says Chinese actions ‘aggressive’ near Scarborough Shoal	MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine coast guard said Chinese navy and coast guard vessels had taken 'aggressive actions' against a routine patrol by it and the fisheries bureau near the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea on Wednesday. A Chinese coast guard fired a water cannon at a PCG vessel 'aiming directly at the vessel's navigational antennas,' Jay Tarriela, PCG spokesperson for the South China Sea, said in a statement. Philippine vessels also faced 'blocking, shadowing, and dangerous maneuvers' from Chinese navy and coast guard ships, he added. Tensions between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea have escalated throughout the year, particularly over the Scarborough Shoal, a prime fishing patch. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, parts of which are also claimed by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-coast-guard-says-chinese-actions-aggressive-near-scarborough-shoal/7886555.html	2024-12-03T19:37:11-08:00	
Yoon’s martial law declaration sparks chaos in South Korea	South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly imposed martial law Tuesday, an unanticipated move that rattled the nation and underscored political turmoil in the U.S. ally.

Survey: 4 months after uprising, most Bangladeshis want new elections	WASHINGTON — Four months after a student uprising deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, most Bangladeshis want new elections within a year, despite strong support for the interim government's reform agenda, according to a new survey. The survey, sponsored by Voice of America and conducted by a Bangladeshi research firm in late October, found that while 65.9% of respondents back ongoing government reforms, more than 61.1% want new polls held within 12 months. The findings suggest that many Bangladeshis desire reforms and elections equally — elections to restore democracy after 15 years of Hasina's increasingly authoritarian rule and reforms to strengthen institutions weakened under her watch. 'I think that people definitely want elections, and at the same time, people definitely want reforms,' said Zillur Rahman, a journalist and political commentator based in the capital, Dhaka. 'This government would do well to focus only on the reforms related to elections.' The poll, based on a random sample of 1,000 respondents, is one of the largest measures of public opinion in Bangladesh since Hasina was removed from power in August. Conducted by Org-Quest Research Limited, it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The survey was conducted when the interim government began rolling out an ambitious set of reforms that officials say could take years to implement. These reforms aim to overhaul key state institutions, including the elections commission, police and judiciary, and the constitution itself, to prevent a return to what proponents call Hasina's authoritarianism. The poll found strong support for institutional reform. An overwhelming majority of respondents (59.9%) said they wanted the government to complete 'all necessary reforms' before holding elections, while 31.9% said it should focus only on election-related reforms. Among those supporting comprehensive reforms before elections, support for reforming the election commission and several other key sectors ran upward of 90%. But even as they supported reforms, Bangladeshis appeared increasingly impatient for new elections. Support for early elections spanned all demographics, with 60.4% of city dwellers and 61.4% of rural residents saying they wanted elections within one year. There were 18.7% of respondents willing to wait between two and three years for new elections to allow time for reforms, while another 8.6% were open to waiting longer than a year but not more than 18 months. In a country where results of three recent elections — in 2014, 2018 and 2024 — were questioned, the strong desire for fresh elections is not surprising, said Nusrat Chowdhury, an anthropology professor at Amherst College. 'When people think about democracy, one of the first things they think about is elections,' Chowdhury, a native of Bangladesh, said in an interview with VOA. 'So, I think it's kind of almost a gut response to say, 'Yes, we want elections within the next year because people want stability.'' For the interim government, balancing calls for early elections and the need for long-term reforms is a delicate act. Since the interim government's installation in August, various political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main opposition to Hasina's Awami League party, have demanded a road map for parliamentary elections within a 'reasonable time.' The government, however, has not committed to a timeline. In a September interview, army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman voiced support for holding elections within 18 months. Yet, interim government officials, including leader Muhammad Yunus, have indicated elections would occur only after at least some reforms are implemented. In a recent interview with Al Jazeera, Yunus said his government has a mandate to carry out reforms before holding elections. 'The highlight of the whole government was reform, because the whole student movement was to create a New Bangladesh,' he said. 'New Bangladesh is not going to come through just [by] holding a new election. Holding an election is a repetition of the old ways of doing things.' Reform advocates appear willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Student leaders have warned that holding elections before completing the reform program will bring back 'fascism,' a reference to Hasina's rule. Four months in, the interim government remains popular. Some 58.4% of respondents said it was governing Bangladesh better than Hasina's administration, while 20.4% said it was doing worse. Some 63.2% said the government was doing a better job maintaining law and order, and 64.1% believed it was doing a better job providing security for ethnic and religious minority groups, according to the survey. But with inflation stubbornly high, 44.7% said the government was doing a worse job reining in the cost of essential goods, with 23.8% saying it was doing a better job. And 30.8% said it was performing the same as the previous government. As revealing as the survey might be, Chowdhury noted that Bangladesh is a deeply divided country, with most people supporting either the BNP or Hasina's Awami League. With Awami League supporters keeping a low profile, those divisions may not be captured in public opinion surveys, she said. 'There are people who are [Awami League] loyalists. There are people who are critical of the interim government only because it came at the cost of the fall of the regime. I think when we see survey data, we also need to keep that in mind,' Chowdhury said.

Biden pardon renews debate over presidential clemency	U.S. President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden this week, ending a political saga that had divided American lawmakers for years.

Taiwan's President Lai visits Pacific ally Tuvalu	Taiwan President Lai Ching-te arrived in Tuvalu on Wednesday, a Tuvalu official said, reinforcing ties with the remote Pacific Island nation on the front line of climate change. 'Taiwan's president and his delegation arrived this morning in Tuvalu,' a Tuvalu government official told Reuters. Lai flew in on a private jet from the Marshall Islands and will stay in Tuvalu for the day before leaving for Guam, as part of a Pacific tour of allies. Tuvalu Prime Minister Feleti Teo reaffirmed ties with Taiwan after he was elected in February and traveled to Taipei to meet with Lai for Taiwan's National Day celebrations in October. With a population of 11,000 scattered across nine low-lying atolls, and predictions that half of its main town will be submerged by rising tides by 2050, Tuvalu is reliant on donor partners including Taiwan to fortify its coast. It will be connected to international telecommunications by a subsea cable for the first time in a joint project backed by Taiwan, Australia, the United States and Japan. Tuvalu's national election was closely watched by China, amid a tussle for influence in the Pacific region, and afterward a leadership candidate said Taiwan ties would be reviewed. China, which views Taiwan as its own territory and opposes any foreign interactions or visits by the island's leaders, has been stepping up military pressure against Taiwan, including two rounds of war games this year. Lai will stop over in Guam for one night and then go to Palau.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-president-lai-visits-pacific-ally-tuvalu/7886519.html	2024-12-03T17:48:45-08:00	
UN: Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced in latest fighting	United Nations — The United Nations said Tuesday that tens of thousands of Syrians have been displaced in the recent fighting between rebels and the government in northwest Syria as the rebels rapidly make territorial gains. 'While thousands have arrived in the central and southern regions of the country, many are trapped at front lines, unable to seek safety in other areas in the country,' Adam Abdelmoula, U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Syria, told reporters in a briefing call from Damascus. He said intense fighting, shelling and airstrikes have displaced residents from the cities of Idlib, Aleppo and Hama. There have been reports of civilian casualties, but Abdelmoula said the extent is still unclear. North of Aleppo in Tel Rifaat, an estimated 125,000 people are in the process of moving east, and as many as a third of that number have arrived. 'The latest information received yesterday night, more than 5,000 families, amounting to anywhere between 30,000 to 40,000 individuals, have moved and have entered the northeastern region,' Ramanathan Balakrishnan, U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, told reporters from Amman, Jordan, on the same briefing call. On November 27, multiple rebel groups aligned under the leadership of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, launched their biggest challenge in years to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. They swept into Aleppo, which the government had held since 2016, stunning the Syrian army and capturing the airport, a military academy and much of the city. They also took towns and villages in Idlib governorate, and on Tuesday were approaching the city of Hama. HTS, which was formerly affiliated with al-Qaida, is a U.N. Security Council-designated terrorist group. It is also listed by the United States, Britain and the European Union as a terrorist group. 'This is the most significant escalation of hostilities witnessed in Syria since 2019,' Abdelmoula said. UN urges de-escalation 'Now in the space of a week, we have seen the de-escalation lines agreed in 2020 and earlier entirely unravel,' said U.N. Syria envoy Geir Pedersen. 'Further shifts in the northeast threaten to unravel other ceasefire arrangements, too, in place since 2019.' Pedersen told an emergency meeting Tuesday of the U.N. Security Council that the Syrian parties and key international stakeholders need to be 'seriously engaged in meaningful and substantive negotiations' to stop the fighting. 'If we do not see de-escalation and a rapid move to a serious political process involving the Syrian parties and the key international players, then I fear we will see a deepening of the crisis,' Pedersen said by video from Geneva. 'Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration and destruction.' Russia entered the war on the side of the Assad regime in 2015 and has been carrying out airstrikes against rebel positions in recent days in support of the Syrian army. 'From the beginning of the operation, approximately 400 terrorists have been liquidated; more than 600 were wounded,' Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said of their strikes. Syria’s ambassador demanded that the council condemn what he said is a terrorist attack against his country. Both the Russian and Syrian envoys accused the United States of supporting terrorist groups in Syria. 'The representative from the Russian Federation is in no position to lecture us on this issue, particularly when it props up regimes that sponsor terrorism around the world,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood shot back in response to the allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7886492.html	2024-12-03T16:59:58-08:00	
US conducts 'self-defense' strike in Syria	PENTAGON — The Pentagon says the U.S. military carried out a strike in 'self-defense' in eastern Syria on Tuesday, destroying several weapons systems. Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters that the military struck three truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers, a T-64 tank and mortars that presented a 'clear and imminent threat to U.S. and coalition forces' in the vicinity of Military Support Site Euphrates. 'The self-defense strike occurred after the mobile multiple rocket launchers fired rockets in the vicinity of MSS Euphrates and mortars were fired toward U.S. forces,' he said, adding that the strike was 'not linked to any broader activities in northwest Syria by other groups.' Ryder said the U.S. was 'still assessing' who was operating the weapons that were struck on Tuesday. The U.S. was aware of Syrian military forces that operate in the area and Iranian-backed militia groups in the area that have conducted attacks on MSS Euphrates in the past, according to Ryder, but could not confirm who was responsible for Tuesday's attack. U.S. forces are in Syria to help Syrian Democratic Forces prevent the Islamic State group from resurging. Last week, U.S. Central Command forces used A-10 fighter aircraft to hit a target threatening U.S. and coalition forces at MSS Euphrates. 'Individuals were observed preparing a rocket rail,' Ryder told reporters. David Adesnik, vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the U.S. should not consider pulling out its forces from Syria in response to increased fighting across the country, especially if it wants to keep the pressure on Islamic State. He said the terror group has already been 'substantially more effective' in areas under the control of Syrian President Bashar Assad. 'We are the ones sort of keeping the cork in the bottle. ISIS would have a lot more room for maneuver. ... It doesn't get much coverage, but they are inflicting pain on Assad's troops,' Adesnik said. ISIS is another name for the Islamic State group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-conducts-self-defense-strike-in-syria/7886481.html	2024-12-03T16:58:55-08:00	
Trump's lawyers urge judge to toss hush money criminal conviction	New York — President-elect Donald Trump's lawyers formally asked a judge Monday to throw out his hush money criminal conviction, arguing that continuing the case would present unconstitutional 'disruptions to the institution of the Presidency.' In a filing made public Tuesday, Trump's lawyers told Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan that anything short of immediate dismissal would undermine the transition of power, as well as the 'overwhelming national mandate' granted to Trump by voters last month. They also cited President Joe Biden's recent pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, who had been convicted of tax and gun charges. 'President Biden asserted that his son was 'selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' and 'treated differently,'' Trump's legal team wrote. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, they claimed, had engaged in the type of political theater 'that President Biden condemned.' Prosecutors will have until Dec. 9 to respond. They have said they will fight any efforts to dismiss the case but have indicated a willingness to delay the sentencing until after Trump's second term ends in 2029. In their filing Monday, Trump's attorneys dismissed the idea of holding off sentencing until Trump is out of office as a 'ridiculous suggestion.' Following Trump's election victory last month, Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed his sentencing, previously scheduled for late November, to allow the defense and prosecution to weigh in on the future of the case. He also delayed a decision on Trump's prior bid to dismiss the case on immunity grounds. Trump has been fighting for months to reverse his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to suppress her claim that they had sex a decade earlier. He says they did not and denies any wrongdoing. The defense filing was signed by Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who represented Trump during the trial and have since been selected by the president-elect to fill senior roles at the Justice Department. Taking a swipe at Bragg and New York City, as Trump often did throughout the trial, the filing argues that dismissal would also benefit the public by giving him and 'the numerous prosecutors assigned to this case a renewed opportunity to put an end to deteriorating conditions in the City and to protect its residents from violent crime.' Clearing Trump, the lawyers added, would also allow him to 'to devote all of his energy to protecting the Nation.' Merchan hasn't yet set a timetable for a decision. He could decide to uphold the verdict and proceed to sentencing, delay the case until Trump leaves office, wait until a federal appeals court rules on Trump's parallel effort to get the case moved out of state court or choose some other option. An outright dismissal of the New York case would further lift a legal cloud that at one point carried the prospect of derailing Trump's political future. Last week, special counsel Jack Smith told courts that he was withdrawing both federal cases against Trump — one charging him with hoarding classified documents at his Florida estate, the other with scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election he lost — citing longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a president from indictment while in office. The hush money case was the only one of Trump's four criminal indictments to go to trial, resulting in a historic verdict that made him the first former president to be convicted of a crime. If the verdict stands and the case proceeds to sentencing, Trump's punishments would range from a fine to probation to up to four years in prison — but it's unlikely he'd spend any time behind bars for a first-time conviction involving charges in the lowest tier of felonies. Because it is a state case, Trump would not be able to pardon himself once he returns to office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7886485.html	2024-12-03T16:46:23-08:00	
French no-confidence vote could topple prime minister's government	The government of France faces a no-confidence vote Wednesday, a move that could topple the government of Prime Minister Michel Barnier. Analysts predict French lawmakers will likely vote in favor of a no-confidence motion. Barnier warned the politicians that voting his government down 'would make everything more difficult for France.' The no-confidence vote follows a seldom-used constitutional move the prime minister invoked Monday when he pushed through the 2025 budget without parliamentary approval, something Barnier said he did to maintain 'stability' amid France's deep political divisions. Barnier, who has been prime minister for just three months, is seeking to bring France's gigantic budget deficit under control. The government can pass legislation without parliamentary approval under Article 49.3 of France's constitution. That move, however, opens up the option of no-confidence motions. The prime minister's action prompted Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally and the leftist New Popular Front to both respond with filings for no-confidence motions. The left and the far-right together hold enough votes to overturn the prime minister's government, according to Reuters, which reports that Le Pen has confirmed that her party would support a left-wing alliance's no-confidence motion. A far-right motion would not receive enough votes from lawmakers. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the lawmakers voting in favor of the no-confidence vote were playing Russian roulette with France's future. French President Emmanuel Macron said he could 'not believe' the lawmakers had teamed up for the no confidence motion against the government and accused Le Pen of 'unbearable cynicism.' 'We must not scare people with these things. We have a strong economy,' the president said. Macron said he is holding on to the hope that the politicians will not censure the French government. 'It doesn't make sense,' he told reporters during a trip to Saudi Arabia. He compared the situation to 'political fiction.' There have also been calls for Macron's resignation, but the president said he has no intention of resigning before his term ends in 2027. 'It so happens that if I am before you, it is because I was elected twice by the French people,' he said. 'I am extremely proud of this, and I will honor this trust with all the energy that is mine until the last second to be useful to the country.' Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-no-confidence-vote-could-topple-prime-minister-s-government/7886458.html	2024-12-03T16:33:05-08:00	
Chinese hackers still lurk in US telecommunications systems	WASHINGTON — Chinese hackers blamed for compromising U.S. telecommunications infrastructure and spying on American presidential campaigns and American officials are still entrenched in those systems, according to senior U.S. officials who warn it could be years before the hackers are kicked out. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI on Tuesday urged U.S. telecommunication companies and their customers to take additional precautions, saying the breach might go deeper than first thought. 'We cannot say with certainty that the adversary has been evicted because we still don't know the scope of what they're doing,' Jeff Greene, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a briefing with reporters. 'We cannot with confidence say that we know everything, nor would our partners,' Greene said. 'We're still trying to understand.' A senior FBI official who also spoke with reporters was equally cautious. 'Understanding the scope of the adversary activity through our investigations, in a situation of this magnitude, is measured in years,' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the breach investigation. The Chinese-linked hackers have been coy, adjusting their behavior as more information about their activities becomes public. 'As more comes to light they change their TTPs [tactics, techniques and procedures] and their approach,' the official warned. 'They may go dormant for a while to lower their profile.' Word of the breach emerged in October, when the Chinese-linked cyber gang known as Salt Typhoon was linked to efforts to intercept communications for the presidential campaigns of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris. Less than a month later, CISA and the FBI warned that the Chinese efforts to spy on the Trump and Harris campaigns were just the start of 'a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign' that penetrated multiple U.S. telecommunication companies. China has repeatedly denied the U.S. allegations, accusing Washington of a smear campaign aimed at undermining Beijing. 'For quite some time, the US side has patched up all sorts of disinformation about threats of 'Chinese hackers' to serve its own geopolitical purposes,' Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email Tuesday regarding the latest allegations. 'China firmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks,' Liu said. 'The US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China.' But U.S. officials have repeatedly pushed back against Chinese denials, and now say the Chinese breach goes even further than initially thought, impacting telecommunication companies around the world, and that it appears to be part of a larger Chinese government effort to gather information about adversaries worldwide. 'Certainly, the way they went about it was very, very specific,' the senior FBI official said, noting the focus on telecommunications infrastructure and internet service providers. 'But it fits into the cyber espionage bucket to really inform global goals for the Chinese.' Neither CISA nor the FBI would say how many telecommunication companies or how many countries have been impacted. But the agencies said the Chinese efforts in the U.S. fall into three categories: individual communications, customer call records and U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders. The focus on individual communications appears to be on intercepting audio of phone calls and the content of text messages for a select number of high-profile U.S. government officials, such as individuals with the Trump and Harris campaigns. The mass collection of customer call records appears to be more random. 'Essentially, they stole data about where, when and whom individuals were communicating with,' said the senior FBI official. 'We don't believe that those were specifically targeted,' the official added. 'We essentially think that they were essentially swept up by the adversary.' The officials said the third category of intercepted information, related to law enforcement requests and court orders, also appears to have been targeted somewhat by chance. Forensic analysis in two of the instances in which the Chinese hackers accessed law enforcement information 'has indicated that the actors were on other parts of their network conducting reconnaissance before pivoting to the [law enforcement portal] and surrounding devices,' the FBI official said. Just how far the Chinese hackers got, though, is not clear. Officials said the hacked portal does include some court orders that relate to foreign intelligence collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act but declined to say whether any of that information was taken by the China-linked hackers. 'We're not prepared to answer that question today,' the senior FBI official said. For now, the FBI and CISA are urging telecommunications companies to harden their defenses, issuing an advisory with cyber agencies in Canada, Australia and New Zealand on steps they can take to reduce the threat. They also urged companies that think they may have been victimized to come forward. 'The companies that have worked closest with us are the furthest along and kicking the actors off their networks,' the senior FBI official said. The FBI and CISA are likewise urging consumers to be more vigilant about security, whether that means keeping mobile phones and other devices current with security updates, or by using encrypted platforms for messaging and other communications. 'We are not seeing any novel techniques,' said CISA's Greene, adding that the Chinese-linked hackers seem to have simply exploited known vulnerabilities in the telecommunications infrastructure environment. 'Encryption is your friend, whether it is on text messaging or if you have the capacity to use encrypted voice communications,' Greene said. 'Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is encrypted, it will make it impossible, if not really hard for them, to detect it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-hackers-still-lurk-in-us-telecommunications-systems/7886221.html	2024-12-03T16:31:17-08:00	
Trump's choice to run DEA withdraws from consideration	NEW YORK — Chad Chronister, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to run the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Tuesday he was withdrawing his name from consideration. Chronister is the second person selected by the president-elect to bow out quickly after being nominated for a position. Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, said in a post on X that he was backing away from the opportunity, which he called 'the honor of a lifetime.' 'Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I've concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration,' Chronister wrote. He did not elaborate, and Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Trump's pick of Chronister for the post drew backlash from conservatives, including for past comments he made that his sheriff's office was not focused on enforcing federal immigration laws. Chronister follows former Republican congressman Matt Gaetz, Trump's first choice to serve as attorney general, in withdrawing his name for a post in the administration. Gaetz withdrew following scrutiny over a federal sex trafficking investigation that cast doubt on his ability to be confirmed as the nation's chief federal law enforcement officer. The DEA post requires Senate confirmation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-choice-to-run-dea-withdraws-from-consideration-/7886224.html	2024-12-03T15:57:43-08:00	
Risk of North Korea's miscalculation rises after South's martial law declaration	WASHINGTON — U.S. analysts are warning against a possible provocation by Pyongyang after a short-lived declaration of martial law on Tuesday threw South Korea into political turmoil. 'There's potential for miscalculation on North Korea's part,' said Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, in a phone interview with VOA Korean. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol imposed emergency martial law on his unsuspecting country in a televised address Tuesday evening, saying it was aimed at 'eradicating pro-North Korean forces and to protect the constitutional order of freedom.' Surprising move Under the decree, all political activities, including rallies and demonstrations, were prohibited, while all media became subject to the control of the martial law command. Soon after Yoon's declaration, a majority of South Korean lawmakers voted to demand the lifting of martial law. Yoon, who was legally obligated to comply with the vote, did so less than six hours after his original declaration. Seiler said that could leave Yoon looking weak to the North Koreans, who might decide this is 'a great time to take advantage of this weakness to deal another blow to him through some type of provocation.' Seiler added that one of Kim Jong Un's primary goals is to undermine the U.S.-South Korea relationship and that Kim 'may see President [Yoon]'s actions as straining that relationship.' David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, agreed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may try to exploit the situation. 'If Yoon is correct and there are North Korean sympathizers in South Korea, we can expect them to incite violence,' Maxwell told VOA Korean via email. Maxwell worried that this could lead South Korean law enforcement agencies to 'inappropriately use force that could cause escalation.' Risk of miscalculation Robert Rapson, who served as charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean via email Tuesday that the U.S. should deliver a 'stern warning' to adversaries such as North Korea against trying to take advantage of the situation. Pyongyang should be reminded that 'our ironclad alliance and commitment to defend remains fully in effect,' he said. The United States reaffirmed it will continue to stand by South Korea, a major ally in the Indo-Pacific region, a few hours after Yoon's declaration. A National Security Council spokesperson told VOA that the Biden administration is 'in contact with the [South Korean] government and is monitoring the situation closely as we work to learn more.' The spokesperson added that the U.S. was not notified in advance of Yoon's plans. 'We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the ROK,' the spokesperson said. ROK is an abbreviation for Republic of Korea, the official name of South Korea. Kurt Campbell, deputy secretary of state, told reporters at a Washington event previewing Japan's 2025 Osaka Expo: 'I do want to underscore that our alliance with the ROK is ironclad, and we stand by Korea in their time of uncertainty.' 'We're watching the recent developments in the ROK with grave concern,' Campbell said. 'We're seeking to engage our ROK counterparts at every level both here and in Seoul.' Campbell stressed that the U.S. has 'every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.' Yoon has long been suffering from low approval ratings. Last week, his approval slid to 25% after rising for three consecutive weeks, according to a survey. Meanwhile, the ruling party and the opposition party have been in deadlock for weeks over the government budget bill for 2025. As of 4:22 a.m. Tuesday, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, 'so far, there was no abnormal move detected from North Korea,' stressing that Seoul's military readiness against North Korea is intact.

UNESCO says education about climate change is essential in southern Africa	PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — The United Nations environmental agency UNESCO is calling for more studies and closer working relations between journalists and scientists to ensure the effects of climate change are understood and can be mitigated, especially in poorer African countries, which more acutely feel the pinch of extreme weather events. On Tuesday, scientists gathered in Pretoria, South Africa, to discuss climate change with journalists from the Southern Africa Development Community region. Meeting under the theme 'Building Science Communication Capacity in the SADC Region,' the journalists were asked to report more often on climate change to ensure people are prepared before disasters such as floods and droughts. In an interview with VOA, Martiale Zebaze-Kana, head of the science unit of UNESCO in southern Africa, said more awareness of climate change and studies into how communities can adapt to it are crucial. 'I think we should focus essentially on really building in the capacity around the whole climate-related issues,' said Zebaze-Kana. 'And for us, in terms of mitigation also.' Zebaze-Kana also said it is important to look at what's happening in a region, to build resilience and to watch for early warning signs across the SADC region. After being hit by El Nino-induced drought, Southern Africa is experiencing its worst food insecurity in years. Millions of people across several countries are dependent on food handouts from aid organizations. Sosten Chiotha, the director of a nongovernmental organization called Leadership for Environment and Development Southern and Eastern Africa, said he wants developing countries to do more climate adaptation studies because developing countries experience the worst effects of global warming. 'Climate change amplifies existing vulnerabilities,' said Chiotha. 'So, you have poor that are poor, it means their infrastructure is not going to stand storms of speeds. In Malawi, winds of 70 to 80 kilometers were strong enough to blow off houses. But in places where they receive tornadoes frequently — they have been receiving them for a long time — the buildings will withstand that kind of [speed]. So, it’s a question of changing the way we do things, constructing our roads, make sure we have [proper] drainage. Also, people where they are staying — should not stay in flood-prone areas. So, all these things are what need to be done.' Charles Chikunda, UNESCO’s officer for climate education, said it’s also important that children learn how to deal with a changing environment. 'In fact, we should start to teach everything that we went from an early age,' said Chikunda. 'Let's not wait for children to go to university. We want them to start thinking about their issues at an early age, how to solve them.' Chikunda added that some countries in the SADC region, such as Lesotho and Zimbabwe, have already started infusing climate change into their curriculum.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unesco-says-education-about-climate-change-is-essential-in-southern-africa/7886128.html	2024-12-03T15:30:37-08:00

Trump's tariffs: Mapping the economic ripple effects	President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs are poised to significantly impact countries with substantial trade volumes with the United States. The primary nations affected include China, Mexico and Canada, which are among the largest U.S. trading partners. Trump has said that tariffs can help his administration pay for proposed tax cuts. But these tariffs are expected to disrupt trade flows, potentially leading to increased consumer prices in the U.S. and prompting retaliatory measures from the affected countries. Industries such as automotive, agriculture and technology may experience significant impacts due to their reliance on imports and exports with these nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-tariffs-mapping-the-economic-ripple-effects/7886154.html	2024-12-03T14:31:32-08:00	
China tells World Court that UN treaties should cover states' climate obligations	THE HAGUE — China told the top U.N. court on Tuesday that existing U.N. treaties should provide the basis for its advisory opinion on states' legal obligations to fight global warming and address the consequences of their historic contributions to it. The U.N. General Assembly, after a campaign spearheaded by small island states, asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to issue an opinion on countries' legal responsibility for the negative impact of climate change. One of those states, Vanuatu on Monday asked the court to recognize the harm climate change had caused and order reparations for its consequences. China, one of the world's top two emitters of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming together with the U.S., said it understood the 'enormous difficulties' faced by developing countries such as the small island states, which are vulnerable especially to rising sea levels and increasingly violent storms. But Ma Xinmin, a legal adviser in China's Foreign Ministry, told the court that the existing treaties produced by U.N.-backed climate change negotiations, which include many nonbinding provisions, should be the benchmark for determining states' obligations. 'China hopes that the court will uphold the U.N. climate change negotiations mechanism as the primary channel for global climate governance,' Ma said. While advisory opinions from the ICJ, often called the World Court, are not binding, they are legally and politically significant. Experts say its eventual opinion on climate change will probably be cited in climate change-driven lawsuits in courts from Europe to Latin America and beyond. More than 100 states and organizations will give their views in the coming weeks. The United States is due to address the court on Wednesday. The court's opinion is expected to be delivered in 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tells-world-court-that-un-treaties-should-cover-states-climate-obligations/7886106.html	2024-12-03T13:18:53-08:00

Syrian rebels advance toward Hama city, pressuring Assad, his allies	Syrian rebels advancing against government forces pushed close on Tuesday to the major city of Hama, rebels and a war monitor said, after their sudden capture of Aleppo last week rocked President Bashar al-Assad. Rebels and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said insurgents had captured villages including Maar Shahur a few miles north of the city. Syrian state media said reinforcements were arriving in the area. An attack on Hama would ramp up pressure on Assad, whose Russian and Iranian allies have scrambled to support him against a reviving rebellion. The city has remained in government hands since civil war erupted in 2011. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in an Arabic-language interview that Tehran would consider sending troops to Syria if Damascus asked, and Russian President Vladimir Putin urged an end to 'terrorist aggression' in Syria, RIA reported. Iraq Prime Minister Shia al-Sudani said Baghdad would not be 'a mere spectator' in Syria and blamed Israeli military strikes on the Syrian government for the rebel advance, his office said. Compounding Assad's problems, fighters from a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition battled government forces in the northeast, both sides said, opening a new front along a vital supply route. Last week's rebel seizure of Aleppo marked the biggest offensive for years. The front lines of the conflict have been frozen since 2020 after Assad clawed back most of the country from rebels, thanks to help from Russian air power and military help from Iran and its network of regional Shiite militia groups. Now, however, Russia has been concentrating on the war in Ukraine, while Israeli strikes over the past three months have decimated the leadership of Hezbollah, the strongest Iran-backed force fighting in Syria. On Monday, hundreds of Iran-backed Iraqi militia fighters entered Syria to back up Syrian government forces, Iraqi and Syrian sources said, but Hezbollah does not plan to send forces now. A rebel source said Iran-backed militia fighters were among the forces they were battling outside Hama. In recent days, Russian and Syrian government warplanes have intensified airstrikes against rebels, both sides have said. Rescue workers have reported deadly strikes on hospitals in Aleppo and Idlib. Any sustained escalation in Syria risks further destabilizing a region alight from wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where a truce between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group took effect last week. Groups fight for control The retreat by Assad's forces over the past several days has led to jockeying for control among other groups that control pockets in the northwest, north and east. The Syrian Democratic Forces, an umbrella group that controls territory in Syria's east with U.S. support, said early on Tuesday that its Deir al-Zor Military Council had 'become responsible for protecting' seven villages previously held by the Syrian army. The Deir al-Zor Military Council comprises local Arab fighters under the SDF, an alliance mainly led by a Kurdish militia, the YPG. Syrian state media reported that the army and allied forces were repelling an SDF assault on the villages, the only Syrian government presence along the east bank of the Euphrates River, an area otherwise mostly held by the SDF. A Syrian military officer said the SDF push was aimed at exploiting government forces' weakness after the rebel advance, and said the army and allied Iran-backed militia groups were sending reinforcements. Airstrikes also targeted Iran-backed militia groups supporting Syrian government forces in the strategically vital region, a security source in eastern Syria and a Syrian army source said. The U.S. military, which has a small number of troops based at a gas field in the area, carried out at least one strike in self-defense overnight, a U.S. official said, adding it was not related to the ongoing rebel advances. Many fighters on front The battlefield is crowded in northern Syria, with the U.S., Russia, Iran and Turkey all involved in the renewed fighting, underscoring the messy global politics at play. The SDF was the main Western-backed ground force in eastern Syria fighting Islamic State, which ran a mini-state there from 2014-17. Turkey says the SDF's main fighting force, the YPG, are Kurdish separatists it regards as terrorists, and sent troops across the frontier in 2017 to push them back. Rebel advances in recent days have dislodged the YPG from areas in and near Aleppo, including Aleppo's Sheikh Maqsoud district and a corridor around Tel Refaat to the north. The SDF presence in northeast Syria along much of the border with Iraq also complicates supply lines for Iran-backed regional militia groups supporting Assad. Israel has regularly struck Iran-backed forces in Syria. Hezbollah said an Israeli strike near Damascus on Tuesday killed one of its senior officers liaising with the Syrian military. Israel's military said it does not comment on reports in foreign media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-rebels-advance-close-to-hama-city-piling-pressure-on-assad-and-his-allies-/7885998.html	2024-12-03T12:32:51-08:00	
Health officials investigate mystery disease in southwest Congo after up to 143 deaths	KINSHASA, CONGO — A flu-like disease that has killed dozens of people over two weeks is being investigated in southwestern Congo, local authorities said. The deaths were recorded between November 10 and November 25 in the Panzi health zone of Kwango province. Symptoms include fever, headache, cough and anemia, provincial health minister Apollinaire Yumba told reporters over the weekend. The deputy provincial governor, Remy Saki, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that between 67 and 143 people had died. 'A team of epidemiological experts is expected in the region to take samples and identify the problem,' he added. Yumba advised the population to exercise caution and refrain from contact with the bodies of the dead to avoid contamination. He called on national and international partners to send medical supplies to deal with the health crisis. Congo is already plagued by the mpox epidemic, with more than 47,000 suspected cases and more than 1,000 suspected deaths from the disease in the Central African country, according to the World Health Organization. WHO is aware of the unidentified disease and has a team on the ground working with local health services to collect samples, according to an organization employee who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/health-officials-investigate-mystery-disease-in-southwest-congo-after-up-to-143-deaths/7885983.html	2024-12-03T11:54:20-08:00

Hefty debt to China stokes soaring inflation in Laos	BANGKOK — Laos is straining under soaring inflation rates made worse by the stress of massive loans owed mostly to China for a series of megaprojects that have yet to pay off. The tiny landlocked nation of nearly 8 million has already deferred some payments. But economists and analysts say Beijing may start asking for a stake in Laotian land, resources and infrastructure as compensation, which could expand China’s influence in the neighboring country. Rising prices Laos’ inflation rate jumped from the low single digits to 23% in 2022 and another 31% last year, the highest in all of Asia, according to the Asian Development Bank, or ADB. The regional development bank expects inflation to stay above 20% through 2025. Food prices have climbed even higher, nearly hitting 40% in 2023. The ADB says the prolonged climb has slammed most families in Laos, forcing many to eat less or even forage to make up for what they can no longer afford to buy in a country that already had the highest rates of hunger in mainland Southeast Asia. 'The price of everything [is] just increasing, increasing, increasing, more and more,' said a resident of Luang Prabang, Laos’ ancient royal capital, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the communist country’s authoritarian government. He said the price of beef has more than doubled in the past year and that an average meal or a grilled fish from a street stall now costs up to four times what it used to. 'People are suffering,' he said. 'Some people buy less than before because of things [being] more expensive. That is why many people now, we try to grow things by ourselves.' The Luang Prabang resident who works as a language instructor says he started a fruit and vegetable garden a year ago to help feed his own family and earn a little extra at the local market. Shaky kip Analysts and economists ascribe the rampant inflation to several factors, including a rise in global oil prices and a sharp drop in the value of the local currency, the kip, as central banks in other countries have raised their interest rates, driving their own currencies up. Souknilanh Keola, a senior economist at Indonesia’s Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia, mostly blames Laos’ failure to build up a healthy supply of foreign currency reserves over the years. He says that has forced the government to now spend big on foreign currencies to pay its bills with other countries, driving the kip down and the price of imports up. But he and others agree that the burden of servicing Laos’ mammoth public debt has made the problem worse. At $13.8 billion, or 108% of the country’s gross domestic product, the World Bank recently called Laos’ debt 'unsustainable.' Of the $10.5 billion Laos owes to other countries, half is due to China. Much of that debt has gone to financing Laos’ share of the bill for a few megaprojects, some backed by China, including hydropower dams on the Mekong River and a $6 billion high-speed rail line connecting China and Thailand through Laos. 'Because of the Chinese debt, yes, that put pressure on the foreign exchange,' Keola said. 'They had to do everything to try to buy foreign currencies in the market, and that put pressure for [the] Lao kip to be weaker, thus making inflation going up.' The kip lost half its value against the U.S. dollar in 2022 and another fifth during the first three quarters of this year, according to the World Bank. Wen Chong Cheah, a research analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit, says having to pay back so much debt has also been driving the kip down by making it less attractive for investors to buy, trade or hold. 'This plays into investor sentiment. If you expect a country to … default, if you expect the kip to worsen, you would less likely want to hold kip. This makes the allure of holding kip less,' he said. Laos watchers see little to no chance of China standing by to let the country default. Useful advocate Cheah says Laos has been a useful advocate of China’s interests this year as chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, playing down talk of a code of conduct for the South China Sea. ASEAN has been in talks with Beijing for years over a binding code for the sea, where China has overlapping claims with several members. Landlocked Laos does not have any claims in the South China Sea. Analysts say China is widely seen to be dragging its feet, preferring instead to deal with the competing countries one on one to make the most of its overwhelming size. 'Laos provides China a voice in Southeast Asia,' said Cheah. 'It is in China’s best interests to not let Laos default because if Laos defaults it is likely to seek aid from Western countries or multilateral organizations, and this would diminish China’s influence.' Debt swaps He said China was likely to keep deferring some of the debt, but added that more so-called debt-for-equity swaps, where China trades a part of the debt for a stake in some equity such as land or mineral rights, were another distinct possibility. In 2021, Laos gave China a majority stake in a joint venture between a Chinese state-owned power company and its own, heavily leveraged Electricite du Laos. The deal effectively handed Beijing control over the country’s power grid, including electricity exports to neighbors. 'I think these forms of restructuring — they are not a straightforward 'debt-for-equity swap' — are likely to grow, but it depends what crown jewels China wants for its wider strategic aims,' said Pon Souvannaseng, assistant professor of global studies at Bentley University in the United States. 'I don't think it'll be hard for them to get their way.' Although the terms of China’s loans to Laos are opaque, they do include some land and natural resources as collateral, according to AidData, a research unit based at the William & Mary, a university in the U.S. state of Virginia. Keola said Laos’ mineral mines would be a likely option for any future swaps or restructuring of the sort arranged for Electricite du Laos. Souvannaseng said that raises serious questions about how much China might add to its already considerable leverage over the country if its stake in key assets keeps growing. 'Outside countries like the U.S. should wonder to what extent the de facto suzerainty will influence Lao economic and political relations with other countries and to what extent it will start harmonizing its foreign policy with China on key issues that China wants backing on,' she said. 'The risk is there,' Cheah agreed. 'The electricity company is a very clear example that that has happened.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hefty-debt-to-china-stokes-soaring-inflation-in-laos-/7885926.html	2024-12-03T11:22:18-08:00	
Regional analysts suggest caution as Nigeria signs new deals with France	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Political analysts in Nigeria say the country needs to be careful after signing a series of agreements with France during President Bola Tinubu’s three-day visit to the European country last week. Tinubu’s three-day visit to France was the first official state visit to Paris by a Nigerian leader in more than two decades. During the visit, Nigeria and France signed two major deals, including a $300 million pact to develop critical infrastructure, renewable energy, transportation, agriculture and health care in Nigeria. Both nations also signed an agreement to increase food security and develop Nigeria's solid minerals sector. Tinubu has been trying to attract investments to boost Nigeria's ailing economy. While many praise his latest deals with France, some critics are urging caution. The deals come as France looks for friends in West Africa following a series of military coups in countries where it formerly had strong ties — Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Ahmed Buhari, a political affairs analyst, criticized the partnership. 'Everybody is trying to look for a new development partner that would seemingly be working in their own interest, but obviously we don't seem to be on the same page,' Buhari said. 'We're partnering with France, who [has] been responsible for countries like Chad, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and the likes, and we haven't seen significant developments in those places in the last 100 years.' Abuja-based political analyst Chris Kwaja said France's strained relationships with the Sahelian states do not affect Nigeria. 'That the countries of the Sahel have a fractured relationship with France does not in any way define the future of the Nigeria-France relationship,' Kwaja said. 'No country wants to operate as an island. Every country is looking at strategic partnerships and relationships.' France has a long history of involvement in the Sahel region, including military intervention, economic cooperation and development aid. Critics say the countries associated with France have been grappling with poverty and insecurity. Eze Onyekpere, economist and founder of the Center for Social Justice, said Nigeria must be wary of any deal before signing. 'It is a little bit disappointing considering the reputation of France in the way they've been exploiting minerals across the Sahel,’ Onyekpere said. 'They've been undertaking exploitation in a way and manner that's not in the best interest of those countries. I hope we have good enough checks to make sure that the agreements signed will generally be in the interest of both countries and not a one-sided agreement.' Nigeria is France’s top trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa. During the president's visit, two Nigerian banks — Zenith and United Bank for Africa — also signed agreements to expand their operations into France.	https://www.voanews.com/a/regional-analysts-suggest-caution-as-nigeria-signs-new-deals-with-france/7885918.html	2024-12-03T11:17:18-08:00	
Kenyan banks urged to employ more people with disabilities to boost inclusion, service delivery	NAIROBI — As the world Tuesday marks the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, Kenyan banks and financial institutions are being urged to employ more people living with disabilities and invest in programs that cater to their financial needs and services. Kenyan banks have improved their accessibility to people living with disabilities by redesigning their entrances for easy access and creating special desks to serve them better, according to the Kenya Bankers Association. Despite the progress made, still more is needed to create financial inclusion for such people in employment. The association's report says only 1% of disabled people is employed in the banking sector. The acting head of the Kenya Bankers Association, Raymond Molenje, called for improved employment opportunities for them in the coming years. 'It's a challenge that we need to intentionally work on this and be able to see within the next year, two years we can move that to two, three percent,' Molenje said. 'For the government, there is a target for the government workforce; every institution ought to be at five percent, so that is government law, but as a private sector, we need to be even far ahead of the government.' Almost 1 million Kenyans live with some form of disability, according to the country’s 2019 census. Seven banks in Kenya participated in a four-month-long project to understand the challenges faced by people with disabilities in accessing financial services in the country. Equity Bank is one of the companies participating in the project. The bank's adviser on diversity, equity, and inclusion, Iram Bahawal, said some digital services do not tend to the needs of disabled people. 'Some of these apps are not friendly to those with dyslexia; they are not friendly with those with epilepsy. They are not friendly to those with low vision,' Bahawal said. 'Looking at all this, some of these things are quick skills – we need to tweak some of these backend codes, and it becomes accessible.' Julius Mbura, advocacy officer from inAble, an organization that empowers people with disabilities, said such employment can improve the service delivery of banks to disabled people. 'Now that they are embracing disability inclusion and bringing people with disabilities on board as their workforce, they should endeavor to make sure that their internal assets for platforms, communications and their service delivery should be fluid and accommodative of persons with disabilities; because once you employ a person with disabilities, reasonable accommodation is one of the areas we should look at and to ensure that there is [a] conducive working environment for persons with disabilities,' Mbura said. The banking association and other stakeholders in the financial sector, moving forward, said they want to focus on mobile applications, online banking, bank statements, ATMs, social media, and employment software applications. The banking association will review the recommendations received from the four-month projects in the coming months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-banks-urged-to-employ-more-people-with-disabilities-to-boost-inclusion-service-delivery/7885821.html	2024-12-03T10:43:20-08:00	
US watches situation in South Korea 'with grave concern'	WASHINGTON — The United States says it is closely monitoring the rapidly evolving situation in South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeol declared emergency martial law, citing the need to protect the nation from North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements. Taken by surprise, U.S. officials are actively engaging with the South Korean government to address the situation. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said on Tuesday that the U.S. is watching developments in South Korea 'with grave concern' and expressed every hope and expectation that 'any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.' President Joe Biden, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been briefed on the developments and are being kept updated as the situation unfolds, according to Campbell. He added that U.S. officials are actively engaging with their South Korean counterparts at all levels, in Washington and Seoul. Late Tuesday, Yoon declared martial law during an unannounced late-night address, vowing to eliminate what he described as 'anti-state' forces amid a power struggle with the opposition-controlled parliament, which he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea. Within hours, the National Assembly voted to overturn the declaration. Speaker Woo Won Shik announced that lawmakers 'will protect democracy with the people' and called for the immediate withdrawal of police and military forces from the Assembly grounds. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-watches-situation-in-south-korea-with-grave-concern/7885823.html	2024-12-03T10:37:55-08:00

Spain to offer visas to 900,000 undocumented migrants amid surge	LONDON/LAS PALMAS, SPAIN — Record numbers of migrants arrived on Spain’s Canary Islands from West Africa this year, according to newly released government figures. Some 41,425 migrants arrived on the islands between January 1 and November 30, according to the figures released Monday. The number surpassed the 39,910 migrants recorded in 2023, which also broke previous records. Most of the migrants are from Mali, Morocco and Senegal. The islands lie in the Atlantic Ocean more than 100 kilometers west of Morocco and have long attracted migrants seeking a new life in Europe. The latest figures were published as Spain outlines plans to offer visas to up to 900,000 undocumented migrants already in the country, while simultaneously clamping down on new arrivals. Madrid announced plans to offer visas to 300,000 undocumented migrants every year for the next three years, allowing them to remain in the country to study and find work. Spain needs young workers’ taxes to fund the pensions and health care of its aging population, according to the minister for migration, Elma Saiz. 'Spain has to choose between being an open and prosperous country or being a closed and poor country. And we have chosen the former. That is why there are already 2.9 million foreigners paying monthly Social Security contributions [taxes],' Saiz announced at a press conference in Madrid on November 19. Saiz said that the government plans to 'cut red tape' to make it easier for migrants to enter the labor market. 'We want to make it easier for foreigners to get a job suited to their professional profile and, at the same time, for companies to find the professionals they need,' she said. The visas will be offered only to migrants already in Spain. Simultaneously, Madrid says it is clamping down on new arrivals by striking deals with African states to curb migrant departures and increase offshore patrols. Spain has also called for the European Union’s border agency, Frontex, to resume patrols in the region. Authorities have struggled to cope with the surge in migrant arrivals on the Canary Islands. Adult migrants are held in camps as they await transfer to the Spanish mainland, where their visa applications are processed. Children younger than 18 stay at shelters on the islands and are offered places in local schools. Bocar Gueye, 36, who arrived on the island of Gran Canaria from Mauritania, told VOA that he was happy to have survived the journey. 'They will give the tickets [for travel to the mainland] to everyone, but it is not easy. Everyone will wait their turn. With all the difficulties we had at sea, I think that the rest, we can be patient,' Gueye said. Tensions on the islands are growing, however. Residents of Las Palmas staged demonstrations in October against the increase in migrant arrivals. Many fear that the government’s plan to regularize the status of migrants already in Spain will encourage more people to attempt the journey. 'Right now, we don't need immigrants to work,' said Rudy Ruyman, who helped to organize the protests on October 27. 'What we need is to give work to the Canary Islanders and to the Spanish in general. We must take care of our land, of our people, of our children, and encourage Canarians and Spaniards to have children. Because if not, what will be left of Spain and the Canary Islands? We will lose our identity,' he told VOA. The migration debate is shadowed by tragedy. The journey from Africa’s Atlantic coast to the Canary Islands remains one of the deadliest routes to Europe. Aid agencies estimate around 1,000 people die every month attempting the crossing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-to-offer-visas-to-900-000-undocumented-migrants-amid-surge/7885556.html	2024-12-03T10:04:53-08:00

Hunter Biden gun case dismissed after President Joe Biden's sweeping pardon	WASHINGTON — A federal judge dismissed the gun case against Hunter Biden on Tuesday after President Joe Biden issued a sweeping pardon for his son. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika closed the case the week before Hunter Biden was to be sentenced. He could have faced up to 25 years in prison, though as a first-time offender he likely would have gotten far less time or avoided prison entirely. Prosecutors opposed dismissing the case, arguing in court documents that a pardon shouldn't wipe away the case 'as if it never occurred.' Hunter Biden was convicted on three felonies after he lied on a federal form to purchase a gun in Delaware by saying he wasn't a drug user in 2018, a period when he has acknowledged being addicted. The Justice Department special counsel is also opposed to dismissing a case filed in California after he failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes. A federal judge in Los Angeles hasn't yet ruled in that case. The president's Sunday decision to go back on previous pledges and issue his son a blanket federal pardon for actions over the past 11 years has sparked a political uproar in Washington, drawing criticism from many Democrats as well as Republicans and threatening to cloud Biden's legacy as he prepares to leave office on Jan. 20. Hunter Biden was originally supposed to strike a plea deal with prosecutors last year that would have spared him prison time, but the agreement fell apart after Noreika questioned unusual aspects of it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hunter-biden-gun-case-dismissed-after-president-joe-biden-sweeping-pardon/7885750.html	2024-12-03T09:41:31-08:00	
Vietnam court upholds death sentence for tycoon in $12 billion fraud case	HANOI, Vietnam — A court in Vietnam on Tuesday upheld a death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan after rejecting her appeal against a conviction for embezzlement and bribery in a high-profile $12 billion fraud case, state media reported. Lan, the chairwoman of real estate developer Van Thinh Phat Holdings Group, was sentenced to death in April for her role in what was Vietnam's biggest financial fraud case on record. The High People's Court in southern Ho Chi Minh City determined there was no basis to reduce Lan's death sentence, reported online newspaper VnExpress. If Lan is able to return three-quarters of the money embezzled while on death row, it is possible the sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment, the report said. She is one of the most famous business executives and state officials jailed in the communist country's lengthy anti-graft campaign known as 'Blazing Furnace.' 'The consequences Lan caused are unprecedented in the history of litigation and the amount of money embezzled is unprecedentedly large and unrecoverable,' the prosecution was quoted as saying at the appeal hearing by state-run online newspaper VietnamNet. 'The defendant's actions have affected many aspects of society, the financial market, the economy,' it said. State media cited Lan's lawyer as saying she had many mitigating circumstances, including 'having admitted guilt, showing remorse and paying back part of the amount of money embezzled,' but prosecutors said that was insufficient. Reuters could not immediately reach Lan's lawyers for comment. Lan still has the right to request a review under Vietnam's cassation or retrial procedures. Lan's arrest in 2022 sparked a run on one of the country's largest private banks by deposits, Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank (SCB), which was at the center of the fraud and largely owned by Lan through her proxies. Documents reviewed by Reuters showed Vietnam's central bank had as of April pumped $24 billion in 'special loans' into SCB in an 'unprecedented' rescue. Apart from the death sentence, Lan was handed a life sentence at a separate trial in October after being found guilty of obtaining property by fraud, money laundering and illegal cross-border money transfers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-court-upholds-death-sentence-for-tycoon-in-12-billion-fraud-case/7885548.html	2024-12-03T07:34:31-08:00	
Afghan women banned from pursuing medical education	ISLAMABAD — Taliban authorities in Afghanistan are reported to have banned medical schools from admitting female students, removing the last remaining opportunity for women to pursue higher education. The decree issued by the reclusive Taliban leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, took effect Tuesday, a day after it was communicated at a meeting in Kabul of heads from all medical institutions, officials and participants told VOA. They spoke anonymously because they were told not to discuss the matter publicly. Taliban officials have not yet commented on the alleged ban or the meeting that took place Monday in the Afghan capital. Human rights advocates and foreign diplomats have condemned the directive they say will deprive millions of women of essential health care services, including midwives, female nurses, and health workers, in the male-dominated Afghan society where the Taliban have prohibited male doctors from treating women. 'I am deeply concerned about new reports that the Taliban will deny medical education to women in Afghanistan,' Robert Dickson, the charge d’affaires of Britain’s diplomatic mission to Kabul, wrote on the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter. 'This is another affront to women’s right to education and will further restrict access to health care for Afghan women and children,' said the British diplomat. Since regaining control of Afghanistan in 2021, the radical Taliban have banned female university education, and girls are not allowed to attend schools beyond the sixth grade. Afghan women also are prohibited from working in all sectors except for a few, including health care, immigration, and police. The de facto Afghan government defends its policies, saying they are aligned with the Taliban’s interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia. Social media videos posted Tuesday showed Afghan girls lamenting the ban on their enrollment in health institutes. In one of the videos recorded after being denied entry to their medical school, a group of female students could be heard telling Taliban officials that 'women should be provided with poison to ensure their peaceful demise.' VOA could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video. 'This decision denies countless young women the opportunity to pursue careers in medicine, a field where they have historically played a vital role, particularly in providing healthcare to women and children,' a statement from Afghanistan Women and Children Strengthen Welfare Organization, which advocates human rights, said Tuesday on X. 'The ban further cripples Afghanistan’s already fragile healthcare system, which relies heavily on female medical professionals to address the needs of its population. With maternal mortality rates among the highest in the world, the absence of female healthcare workers will have catastrophic consequences for women’s health,' it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-women-banned-from-pursuing-medical-education/7885522.html	2024-12-03T07:30:41-08:00	
Rare ceremony in Thailand marks king's auspicious 72nd birthday	BANGKOK — Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn on Tuesday presided over a parade that saw the queen lead hundreds of military personnel in honor of his 72nd birthday. It was the first such ceremony in Bangkok's vast Royal Plaza in 16 years. Birthdays celebrated in 12-year cycles are considered especially auspicious in Thai culture, with the sixth cycle — celebrating 72 years — holding special significance. Vajiralongkorn's birthday is July 28, but the previous ceremonies had been held around Dec. 5, which was his father's birthday. Vajiralongkorn's father, Bhumibol, had enjoyed near-universal respect, steering Thailand safely through the challenges of war in neighbors Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, which all saw Communist takeovers in 1975. Vajiralongkorn has faced different challenges, as political polarization has jeopardized the formerly untouchable status of the Thai monarchy. There was no dissent evident as the public gathered to watch military units in the plaza, where the king and family members watched from an ornate pavilion. Queen Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana led the parade in her capacity as Commander of the Combined Guards Unit. Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana, the king's youngest daughter, led the Royal Horse Guards Regiment. As the sun set, commanders of the military services led units in taking an oath of allegiance to the king.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rare-ceremony-in-thailand-marks-king-s-auspicious-72nd-birthday/7885492.html	2024-12-03T07:28:29-08:00	
Biden visits Angola on first trip to Africa as president	LUANDA, ANGOLA — U.S. President Joe Biden received a warm welcome at Angola’s pink-hued Presidential Palace Tuesday as he made his first and almost certainly final visit to the African continent as president. After a red-carpet promenade, renditions of national anthems by a military band, an inspection of troops and a 21-gun salute, he and Angolan President Joao Lourenco, both flanked by diplomats, got down to work. 'I'm very proud to be the first American president to visit Angola, and I'm deeply proud of everything we have done together to transform our partnership thus far,' Biden told Lourenco. 'There is so much ahead of us, so much we can do.' His administration’s top Africa adviser told VOA that Biden sees Angola as 'exhibit A' of a collaborative relationship with Washington. 'We, the United States, are working with Angola on a few really important things,' said Frances Brown, senior director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking exclusively to VOA. 'One is bolstering peace and security in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Another is growing economic opportunities in the region. A third is technological and scientific cooperation.' Unmentioned by Biden — publicly at least — was Angola’s poor human rights record. Rights group Amnesty International attempted to summarize the situation. 'Amnesty has repeatedly documented excessive and lethal force to disrupt peaceful demonstrations,' Kate Hixon, advocacy director for Africa at Amnesty International USA, told VOA via Zoom. 'Not only is lethal force used in these demonstrations, but the victims’ families do not have recourse to access to justice. We've also seen several repressive laws passed since 2020. Since 2020 it's been illegal to criticize the president. More recently, this year, we've seen two laws approved that further threaten the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and the media.' Angolan opposition groups told local media that Biden missed a 'great opportunity' to listen to civil society groups about their concerns. 'The Lobito rail corridor ... is the only concern of Biden’s visit to Angola,' said Ernesto Mulato of the opposition UNITA party. Biden is set Wednesday to visit the port city of Lobito, where a new, U.S.-financed rail line brings raw materials from Africa’s interior to this bustling port. Brown told VOA that the president always raises concerns about human rights, privately. 'He never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts,' she told VOA. 'And I think that's pretty consistent with the way he's been throughout his long, long career in public service.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-visits-angola-on-first-trip-to-africa-as-president/7885486.html	2024-12-03T07:13:40-08:00

South Korean president declares emergency martial law	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared an 'emergency martial law' on Tuesday, accusing the country's opposition of controlling the parliament, sympathizing with North Korea and paralyzing the government with anti-state activities. Yoon made the announcement during a televised briefing, vowing to 'eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.' It wasn't immediately clear how the steps would affect the country's governance and democracy. Yoon — whose approval rating has dipped in recent months — has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022. Yoon's conservative People Power Party had been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition Democratic Party over next year's budget bill. He has also been dismissing calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-president-declares-emergency-martial-law/7885429.html	2024-12-03T06:21:57-08:00	
China bans exports to US of gallium, germanium, antimony in response to chip sanctions	Bangkok — China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports. The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications. The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology. China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof. 'China has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China's technological progress,' Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday. 'I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,' Lin said. Minerals sourced in China used in computer chips, cars China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite. Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report. The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials. China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology. China says it's protecting itself from US trade restrictions After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called 'entity list' subject to strict export controls, China's Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China's 'rights and interests.' Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington's latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security. China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China's fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology. Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, 'abuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.' 'Such behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,' it said in a statement. The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies. 'U.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China's related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,' it said. The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year. The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources. The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite also have mostly risen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-bans-exports-to-us-of-gallium-germanium-antimony-in-response-to-chip-sanctions/7885380.html	2024-12-03T05:52:04-08:00

Trump says will 'block' Nippon Steel from taking over US Steel	Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Monday said he would 'block' a planned takeover of US Steel by Japanese company Nippon Steel, a deal worth $14.9 billion including debts. 'I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'Through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST! As President, I will block this deal from happening.' Embattled US Steel has argued that it needs the Nippon deal to ensure sufficient investment in its Mon Valley plants in Pennsylvania, which it says it may have to shutter if the sale is blocked. Nippon Steel said after Trump's comments that it was 'determined to protect and grow US Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry, domestic supply chain resiliency, and US national security.' 'We will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at US Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,' the Japanese firm said in a statement. Days after the US election last month, Nippon Steel said it expected to close its takeover of the company before the end of the year, while U.S. President Joe Biden was still in office. Biden, too, has opposed the deal, saying it was 'vital' for US Steel 'to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.' The deal is being reviewed by a body helmed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that audits foreign takeovers of US firms, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. In September, Biden's administration extended their review, pushing a conclusion on the politically sensitive deal until after the November 5 presidential election. A Nippon Steel earnings presentation on November 7 maintained that 'the transaction is expected to close in... calendar year 2024' pending a U.S. national security review. 'Unless the situation changes dramatically, I believe the conclusion will come by the end of the year,' during Biden's time in office, vice chairman Takahiro Mori told reporters. Trump will be inaugurated on January 20. Protectionist policies On the campaign trail, he vowed to install protectionist economic policies to help support US businesses, including threats to restart a trade war with the world's second largest economy, China. While running for the White House, he specifically promised to block Nippon's takeover of US Steel, which is based in the key political battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump's vice presidential pick JD Vance also led congressional opposition to the takeover in the U.S. Senate, where the deal has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats. Analysts had suggested Trump's position could soften after the election was over, but Monday's statement indicated that was not the case. Major Japanese and American business groups have urged Yellen not to succumb to political pressure when reviewing the proposed acquisition. The steelworkers union has fought the deal, and criticized a September arbitrators' ruling that Nippon had proven it could assume US Steel's labor contract obligations. In September, however, some US Steel workers rallied in support of the deal, arguing it would help keep plants open.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-will-block-nippon-steel-from-taking-over-us-steel-/7885307.html	2024-12-03T04:49:34-08:00	
Romanian hard-right says it wants to be part of new government	BUCHAREST — Romania's hard-right Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR) party wants to be part of a coalition government, its leader said on Tuesday, as the nation eyes a presidential runoff vote that will decide who appoints the prime minister. Hard-right and ultranationalist parties, including AUR, saw a sharp surge in support in a parliamentary election on Sunday, and while they lack a majority they garnered more than 30% of seats in the legislature. A Constitutional Court ruling on Monday cleared the way for a presidential runoff next Sunday that will pit far-right candidate Calin Georgescu against centrist Elena Lasconi, raising the possibility that the new head of state, who appoints the government, will share AUR's views. A Georgescu win in the presidential runoff would upend Romania's pro-Western orientation and erode its backing for neighboring Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. Romania is a member of NATO and the European Union. The court had ordered a recount of the first round of the election amid concerns over interference in the electoral process, but finally validated the result. 'As Romania's second-largest party we ... have the responsibility to come up with a credible vision,' AUR leader George Simion told foreign press. 'I would like to have a governmental coalition. If the next president of Romania nominates me as prime minister or asks our party to propose a name for prime minister [then we will]. 'We will stay and talk with every political force in the Romanian parliament,' he said, speaking in English. However Simion ruled out cooperating with the leftist Social Democrats (PSD), who came first in Sunday's ballot. Unity The leader of the far-right SOS grouping, Diana Sosoaca, appealed for unity among nationalist parties on Monday, saying they should try to form a government even if it was a minority one. AUR and Sosoaca have previously clashed over policy and the latter's pro-Russian statements. A survey conducted by pollster CURS on Dec. 1 at polling stations showed Georgescu would win 57.8% in a run-off to Lasconi's 42.2% among people who say they will vote. The survey polled 24,629 people after they cast their vote and had a margin of error of plus/minus 0.6%. An admirer of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and a critic of the European Union, Simion has said he would stop military aid to Ukraine. He has opposed Holocaust education and gay marriage, and wants to recover territories that Romania lost during World War Two. AUR has gone from being a fringe anti-vaccination group during the COVID-19 pandemic into Romania's leading opposition force, appealing to the working class diaspora and young voters and building on popular discontent with mainstream politicians. He says he is not pro-Russian, calling President Vladimir Putin a war criminal, and supports Romania's NATO and European Union member status, though he condemns what he calls a 'greedy, corrupt bubble' in Brussels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-hard-right-says-it-wants-to-be-part-of-new-government-/7885270.html	2024-12-03T03:53:23-08:00	
Palestinians say Fatah, Hamas close to post-war Gaza administration plan	Palestinian officials said Tuesday that Fatah and the militant group Hamas were close to an agreement on a plan for administering post-war Gaza. The plan would see Fatah, which governs part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007, jointly appointing a committee of up to 15 politically independent technocrats to administer the Gaza Strip. The officials said the plan would follow a ceasefire agreement with Israel. Months of talks brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza have yet to yield an agreement between Israel and Hamas. U.S. and other officials expressed hope in recent days that a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group could help to push along the Gaza ceasefire efforts. Renewed rocket launches from Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and a wave of retaliatory strikes by Israel are intensifying pressure on the ceasefire agreement. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) late Monday carried out a series of strikes across Lebanon, accusing the Iranian-backed Hezbollah of defying the deal by targeting Israel with rockets. 'Hezbollah’s launches tonight constitute a violation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon,' the IDF said in a statement on its Telegram channel. 'The State of Israel demands that the relevant parties in Lebanon fulfill their responsibilities and prevent Hezbollah's hostile activity from within Lebanese territory.' Israel said its targets included dozens of Hezbollah rocket launchers, terrorist fighters and other Hezbollah infrastructure. Lebanon’s Health Ministry late Monday said Israeli strikes in the towns of Haris and Talousa killed nine people and injured three others. The ministry said earlier that Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon killed two more. The flurry of strikes followed a Hezbollah rocket attack on an Israeli military position in the disputed Shebaa Farms area, which Hezbollah described as a 'defensive warning strike.' But despite the revived hostilities and tough talk from both Israeli and Hezbollah officials, U.S. officials expressed hope Monday that a temporary peace will prevail. 'Broadly speaking, it's our assessment that despite some of these incidents that we're seeing, the ceasefire is holding' Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Monday during a briefing with reporters. 'We will continue to work with partners in the region to ensure that the ceasefire has the best potential for succeeding,' he added. U.S. State Department officials Monday, likewise, said they have not seen indications that the ceasefire is in danger of collapsing, despite accusations by both side of violations. 'This is work that's ongoing,' said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. 'We take all of them very seriously, and we work through the [ceasefire] mechanism that we set up to adjudicate them.' Negotiators from the United States and France have touted the ceasefire deal as a chance to forge a more permanent cessation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon, and end fighting that erupted following the October 7, 2023, attack by Hezbollah ally Hamas on Israel. During its attack, Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. There are still about 100 hostages held in Gaza, with about one-third believed to be dead. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump warned Monday on his social media platform 'there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East' if the hostages are not released by the time he takes office on January 20. 'Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America,' he added. 'RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' In its counteroffensive in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 44,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish in its death toll between civilians and combatants. Israel, without providing evidence, says it has killed more than 17,000 militants. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries.

Turkish court jails protesters over Erdogan speech disruption	A Turkish court has jailed pending trial nine protesters who disrupted President Tayyip Erdogan's speech in Istanbul last week, accusing his government of continuing oil exports to Israel despite a publicized embargo. The incident occurred during Erdogan's televised address at a forum on Friday, where the protesters said the government was failing to uphold its pro-Palestinian rhetoric. They chanted slogans such as 'Ships are carrying bombs to Gaza' and 'Stop fueling genocide.' Erdogan responded sharply. 'My child, don't become the mouthpiece of Zionists here. No matter how much you try to provoke by acting as their voice, mouth, and eyes, you will not succeed,' he said. 'Zionists around the world know very well where Tayyip Erdogan stands. But it seems you still haven't understood.' Police removed the demonstrators from the event, and prosecutors charged them with insulting the president and participating in an illegal demonstration. The Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office said the group had coordinated their actions inside and outside the venue and sought their detention pending trial. The arrests have drawn strong criticism from opposition politicians and rights advocates. Main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Ozgur Ozel denounced the detentions as a blow to democracy. 'The decision to arrest nine young people who protested Tayyip Erdogan proves the grave situation our country's democracy has fallen into,' Ozel said. 'These young people were exercising their right to free expression and should be released immediately.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-court-jails-protesters-over-erdogan-speech-disruption/7885220.html	2024-12-03T02:13:26-08:00	
Airlines not switching quickly enough to green jet fuel, study says	Most of the world's airlines are not doing enough to switch to sustainable jet fuel, according to a study by Brussels-based advocacy group Transport and Environment, which also found too little investment by oil producers in the transition. The airline sector is calling for more production of the fuel, which can be made from materials such as wood chips and used cooking oil. 'Unfortunately, airlines at the moment are not on the trajectory to have meaningful emissions reduction because they're not buying enough sustainable aviation fuel,' Transport and Environment aviation policy manager Francesco Catte said. As it stands, SAF makes up about 1% of aviation fuel use on the global market, which needs to increase for airlines to meet carbon emission reduction targets. The fuel can cost between two to five times more than regular jet fuel. A lack of investment by major oil players, who have the capital to build SAF processing facilities, is hampering the market's growth, the study says. In its ranking, Transport and Environment pointed to Air France-KLM, United Airlines and Norwegian as some of the airlines that have taken tangible steps to buy sustainable jet fuel, particularly its synthetic, cleaner burning version. But 87% are failing to make meaningful efforts, the ranking shows, and even those who are trying could miss their own targets without more investment. Airlines such as Italy's ITA Airways, the successor airline to bankrupt Alitalia, and Portugal's TAP have done very little to secure SAF in the coming years, the ranking shows. A TAP spokesperson said the airline was the first to fly in Portugal with SAF in July 2022, 'and is committed to flying with 10% SAF in 2030.' 'While we would have liked to increase our investment in SAF, the low availability...and high costs...have limited our ability to do so, considering also our start up condition,' an ITA spokesperson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/airlines-not-switching-quickly-enough-to-green-jet-fuel-study-says/7885219.html	2024-12-03T02:07:20-08:00	
Indian police to query Starlink on device used in huge haul of smuggled drugs	BENGALURU, INDIA — Indian police will seek details from Elon Musk's Starlink, they said on Tuesday, in a bid to hunt down drug smugglers who used its satellite internet device to navigate deep seas and bring meth worth $4.25 billion into Indian waters for the first time. In their biggest such seizure, police in the remote outpost of the Andaman and Nicobar islands uncovered more than 6,000 kg of meth last week in a Myanmar boat carrying sacks of suspected contraband, and detained six Myanmar nationals. But the incident has set off alarm bells as it is the first time Starlink's device has been used to navigate and reach Indian waters, Hargobinder S. Dhaliwal, a top police officer in the Andaman islands who is handling the case, told Reuters. Starlink, which says it provides coverage in international waters, has plans to launch in India, but says its coverage in territorial waters is contingent on government approval. 'This (case) is different because it is bypassing all the legal channels,' Dhaliwal added. 'They directly operated (phones) with satellite, creating a Wi-Fi hotspot.' He said he planned to seek from Starlink details such as who bought the device and when, as well as its usage history. 'They (smugglers) were using Starlink since their journey started from Myanmar,' he said. Starlink did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Andaman and Nicobar police estimated the seized meth had a retail market value of 360 billion rupees, or $4.25 billion. Their inquiry comes as Starlink inches closer to a launch in India after lobbying for months to secure satellite spectrum, following a face-off with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani who repeatedly opposed the move and urged spectrum auctions. Dhaliwal said the smugglers used the Starlink Mini device, described on its website as 'a compact, portable kit that can easily fit in a backpack.' Police in the Andaman and Nicobar islands have said they are checking the involvement of any local or foreign syndicates in the whole network as they tackle the latest seizure case from various angles. In 2023, seizures of methamphetamine, or meth, as it is known, reached a record high of 190 tons in east and southeast Asia, as meth trafficking on maritime routes has increased in recent years, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says. India is a growing transit and destination market for methamphetamine from Myanmar, the UNODC said in its report this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-police-to-query-starlink-on-device-used-in-huge-haul-of-smuggled-drugs-/7885214.html	2024-12-03T01:55:25-08:00	
Taiwan launches hotlines for China travel 'safety risks'	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan has launched hotlines for travelers seeking information about their 'safety risks' while in China, which recently published tough criminal sentencing guidelines for supporters of the island's independence. The enhanced 'emergency assistance services' aim to help address 'personal safety risks associated with travelling' to China, Hong Kong and Macau, Taiwan's top China policy body, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), announced on Monday. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control. MAC raised its travel warning for China to the second-highest 'orange' level earlier this year after Beijing published judicial punishments for supporters of Taiwan's independence. The guidelines announced in June include the death penalty for 'particularly serious' cases involving 'diehard' advocates. China has 'continued to enact and amend national security laws, leading to numerous incidents involving the illegal detention, arrest, and interrogation of Taiwanese nationals in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau,' MAC said. While Taiwanese people do not have to register their travel to China, the number who have done so this year has soared, according to figures released by MAC. From January to October, the number of people registering for travel to China's mainland rose 'approximately 14 times' compared to last year, MAC said. Meanwhile, registrations for Hong Kong and Macau 'exceeded five times the total for the same period last year.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-launches-hotlines-for-china-travel-safety-risks-/7885192.html	2024-12-03T00:56:58-08:00	
Trump says will 'block' Nippon Steel from taking over US Steel	WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Monday said he would 'block' a planned takeover of US Steel by Japanese company Nippon Steel, a deal worth $14.9 billion including debts. 'I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'Through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST! As President, I will block this deal from happening.' Embattled US Steel has argued that it needs the Nippon deal to ensure sufficient investment in its Mon Valley plants in Pennsylvania, which it says it may have to shutter if the sale is blocked. Nippon Steel said after Trump's comments that it was 'determined to protect and grow US Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry, domestic supply chain resiliency, and US national security.' 'We will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at US Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,' the Japanese firm said in a statement. Days after the US election last month, Nippon Steel said it expected to close its takeover of the company before the end of the year, while U.S. President Joe Biden was still in office. Biden, too, has opposed the deal, saying it was 'vital' for US Steel 'to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.' The deal is being reviewed by a body helmed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that audits foreign takeovers of US firms, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. In September, Biden's administration extended their review, pushing a conclusion on the politically sensitive deal until after the November 5 presidential election. A Nippon Steel earnings presentation on November 7 maintained that 'the transaction is expected to close in... calendar year 2024' pending a U.S. national security review. 'Unless the situation changes dramatically, I believe the conclusion will come by the end of the year,' during Biden's time in office, vice chairman Takahiro Mori told reporters. Trump will be inaugurated on January 20. Protectionist policies On the campaign trail, he vowed to install protectionist economic policies to help support US businesses, including threats to restart a trade war with the world's second largest economy, China. While running for the White House, he specifically promised to block Nippon's takeover of US Steel, which is based in the key political battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump's vice presidential pick JD Vance also led congressional opposition to the takeover in the U.S. Senate, where the deal has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats. Analysts had suggested Trump's position could soften after the election was over, but Monday's statement indicated that was not the case. Major Japanese and American business groups have urged Yellen not to succumb to political pressure when reviewing the proposed acquisition. The steelworkers union has fought the deal, and criticized a September arbitrators' ruling that Nippon had proven it could assume US Steel's labor contract obligations. In September, however, some US Steel workers rallied in support of the deal, arguing it would help keep plants open.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-will-block-nippon-steel-from-taking-over-us-steel/7885190.html	2024-12-03T00:50:18-08:00	
Indonesia to increase local component requirement for smartphones	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesia plans to increase requirements on local components for smartphones made and sold in the country, its deputy industry minister said on Tuesday, a move aimed at boosting the domestic manufacturing sector. The plan follows Indonesia's banning last month of sales of Apple's iPhone 16 after it failed to meet a requirement that smartphones sold domestically must comprise at least 40% locally made parts. Apple has since made a $100 million investment proposal to build an accessory and component plant to reverse the ban, but the government has rejected that on the grounds it did not meet the principal of fairness. Apple has not responded to Reuters requests for comment on the issue. Deputy Minister Faisol Reza said the government was still discussing the details and gave no timeframe for the introduction of the plan, or by how much the ratio of local components would increase. 'What important is that the goal is to strengthen our domestic industry,' he told reporters. The government was looking at whether investment into research and development was relevant and could be counted as a component in fulfilling the local content rule. Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia but has since 2018 set up application developer academies, which Jakarta considers the company's strategy to meet local content requirement for the sale of older iPhone models. Minister Faisol said Apple's representatives will meet with the government soon to discuss a solution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-to-increase-local-component-requirement-for-smartphones/7885175.html	2024-12-02T23:54:12-08:00	
As sabotage allegations swirl, NATO struggles to secure the Baltic Sea	TURKU, Finland — On Nov. 18, hours after two communication cables were severed in the Baltic Sea, 30 NATO vessels and 4,000 military staff took to the same body of water for one of northern Europe's largest naval exercises. The 12-day 'Freezing Winds' drill was part of a push to step up the transatlantic defense alliance's protection of infrastructure in waters that carry 15% of global shipping traffic and are seen as increasingly vulnerable to attack. The Baltic Sea is bordered by eight NATO countries and Russia. There have been at least three incidents of possible sabotage to the 40-odd telecommunication cables and critical gas pipelines that run along its relatively shallow seabed since 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. 'NATO is stepping up patrols, ... allies are investing in innovative technologies that can help better secure these assets,' said Commander Arlo Abrahamson, a spokesperson for NATO's Allied Maritime Command. Yet the ease with which a ship's anchor can slice through a cable, coupled with the often-treacherous sea conditions, makes actual prevention of such attacks almost impossible. On day three of the exercise, German Navy commander Beata Król tried to launch an underwater drone from her de-mining vessel, the Weilheim, to inspect the seabed as a winter storm raged. After a 30-minute delay in launching it, the drone had frozen and could not operate. 'The batteries got cold,' she said, shrugging, as she waited for the equipment to warm up. Having spent years detonating World War II-era mines on the Baltic seabed, NATO is repurposing its six-vessel mine hunting fleet to also monitor suspicious underwater activity, with its hull-mounted sonar scanning the seabed, drones able to take pictures and video under the water, and specialist divers on hand. But its powers are still limited. 'We are a defensive alliance, so by conducting training and exercising, also in areas which are crucial with underwater infrastructure, we show presence and prevent rather than actively engage,' Król said. Security sources say the Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3, which left the Russian port of Ust-Luga on Nov. 15, was responsible for severing the two undersea cables in Swedish economic waters between Nov. 17 and 18 by dragging its anchor on the seabed. As of Monday, it was stationary in Danish economic waters, being watched by NATO members' naval ships, having been urged by Sweden to return to be investigated. Some politicians had accused it of sabotage, but no authority had shown evidence that its actions were deliberate. China has said it is ready to assist in the investigation, while its ally Russia has denied involvement in any of the Baltic infrastructure incidents. The case is similar to an incident last year when the Chinese ship NewNew Polar Bear damaged two cables linking Estonia to Finland and Sweden as well as an Estonia-Finland gas pipeline. China made similar promises to assist, but the ship was not stopped and, a year on, Finnish and Estonian investigators have yet to present conclusions. Damage to cables is not new. Globally, around 150 are damaged each year, according to the UK-based International Cable Protection Committee. The telecoms cables, power lines and gas pipes in the shallow Baltic are particularly vulnerable due to its very intense ship traffic, the U.S.-based telecom research firm TeleGeography said. If any of the recent incidents are proven to be sabotage by another country, it would mark a return of a type of warfare not seen for decades. 'You should go back to World War One or the American-Spanish war to find a state-sponsored sabotage of a submarine cable,' said Paul Brodsky, a senior researcher at TeleGeography. To counter this potential threat, NATO in May opened its Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure (CUI) in London, which wants to map all critical infrastructure in NATO-controlled waters and identify weak spots. In Rostock, on Germany's Baltic coast, a multinational naval headquarters opened in October to protect NATO members' interests in the sea. 'What I think we can achieve is to place the responsibility after an incident,' CUI's Branch Head, Commander Pal Bratbak, said onboard the Weilheim, stressing the growing power of technology. NATO's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation in Italy is launching software that will combine private and military data and imagery from hydrophones, radars, satellites, vessels' Automatic Identification System (AIS) and fibers with Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), which private telecom companies use to localize cuts in their cables. 'If we have a good picture of what's going on, then we can deploy units to verify what the system tells us,' Bratbak said. German Lieutenant-General Hans-Werner Wiermann, who led an undersea infrastructure coordination cell at NATO Headquarters until March, said no pipeline or cable can be guarded all the time. 'The right response to such hybrid attacks is resilience,' he said, adding that companies were already laying cables to add 'redundancies' - spare routings that will allow critical pieces of infrastructure to keep working if one cable is cut. On board the Weilheim, Król's second drone is finally able to brave the storm to continue the inspection drill underwater.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-sabotage-allegations-swirl-nato-struggles-to-secure-the-baltic-sea/7885171.html	2024-12-02T23:40:54-08:00	
Ukraine support in focus as NATO foreign ministers meet	NATO foreign ministers open two days of talks Tuesday in Brussels with support for Ukraine high on the agenda as the country fights to defend itself from a Russian invasion that began nearly three years ago. Allies have already pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in new military aid ahead of the meetings, including new rounds of assistance from the United States and Germany. In addition to the NATO ministerial talks, the agenda also includes the latest round of meetings for the NATO-Ukraine council as Ukrainian officials push for membership in the alliance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that an invitation to join NATO 'would fundamentally strengthen Ukraine before any negotiations to end the war.' NATO leaders have repeatedly said Ukraine’s future is in NATO, but that the country would not be able to join while the Russian war is ongoing. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Monday that the United States is focused on 'helping Ukraine to be in the strongest position possible on the battlefield and to ensure they are able to defend itself now and over the long term.' On the battlefront, Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russian aerial attacks overnight damaged energy infrastructure in the western regions of Rivne and Ternopil. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that Russian shelling and a drone hit the city of Nikopol, damaging multiple homes, a gym, and gas and power lines. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down a Ukrainian drone over the Belgorod region and another drone over Bryansk.

White House: Biden expected to issue more pardons before end of term	A day after U.S. President Joe Biden announced the pardon of his son Hunter, the White House said the president is expected to issue more pardons and clemencies before he leaves office next month. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday that Biden is 'thinking through that process very thoroughly.' 'I don't have a timeline for you,' Jean-Pierre said. 'As you know, this usually happens towards the end. And so, the president is going through that process, thinking through that process. I'm not going to get ahead of him. But you can expect more announcements to come.' Hunter Biden was facing sentencing this month for gun and tax offenses and could have been imprisoned for years. Biden had for months pledged not to pardon his 54-year-old son, a lawyer who for years was caught up in cocaine addiction as his life spiraled out of control. But the president said in a statement late Sunday that Hunter Biden’s prosecution was selective and politically motivated, aimed at undercutting his reelection campaign before he dropped out of the race in July for another four-year term. 'The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,' Biden said. Hunter Biden was convicted of three felonies in June for a 2018 gun purchase. Prosecutors said he falsely claimed on a federal form to not be illegally using or addicted to drugs. He also pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in a case where he was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. He faced up to 17 years in federal prison in the tax case during a scheduled sentencing hearing in Los Angeles on December 16, although sentencing experts said that most likely as a first-time offender, he would have served no more than 36 months behind bars. Hunter Biden was facing a stiffer maximum sentence, 25 years, in the gun case but was more likely, based on precedent in similar cases, to be handed a much shorter sentence, perhaps up to 16 months during a hearing scheduled in Delaware for December 13. The president’s action Sunday pardoned Hunter Biden in both cases, as well as any offense he 'has committed or may have committed or taken part' from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2024. Hunter Biden said in a statement, 'I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport.' The president said in his statement that he hopes 'Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.' 'For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,' Biden said. President-elect Donald Trump criticized the move, calling it 'such an abuse and miscarriage of justice' compared to hundreds of Trump supporters who have been imprisoned after being convicted for an array of offenses stemming from the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, while they tried to block Congress from certifying that Biden had defeated Trump’s reelection bid in the 2020 campaign. Trump has said he will consider pardoning many of the rioters when he takes power again on January 20 after winning the November presidential election. Some of the rioters have already served their sentences, but many are still in prison for years to come, while other trials have yet to occur. Trump, in the late stages of his first term in office, pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was convicted on tax offenses and other charges. On Saturday, Trump said he intends to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. ambassador to France. Trump also pardoned one of his former national security advisers, Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former chief strategist Steve Bannon and campaign aide George Papadopoulos, among others. Reactions to President Biden pardoning his son varied across the U.S. political landscape and not always predictably along political party lines as is usually the case when contentious decisions are announced. Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said that while he understood the 'natural desire' of Biden wanting to help his son, he said, 'I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.' Greg Stanton, a Democratic congressman from Arizona, said, 'I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a politically motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies and was convicted by a jury of his peers.' Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, posted on X that he was 'shocked' by the pardon because the elder Biden 'said many, many times he wouldn’t & I believed him. Shame on me.' But Eric Holder, a Democrat who was the U.S. attorney general under former President Barack Obama, said the president’s son was only prosecuted because his last name was Biden. He said no U.S. attorney 'would have charged this case given the underlying facts.'

Trump names billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens as his envoy to Britain	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has named billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens as his envoy to Britain, a prestigious posting for the Republican donor whose contributions this year included $2 million to a Trump-backing super PAC. Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site Monday evening, announced he was selecting Stephens to be the U.S. ambassador to the Court of Saint James. The Senate is required to confirm the choice. 'Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time. I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top Diplomat, representing the U.S.A. to one of America's most cherished and beloved Allies,' Trump said in in his post. Stephens is the chairman, president and CEO of Little Rock, Arkansas-based financial services firm Stephens Inc., having taken over the firm from his father. Trump has already named many of his nominees for his Cabinet and high-profile diplomatic posts, assembling a roster of staunch loyalists. Over the weekend, Trump announced he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France. During his first term, Trump selected Robert 'Woody' Johnson, a contributor to his campaign and the owner of the New York Jets football team, as his representative to the United Kingdom.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-names-billionaire-investment-banker-warren-stephens-as-his-envoy-to-britain/7885131.html	2024-12-02T20:34:15-08:00	
Police in Georgia move again to disperse protests over the suspension of EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia — Police in Georgia's capital again moved to disperse thousands of demonstrators on Monday after over 200 people were detained during four previous nights of protests against the government's decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union. Police used water cannons and tear gas to drive protesters away from the parliament building where they have gathered each night since Thursday when the ruling Georgian Dream party declared its decision to put EU accession talks on hold. Georgian Dream's disputed victory in the country's Oct. 26 parliamentary election, widely seen as a referendum on Georgia's aspirations to join the EU, has sparked mass demonstrations and the opposition boycott of the parliament. The opposition and the country's pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with Moscow's help. Georgia's Interior Ministry said Monday that 224 protesters were detained on administrative charges and three arrested on criminal charges. So far, 113 police officers needed medical treatment while three others were hospitalized after clashes with protesters, who hurled fireworks at police. Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili said many of the arrested protesters had injuries to their heads and faces, including broken bones and eye sockets. Writing on X and citing lawyers who represent the detained, she said some people were subject to systematic beatings between arrest and transportation to detention facilities. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has rejected official election results and refused to recognize the parliament's legitimacy. She has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to spearhead the demands for a new parliamentary election. The president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, and foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas spoke to Zourabichvili on Sunday to condemn the violence against protesters and to note that 'the actions of the government run counter to the will of the people,' Costa wrote on X. Kallas and EU enlargement commissioner Marta Kos also released a joint statement that reiterated the EU's 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country' and urged Georgian authorities to 'respect the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, and refrain from using force against peaceful protesters, politicians and media representatives.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of Georgian Dream has warned the opposition that 'any violation of the law will be met with the full rigor of the law.' 'Neither will those politicians who hide in their offices and sacrifice members of their violent groups to severe punishment escape responsibility,' he said. Kobakhidze argued that the government remains committed to the goal of European integration, claiming that 'the only thing we have rejected is the shameful and offensive blackmail.' The government's announcement of the EU accession talks' suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October's election in Georgia as neither free nor fair. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc's recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. Georgian Dream has increasingly adopted repressive laws mirroring those in Russia which crack down on freedom of speech and curtail LGBTQ+ rights. A law banning same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media came into force Monday. Speaking to The Associated Press on Saturday, Zourabichvili said that her country was becoming a 'quasi-Russian' state and that Georgian Dream controlled the major institutions. 'We are not demanding a revolution. We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again,' Zourabichvili said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov alleged parallels between protests in Georgia and massive demonstrations in Ukraine that led to the ouster of a Moscow friendly leader in 2014. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he accused outside forces of trying to 'destabilize the situation' and insisted that Russia is not interfering in Georgia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-in-georgia-move-again-to-disperse-protests-over-the-suspension-of-eu-talks/7885129.html	2024-12-02T20:22:57-08:00	
Trump to attend Notre Dame Cathedral reopening in Paris	NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump will attend the reopening celebration for Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris this weekend, his first foreign trip since the election. The cathedral is set to reopen Saturday after more than five years of reconstruction following a devastating fire in 2019. The invite-only ceremonies Saturday and Sunday will be high-security affairs, with about 50 heads of state and government expected to attend. Trump announced his trip in a post on his Truth Social site Monday evening. 'It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris, France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a devastating fire five years ago,' he wrote. 'President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!' Trump and Macron have had a complicated relationship. Macron was the guest of honor at Trump's first state dinner and Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship soured as Trump's term progressed and Macron criticized him for questioning the need for NATO and raising doubts about America's commitment to the mutual-defense pact. As he ran for a second term this year, Trump often mocked Macron on the campaign trail, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American companies. After Trump won another term last month, Macron rushed to win favor with the president-elect. He was among the first global leaders to congratulate Trump — even before The Associated Press called the race in his favor — and beat UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the punch in delivering a congratulatory phone call. 'Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump,' Macron posted on X early on Nov 6. 'Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.' The reopening of Notre Dame will be an elaborate, multiday celebration, beginning Saturday. Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will preside at a reopening service that afternoon, banging on Notre Dame's shuttered doors with his staff to reopen them, according to the cathedral's website. The archbishop will also symbolically reawaken Notre Dame's thunderous grand organ. The fire that melted the cathedral's lead roofing coated the huge instrument in toxic dust. Its 8,000 pipes have been painstakingly disassembled, cleaned and returned. Macron will attend and address the VIP guests. After the service, opera singers Pretty Yende, from South Africa, and Julie Fuchs, from France; Chinese pianist Lang Lang; Paris-born cellist Yo-Yo Ma; Benin-born singer Angelique Kidjo; Lebanese singer Hiba Tawaji and others will perform at a concert Saturday evening, according to the show's broadcaster, France Télévisions. On Sunday morning, the Paris archbishop will lead an inaugural Mass and consecration of the new altar. Nearly 170 bishops from France and other countries will join the celebration, along with priests from all 106 parishes in the Paris diocese. The Mass will be followed by a 'fraternal buffet' for the needy. Ile de la Cité, where the cathedral sits in the middle of the River Seine, will be blocked off to tourists for the events. A public viewing area with room for 40,000 spectators will be set up along the Seine's southern bank.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-attend-notre-dame-cathedral-reopening-in-paris/7885127.html	2024-12-02T20:16:01-08:00	
Congress returns, facing spending, disaster relief issues ahead of change in administrations	WASHINGTON — The Democratic-led U.S. Senate returned on Monday for a showdown with the Republican-controlled House of Representatives over government spending, disaster relief and defense policy before President-elect Donald Trump ushers in a new era of single-party rule next month. The main challenge for lawmakers over the next three weeks is to avert a pre-Christmas partial government shutdown by striking a bipartisan deal to fund federal agencies beyond Dec. 20, when a current stopgap spending measure is due to expire. The debate will include a nearly $100 billion emergency disaster relief request from President Joe Biden for areas of the U.S. Southeast hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other communities struck by natural disasters. Congress also faces a Jan. 1 deadline for raising the federal government's debt ceiling, though lawmakers and aides say that extraordinary measures employed by the Treasury Department are likely to postpone the expected 'X' date for default well into 2025. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated on Monday that lawmakers are negotiating a short-term stopgap funding bill known as a continuing resolution, or CR, rather than a package of annual spending bills that would fund the government through fiscal year 2025, which ends on Sept. 30. Schumer did not disclose details about a potential CR, which House Speaker Mike Johnson has said would run into early next year. Trump's allies are pushing for a three-month stopgap that supporters say would allow their party's incoming political trifecta to dismantle current Democratic spending initiatives and policy priorities early in the new administration. Legislative action on government funding is not expected to begin in the House until the last of the session's three weeks, timing that could raise risks for Johnson's slim 220-213 Republican majority if they opt for a partisan measure first. House Republicans failed to pass their own partisan stop-gap measure in September and had to rely on mainly Democratic votes to narrowly avert a shutdown weeks before the Nov. 5 election. Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Top lawmakers have yet to say how they intend to handle a Biden request for emergency disaster relief. The head of the Small Business Administration recently testified to Congress that the agency's disaster loan program for homeowners, renters, and businesses ran out of money in October, leaving more than 60,000 loan applicants waiting for assistance. Congressional aides said a disaster relief package would likely be attached to a CR. But the first objective for Congress this month is likely to be passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, annual legislation that sets policy for the Defense Department, according to congressional aides. Floor votes could come as early as next week, according to aides.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-returns-facing-spending-disaster-relief-issues-ahead-of-change-in-administrations/7885122.html	2024-12-02T20:00:26-08:00	
Analysts skeptical about potential of ‘Asian NATO’	Taipei, Taiwan — Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru has been actively advocating for the establishment of a collective security alliance in Asia similar to that of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe and North America. Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party set up a new committee in November specifically to discuss this 'Asian NATO' concept. However, such an ambitious plan is unlikely to take place under the second term of U.S.-elect President Donald Trump, according to experts. Ishiba has reportedly advocated for bolstering regional deterrence by integrating existing security frameworks such as the ANZUS Security Treaty between the United States, Australia and New Zealand; the U.S.-Japan Alliance; and the U.S.-South Korea Alliance. He outlined his vision in a paper to the Washington-based Hudson Institute in September, arguing that such an alliance would deter China from using military force in Asia. 'The absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense,' he wrote. However, the proposal has encountered significant resistance, including opposition from China, concerns from ASEAN nations and even U.S. skepticism. Feasibility doubtful Koichi Nakano, a visiting scholar on U.S.-Japan relations at Harvard University’s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, was skeptical that the U.S. would support an 'Asian NATO' proposal. 'Ishiba’s personal advocacy is based on his view that [a] U.S.-Japan alliance should be placed on a more equal footing. And it is also connected to his parallel argument that there should be nuclear sharing with Japan. In other words, it is with an aim at constraining U.S. unilateralism,' Nakano said. 'All of this is exactly what President-elect [Donald] Trump does not want. He doesn't even like NATO in the first place, and there is zero reason to think that he would want to have an Asian version of it,' he said. Trump has pledged that 'NATO’s purpose and NATO’s mission' will be fundamentally changed in his new administration. During his first term as president, he reduced defense spending to the alliance, saying America spent more than other countries in the organization. Officials in the Biden administration have also been skeptical of the Asian NATO proposal. Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo’s International Christian University, also said a 'Asian NATO' is neither realistic nor achievable. 'An Asian NATO may not necessarily be a negative initiative,' Nagy said. 'On the contrary, it may help stakeholders align their strategic thinking on security concerns on the region and find ways to cooperate with each other to deal with traditional and non-traditional security challenges.' However, Nagy said that minilateral cooperation, which involves a small group of countries working together on specific issues, is more feasible than the 'Asian NATO' concept. 'Establishing and maintaining various forms of minilateral cooperation such as the Quad [Australia, India, Japan and the United States]; the Squad [United States, Japan, Australia and the Philippines]; the Manila-Tokyo-Washington minilateral; the Camp David-based cooperation between Seoul, Tokyo and Washington, will be more realistic and accrue security and diplomatic results compared to an Asian NATO multilateral project,' he said. John Chuan Tiong Lim, a research fellow on East Asian and international relations at the University of Tokyo, said that the idea of an 'Asian NATO' faces significant obstacles, including Japan's constitutional restrictions under Article 9, which prohibits the country from engaging in collective warfare. This would make it impossible for Japan to replicate NATO's European model directly, he said. Voter support? In addition to major powers in the Indo-Pacific, Ishiba needs public support. 'There is little interest in foreign and security policy among the Japanese voters, and if anything, the increasing cost attached to the recent drive for remilitarization is likely to lead to a loss of votes for the ruling party,' Harvard’s Nakano said. Lim also noted that Ishiba did not bring up such a concept during his meeting in Peru with U.S. President Joe Biden in November. Still, Lim emphasized that the proposal remains alive within the LDP. The fact that it continues to be discussed within the party indicates that Ishiba has not abandoned his push for the idea. Nagy observed that Japan's growing security concerns, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's actions in Hong Kong, have intensified the public’s focus on national security. 'If Ishiba survives in office after the Upper House election in the summer of 2025, I don't see the LDP or the public fundamentally shifting their position on an Asian NATO,' Nagy said. Future security cooperation In addition to the U.S., Ishiba is trying to establish closer cooperation with other regional powers in the Indo-Pacific such as South Korea. He once served as Japan's defense minister and is very familiar with defense affairs. He also met with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in October and plans to visit South Korea in January, which will be his first visit since he became prime minister. 'South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol might share Ishiba’s interest in trying to anchor the U.S. under Trump to a trilateral framework, but he is also deeply unpopular among the voters,' Nakano said. 'They share the common fear that Trump would bypass them and directly get into a negotiation and even a ‘deal’ of some sort with China or North Korea,' he added. Nakano believes the best option for Japan now is to seek closer relations with Beijing. 'If Japan wants to secure and defend its national interest, the only logical thing to do now is to increase dialogue and cooperation with China and hedge against the risks that the U.S. has now turned into,' he said. Lim said that all parties are currently waiting to see the U.S. foreign policy direction after Trump's inauguration. In the meantime, existing mechanisms are being institutionalized. 'What can be done now is being done first, with the hope of aligning with the new era under Trump’s leadership,' he said. Some information for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-skeptical-about-potential-of-asian-nato-/7885116.html	2024-12-02T19:23:39-08:00	
Namibia's female VP leads in presidential election marred by problems	WINDHOEK, Namibia — The candidate for Namibia's ruling party led Monday in early results of a presidential election characterized by technical problems which caused voting to be extended for three days. The opposition has rejected the results and claimed the extension was illegal, undermining the vote in a southern African country that has a largely smooth history of elections and is praised as one of the region's more stable democracies. Final results are expected this week, with opposition parties saying they will challenge the validity of the election in court. The problems in last Wednesday's election, which included a shortage of ballot papers and other issues, led election authorities to allow some polling stations to stay open until Saturday. The issues threaten to overshadow any result, with Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah of the ruling SWAPO party a strong contender to become Namibia's first female leader. The 72-year-old Nandi-Ndaitwah, a former member of Namibia's underground independence movement, had around 56% of the vote in the partial results published Monday. Only 220,000 of the approximately 1.4 million votes cast have been counted. Panduleni Itula of the Independent Patriots for Change opposition party is second with 27% of the vote. Namibians voted for president and for the makeup of Parliament in a large but sparsely populated country on the southwest coast of Africa that has swathes of desert running through it. Namibia has been governed by SWAPO since independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990. While Nandi-Ndaitwah offers a chance at history, SWAPO has faced frustration from Namibians struggling with a high unemployment rate and other economic hardships, especially among young people. Government corruption scandals have tarnished its reputation as the country's liberator. The Independent Patriots for Change said it expected to file a legal challenge against the election this week. Other opposition parties said they will join the case. 'It is about our country, it’s about our democratic credentials, it’s about the country that must work for everybody, the poor and the rich. It cannot only work for those who want to remain in power by hook or (by) crook,' said McHenry Venaani, the leader of the opposition Popular Democratic Movement and a candidate in the presidential election. The Electoral Commission of Namibia which organized the election said there will not be a rerun despite opposition demands. Other ruling parties in southern Africa have faced a mood of discontent this year. In neighboring South Africa, the African National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela, lost its 30-year majority and had to form a coalition to stay in government and keep hold of the presidency. The Botswana Democratic Party was stunningly swept from power in that country after governing for 58 years since independence from Britain. In Mauritius, the incumbent party also lost in a landslide, while Mozambique's Frelimo party was accused of rigging an October election, sparking large and ongoing protests of its long rule.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-s-female-vp-leads-in-presidential-election-marred-by-problems/7885079.html	2024-12-02T17:50:07-08:00	
Biden seeking additional $24B to support Ukraine, replenish US weapons stockpiles	PENTAGON — President Joe Biden has asked Congress for an additional $24 billion to support Ukraine and replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles, two U.S. officials tell VOA, as the administration continued Monday to push out new aid packages from the last congressionally approved funds for Kyiv before Biden leaves office on January 20. Officials who have seen the administration’s request, on condition of anonymity to discuss its details, told VOA, that the new support would include $16 billion to restock U.S. weapons under the Pentagon’s presidential drawdown authority (PDA), along with $8 billion to manufacture weapons under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which focuses on supplying Kyiv’s long-term defense needs. 'This funding not only supports Ukraine’s fight for its sovereignty and degrades Russian military capabilities but also strengthens U.S. military readiness by modernizing our weapons systems and making direct investments in our defense industrial base,' a U.S. defense official told VOA on Monday. The Biden administration submitted aid for Ukraine in an anomaly funding bill that also includes spending on other matters rather than in a separate supplemental funding request. 'We defer to Congress to determine the most appropriate vehicle for addressing this urgent need,' one official said. News of the latest request was first reported by Politico. Some Republicans are already opposing the request. 'Any Biden funding demands should be DOA (dead on arrival),' Senator Mike Lee posted on X. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who will determine whether the bill is brought to a vote in the form proposed by the White House, wrote on X that funding decisions 'are for the incoming administration, not the outgoing lame duck President.' 'The American people resoundingly elected President [Donald] Trump because he promised to bring an end to wars, not prolong them indefinitely,' Johnson added. The aid request follows vows from Biden administration officials to seek additional aid approval from Congress for 2025. Last week, the Biden administration also informed Congress of its intention to forgive $4.65 billion worth of Ukrainian debt. The U.S. announced Monday it was sending another military aid package to Ukraine valued at up to $725 million, its 71st tranche of equipment from Department of Defense inventories for Kyiv since August 2021. Monday’s PDA included air defense capabilities, munitions for rocket systems and artillery, and anti-tank weapons. The package is the latest round of aid stemming from a $61 billion assistance bill for Kyiv that was approved by Congress in April after several months of delays. The Biden administration still has more than $8 billion in funding from previous aid packages to give to Ukraine. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Ukrainian Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov on Monday to discuss battlefield dynamics and U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, according to the Pentagon. During his call with Umerov, Austin condemned Russia’s recent barrage of missiles and drones targeting Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, along with its use of an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile in Ukraine, which the Pentagon called 'another escalation in Russia’s war against Ukraine.' Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-seeking-additional-24b-to-support-ukraine-replenish-us-weapons-stockpiles/7885060.html	2024-12-02T17:23:33-08:00	
Transgender attorney to argue before Supreme Court, challenging health care ban for minors	WASHINGTON — When the Supreme Court this week wades into the contentious issue of transgender rights, the justices will hear from an attorney with knowledge that runs deep. Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation's highest court, representing families who say Tennessee’s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future. Arguments in the case come amid heightened pushback to transgender rights, including a presidential campaign where Republican Donald Trumpput his fierce opposition front and center. Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience. 'I am able to do my job because I have had this health care that transformed and, frankly, saved my life,' he said. 'I am a testament to the fact that we live among everyone.' Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was in law school. Now 42, he's an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at the Supreme Court. He's also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his Army-veteran brother. He's also an advocate, speaking out as a series of U.S. states banned gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The laws are part of a wave of restrictions on school sports participation and bathroom usage around the country. After the first openly transgender person was elected to Congress, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson declared support for restricting bathroom use to sex assigned at birth. Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and that its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely. 'Tennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,' state attorneys wrote in court filings. Arguing for Tennessee is state Solicitor General Matt Rice. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the transgender worker-discrimination case Strangio worked on that term. The state attorney general's office did not make Rice available for an interview ahead of arguments, but his background also includes a couple of years as a minor league baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays before he earned his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley. The Biden administration is supporting the challenge to Tennessee's law, but the federal government’s position is expected to change after Trump takes office in January. Strangio said he'll nevertheless keep advocating for transgender youth to access health care that wasn't available when he was young. 'Many of us think about our childhood and young adulthood as lost years, when we were just simply disembodied from our core,' he said. Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans and have endorsed such care, saying it’s safe when administered properly. Strangio also pointed out that many medical interventions for young people, like gastric bypass surgeries for weight loss, carry some risk and it makes sense to inform families and let them decide. 'There is harm that is compounded when we are forcing young people to be denied care that their doctors and their parents and they themselves all agree they need,' he said. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the case by the summer.	https://www.voanews.com/a/transgender-attorney-to-argue-before-supreme-court-challenging-health-care-ban-for-minors-/7885052.html	2024-12-02T17:10:55-08:00	
Trump's tariff threats create division between Canada and Mexico over security at borders	Mexico City — Threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to impose tariffs have created a split between Canada and Mexico, after Canadian officials said problems with the two countries’ borders shouldn’t be compared. On Monday, Mexico’s president rejected those comments, which were made following a meeting between Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 'Mexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners,' President Claudia Sheinbaum said, after Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told The Associated Press on Sunday that 'the message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood.' Sheinbaum said Canada had its own problems with fentanyl consumption and 'could only wish they had the cultural riches Mexico has.' Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries' border are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Mexico's efforts to seize fentanyl before it reaches the U.S. have been lackluster. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone, while there were only 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024. During the same period, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico. Mexico feels especially hurt by the Canadian comments, because Mexican officials claim their government went to bat for Canada in the past. They claim that Trump, during his first term, initially wanted to leave Canada out of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement in 2018, and Mexico demanded it be included. It is unclear if that was actually the case. Trudeau also got ahead of Sheinbaum by meeting with the U.S. president-elect first. Both leaders are scrambling to get some assurances before Trump takes office. Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers. She also noted an agreement between Canada and the U.S. that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally to be sent back to Canada. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar agreement. On Monday, Sheinbaum revealed more about her own conversation last week with Trump, saying he 'had agreed' that Mexico wanted to focus on intelligence sharing in anti-drug efforts, noting 'he said that in his opinion that was good.' But she said Mexico would reject any direct U.S. intervention in Mexico and continue to enforce the tight restrictions on U.S. law enforcement agencies in Mexico imposed by her predecessor. 'That is going to maintained,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-tariff-threats-create-division-between-canada-and-mexico-over-security-at-borders-/7885051.html	2024-12-02T17:06:43-08:00	
Delaware judge rejects request to restore Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay	Wilmington, Delaware — A Delaware judge ruled Monday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it. The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk's future at the world's most valuable carmaker. Musk did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances — and reinstate his compensation. McCormick said Tesla’s board was not entitled to hit 'reset' to restore Musk’s pay package. 'Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable,' she said in her 101-page opinion. She also said Tesla made multiple material misstatements in its proxy statement regarding the vote and could not claim the vote was a 'cure-all' to justify restoring Musk’s pay. 'Taken together,' the problems with Tesla’s arguments 'pack a powerful punch,' she wrote. Tesla shares fell 1.4% in afterhours trade, following the ruling. McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the $6 billion they initially requested. She said the fee could be paid in cash or Tesla stock. 'We are pleased with Chancellor McCormick’s ruling, which declined Tesla’s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings,' said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff. The law firm also said it looked forward to defending the court's opinion if Musk and Tesla appealed. Musk and Tesla can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court as soon as McCormick enters a final order, which could come as soon as this week. The appeal could take a year to play out. After the January ruling, Tesla shareholders flooded the court with thousands of letters arguing that rescinding Musk's pay increased the possibility he would leave Tesla or develop some products like artificial intelligence at ventures other than Tesla. Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to challenge Musk's compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn the ruling from a trial. McCormick in January found that Musk improperly controlled the 2018 board process to negotiate the pay package. The board had said that Musk deserved the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market value, revenue and profitability. But the judge criticized Tesla's board as 'beholden' to Musk, saying the compensation plan was proposed by a board whose members had conflicts of interest due to close personal and financial ties to him. After the January ruling, Musk criticized the judge on his social media platform X and encouraged other companies to follow the lead of Tesla and reincorporate in Texas from Delaware, although it is unclear if any companies did so. The judge in her January ruling called the pay package the 'biggest compensation plan ever — an unfathomable sum.' It was 33 times larger than the next biggest executive compensation package, which was Musk's 2012 pay plan. As of Monday, the pay package was worth $101.4 billion, according to Equilar, a compensation consulting firm. Musk's 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1% of Tesla's equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals. Musk did not receive any guaranteed salary. Tornetta argued that shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when they voted on the package.	https://www.voanews.com/a/delaware-judge-rejects-request-to-restore-musk-s-56-billion-tesla-pay/7885050.html	2024-12-02T17:02:43-08:00	
US to block sale of cutting-edge, chip-making equipment to China	The Biden administration announced Monday that it has imposed a new set of export controls on China, restricting the sale of cutting-edge, semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and high-bandwidth computer memory to the communist nation. The new rules ban the sale of 24 different kinds of equipment and three different software tools, all of which are used to produce what are known as 'advanced node' semiconductors, the fastest and most efficient chips on the market. The export controls, announced by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, also restrict the transfer of high-bandwidth memory products, which advanced node semiconductors need to maximize their performance in high-intensity applications, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. At the same time, the government added 140 companies, mostly in China’s domestic semiconductor manufacturing industry, to a list of entities that U.S. firms and individuals are restricted from doing business with. In general, exporting certain technologies to companies on the list requires a license from the federal government. Blocking military development The latest round of sanctions is specifically aimed at preventing China from fabricating advanced semiconductors on its own, out of concern that it would then incorporate AI into new military hardware and advanced tools of social control. 'Advanced AI models could be used for rapid response scenarios on the battlefield; lowering the barrier to develop cyberweapons or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons; and utilizing facial and voice recognition to repress and surveil minorities and political dissidents,' the department said in a release announcing the sanctions. 'This action is the culmination of the Biden-Harris Administration’s targeted approach, in concert with our allies and partners, to impair [China’s] ability to indigenize the production of advanced technologies that pose a risk to our national security,' U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement. 'The United States has taken significant steps to protect our technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our national security,' national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in the same statement. 'As technology evolves, and our adversaries seek new ways to evade restrictions, we will continue to work with our allies and partners to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading technologies and know-how so they aren’t used to undermine our national security.' China responds In a statement sent to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington condemned the sanctions. 'China strongly opposes the U.S.' latest control measures on semiconductor export. The move is a typical economic coercion and non-market practice,' the embassy said. The embassy accused the United States of 'overstretching' the idea of national security, abusing export control rules and 'bullying.' 'The semiconductor industry is highly globalized,' the statement said. 'The US' abuse of regulatory measures severely hinders normal economic and trade exchanges among countries, undermines market rules and the international economic and trade order, and poses a serious threat to the stability of the global industrial and supply chains. The global semiconductor industry, including US companies, has been severely affected.' The statement concluded with the promise that, 'China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.' Significant impact Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told VOA that the new sanctions are likely to do real damage to China’s effort to create a world-class domestic chip manufacturing industry. In an email exchange with VOA, Ezell said that manufacturing semiconductors is 'perhaps the most complex engineering task humanity undertakes,' and that simply building the machinery to manufacture them requires a vast array of inputs, access to many of which the U.S. can meaningfully restrict. 'Those tools … depend on literally dozens of thousands of inputs and components, many provided by specialized suppliers from across the world,' Ezell wrote. 'If Chinese toolmakers don’t have ready access to these, it makes their task of recreating a wholly indigenous supply chain that much more difficult and expensive.' Ezell said the loss of market share in China will hurt U.S. manufacturers unable to sell into the country, but he pointed out that China’s goal has been to eliminate its dependence on foreign chips anyway, which would produce the same result. 'The way to deal with the challenge is for the United States (and like-minded allies) to stimulate the growth of semiconductor industries in places like India or Malaysia, so sales that are lost in China can be recaptured elsewhere, because we’re expanding semiconductor production in like-minded nations,' Ezell said. He added that it is important that the U.S. team up with other major semiconductor manufacturing and equipment-making nations to institute similar policies toward China. Advanced chips The primary target of the new U.S. export controls are so-called 'advanced node' chips and the equipment used to manufacture them. Advanced node chips’ distinguishing factor is the size of the transistors used in their manufacture. Some transistors can be as small as three nanometers — three one-billionths of a meter — in length. The smaller the individual transistors are, means more of them can be placed on a single chip, making them better at processing information, and more energy efficient. For advanced node chips to operate at their full potential, they need to be paired with high-bandwidth computer memory, which can provide high-speed access to vast amounts of data.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-block-sale-of-cutting-edge-chip-making-equipment-to-china/7884774.html	2024-12-02T16:15:07-08:00	
UN: Haitian children account for about half of country's armed gang members	United Nations — The head of the United Nations children's agency said Monday that children make up about half of all armed gang members in Haiti and called for their enhanced protection. 'We estimate that children account for up to 50% of armed group members, while the total number of children recruited by armed groups has jumped by 70% over the past year,' UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell told a U.N. meeting on the situation of children in Haiti. 'They are being used as informants, cooks and sex slaves, and they are being forced to perpetrate violence themselves.' She said that gangs regularly kill and maim children, and that reported incidents of sexual violence against minors has skyrocketed this year by 1,000%. Haiti has been rocked by instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. Heavily armed gangs have sought to fill the vacuum, seizing up to 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and expanding their violent grip to some areas beyond it. The violence has caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, displacing more than 700,000 people — of whom the U.N. says about half are children. A record 5.4 million Haitians are facing acute hunger. The World Food Program says faminelike conditions are present, particularly in shelters for the displaced in Port-au-Prince. Children are particularly vulnerable, and at least 125,000 are estimated to be acutely malnourished. 'Why is it easier for a young person to get a gun than it is to get food? That is the defining question of the moment,' said Inga King, ambassador of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, speaking on behalf of Caricom, the bloc of Caribbean countries. 'The protection of children must not be an option; it must be an absolute priority,' said Jean Jean Roosevelt, a Haitian musician and UNICEF goodwill ambassador. Roosevelt, who works to prevent youth from being recruited by gangs, performed a song called 'Watch Out Children' at the U.N. Monday. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Canadian Ambassador Bob Rae emphasized the importance of stabilizing the country. 'If you don't have security, you don't have other things that are required to get us to peace, development and human rights,' Rae said. In June, a multinational security support mission, or MSS as it is known, began its first deployment of about 400 police from Kenya, which is also leading the mission. Jamaica and Belize have also sent some police to assist the embattled Haitian National Police in subduing the gangs. The mission has been beset with delays and financial and equipment shortages, and despite its presence, violence has recently dramatically escalated. Rae said, without giving specifics on numbers or timing, that more police and equipment would be coming to the MSS. In the meantime, Haiti's transitional government has asked the United Nations Security Council to consider turning the non-U.N. force into a U.N. peacekeeping mission, an option U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has been clear should be one of last resort. To transform the mission would take months and need the 15-nation Security Council's authorization. The United States and Ecuador are working on a draft council resolution that would ask Guterres to begin looking at preparing a peacekeeping operation. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Monday that the negotiations were continuing and that 'they are not easy,' because some council members were not on board with the idea. 'But this is what the Haitian people have asked for,' she told reporters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-haitian-children-account-for-about-half-of-country-s-armed-gang-members-/7884775.html	2024-12-02T16:13:29-08:00

Greek islands Rhodes and Lemnos declare state of emergency after deadly storm wreaks havoc	ATHENS, Greece — Authorities on the Greek islands Rhodes and Lemnos declared a state of emergency Monday after storms battered the islands, leaving two dead and widespread damage. Rescue teams, assisted by the military and local authorities, rescued many older residents in flood-hit areas, after strong winds and torrential rain over the weekend flipped cars, caused power outages and damaged roads. Two men were killed in a flooded village on Lemnos, while scores of people were evacuated and taken to hotels in the island's main port. Vassilis Kikilias, the minister for climate crisis and civil protection, urged residents in storm-hit areas to comply with evacuation orders that are announced using cellphone push alerts. 'It is a thousand times better to comply with potentially excessive warnings than to face tragedy,' the minister told private Skai television. Kikilias has pointed to climate change as the cause of worsening weather conditions in Greece in recent years, including an unprecedented series of heatwaves that intensify wildfires, a severe drought this year and massive floods in central Greece in 2023. Rail travel on the Greek mainland was disrupted Monday. Weather warnings remained in effect for islands of the eastern Aegean islands, as well as parts of central and southern mainland Greece.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greek-islands-rhodes-and-lemnos-declare-state-of-emergency-after-deadly-storm-wreaks-havoc-/7884757.html	2024-12-02T15:07:59-08:00	
California lawmakers to begin special session to protect state laws from 2nd Trump presidency	SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California Governor Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Monday to begin a special session to protect the state's progressive policies ahead of another Trump presidency. The Democratic governor, a fierce critic of President-elect Donald Trump, is positioning California to once again be the center of a resistance effort against the conservative agenda. He is asking his Democratic allies in the Legislature, who hold supermajorities in both chambers, to approve additional funding to the attorney general's office to prepare for a robust legal fight against anticipated federal challenges. Democratic Assembly member Jesse Gabriel on Monday introduced legislation to set aside $25 million for legal fees to respond to potential attacks by the Trump administration on state policies regarding civil rights, climate change, immigration and abortion access. 'While we always hope to collaborate with our federal partners, California will be ready to vigorously defend our interests and values from any unlawful action by the incoming Trump Administration,' Gabriel said in a statement. California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times to various levels of success. 'We’re not going to be caught flat-footed,' Newsom said at a recent news conference. Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in America. Democrats, which hold every statewide office in California and have commanding margins in the Legislature and congressional delegation, outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 2-to-1 statewide. Trump called the Democratic governor 'New-scum' during a campaign stop in Southern California and has relentlessly lambasted the Democratic stronghold over its large number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, homeless population and thicket of regulations. Trump also waded into a water rights battle over the endangered delta smelt, a tiny fish that has pitted environmentalists against farmers and threatened to withhold federal aid to a state increasingly under threat from wildfires. He also vowed to follow through with his campaign promise of carrying out the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status and prosecuting his political enemies. Before the special session was set to begin, state lawmakers swore in more than two dozen new members and elected leaders for the 2025 legislative session. Hundreds of people also demonstrated around the Capitol on Monday to urge the Legislature to try to stop Trump's mass deportation plans. They carried banners that said 'Not one cent for mass deportation' and 'MAGA out of California.' 'With the results of the presidential election, we need our state elected officials to use every tool and every resource they have available to them to protect our immigrant Californians,' protester Deborah Lee said. State Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office will protect the state’s immigrant population, while Newsom last week unveiled a proposal to revive a rebate program for electric vehicle purchases if the incoming Trump administration eliminates a federal tax credit for people who buy electric cars. Newsom is also considering creating a backup disaster relief fund for the wildfire-prone state after Trump’s threats. Bonta announced legislation Monday aimed at bolstering reproductive rights in the state, including by allowing the attorney general to seek monetary penalties against local governments that infringe on those rights. The proposals are part of the state's efforts to safeguard against threats to abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Republican lawmakers blasted Newsom and his Democratic allies over the special session. Representative Vince Fong, who represents the state’s Central Valley farm belt, said California should work with the incoming Trump administration instead. 'Gavin Newsom’s actions are tone-deaf to the concerns of Californians who disapprove of the direction of our state and country,' Fong said in a video on social media. Legislators also are expected to spend the year discussing ways to protect dozens of laws expected to be targeted by the Trump administration, including one that has made the state a sanctuary for people seeking abortions who live in states where such practices have been severely limited. California, the nation’s most populous state, was the first to mandate that by 2035 all new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in California be electric, hydrogen-powered or plug-in hybrids. The state also extends state-funded health care to all low-income residents regardless of their immigration status. Newsom hasn't provided details about what actions the lawmakers will consider but said he wanted funding in place before Trump's inauguration day, January 20. The state spent roughly $42 million in litigation costs during the first Trump administration, officials said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-lawmakers-to-begin-special-session-to-protect-state-laws-from-2nd-trump-presidency-/7884745.html	2024-12-02T14:46:29-08:00	
Cyber Monday shoppers expected to set record in online sales	Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon with Cyber Monday. Even though e-commerce is now part of many people's regular routines and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday — a term coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation — has become the biggest online shopping day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has created to fuel it. Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's — and the year's — biggest shopping day for e-commerce. Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday, per Adobe — reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute. For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members Sunday afternoon and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern time. Consumer spending for Cyber Week — the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday — provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays. Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace. At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use 'buy now, pay later' plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items. Many economists have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles. The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% — compared to 3.9% in 2023. A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won’t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers. Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have 'exceeded expectations' — and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined. U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said. Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double-digits while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%. E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute — with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company. Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. 'Hot products' included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care. Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes. RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest. While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more 'experience-driven spending' in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned. Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this season — with consumers opening their wallets to invest or 'trade up' to more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and sporting goods.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyber-monday-shoppers-expected-to-set-record-in-online-sales-/7884748.html	2024-12-02T14:42:48-08:00	
Nigeria's renewed crackdown on oil theft shows impact	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian security operatives recently recovered 1.2 million liters of stolen oil, destroyed scores of illegal refineries and arrested suspected thieves in the latest effort to address crude oil theft in Africa's top oil producer. While many praise the new crackdown, some say authorities need to publicly prosecute and convict offenders. A Nigerian military spokesperson on Sunday announced that the army and other security agencies arrested 17 suspects, dismantled 56 illegal 'oil bunkering' or theft sites, and recovered 1.2 million liters of stolen crude during multiple raids across the Niger Delta in the past week. The raids were part of a larger push to combat oil theft. Energy expert Faith Nwadishi said the renewed efforts are having an impact. 'We see that there’s been an improvement in production coming from the background of about two ... three years ago when Nigerian Upstream commission said that we’re losing about 70% of our production,' Nwadishi said. 'These efforts are beginning to yield some of the results that we’re seeing, but I think that more should be done.' Nigeria has been struggling to curb rampant oil theft for decades. Corruption, poor regulation and a lack of effective security measures have played a role. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation estimates the country loses around 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day or about $10 billion annually to illegal activities that include theft and unauthorized refining operations known as 'Kpo Fire.' The term 'Kpo Fire' refers to the explosive sound made when crude oil — illegally siphoned from official pipelines — is heated in a metal cauldron and then condensed into petroleum products. Authorities say oil theft is harming economic growth. Economist Eze Onyekpere said that the latest crackdown by authorities is welcome but that the government must focus on organized criminal networks. 'Nigeria’s crude oil is stolen at a commercial rate, so the expectation is that they should ... go after the real cabals — the people who are doing it at a very bigger level and not just the smaller men and women in the industry,' Onyekpere said. 'It’s a welcome development, and we need more of it.' Nwadishi said Nigerian authorities need to publicly prosecute and convict suspects arrested for oil theft. She said that even though authorities often announce arrests, the prosecution process is usually shrouded in secrecy, giving rise to allegations of manipulation and corruption. 'It’s not enough to say you’re seizing [crude oil],' Nwadishi said. 'Who are the people you’re seizing it from? The ones they have seized before, were they prosecuted? What was the outcome of that prosecution? We have not heard about that. 'And sometimes the people that you see are really not the financiers of the process,' she said. 'We have not seen a really ‘big fish’ caught on this issue of oil theft. We have not seen the financiers.' In 2022, the Nigerian government awarded a multimillion-dollar pipeline surveillance deal to former oil militant, Government Ekpemupolo — popularly known as Tompolo. Between last year and 2024, Nigeria’s crude oil output increased by 16.7%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-renewed-crackdown-on-oil-theft-shows-impact/7887298.html	2024-12-02T14:22:00-08:00	
A look at groups that captured Syria’s Aleppo	Washington — Rebel forces and allied militants launched a significant offensive last week against Syrian government forces in northwestern Syria, capturing Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city. This marks the largest escalation in Syria’s civil war since it began in 2011. Aleppo, once known as Syria’s economic capital, had been controlled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government since 2016, when government forces, aided by Iranian-backed militias and Russian airstrikes, drove out rebel forces from the eastern parts of the city. Multiple rebel factions and militant groups participated in the battle for Aleppo, code-named Operation Deterrence of Aggression, and headed by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist group that controls most of Idlib province in northwest Syria. Formerly known as al-Nusra Front, it was the main affiliate of al-Qaida in Syria until 2017, when it formally severed ties with the global terror group. According to Aaron Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the group’s current ideology is rooted in local rather than global goals. 'I still consider them extremists. They still have some foreign fighters in their ranks, and they also backed Hamas' October 7 attack against Israel,' Zelin told VOA, referring to the attack carried out by the Palestinian militant group in 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. HTS Is estimated to have up to 30,000 fighters, largely concentrated in northwestern Syria. 'They essentially situate themselves as what I describe as sort of these political jihadists, where theology no longer guides every action they do, like ISIS or al-Qaida, whereas they put in a lot more political considerations related to this, but they are still very much interested in jihad, as we can see the way that they frame this fight,' Zelin said, referring an acronym for the Islamic State. 'One of the ways that I look at the issue is that they essentially went from global jihad to a local regime,' he added. Turkey-backed rebels Among the other armed groups involved in the Aleppo offensive was the Syrian National Army, or SNA, an umbrella organization for several factions backed by Turkey. The SNA was established in 2017 as the armed force of the Turkish-backed Syrian Interim Government, which had gained control of parts of northwestern Syria. The SNA previously took part in two Turkish-backed offensives against Kurdish forces in 2018 and 2019. Some groups aligned with the SNA have been known for their radical Islamist ideology. Last year, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Suleiman Shah Brigade and the Hamza Division, two main factions within the SNA, for 'serious human rights abuses against those residing in the Afrin region of northern Syria.' Caroline Rose, director of the Strategic Blind Spots portfolio at the Washington-based New Lines Institute, said, 'It appears that there is tentative, fragile collaboration between HTS and the SNA, following years of tension and infighting. 'While Turkey had belatedly intervened in the rivalry in respect to security in Syria’s northwest, it’s clear that Ankara invested in fostering greater partnership between HTS and the SNA to conduct this offensive into Aleppo,' she told VOA. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday during a press conference with his Iranian counterpart in Ankara that the latest escalation in Aleppo was the result of long-standing unresolved issues rather than external interventions. He attributed the violence to the Syrian government’s refusal to engage in dialogue with the opposition. As the Aleppo offensive was launched, another was simultaneously announced by the Turkey-backed SNA against U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, in the northern countryside of Aleppo province, primarily around the town of Tel Rifaat. Turkey regards the SDF a terrorist organization. Rose said these different priorities could determine whether the HTS-SNA partnership can last. 'While the SNA is pushing towards Tel Rifaat against SDF forces, HTS is concentrating on establishing proto governance in strategic locations in Aleppo,' she said. 'Turkey will likely play on this rivalry and use it to its advantage as it seeks to redraw battle lines and create leverage with the Assad regime, the U.S., Iran and other actors engaging in Syria.' Several other groups that operate independently are also part of the Aleppo offensive, including Ahrar al-Sham, a coalition of armed Islamist factions established at the beginning of Syria’s conflict. Another Islamist group, the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, emerged in Aleppo in 2014 and has maintained close ties with HTS.

Sectarian violence in Pakistan border district claims more than 130 lives	Islamabad — Authorities in Pakistan reported Monday that armed clashes between rival Sunni and Shiite Muslim tribes in a northwestern district bordering the border with Afghanistan have resulted in at least 133 deaths within the past two weeks. The sectarian violence in Kurram in the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa flared up late last month when gunmen ambushed a Shiite vehicle convoy, killing 52 passengers, including women, children, and security personnel escorting them. No group assumed responsibility for the bloodshed, which triggered retaliatory attacks and arson by Shiite tribesmen in the predominantly Sunni village where the convoy was ambushed. The clashes have since escalated into revenge attacks districtwide, leaving more than 80 people dead and nearly 200 injured. The provincial government facilitated a week-long ceasefire between the warring groups, which allowed the two sides to exchange hostages but failed to halt hostilities. Kurram, situated on the Afghan border, is the sole Pakistani district where Shiites constitute the majority of the population, deviating from the national average where Sunnis hold the majority. Ali Amin Gandapur, the provincial chief minister, Monday led a Cabinet meeting where members were briefed on efforts to restore peace in the region. Local media quoted Gandapur as telling the meeting that those responsible for 'the chaos, spreading sectarian hatred, and inciting murder and destruction' would be 'treated as terrorists.' A land dispute between Sunni and Shiite groups sparked weeks of clashes in Kurram earlier this year, killing more than 100 people between August and October. The violence had compelled authorities to halt all traffic to and from the district until early November, when tribal elders brokered a temporary ceasefire, enabling travelers to resume their journey. The November 21 convoy attack and subsequent clashes, however, forced authorities to again close the highway linking the district to the rest of Pakistan, citing security reasons. Residents have reported a shortage of food, fuel, and medicine due to repeated road closures, causing significant hardships across Kurram, which has a population of nearly 800,000. Gandapur announced Monday that the government was taking steps to address the escalating humanitarian crisis in Kurram. He indicated that authorities were considering deploying helicopters to deliver food and medical supplies to the most affected areas. Trade activities between Pakistan and landlocked Afghanistan through the Kharlachi border crossing in the mountainous district have also been disrupted. Sectarian violence in Kurram erupted amid a surge in militancy in several Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts near or along the Afghan border, the southwestern province of Balochistan, and elsewhere in Pakistan. Nationwide militant attacks have resulted in the deaths of 68 Pakistani security personnel and 50 civilians in November alone, as reported by the Islamabad-based independent Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. The Pakistani military has also stepped-up counter-militancy operations, killing dozens of insurgents. In a statement released Sunday, the Pakistani military announced the killing of eight militants in what it said were intelligence-driven operations conducted in two districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It also confirmed the deaths of two Pakistani soldiers, including an officer, as a result of these operations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sectarian-violence-in-pakistan-border-district-claims-more-than-130-lives/7884594.html	2024-12-02T12:41:41-08:00

Chad orders French troops' departure, triggers fresh anti-French military sentiment	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby has defended his decision to break military ties with France, saying at a news conference Sunday that their defense pact no longer meets Chad’s security needs. The decision requires France to withdraw its troops from the central African nation and echoes growing anti-French sentiment with civil society groups who say it is long overdue. Deby said military ties with France that have existed for close to 65 years are in no way helping to rescue Chad from what he calls growing security challenges, including terrorism and armed conflicts. In a Sunday broadcast on state TV, Deby said his decision to end cooperation agreements with the French military is part of a promise he made during his May 23 inauguration, ending three years of military transition. In the message, Deby said he would build reciprocal relations only with friendly nations that respect each other's independence and sovereignty and assist each other in times of crisis. Deby promised to stop ties with countries he said behaved as if Chad had remained their colony. The central African state first announced that it was ending military ties with France last week. The announcement came after French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot visited Chad and was told that Chad's military is strong enough to protect civilians and their property, according to government officials. Last Friday, the French foreign ministry said it had taken note of Chad’s decision to end the military agreement with Paris, but gave no further details. Deby's decision has reignited debates on what civil society and opposition groups call France's overbearing influence provoking tensions in several African countries, especially Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger and Senegal. Mamadou Doudet, coordinator of Chad’s Patriotic Movement, an opposition political party, said he was part of several dozen civil society organizations and opposition parties that met in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, on Monday to ask Deby to order the departure of over a thousand French troops stationed in Chad. Doudet said the presence of French troops in Chad is of no use. He said Chad's civil society and opposition find it very difficult to understand why French troops did not assist Chad last month when Boko Haram attacked and killed 40 Chadian soldiers in a military garrison in Lake Chad shared by Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger. It is not the first time Chadian civil society and opposition groups sought the expulsion of French troops. In November 2023, the groups said Deby should ensure some 1,000 French troops stationed in Chad and several thousand others expelled from Niger should leave Chad before the end of 2023. Yet, close to 1,000 French troops remain in Chad. On Monday, the Concertation Group of Chad's Political Actors, or GCAP, condemned Deby’s decision to end military cooperation with France. GCAP spokesperson Max Kemkoye said Chad's military is not strong enough to handle the many security challenges facing the country. He accused Deby of not consulting his government before making the decision, a claim VOA could not independently verify.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-orders-french-troops-departure-triggers-fresh-anti-french-military-sentiment-/7884520.html	2024-12-02T11:40:41-08:00

Top Romanian court validates first round of presidential race after vote recount	BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — A top Romanian court on Monday validated the first round of a presidential race in which a far-right outsider emerged as the front-runner, plunging the country into turmoil amid allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling. The Constitutional Court's unanimous decision came after it asked the Central Election Bureau to recount and verify all 9.4 million ballots cast in the first round of the presidential election on Nov. 24. BEC approved the request and said that scanned reports were due to be sent in on Dec. 1. The decision is final. Calin Georgescu, a little-known far-right populist and independent candidate, narrowly won the first round, beating the incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu. Georgescu will face reformist Elena Lasconi, the leader of the Save Romania Union party, in a Dec. 8. runoff. Lasconi beat Ciolacu by just 2,740 votes. The recount was prompted by a complaint lodged by Cristian Terhes, a presidential candidate who garnered 1% of the ballot. Terhes' press office said the court ordered the recount 'due to indications of fraud,' alleging that valid votes cast for Ludovic Orban — who had dropped out of the race but remained on the ballot — were reassigned to Lasconi. He also claimed that Lasconi's party had urged people to vote before some diaspora polls had closed, saying it violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day. On Monday, the BEC submitted partial recount results to the court, which did not include hundreds of thousands of the votes from Romania's large diaspora. Dominic Fritz, the vice president of USR, said in a statement before that court's decision that more than 8 million votes had been recounted, and that 'no one has found any reason to question the final results.' Many observers had warned that invalidating the vote could further fuel the crisis that gripped Romania's political establishment in the wake of the first round. Georgescu's unexpected success prompted a series of protests by people concerned with previous remarks he made in praising Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and who believe he poses a threat to democracy. Many have attributed his victory to his rapid rise in popularity on the social media platform TikTok. According to a report by Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, Georgescu's account has had an explosion which it said 'appears sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.' Without naming Georgescu, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis' office said after a Supreme Council of National Defense meeting last Thursday that an analysis of documents revealed that 'a presidential candidate benefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment granted by the TikTok platform.' Romania's National Audiovisual Council asked the European Commission to investigate TikTok's role in the Nov. 24 vote. Pavel Popescu, the vice president of Romania's media regulator Ancom, said he would request TikTok's suspension in Romania if investigations find evidence of 'manipulation of the electoral process.' TikTok did not respond to a request from The Associated Press. On Sunday, Romania also held a parliamentary election in which pro-Western parties won the most votes and will look to form a coalition government. The ballot also saw a surge of support for far-right nationalists who made huge gains in the country's legislature.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-romanian-court-validates-first-round-of-presidential-race-after-vote-recount/7884472.html	2024-12-02T11:02:50-08:00	
French PM's bold budget move spurs opposition parties to pledge no-confidence	Paris — French Prime Minister Michel Barnier invoked a special constitutional tool on Monday to push through the controversial 2025 budget without a parliamentary vote. He said it was necessary to ensure stability at a time of deep political divisions. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally and the leftist France Unbowed announced they would file no-confidence motions in response, setting up a vote for as early as Wednesday that could bring down the fragile government. The decision comes as France grapples with a fractured National Assembly following snap elections in June, which left no party or coalition with a majority. President Emmanuel Macron appointed Barnier in September to break the deadlock and tackle the country's ballooning deficit. However, his austerity budget— featuring 40 billion euros in cuts and 20 billion euros in tax hikes — has been widely criticized, escalating tensions in the lower house. The use of the tool, called Article 49.3, allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote but leaves it exposed to no-confidence motions. Opposition leaders argue that Barnier's concessions, including scrapping an electricity tax hike, do not go far enough to address their concerns. Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her party's demands. 'Everyone must shoulder their responsibilities,' she said.The political standoff has unsettled financial markets, with borrowing costs rising sharply amid fears of prolonged instability. Barnier warned of 'serious turbulence' if the budget isn't passed, but critics dismissed his remarks as fearmongering. If the no-confidence motion succeeds, Macron will remain president but will need to appoint a new prime minister to steer legislation through the fractured assembly. The uncertainty threatens to deepen France's economic troubles and reverberate across the eurozone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-pm-s-bold-budget-move-spurs-opposition-parties-to-pledge-no-confidence-/7884460.html	2024-12-02T11:00:59-08:00

Turkey calls for reconciliation between Syria government and opposition to end conflict	ANKARA, TURKEY — The recent rapid advance by opposition fighters in Syria shows that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must reconcile with his own people and hold dialogue with the opposition, the Turkish foreign minister said Monday. At a joint news conference in Ankara with his Iranian counterpart, Hakan Fidan said Turkey and Iran, which support opposing sides in Syria's civil war, have agreed to resume diplomatic efforts along with Russia to restore calm days after insurgents launched a lightning offensive and captured almost all of the country's largest city, Aleppo. The swift advance by fighters that Turkey supports was a huge embarrassment for Assad and it comes at a time when his allies — Iran and groups it backs and Russia — are preoccupied with their own conflicts. The push is among the rebels' strongest in years and raises the prospect of another violent front reopening in the Middle East when U.S.-backed Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both Iranian-allied groups. Fidan, whose country has backed forces opposed to Assad, blamed the recent flare-up of the conflict on the Syrian government's refusal to enter a dialogue with the opposition that Turkey supports. 'Recent developments show once again that Damascus must reconcile with its own people and the legitimate opposition,' the Turkish minister said. 'Turkey is ready to make all the necessary contribution toward this.' Fidan's comments emerged amid Turkish frustration that recent efforts toward a reconciliation with Assad have fallen flat. The comments indicated that the shock offensive launched by opposition fighters could be aimed at pressuring the Syrian leader to engage in political talks. Turkey has been seeking to normalize ties with Syria to address security threats from groups affiliated with Kurdish militants along its southern border and to help ensure the safe return of more than 3 million Syrian refugees. Assad has insisted that Turkey's withdrawal of its forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who visited Assad on Sunday before traveling to Ankara, reiterated Tehran's full support for the Syrian government. Iran has been one of Assad's principal political and military supporters and has deployed military advisers and forces after 2011 protests against Assad's rule turned into an all-out war. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have deployed in Syria to back the government's counteroffensive against the insurgents, an Iraqi militia official and a war monitor said Monday. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based opposition war monitor, some 200 Iraqi militiamen riding on pickups crossed into Syria overnight through the strategic Bou Kamal crossing. They were expected to deploy in Aleppo to support the Syrian army's pushback against the insurgents, the monitor said. The rebel offensive in Syria has caused concern among neighboring countries that the conflict could spill over. In Iraq, Interior Ministry spokesperson Brig. Gen. Miqdad Miri said security forces have deployed in greater numbers to protect their large border with Syria. Fidan reiterated Turkey's support for Syria's territorial integrity, but suggested that Turkey would not hesitate to intervene against Syrian Kurdish militia groups that Turkey considers to be terrorists if they 'exploit the environment of instability.' 'It was a mistake to ignore the legitimate demands of the opposition and for the (Syrian) regime not to sincerely engage in the political process,' Fidan said. 'Turkey will never, ever allow terrorist organizations that seek to exploit the environment of instability,' Fidan said. 'We will eliminate any threat to our national security and our people wherever it emerges.' Both Fidan and Araghchi said Turkey, Iran and Russia would convene a new three-way meeting to address the conflict in Syria. 'We have decided to hold closer consultations and dialogue, and with God's permission, we will cooperate to further improve the situation toward peace and stability in our region,' Araghchi said. Russia, whose intervention in Syria's civil war on behalf of Assad was crucial in turning the conflict in his favor, has said it will continue to support him. 'We continue our contacts at the appropriate level and analyze the situation,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday. 'A position will be formed regarding what is needed to stabilize the situation.' As Syrian and Russian jets continued pounding targets, two airstrikes hit a group of four hospitals and the health directorate building in Idlib city, the Syrian Civil Defense force that operates in opposition-held areas, known as the White Helmets, said. Two people in Idlib University Hospital died after their oxygen machines turned off following the strikes. Ceiling panels and doors at the hospital were blown off, while ambulances and vehicles outside were severely damaged according to footage taken by a journalist with The Associated Press at the hospital. At least 15 civilians were killed in Idlib city and province, according to the White Helmets. Syrian Kurds were fleeing the fighting in large numbers after Turkish-backed rebels seized Tel Rifaat from rival U.S.-backed Kurdish authorities. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces largely withdrew and called for a humanitarian corridor to allow people to leave safely in convoys toward Aleppo and later to Kurdish-led northeast regions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html	2024-12-02T08:38:26-08:00	
US unveils fresh export curbs targeting China's chip sector	Washington — The United States announced new export restrictions Monday taking aim at China's ability to make advanced semiconductors — used in weapon systems and artificial intelligence as competition intensifies between the world's two biggest economies. 'The United States has taken significant steps to protect our technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our national security,' said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan in a statement. He added that Washington will keep working with allies and partners to 'to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading technologies and know-how.' The latest rules include a restriction of exports to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier Technology. They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the Commerce Department. 'We are constantly talking to our allies and partners as well as reassessing and updating our controls,' added Under Secretary of Commerce for industry and security Alan Estevez. The latest announcement also includes controls on two dozen types of chipmaking equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-unveils-fresh-export-curbs-targeting-china-chip-sector/7884193.html	2024-12-02T07:48:21-08:00	
Analysts say Biden’s first trip to Africa should’ve come earlier in presidency	Nairobi — After promising to visit Africa two years ago at the U.S. Africa summit in Washington, President Joe Biden makes his first presidential trip to the continent where he is visiting Angola with a quick stop in Cabo Verde. Analysts in Africa say the trip should’ve come sooner and some are asking why Angola is the primary destination – given its troubling human rights record. White House officials say President Joe Biden is looking forward to visiting the continent after a promise he made in 2022. But some analysts tell VOA that Biden’s trip, which comes weeks before he steps down, would’ve had more weight if he had done it earlier. Louw Nel, senior political analyst for Oxford Economics Africa, spoke to VOA from South Africa. 'I think his trip is less significant than it would’ve been otherwise just because of the fact that he withdrew as presidential candidate and, of course, now [is] not returning for a second term. So, it really feels like an afterthought to his presidency,' said Nel. After a short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde off Africa’s northwestern coast, President Biden heads south to Angola. There, officials say he plans to focus on U.S. leadership on trade, investment, and infrastructure in Africa. He’ll also recognize Angola’s President João Lourenço’s regional leadership and global partnership on trade, security, and health. More importantly, President Biden will highlight one of his signature initiatives, the investment of the Lobito Corridor — a regional railway project linking natural resource-rich areas stretching from the Angolan port of Lobito to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. The corridor is part of a wider joint effort between multiple partners aimed at closing the infrastructure gap in growing economies around the world, officials say. Dr. Frances Brown, special assistant to the president and senior director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking about the broader benefits associated with the project. 'What I found really notable about the Lobito Corridor is that it isn’t just about a railroad or critical minerals. It’s also about the communities that are strengthened along the way, it’s about more access to education, it’s about agricultural products moving to market, and it’s about increases in digital connectivity,' said Brown. Last year, U.S.-Angola trade totaled approximately $1.77 billion, making Angola America’s fourth-largest trade partner in Sub-Saharan Africa. Angola has vast mineral deposits and is Africa’s third largest oil producer. But according to Amnesty International, the country’s natural resource wealth has not translated to prosperity for most of its people, resulting in numerous peaceful protests against poverty, unemployment and high cost of living. Nel says some Angolans may see a benefit with this Biden visit. 'Many ordinary Angolans will recognize that Angola desperately needs to diversify its economy, and this is an enormous opportunity to do so, to move away from oil and gas and bolster other parts of the economy and it has massive potential,' said Nel. But others including human rights campaigners and opposition parties, Nel says, will feel aggrieved by President Biden’s visit because they see the Lourenco administration as being rewarded despite growing concerns about the shrinking space for independent civil society organizations and freedom of expression. In a new report, Amnesty International said that anyone who publicly criticizes the Lourenço government risks arrest. And 'if human rights are central to President Biden’s foreign policy, then he must demand Angola’s government immediately …free arbitrarily detained government critics.' Adriano Nuvunga, who runs the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Mozambique, echoes that sentiment. 'I commend the people of Angola and president Lourenço for hosting President Biden. It means a lot for the people of Angola. While I commend them, I would also want to encourage President Biden to ask those tough questions to President João Lourenço,' said Nuvunga. 'We have a number of human rights defenders in Angola that are detained unjustly, unfairly for doing nothing. They are languishing in jails, some of them in critical conditions,' said Nuvunga. Nuvunga hopes that this could be addressed during this trip.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-say-biden-s-first-trip-to-africa-should-ve-come-earlier-in-presidency-/7884103.html	2024-12-02T07:07:00-08:00	
Chief of ICC lashes out at US and Russia over threats, accusations	The Hague, Netherlands — The president of the International Criminal Court lashed out at the United States and Russia for interfering with its investigations, calling attacks on the court 'appalling.' 'The court is being threatened with draconian economic sanctions by another permanent member of the Security Council as if it was a terrorist organization,' Judge Tomoko Akane said in her address to the institution's annual meeting, which opened on Monday. Akane was referring to remarks made by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose Republican party will control both branches of Congress in January, and who called the court a 'dangerous joke' and urged Congress to sanction its prosecutor. 'To any ally, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, if you try to help the ICC, we're going to sanction you,' Graham said on Fox News. Graham was angered by an announcement last month that judges had granted a request from the court's chief prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas' military chief for crimes against humanity in connection with the nearly 14-month war in Gaza. This marks the first time the global court of justice calls out a sitting leader of a major Western ally. ICC faces challenges on arrest warrants Graham's threat isn't seen as just empty words. President-elect Donald Trump sanctioned the court's previous prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, with a travel ban and asset freeze for investigating American troops and intelligence officials in Afghanistan. Akane on Monday also had harsh words for Russia. 'Several elected officials are being subjected to arrest warrants from a permanent member of the Security Council,' she said. Moscow issued warrants for Khan and others in response to the investigation into Putin. The Assembly of States Parties, which represents the ICC's 124 member countries, will convene its 23rd conference to elect committee members and approve the court's budget against a backdrop of unfavorable headlines. The ICC was established in 2002 as the world's permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the most heinous atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. The court only becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute those crimes on their territory. To date, 124 countries have signed on to the Rome Statute, which created the institution. Those who have not include Israel, Russia and China. The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to execute arrest warrants. The decision to warrant issues for Netanyahu and Israel's ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has been denounced by critics of the court and given only milquetoast approval by many of its supporters, a stark contrast to the robust backing of an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin last year over war crimes in Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden called the warrants for Netanyahu and the former defense minister 'outrageous' and vowed to stand with Israel. A year ago, Biden called the warrant for Putin 'justified' and said the Russian president had committed war crimes. The U.S. is not an ICC member country. France said it would 'respect its obligations' but would need to consider Netanyahu's possible immunities. When the warrant for Putin was announced, France said it would 'lend its support to the essential work' of the court. Another member country, Austria, begrudgingly acknowledged it would arrest Netanyahu but called the warrants 'utterly incomprehensible.' Italy called them 'wrong' but said it would be obliged to arrest him. Germany said it would study the decision. Member Hungary has said it would stand with Israel instead of the court. Global security expert Janina Dill worried that such responses could undermine global justice efforts. 'It really has the potential to damage not just the court, but international law,' she told The Associated Press. Milena Sterio, an expert in international law at Cleveland State University, told the AP that sanctions against the court could affect a number of people who contribute to the court's work, such as international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Clooney advised the current prosecutor on his request for the warrants for Netanyahu and others. 'Sanctions are a huge burden,' Sterio said. Accusations against Khan Also hanging heavy over the meeting in The Hague are the internal pressures that Khan faces. In October, the AP reported the 54-year-old British lawyer is facing allegations he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her. Two co-workers in whom the woman confided reported the alleged misconduct in May to the court's independent watchdog, which says it interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan was never questioned. He has denied the claims. The Assembly of States Parties has announced it will launch an external probe into the allegations. It's not clear if the investigation will be addressed during the meeting. Khan took the floor after Akane. He didn't address the accusations against him or the threats against the court directly, other than to say the institution was facing 'unprecedented challenges.' Instead he highlighted his office's recent request for an arrest warrant against the head of Myanmar's military government and said he planned to request warrants related to Afghanistan and Sudan in the coming months. Late last week, six countries including France, Luxembourg and Mexico asked Khan's office to look into possible crimes in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control in 2021. While Khan isn't obligated to open an investigation in response to such a request, historically court prosecutors have done so. The court, which has long faced accusations of ineffectiveness, will have no trials pending after two conclude in December. While it has issued a number of arrest warrants in recent months, many high-profile suspects remain at large. Member states don't always act. Mongolia refused to arrest Putin when he visited in September. Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir is wanted by the ICC over accusations related to the conflict in Darfur, but his country has refused to hand him over. Last week, Khan requested a warrant for the head of Myanmar's military regime, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, for attacks against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority. Judges have yet to decide on that request. 'It becomes very difficult to justify the court's existence,' Sterio said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chief-of-icc-lashes-out-at-us-and-russia-over-threats-accusations/7884096.html	2024-12-02T07:01:28-08:00

German FM urges China to stop backing Russia, work for Ukraine peace	Beijing — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Monday warned her Chinese counterpart that Beijing's support for Moscow would impact ties and instead urged China to help end the Ukraine conflict. Speaking in Beijing, she said the over 1,000-day war was impacting the whole world and condemned the battlefield role of North Korean troops and the use of Chinese-made drones in the conflict. Baerbock urged an international peace process for Ukraine and said 'that is why I am here in China today,' adding that every permanent member of the U.N. Security Council had a 'responsibility for peace and security in the world.' 'The Russian president is not only destroying our European peace order through his war against Ukraine, but is now dragging Asia into it via North Korea,' she told a press briefing. 'My Chinese counterpart and I have therefore discussed in depth that this cannot be in China's interest either.' Germany's top diplomat met with her counterpart Wang Yi for a 'strategic dialogue' as Berlin seeks to build better ties with China while engaging on key differences. Wang told his German counterpart that, 'as the world's second- and third-largest economies' China and Germany must improve ties 'as great powers in a turbulent international situation.' On the day German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made a surprise visit to war-torn Ukraine, Baerbock stressed that 'in order to protect our own German and European security, we must now support Ukraine.' 'And it is just as important to enter into a peace process together in the world, and that is why I am here in China today,' she said. Chinese drone worries China presents itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations. But it remains a close political and economic ally of Russia, and NATO members have branded Beijing a 'decisive enabler' of the war, which it has never condemned. 'Drones from Chinese factories and North Korean troops attacking the peace in the middle of Europe are violating our core European security interests,' Baerbock said. She said she had 'advocated a just peace process here in Beijing today, precisely because we come from different perspectives and roles'. Baerbock had earlier told Wang that 'increasing Chinese support for Russia's war against Ukraine has an impact on our relations,' according to a readout by the German foreign ministry. 'Core German and European security interests are affected,' she said. Baerbock also discussed crucial trade ties between Europe's biggest economy and China, which has long been a key market for German automakers and other industrial giants. She urged Chinese authorities to 'engage constructively' with the European Union over tariffs levied on Chinese electric vehicles. 'A level playing field, fair competition and reciprocal market conditions are essential,' she said, according to her spokesperson. At the press briefing, she added that as 'highly subsidized electric cars are now flooding the European market, we have to react to that.' The EU at the end of October imposed extra tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars, after an anti-subsidy probe concluded Beijing's state support was unfairly undercutting European automakers. Germany, whose big auto makers including Volkswagen are facing falling profits and are weighing lay-offs, had in Brussels opposed the EU tariffs and called for continued dialogue with China. Wang said that 'the EU's imposition of high anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles violates the principles of fair competition and free trade,' according to a readout of the meeting published by China's foreign ministry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-fm-urges-china-to-stop-backing-russia-work-for-ukraine-peace/7884019.html	2024-12-02T05:54:21-08:00	
Lebanese officials say Israeli strikes hit southern, eastern Lebanon	Lebanon’s health ministry said an Israeli strike Monday killed one person in southern Lebanon, while the Lebanese military said an Israeli strike wounded a soldier in the eastern part of the country. Israel’s military did not immediately comment on the attacks. The strikes come days after Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a cease-fire, bringing a halt to 14 months of fighting that erupted following an attack by Hezbollah ally Hamas on Israel. During its attack, Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. There are still about 100 hostages being held in the Gaza Strip, with about one-third believed to be dead. Israeli officials announced Monday that Omer Neutra, an Israeli American soldier who was presumed captured in the October 7, 2023, attack, is now believed to have been killed in the attack. The Israeli military did not detail what new information it may have to make the new determination. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement that the country’s hearts are with Neutra’s family. 'We must fulfill the ultimate imperative: to return Omer, and all our abducted men and women — the living to their families, and the fallen and murdered to be laid to rest,' Herzog said. In its counteroffensive in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 44,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel, without providing evidence, says it has killed more than 17,000 militants. A top U.S. national security official said Sunday that a ceasefire in Gaza is now 'more likely' following the ceasefire reached in Lebanon. The U.S. and other negotiators 'may have a chance' to end 14 months of fighting in Gaza, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show but declined to make a prediction, 'because we’ve come close before.' Herzog said Sunday, 'There are negotiations taking place behind the scenes, and it can be done.' Sullivan told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' show, 'We are engaged deeply with the key players in the region, and there is activity even today. There will be further conversations and consultations, and our hope is that we can generate a ceasefire and hostage deal, but we're not there yet.' Sullivan spoke a day after Hamas released a videotape of one of the hostages, Israeli American Edan Alexander. Speaking under duress, Alexander blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, saying, 'The prime minister is supposed to protect his soldiers and citizens, and you abandoned us.' Sullivan said the video was 'a cruel reminder of Hamas' brutality and of the fact that they are holding so many hostages from so many countries.' Sullivan called the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, which has largely been holding steady, 'a huge step forward in the Middle East … the opportunity for people to ultimately be able to return to their homes in Israel and in Lebanon.' He said the United States, France and other allies 'are going to work together with the Lebanese Armed Forces through a mechanism to ensure that the ceasefire is implemented effectively. Our goal is to get through these first few days, critical days of a ceasefire, when it's most fragile, have it take full hold, and then ultimately build on it so that it becomes the permanent ceasefire it's intended to be.' The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent much of the past year trying to broker a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages. But the talks have been stalemated, with Israel rejecting Hamas' demand for a complete withdrawal from the territory and Israel demanding that any vestige of Hamas control in the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea be erased. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanese-officials-say-israeli-strikes-hit-southern-eastern-lebanon-/7883916.html	2024-12-02T04:18:05-08:00	
Malaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs	KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysia has urged Chinese companies to refrain from using it as a base to 'rebadge' products to avoid U.S. tariffs, its deputy trade minister said on Monday, amid increasing export restrictions and concerns of a U.S.-China trade war. Washington is expected to further curb exports to Chinese semiconductor toolmakers and sales of certain chipmaking equipment, including products manufactured in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, sources have told Reuters. Malaysia is a major player in the semiconductor industry, accounting for 13% of global testing and packaging, and is seen as well placed to grab further business in the sector as Chinese chip firms diversify overseas for assembling needs. 'Over the past year or so... I have been advising many businesses from China not to invest in Malaysia if they were merely thinking of rebadging their products via Malaysia to avoid U.S. tariffs,' Malaysia's deputy trade minister Liew Chin Tong told a forum on Monday. He did not specify the types of businesses. Liew said regardless of whether the U.S. had a Democratic or Republican administration, the world's largest economy would impose tariffs, as seen in the solar panel sector. Washington imposed tariffs on solar exports from Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Cambodia — home to factories owned by Chinese firms — last year and expanded them in October following complaints from manufacturers in the United States. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese imports when he takes office on Jan. 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-urges-chinese-firms-to-avoid-using-it-to-dodge-us-tariffs-/7883903.html	2024-12-02T03:54:02-08:00	
Guinea stadium crush kills 56 people after disputed refereeing decision	CONAKRY, Guinea — A controversial refereeing decision sparked violence and a crush at a soccer match in southeast Guinea, killing 56 people according to a provisional toll, the government said on Monday. The fatalities occurred during the final of a tournament in honor of Guinea's military leader Mamady Doumbouya at a stadium in Nzerekore, one of the nation's largest cities. Some fans threw stones, triggering panic and a crush, the government statement said, promising an investigation. A video authenticated by Reuters showed dozens of people scrambling over high walls to escape. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official from the city's administration said many victims were minors caught in the turmoil after police started firing tear gas. The official described scenes of confusion and chaos with some parents retrieving bodies before they were officially counted. Videos and pictures shared online showed victims lined up on the ground. In one video, over a dozen inert bodies could be seen, several of them children. Reuters was not immediately able to verify that footage. Opposition group National Alliance for Change and Democracy said authorities bore responsibility for organizing tournaments to bolster political support for Doumbouya in contravention of a transition charter prior to a promised presidential election. There was no immediate response from the military junta to that accusation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guinea-stadium-crush-kills-56-people-after-disputed-refereeing-decision/7883830.html	2024-12-02T02:56:26-08:00	
Germany announces Ukraine military aid as chancellor makes Kyiv visit	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged $680 million in military aid for Ukraine as he pledged support for the country during a visit Monday to Kyiv. Scholz said Ukraine can rely on Germany, and that his visit was meant to reinforce that commitment. He said the new military equipment is set to be delivered to Ukraine this month. The visit comes amid questions about future Western aid for Ukraine with the United States set to go through a change of leadership in January. Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 52 of 110 drones that Russian forces launched in attacks overnight. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the air force said. Viacheslav Negoda, the head of the military administration of Ternopil region, said on Telegram that Russian attacks killed one person and injured several others. Officials in Cherkasy said falling drone debris damaged several residential buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 15 Ukrainian aerial drones. The ministry said it destroyed drones over the Kursk, Bryansk and Belgorod regions, and over Russia-occupied Crimea.

Philippines' Marcos says presence of Russian submarine 'very worrisome'	Manila, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Monday the presence of a Russian attack submarine in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea was 'very worrisome.' 'That’s very concerning. Any intrusion into the West Philippine Sea, of our EEZ, of our baselines, is very worrisome,' Marcos told reporters, referring to part of the South China Sea within the Philippines' maritime zone. A Russian Kilo-class submarine was sighted 80 nautical miles off the western province of Occidental Mindoro on Nov. 28, Navy spokesperson Roy Vincent Trinidad said in a statement on Monday, confirming a report by the Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper. Philippine navy frigate Jose Rizal established radio contact with the Russian submarine, which confirmed its identity as UFA 490 and its intent. 'The Russian vessel stated it was awaiting improved weather conditions before proceeding to Vladivostok, Russia,' Trinidad said, without elaborating on why it was in the area. Philippine naval forces escorted the submarine to ensure compliance with maritime regulations, he added. Russia's embassy in Manila could not immediately be reached for comment. Russia's Kilo-class submarines are considered some of the quietest submarines and have been constantly refined since the 1980s. China and Russia declared a 'no limits' partnership when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing in 2022, just days before Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine. The two countries carried out live-fire naval exercises in the South China Sea in July. Tensions between Manila, a U.S. treaty ally, and Beijing have escalated over the past year due to overlapping claims in the South China Sea. A 2016 arbitral tribunal ruled China's historical claims to the disputed waterway had no basis, a decision Beijing rejects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-marcos-says-presence-of-russian-submarine-very-worrisome-/7883723.html	2024-12-01T23:18:18-08:00	
Nine Volkswagen plants to strike as labor battle escalates	BERLIN — Workers at nine Volkswagen car and component plants across Germany will strike for several hours on Monday, IG Metall union said, bringing assembly lines to a halt as labor and management clash over the future of the carmaker's German operations. Thousands are expected to gather at the carmaker's headquarters in Wolfsburg. Demonstrations are also expected at the Hanover plant, which employs around 14,000 people, and other component and auto plants including Emden, Salzgitter, and Brunswick. The strikes, which could escalate into 24-hour or unlimited strikes if a deal is not struck in the next round of wage negotiations, will put a dent in Volkswagen's output at a time when the carmaker is already facing declining deliveries and plunging profit. 'How long and how intensive this confrontation needs to be is Volkswagen's responsibility at the negotiating table,' Groeger said on Sunday. A company spokesperson on Sunday said the carmaker respected workers' right to strike and had taken steps to ensure a basic level of supplies to customers and minimize the strike's impact. The union last week proposed measures it said would save $1.6 billion, including forgoing bonuses for 2025 and 2026, which Europe's top carmaker dismissed. Volkswagen has demanded a 10% wage cut, arguing it needs to slash costs and boost profit to defend market share. The company is also threatening to close plants in Germany, a first in its 87-year history. An agreement not to stage walkouts ended on Saturday, enabling workers to carry out strikes from Sunday across VW AG's German plants. The labor union called on employees of the plants housed under subsidiary Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH, which include VW's EV-only plant Zwickau, to strike on both Monday and Tuesday. Negotiations will continue on Dec. 9 over a new labor agreement, with unions vowing to resist any proposals that do not provide a long-term plan for every VW plant.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nine-volkswagen-plants-to-strike-as-labor-battle-escalates/7883718.html	2024-12-01T23:01:54-08:00	
Georgia police fire tear gas to scatter protesters, Russian agencies say	TBILISI, Georgia — Police in Georgia fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse protesters in Tbilisi, the capital, who opposed the government's decision to suspend talks on joining the European Union, while some were detained, Russian agencies said on Monday. Thousands of protesters had taken to the streets for several days in the nation of 3.7 million, accusing the ruling Georgian Dream party of pursuing increasingly authoritarian, anti-Western and pro-Russian policies. Police ended hours of standoff early on Monday by moving demonstrators away from the parliament building and down the central Rustaveli Avenue towards the Tbilisi opera house and began erecting barricades with any material they could find. Amid skirmishes with police, the demonstrators were forced off the avenue as they tossed fireworks at law enforcement officers, who responded with volleys of water cannon and tear gas, Russian agencies said. After months of rising tension, the crisis has worsened since Thursday's announcement that the government would freeze EU talks for four years, with pro-EU demonstrators facing off against police. It was not immediately clear how many protesters were detained early on Monday, when Russia's Interfax news agency said only a small group was left near a metro station. It said 113 police officers were injured during the Tbilisi protests of the last few days, citing the Georgian interior (home) ministry. On Sunday, four opposition groups urged protesters to demand paid leave from their jobs in order to attend protests, as provided by labor law, and asked employers to permit time off. Georgia's pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili called for pressure to be brought on the Constitutional Court to annul elections last month won by Georgian Dream. Both the opposition and Zourabichvili say the poll was rigged. The European Union and the United States said they were alarmed by what they see as Georgia's shift away from a pro-Western path back towards Russia's orbit. Georgian Dream says it is acting to defend the country's sovereignty against outside interference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-police-fire-tear-gas-to-scatter-protesters-russian-agencies-say/7883708.html	2024-12-01T22:53:16-08:00	
Indonesia, Canada sign comprehensive economic partnership	JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia and Canada on Monday signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) that aims to strengthen economic ties between the two G20 members, three years after negotiations began. The agreement will take effect in 2026 and was signed in Jakarta by trade ministers of both countries. Indonesia's trade minister, Budi Santoso, said Indonesia appreciated Canada's support for its plan to prioritize its critical minerals sector, which was vital for its sustainable growth. 'Together, we advance sustainable critical mineral management, supporting Indonesia's net zero target by 2060, and fostering Canadian investment while driving green growth in both nations,' he told a joint press conference. Indonesia has rich deposits of tin, copper and bauxite, among others, and is the world's largest source of nickel ore. It is seeking to extract more value from the minerals by attracting investment into its processing and in the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries. The United States in July said it had approached Indonesia about joining a multinational mineral security partnership aimed at speeding up development of sustainable critical mineral supply chains. Indonesia also made an agreement with Britain in September to collaborate on critical minerals. Two-way trade between Indonesia and Canada was $3.4 billion last year, according to with Indonesia's trade ministry. Canada has estimated bilateral trade at $5.1 billion in 2023. Canada's main exports to Indonesia were agriculture products fertilizers, while Indonesia mainly exported machinery and electrical machinery as well as garments and footwear. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto met during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' summit in Peru last month. Prabowo at the time said he was looking for more cooperation on fisheries, manufacturing and renewable energy sectors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-canada-sign-comprehensive-economic-partnership/7883711.html	2024-12-01T22:48:50-08:00	
Serbia rejects responsibility for a water supply explosion in Kosovo as tensions rise	BELGRADE, Serbia — Serbia on Sunday rejected any responsibility for a powerful explosion that temporarily cut water and power supplies to large swathes of neighboring Kosovo, with Serbia's president claiming such accusations are part of a 'hybrid' warfare against his country. Kosovo officials said police had arrested eight people after an explosion on Friday in the northern Serb-populated part of the state hit a canal that sends water to its two main power plants. Pristina called it a 'terrorist act' conducted by Serbia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic rejected those accusations. 'On Friday, there was an attempt of a large hybrid attack on our country,' Vucic said. 'Belgrade and Serbia have nothing to do with those events.' The populist Serbian leader suggested Kosovo was behind the attack but said he would refrain from directly accusing Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti pending an investigation conducted by Belgrade. 'I will not say that Kurti directly ordered the attack,' Vucic said. 'The investigation will show, we have certain suspicions. We believe we have certain findings who could be the perpetrator.' 'During that so-called anti-terrorist operation, Kurti's special forces occupied new intersections and streets, harassing Serbs, and it was all a show for the international public,' Vucic said. Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti said the recent attacks in Kosovo — on a water canal, town hall building and police station — were correlated with the recent attacks from Russia in Ukraine. 'That attack has correlation with the massive air attacks of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, attacks which targeted energy infrastructure in Ukraine,' he said at a news conference on Sunday. Kosovo police have raided 10 locations in the north, confiscating more than 200 military uniforms, six shoulder-fired rocket launchers, long weapons, pistols and ammunition, they said. About 15 to 20 kilograms (30 to 45 pounds) of explosives were used to damage the critical infrastructure, according to Kosovo police chief Gazmend Hoxha. Police also found many emblems of the Russian special forces and Russian empire flags, according to Kurti, adding that 'Serbia is copying Russian methods to threaten Kosovo and the region in general.' The explosion has further fueled tensions between the two Balkan states. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, which is not recognized by Belgrade. Most of the Serb minority living in Kosovo still consider Belgrade as their capital. The European Union and the United States strongly denounced the explosion and demanded that the perpetrators are brought to justice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-rejects-responsibility-for-a-water-supply-explosion-in-kosovo-as-tensions-rise/7883670.html	2024-12-01T19:20:04-08:00	
Romanian leftists ahead of resurgent far right in election	BUCHAREST, Romania — Romania's ruling leftist Social Democrats (PSD) looked set to win the most votes in a parliamentary election on Sunday, fending off a resurgent far-right movement that challenges the country's pro-Western orientation, partial results showed. The vote is the second of three consecutive ballots for both a new parliament and a new president, after the first round of the presidential election on Nov. 24 saw an independent far-right candidate, Calin Georgescu, emerge from relative obscurity to become the frontrunner. His unexpected win ushered in support for ultranationalist, hard-right parties, some with overt pro-Russian sympathies, which political analysts said could undermine Romania's support for Ukraine. If final results confirm the preliminary count, a pro-Western coalition led by the PSD would likely have enough seats in parliament to form a government, although the far right would be a substantial force in the legislature. However, a broad coalition would be difficult to form amid disagreements over reforms and measures needed to rein in the country's gaping budget deficit, now the highest in the EU at 8% of economic output. Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University, said the PSD would likely play a central part in any coalition talks. But the results pointed to 'the most fragmented political spectrum since 1990,' he said, in a reflection of deepening social divisions in Romania, which has some of the EU's poorest regions. With 90% of votes counted, the PSD won 23.9% of votes, ahead of the hard-right Alliance for Uniting Romanians with 17.9%. Lasconi's centrist opposition Save Romania Union (USR) had 11.1%, while the junior ruling coalition ally Liberals had 14.6%. Two far-right groupings, SOS and POT, had 7.2% and 5.8%, respectively, and the ethnic Hungarian Party UDMR got 7%. After a campaign dominated by voters' concerns over budget problems and the cost of living, the election pitted the far-right contenders against pro-European mainstream parties that have angered their voters with infighting and corruption allegations. Far-right parties have also used Romania's championing of Ukraine to stoke fears the war could spill over the border unless the country halts its support, as well as resentment over alleged preferential treatment for refugees from Ukraine. Romania has the EU's biggest share of the population at risk of poverty, and swathes of the country need investment to attract jobs. 'I am not voting for any party which has been in parliament before. It is an elimination vote,' Marian Gheorghe, a cab driver, said. 'I have children, and I am tired of telling them 'No' because I can't afford what they need.' 'Where is the justice? Why are Romanian children less than Ukrainian children?' she asked. Social Democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu had ranked third in the presidential ballot first round. The PSD will meet on Monday to decide the terms under which it will negotiate a governing majority, PSD European MP Victor Negrescu said. 'The Social Democrats will take a few days and wait to be courted,' said political commentator Radu Magdin. 'A coalition with centrist parties is more likely than with the hot potato extremists. And much depends on who becomes president.' Who gets to form the government will depend on who wins the presidential election, since the president designates a prime minister, and the timeline for that is unclear. Romania's top court on Friday postponed a decision on whether to annul the first round of the presidential vote until Dec. 2, after the shock result caused suspicions of interference in the campaign. Romanian authorities say they have found evidence of meddling by hostile actors, and the Constitutional Court is yet to validate the results. The court has ordered a recount of the 9.46 million votes cast in the first round, while also considering a request to annul the first-round vote. If a rerun is decided, the first round of voting in the presidential election could take place on Dec. 15 and the runoff could be on Dec. 29.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-leftists-ahead-of-resurgent-far-right-in-election/7883667.html	2024-12-01T19:12:55-08:00	
Catholic church calls on president of El Salvador not to lift ban on gold mining	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — The Roman Catholic Church called on the president of El Salvador Sunday not to lift the country's ban on gold mining. Archbishop Jose Luis Escobar Alas asked President Nayib Bukele not to reverse the ban, which has been in place since 2017. 'It will damage this country forever,' Msgr. Escobar Alas said in a homily. That view has also been voiced by civic and environmental groups. On Wednesday, Bukele called the 7-year-old ban on metals mining 'absurd,' and claimed unmined gold would be 'wealth that could transform El Salvador,' in comments on the social platform X. Bukele's party controls El Salvador's Congress by a wide margin and his political opposition has been devastated, so a formal proposal to end the ban is unlikely to meet much resistance. In 2017, El Salvador banned all metals mining above ground and below. A broad coalition of sectors, including the Catholic church, supported the prohibition in order to protect the small country's water resources from contamination. At that point, exploration had revealed deposits of gold and silver, but there was no large-scale metal mining. It's unclear what its gold reserves could be. Bukele on Wednesday proposed 'modern and sustainable' mining that would care for the environment. Environmentalists quickly criticized the president's boosterism. 'It's not true that there's green mining, it's paid for with lives, kidney, respiratory problems and leukemia that aren't immediate,' said Amalia López with the Alliance Against the Privatization of Water. Their concerns include the amount of water needed for mining operations and the storage of water contaminated with heavy metals. It marks a reversal for the highly popular and recently reelected Bukele, who during his first campaign for the presidency in 2019 said he supported the mining ban.	https://www.voanews.com/a/catholic-church-calls-on-president-of-el-salvador-not-to-lift-ban-on-gold-mining/7883656.html	2024-12-01T18:39:23-08:00	
Ireland's incumbent parties look likely to hang on to power after a fractured election	DUBLIN — Ireland's two long-dominant center-right parties looked likely to form a new government as results came in Sunday from a fractured national election, though with a reduced vote share and complex coalition negotiations ahead. In an exception to the global anti-incumbent mood, outgoing governing parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael took the two largest shares of the vote, narrowly ahead of left-of-center opposition Sinn Fein. Under Ireland's system of proportional representation, vote share does not translate neatly into seats in parliament. With about two-thirds of results declared, Fianna Fail was on course to be the biggest party in the 174-seat Dáil, the lower house of parliament, with Fine Gael and Sinn Fein battling for second place. It's certain that no party will have enough seats to govern on its own, and the most likely outcome is a coalition between Fianna Fail, led by Micheál Martin, and Fine Gael under outgoing Prime Minister Simon Harris. In that case either Harris or Martin — or possibly both, if they strike a job-sharing deal — will become Ireland's next premier, known as the taoiseach. Sinn Fein, which aims to reunify the Republic of Ireland with the U.K. territory of Northern Ireland, lacks a clear path to power because the other two parties say they won't work with it, partly because of its historic ties with the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Ireland uses a complex system of proportional representation in which each of the country's 43 constituencies elects several lawmakers and voters rank candidates in order of preference. As a result, it can take days for full results to be known. 'The people of Ireland have now spoken,' Harris said. 'We now have to work out exactly what they have said, and that is going to take a little bit of time.' The cost of living — especially Ireland's acute housing crisis — was a dominant topic in the three-week campaign, alongside immigration, which has become an emotive and challenging issue in a country of 5.4 million people long defined by emigration. The results of Friday's election mean Ireland has partly bucked the global trend of incumbents being rejected by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures. The next government, like the last, will likely be led by two parties that have dominated Irish politics for the past century. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have similar policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland's 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat, they formed a coalition, propped up by the Green Party. The Greens had a devastating result, losing all but one of their 12 seats. This time, the winning parties may turn to left-leaning Labour or the Social Democrats, or to independent lawmakers, for support. For all the focus on migration, anti-immigration independents made few breakthroughs. Ireland does not have a significant far-right party to capitalize on the issue. Reelected Fine Gael lawmaker Paschal Donohoe said the main theme of the election was 'the center holding.' Nonetheless, the new government will face huge pressure to ease rising homelessness, driven by soaring rents and property prices, and to better absorb a growing number of asylum-seekers. The big parties' share of the vote continues to decline, and voter disaffection expressed itself in support for small parties and independent candidates. One of the more unorthodox independents was reputed organized crime boss Gerry 'the Monk' Hutch, who saw a groundswell of support after he was bailed on money-laundering charges in Spain in November in order to run for election. Hutch, who last year was acquitted of killing a gangland rival, came within a whisker of winning a seat in Dublin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ireland-s-incumbent-parties-look-likely-to-hang-on-to-power-after-a-fractured-election-/7883643.html	2024-12-01T18:26:06-08:00	
Big Ten fines Michigan and Ohio State $100,000 each for postgame melee	ROSEMONT, Ill. — The Big Ten Conference announced it fined Michigan and Ohio State $100,000 each for violating the conference's sportsmanship policy for the on-field melee at the end of the Wolverines' win in Columbus on Saturday. 'Not only did the actions of both teams violate fundamental elements of sportsmanship such as respect and civility, the nature of the incident also jeopardized the safety of participants and bystanders,' the Big Ten said in a statement Sunday. A fight broke out at midfield after the Wolverines' 13-10 victory when Michigan players attempted to plant their flag on the OSU logo and were confronted by the Buckeyes. Police used pepper spray to break up the players, who threw punches and shoves. One officer suffered a head injury when he was 'knocked down and trampled while trying to separate players fighting,' a police union official said. The officer was taken to a hospital and has since been released. After the Ohio State players confronted their rivals at midfield, defensive end Jack Sawyer grabbed the top of the Wolverines' flag and ripped it off the pole as the brawl moved toward the Michigan bench. 'We respect the Big Ten Conference's decision in this matter,' Ohio State said in a statement. 'What happened post-game yesterday was unfortunate. Good sportsmanship is always important in everything we do at Ohio State. Moving forward, we will continue to examine and address our post-game protocols to ensure our student-athletes, coaches, visiting teams and staff safely exit the field.' Ohio State police said in a statement that 'multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray.' Michigan players could be seen rubbing their eyes after exposure to the chemical irritant. Michigan coach Sherrone Moore said after the game both teams could have handled the situation differently. 'So much emotions on both sides,' he said. 'Rivalry games get heated, especially this one. It's the biggest one in the country, so we got to handle that better.' A Michigan athletic department spokesman said Sunday night the football program would have no comment beyond the team's remarks Saturday. The scuffle was one of many that broke out Saturday in rivalry games across the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/big-ten-fines-michigan-and-ohio-state-100-000-each-for-postgame-melee/7883647.html	2024-12-01T18:13:43-08:00	
Biden pardons his son Hunter despite previous pledges not to	Washington — President Joe Biden has pardoned his son Hunter sparing the younger Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversing his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family members. The Democratic president had previously said he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence after his convictions in the two cases in Delaware and California. The move comes weeks before Hunter Biden was set to receive his punishment after his trial conviction in the gun case and guilty plea on tax charges, and less than two months before President-elect Donald Trump is set to return to the White House. It caps a long-running legal saga for the president’s son, who publicly disclosed he was under federal investigation in December 2020 — a month after Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. In June, as Hunter Biden was facing trial in the gun case in Delaware, the president ruled out a pardon or clemency for his son in an interview with ABC News. As recently as Nov. 8, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre ruled out a pardon or clemency for the younger Biden, saying, 'We’ve been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-pardons-his-son-hunter-despite-previous-pledges-not-to/7883629.html	2024-12-01T16:52:09-08:00	
Wars, regional tensions boost sales for major arms suppliers	Stockholm — Sales by major arms suppliers were boosted last year by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and tensions in Asia, with marked increases for manufacturers based in Russia and the Middle East, according to a report published Monday. Sales of arms and military services by the world's 100 largest arms companies totaled $632 billion last year, up 4.2%, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said. They had declined in 2022 due to the inability of these global giants to meet the increase in demand, but many of them managed to restart their production in 2023, according to the report. As a sign of this strong surge in demand, these 100 companies, for the first time, all individually achieved a turnover of more than a billion dollars last year. 'There has been a marked increase in arms sales in 2023, and this trend is expected to continue in 2024,' Lorenzo Scarazzato, a researcher at SIPRI's program on military expenditure and arms production, was quoted as saying in a statement. Sales of the world's top 100 groups 'do not yet fully reflect the scale of demand and many companies have launched recruitment campaigns, showing their optimism for the future,' he adds. Smaller producers have been more efficient in meeting this new demand linked to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, growing tensions in East Asia and rearmament programs in other regions, SIPRI points out. 'Many of them specialize in one component or build systems that require a single supply chain,' allowing them to react more quickly, Nan Tian, director of the military spending program, told AFP. As the world's leading producers, American groups recorded a 2.5% increase in their sales in 2023 and still represent half of global arms revenues, with 41 American companies among the top 100 in the world. Lockheed Martin and RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies), the two largest arms groups in the world, recorded a drop in their sales. 'They often rely on complex, multi-tiered supply chains, making them vulnerable to the supply chain challenges that have persisted into 2023,' Nan Tian says. Bond of Russian Rostec Europe, with 27 groups, only posted a 0.2% increase in sales last year, which masks a dual reality. European groups manufacturing complex weapons systems were still working on old contracts last year, which does not reflect the influx of orders recorded since then. Other groups, on the other hand, 'saw their turnover increase substantially, driven by demand linked to the war in Ukraine', notably for munitions, artillery and air defense systems and land systems, writes SIPRI. The figures for Russia, although incomplete, show the effects of an economy largely geared toward war. Sales of the two Russian groups in the ranking showed a 40% increase, mainly due to the 49% increase in sales of the state conglomerate Rostec, according to SIPRI. Manufacturers in the Middle East were buoyed by the war in Ukraine and the first months of the Israeli offensive on Gaza in October 2023. The three Israeli manufacturers in the ranking posted record sales of $13.6 billion, while the three groups based in Turkey, such as drone producer Baykar, saw their sales jump by 24%, supported by the war in Ukraine and Turkey's desire to develop its defense. The general rearmament in Asia is particularly evident in the sales increases of the four South Korean manufacturers and the five Japanese weapons’ makers, with the nine Chinese producers marking time against a backdrop of a 'slow economy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/wars-regional-tensions-boost-sales-for-major-arms-suppliers/7883623.html	2024-12-01T16:32:49-08:00	
Trump appoints Lebanese American Massad Boulos as Middle East adviser	Washington — Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he had appointed American Lebanese businessman Massad Boulos, the father of one of his sons-in-law, as his Middle East adviser. 'Massad is a skilled negotiator and a steadfast advocate for PEACE in the Middle East. He will be a staunch defender of the United States and its interests,' Trump wrote on Truth Social, as the conflict between Israel and Hamas has been plaguing the region for more than a year. A longtime Republican, Boulos built his fortune selling automobiles in Nigeria. The 2022 marriage of his son Michael Boulos to Donald Trump’s daughter Tiffany propelled him into the newly elected billionaire’s inner circle. Boulos took an active part in the presidential campaign, working to convince the Arab community in some key states to vote for Trump. 'Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected business leader with extensive experience on the international stage,' the president-elect, who is due to take office on January 20, said. A Maronite Christian, Boulos had tried to get elected as a parliamentarian in Lebanon, without success. During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would end the conflict between Israel and Hamas, without ever revealing a plan to do so. Boulos had explained in October that he shared the same philosophy. Israel 'has military objectives to achieve, namely to get rid of Hamas' infrastructure and its capacity to launch new attacks,' he said in an interview with Sky News. But 'they have to do it very quickly. (...), It cannot last forever,' he added. His appointment comes days after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite Islamist movement allied with Hamas and Iran. This truce in Lebanon gives hope for progress in the Middle East to the administration of Joe Biden, still in power for a few weeks. In the wake of the Lebanon deal, the United States is 'actively' working toward a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Jake Sullivan, the current White House national security adviser, said Sunday. But 'we're not there yet,' he said. On Saturday, Trump also named Charles Kushner, the father of his other son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, as U.S. ambassador to France. An unusual choice for a diplomatic role: Kushner spent a year in federal prison for tax fraud before being pardoned by Trump toward the end of his first term in the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-appoints-lebanese-american-massad-boulos-as-middle-east-adviser/7883617.html	2024-12-01T16:21:05-08:00	
Art collection on 1930s Soviet-engineered famine gifted to Ukraine	The late American businessman Morgan Williams was deeply involved in promoting Ukrainian business as president of the US-Ukraine Business Council. During his time in Ukraine, Williams began collecting artwork related to the Holodomor, a famine engineered by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in the early 1930’s that killed millions. Now, all that artwork has a home. Hanna Tverdokhlib has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

Taiwan's president meets Hawaii's governor, others in visit China condemns	Honululu, Hawaii — On a two-day visit to Hawaii, Taiwan’s president Lai Ching-te met with the state's governor and congressional representatives as part of a Pacific island tour that has already triggered criticism from Beijing. On Sunday, China’s Foreign Ministry said it 'strongly condemned' U.S. support for Lai’s visit and had lodged a complaint with the U.S. It also denounced a newly announced U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as its own territory. 'China will closely monitor the situation’s development and take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,' said the statement. Hawaii was Lai's first stop on a weeklong voyage that will later take him to the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau. They account for three of the 12 countries Taipei has formal diplomatic relations with. Hawaii's Gov. Josh Green on Saturday hosted Lai at the state's emergency management agency where they discussed disaster preparedness. Green, who was a longtime emergency room physician before becoming governor, posted on social media that he and Lai discussed how their experiences in health care informed their governance. Lai is also a physician by training and obtained a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University. 'Together, we extended a warm aloha to Lai and his delegation, highlighting Hawai'i’s shared values of resilience and collaboration with Taiwan,' Green said in an Instagram post. Lai also visited Bishop Museum, Hawaii’s leading museum of natural history and Native Hawaiian culture. In the evening, Lai posed for photos with Hawaii congressional representatives and state lawmakers at a dinner banquet with the Taiwanese American community. U.S. Rep. Ed Case, a Democrat who represents Honolulu in Congress, said on social media that he told the audience that 'our ties endured on shared values and interests to advance mutual goals and meet shared challenges.' It is unclear whether Lai with meet with any senior officials from the Biden administration or anyone from the incoming Trump administration during his Hawaii stay. President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S. Trump evaded answering whether he would defend the island from Chinese military action. The new arms deal announced by the U.S. State Department Friday includes $385 million in spare parts and equipment for a fleet of F-16s, as well as support for a tactical communication system to Taiwan. The U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act but maintains a position of strategic ambiguity over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by China. Former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen drew vocal opposition from China when she stopped in New York last year on her way to Latin America. Tsai met with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the time. The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a 'stern warning' over what it called collusion between 'separatists and foreign forces' days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped over in the U.S. China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting the island as it views any official contact with foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-president-meets-hawaii-s-governor-others-in-visit-china-condemns/7883373.html	2024-12-01T15:04:48-08:00	
Biden has AIDS Memorial Quilt at White House, observing World AIDS Day	Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday had the AIDS Memorial Quilt spread on the White House South Lawn for the first time in observance of World AIDS Day. Gathered with the president and his wife, Jill, were survivors, family members and advocates to memorialize the lives lost to the epidemic. The president emphasized the federal government's support for the 1.2 million people in the United States living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can lead to AIDS. 'This movement is fully woven into the fabric and history of America,' Biden said. 'For all the lives lost, for all those that are still alive, look at what you’ve already done to change the hearts and minds, to save lives across the country and around the world. That's the power of this movement.' There were 124 sections of the quilt on the lawn to commemorate people who died due to AIDS-related illnesses. Conceived in 1985, the quilt made its first public appearance in 1987. There was also a red ribbon, a symbol of support and awareness for those with HIV and AIDS, draped across the South Portico of the White House. There are 40 million people around the world with HIV, according to the White House. Introducing Biden was Jeanne White-Ginder, whose son, Ryan White, contracted AIDS through a tainted blood transfusion at the age of 13 and died in 1990 at the age of 18. She said her son's experience taught America that 'we needed to fight AIDS and not the people who have it.' The Ryan White CARE Act became law in 1990, and White-Grinder recalled being at the U.S. Capitol to speak for the measure and met Biden when he was a senator from Delaware. The president also saluted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert until leaving the government in 2022, Fauci was in attendance at the event as he worked to treat AIDS, though he's known by much of the country for his efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic that made him a target of criticism by many Republican lawmakers. The Biden administration has sought to make investments to stop the epidemic, and the stigmas attached to people with HIV. Among other steps, it has worked to expand access to PrEP, or the pre-exposure prophylaxis, which at-risk populations use to prevent HIV infections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-has-aids-memorial-quilt-at-white-house-observing-world-aids-day/7883367.html	2024-12-01T14:37:28-08:00	
Bus crash near French ski resort kills 2 people, injures 33	Madrid — A bus crashed Sunday evening near a ski resort in southern France, killing at least two people and injuring 33 others, local authorities said. A total of 47 people including the driver were on the bus when it crashed near the Porte-Puymorens ski resort, the regional administration said. Seven people were in critical condition. Local authorities said a preliminary investigation showed the bus ran into a cliff, but the exact circumstances that may have resulted in such a collision were not immediately clear. Images released by the local firefighter service showed the bus pressed against the side of a cliff, its right side partially crushed, and the windshield was apparently knocked out. More than 120 individuals were involved in the high-altitude rescue effort, including from neighboring Catalonia in Spain and Andorra. Four rescue helicopters were also deployed to the accident scene some 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) in the French Pyrenees mountains. Catalonia's emergency services said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that the bus originated from L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, outside Barcelona, Spain. A holiday center in Porte-Puymorens resort was opened to house the surviving passengers. The local ski resort has not opened yet because of a lack of snow. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bus-crash-near-french-ski-resort-porte-puymorens/7883364.html	2024-12-01T14:24:56-08:00	
Trump nominates former aide Kash Patel to head FBI	Donald Trump’s nomination of Kash Patel, a loyalist of the U.S. president-elect, to be director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has added to the list of Trump’s unconventional appointments to top-level jobs in his nascent administration. Trump named Patel, 44, to lead the country’s top criminal investigative agency on late Saturday, saying he 'is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American people.' Patel held three defense, intelligence and national security posts in the first Trump administration but has endeared himself to the incoming chief executive by vowing to clean out the 'deep state' at the FBI. He also said he would launch a campaign of retribution against Trump’s adversaries, including FBI agents who have investigated the once-and-future president, journalists and others. During his first term, Trump suggested naming Patel as the deputy FBI director, but then-Attorney General William Barr, now a Trump critic, said the appointment would only occur 'over my dead body.' Patel has vowed to close the FBI headquarters in Washington and dispatch many of its agents across the country to fight crime, not launch more intelligence-gathering operations. Trump’s first hurdle in installing Patel as the FBI director is that there already is an FBI director, Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump and whose 10-year term extends to 2027. Trump would have to fire Wray or Wray would have to resign before Patel could take over. FBI directors are appointed to decade-long terms by design, so that their tenures and investigative directives are not subject to the political whims of the moment. But Trump already fired one FBI director, James Comey, in 2017, before naming Wray. Trump says the FBI is 'badly broken' and has 'lost the confidence of America.' Patel faces a Senate confirmation hearing and is likely to face tough questioning about how he would run the agency and oversee its more than 10,000 criminal investigative agents and another 25,000 staff members. Patel’s appointment comes on top of other unconventional Trump appointments: vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to oversee the health and human services department, talk show host Pete Hegseth, a decorated military officer with scant managerial experience, to be the Pentagon chief, and Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic-congresswoman-turned-staunch-Trump-defender, as director of national intelligence. Trump’s first nominee to be attorney general, former Congressman Matt Gaetz, dropped out after eight days as he faced widespread scrutiny of his alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use; charges Gaetz has denied. Some Republican senators praised Patel’s appointment. Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate next year, meaning Patel could lose the support of three senators and still be confirmed, with Vice President-elect JD Vance casting the decisive tie-breaking vote if needed. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that Patel 'represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI. ... The entire agency needs to be cleaned out.' 'There are serious problems at the FBI,' Hagerty said. 'The American public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change, and Kash Patel's just the type of person to do it.' Another Republican senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, said Patel was a 'very strong nominee' and he thought Patel would be confirmed. 'All of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI,' Cruz told CBS' 'Face the Nation.' A third Republican, Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said, 'Every president wants people that are loyal to themselves.' But he called Wray 'a very good man,' adding, 'I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now.' Democrats are almost certain to oppose the nomination. Senator Chris Murphy told NBC, 'Patel's only qualification is that he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should punish, lock up and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents.' Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-nominates-former-aide-kash-patel-to-head-fbi/7883356.html	2024-12-01T14:06:38-08:00	
Landmark climate change case to open at top UN court	The Hague — The top United Nations court will take up the largest case in its history Monday, when it opens two weeks of hearings into what countries worldwide are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact. After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on 'the obligations of States in respect of climate change.' 'We want the court to confirm that the conduct that has wrecked the climate is unlawful,' Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is leading the legal team for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Associated Press. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis. 'We live on the front lines of climate change impact. We are witnesses to the destruction of our lands, our livelihoods, our culture and our human rights,' Vanuatu’s climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told reporters ahead of the hearing. Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, advocacy groups will bring together environmental organizations from around the world. Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change — who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion — together with World Youth for Climate Justice plan an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions. From Monday, the Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It’s the largest lineup in the institution’s nearly 80-year history. Last month at the United Nations’ annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed. 'For our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world’s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,' Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, told reporters in a briefing. Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? The second question refers to 'small island developing States' likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to 'members of 'the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change.' The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.’s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings. The case at the ICJ follows a number of rulings around the world ordering governments to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In May, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution, and countries must take steps to adapt to and mitigate their adverse effects. That ruling came a month after Europe’s highest human rights court said that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change, in a landmark judgment that could have implications across the continent. The ICJ’s host country of The Netherlands made history when a court ruled in 2015 that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change is a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. The judgment was upheld in 2019 by the Dutch Supreme Court.	https://www.voanews.com/a/landmark-climate-change-case-to-open-at-top-un-court/7883344.html	2024-12-01T13:21:20-08:00	
Moana 2' has record $221 million opening, Hollywood celebrates moviegoing feast	New York — Christmas came early at the box office this year. 'Moana 2' brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, setting records with $221 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. That, combined with 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II,' made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas and a confluence of blockbusters more like what’s often found in late December. Expectations were high for Walt Disney Co.’s 'Moana 2,' but the film — originally planned as a series for Disney+ before it was redirected to the big screen — blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was $125 million for 'Frozen 2' in its second week of release in 2019.) 'Moana 2' added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million worldwide, it's the second-best global launch of the year. At the same time, the sensation of 'Wicked' showed no signs of slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2 million. Not accounting for inflation, 'Wicked' is now the highest grossing Broadway adaptation over 'Grease.' (That 1978 film grossed $190 million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.) 'Gladiator II,' meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its opening weekend. Ridley Scott’s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging, 'Gladiator II' has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide. Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420 million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to Comscore — more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that showed the still-potent power of Hollywood’s blockbuster machine. Before 'Wicked,' 'Moana 2' and 'Gladiator II' arrived in theaters, ticket sales were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels. Michael O’Leary, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theater Owners, said the weekend showed what’s possible when 'all the pieces of the puzzle come together' in compelling big-budget movies with marketing muscle. 'We’re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we believe is a full-on charge into the future,' he said. 'The remaining quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and 2026. We’re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this industry has had in a long time.' Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release calendar — 2023's much-ballyhooed 'Barbenheimer' — the movie industry again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, 'Venom: The Last Dance,' for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks, despite not being particularly successful. 'For a long, long time in Hollywood, there’s been a belief that you don’t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,' said O'Leary. 'But the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It’s good for the movies. It’s good for the studios. It’s good for the theater owners. But it’s particularly good for the moviegoing public.' 'Moana 2' was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance between theatrical and streaming. The original 'Moana,' after all, was the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of $680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger announce the release of 'Moana 2,' with Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui. 'It just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,' says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. 'Whoever made that decision to go big screen globally with ‘Moana 2,' that was one of the greatest decisions ever.' And it helped lead a resurgence for Walt Disney Co., whose last two animated November releases — 'Strange World' and 'Wish' — fizzled in theaters. 'Moana 2' may become the third $1 billion-grossing movie for the studio in 2024, along with 'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' Though reviews for 'Moana 2' have only been 65% 'fresh' on Rotten Tomatoes, audiences gave it an 'A-' CinemaScore. 'Moana 2' is also part of a major rebound for family moviegoing. According to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, family moviegoing in 2024 is going to account for approximately $6.8 billion in ticket sales, roughly the sums of 2022 and 2023, combined. After such large debuts, 'Moana 2' and 'Wicked' are likely to continue to drive moviegoing through December. The only question will be if this year's Christmas movies — historically a much bigger holiday period for theaters — can come anywhere near the Thanksgiving lineup. Among the movies aiming for that holiday corridor are Disney's 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' Paramount's 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' and Searchlight's 'A Complete Unknown,' with Timothee Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Moana 2,' $135 million. 2. 'Wicked,' $80 million. 3. 'Gladiator II' $30.7 million. 4. 'Red One,' $12.9 million. 5. 'The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,' $3.3 million. 6. 'Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin,' $2.4 million. 7. 'Venom: The Last Dance,' $2.2 million. 8. 'Heretic,' $956,797. 9. 'The Wild Robot,' $670,000. 10. 'A Real Pain,' $665,000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moana-2-has-record-221-million-opening-hollywood-celebrates-moviegoing-feast-/7883326.html	2024-12-01T12:32:38-08:00	
Storm Bora floods homes, streets in Greek island of Rhodes	Athens, Greece — Torrential rains flooded homes, businesses and roads in the popular Greek tourist island of Rhodes on Sunday, forcing authorities to temporarily ban the use of vehicles as Storm Bora pounded the country for a second day. On Saturday, a man died in flash floods which hit another Greek island in the northern Aegean. The fire service received more than 650 calls to pump water out of flooded buildings on Rhodes island and evacuated 80 people to safer ground, with the city of Ialysos hit the hardest. No injuries were reported. Cars and debris were piled up high in the flooded streets of Rhodes, with residents trying to remove mud from their water-logged properties. 'The situation is tragic, some have lost their homes, some have fled, our cars are in a terrible condition,' said Sofia Kanelli in Ialysos. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis told Greece's SKAI TV that the bad weather would continue Monday. The Mediterranean country has been ravaged by floods and wildfires in recent years, with scientists saying that Greece has become a 'hot spot' for climate change. 'The conditions in recent years are different; we have sudden rainfall and sudden floods,' Varthakogiannis said. In 2023, more than 20,000 tourists and locals were forced to flee homes and seaside hotels as wildfires burned for days. Thunderstorms and heavy rain also interrupted train services in mainland Greece, especially in the center and north of the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-bora-floods-homes-streets-in-greek-island-of-rhodes/7883303.html	2024-12-01T11:37:42-08:00	
Mali says army drone strike killed senior rebel commander, others	Bamako, Mali — Mali's government said Sunday it had killed a senior Tuareg rebel commander and other rebels in a drone strike on a town in the north of the country. A Reuters journalist in Tinzaouaten on the border with Algeria witnessed the strike on the town, which is under the control of a rebel coalition known as the Permanent Strategic Framework for the Defense of the People of Azawad (CSP-DPA). Tuareg factions had been meeting in Tinzaouaten this week to form a unified political and military structure. 'Several CSP cadres were killed, including the notorious Fahad Ag Almahmoud,' Chodi Ag, a mission manager at Mali's communications ministry, said in a post on Facebook. Separatist groups from northern Mali, largely dominated by ethnic Tuaregs, launched a rebellion against the government in 2012, which was later subsumed into an insurgency by Islamist groups linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State. A 2015 peace agreement between the government and rebels collapsed in July this year and triggered renewed fighting, including a fierce battle around Tinzaouaten that killed dozens of Malian soldiers and Russian Wagner mercenaries. Almahmoud was a key member of the CSP alliance. He ensured coordination between its factions and represented them in discussions with authorities about the peace agreement. A military source who did not wish to be identified said strikes on Tinzaouaten had killed Almahmoud and other 'terrorist leaders.' The army has not officially commented on the attack. Multiple drone strikes since the July conflict have killed dozens of civilians in Tinzaouaten, including children, doctors and residents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-says-army-drone-strike-killed-senior-rebel-commander-others/7883298.html	2024-12-01T11:29:17-08:00	
Heavy snow and numbing temperatures keep parts of the US in deep freeze	LOWVILLE, N.Y. — Heavy snowfall and numbing temperatures kept parts of the U.S. in a deep freeze Sunday as the Thanksgiving holiday weekend draws to a close. Despite the Arctic-type weather, however, snowmobilers and skiers are reveling in their respective wintry terrains, and weather forecasters gave possible good news ahead of the NFL game in Buffalo. In the remote Tug Hill region of upstate New York, where lake-effect snow off Lake Ontario can dump several centimeters of snow at a time, there was up to 117 centimeters in the Barnes Corners area. 'We just keep digging out,' Kevin Tyo, a local businessman, said Sunday. 'We were out all day yesterday, plowing.' Like many locals, he has a plow attached to the front of his truck for much of the winter, 'and I have a tractor with a bucket, and a snowblower.' His advice? 'If you’re not used to it, stay home. If you’re out, slow down.' Buffalo Bills kickoff set for Sunday night In Buffalo, officials with the NFL’s Bills had sought stadium snow shovelers for the season, including ahead of Sunday night’s game against the San Francisco 49ers. The team said it would pay $20 per hour and provide food and hot drinks. A lake-effect storm began hitting the area Saturday near the Bills’ stadium in Orchard Park, New York. Snow was continuing to fall near the stadium just hours ahead of the game, according to the State Weather Risk Communication Center in New York. 'Snowfall totals will be highly dependent on whether the current lake effect snow shifts just south of the stadium, or remains in place over the stadium longer,' the center said in a post on the social media site X. Some motorists stuck for hours along New York-Pennsylvania border Christine Schintzius, her 4- and 8-year-old sons and 12- and 15-year-old nieces had set out on clear roads Friday from Wales, New York, southeast of Buffalo. The family planned to attend a travel hockey tournament in Cleveland but instead found themselves snowbound for 19 hours, stuck inside Schintzius' Honda Pilot. The family ran into seemingly endless lines of stopped traffic, first on Interstate 90 near the New York-Pennsylvania border for 9 hours, and again on Route 5 in Pennsylvania for 10 hours, until being plowed out by some residents. 'There were lines and lines of cars. It was packed, there was tons of people, tons,' Schintzius said by phone Sunday. While stuck on Route 5, Schintzius never turned off her car, afraid it wouldn’t start again in the frigid cold. Two truckers stopped to check on them during the night. In the morning the police checked in, along with a local resident who walked the line of cars with a basket of muffins, handing them out and making sure the stranded drivers had water. 'Thankfully, all of my kids, my nieces, all travel well,' said Schintzius, who had packed a cooler with lunch meats, snacks, yogurt and fruit. 'And luckily I had still basically a full tank of gas.' When they were finally free of the backup Saturday, Schintzius turned around and took a roundabout route home, avoiding the worst of the snow that was still falling. 'We went completely around the storm because I was worried, like I’m not getting stuck in that ever again,' she said. Arctic air late last week brings bitter temperatures A blast of Arctic air late last week brought bitter temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 degrees Celsius to minus 7 degrees Celsius) below average to the Northern Plains, the National Weather Service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the U.S. by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees (minus 12 degrees Celsius) below average. Officials in Erie, Pennsylvania, said Sunday that the heavy lake-effect snow has produced 'treacherous' conditions that are causing even snowplows to get stuck as they work around the clock to try to clear city roads. The city estimated Sunday morning that there were 'about 100 cars throughout the city that are blocking roads and need to be towed out of the way so plows can get through.' Commercial vehicles remained banned in both directions of I-90 in western New York along a nearly 216-kilometer stretch to the Pennsylvania line. The National Weather Service said lake-effect snow was expected to continue east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on Sunday, with additional snowfall of 30 to 60 centimeters possible. New York, Pennsylvania declare emergencies In a phone interview Saturday with WWNY-TV, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state prepared for the storm for days by deploying snowplows and thousands of workers and consulting with utility providers. She also dispatched personnel from other parts of the state to assist. 'I know it’s something they’re all accustomed to and they can handle, but I want to let them know we are there with reinforcements and to make sure everyone can travel safely, especially over this really busy holiday weekend,' she said. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency proclamation Saturday and said parts of Erie County in the northwest received nearly 61 centimeters of snow with more expected through Monday night. Pennsylvania State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said. Authorities closed part of I-90 in Pennsylvania and westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania. Michigan battered by lake-effect snow Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow rolling off Lake Superior buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 61 centimeters or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Marquette, Michigan. Motorists were warned of potentially dangerous road conditions for holiday travel on Sunday. 'Expect rapid changes in traveling conditions in and out of snow bands, including snow covered, slick roads, and reduced visibility,' the National Weather Service said Sunday. There were 69 centimeters of snow just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula’s western reaches, and another 61 centimeters in Munising, in the eastern area. Lake-effect snow could add more than 30.5 centimeters over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 15 to 25 centimeters or higher to the west, Chapman said Saturday. Gaylord, Michigan, received 63 centimeters of snow Friday, setting a new single-day record for the city in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger of the weather service’s Gaylord office. The previous record of 43 centimeters was set March 9, 1942. Joseph Delizio, a weather service meteorologist based in Gaylord, said heavy snow, especially lake-effect snow, isn’t unusual this time year, 'but that magnitude certainly is not.' 'We’ve got more snow in the forecast, believe it or not,' he added. The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 32 hectares of ski hill terrain among its 809 hectares. It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will increase before the resort's season opening next weekend, Recreation Director Doug Hoeh said. 'Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it’s great for the snow hills, but it’s bad for the parking lots, so we’re kind of digging out,' Hoeh said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-snow-and-numbing-temperatures-keep-parts-of-the-us-in-deep-freeze/7883288.html	2024-12-01T10:57:16-08:00	
Israel-Hamas ceasefire now ‘more likely,’ US security official says	The chance for an end to more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the release of about 100 hostages held by the militants is now 'more likely' because of last week’s ceasefire reached by Israel with Hezbollah in Lebanon, a top U.S. national security official said Sunday. The U.S. and other negotiators 'may have a chance' to end 14 months of fighting in Gaza, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show but declined to make a prediction, 'because we’ve come close before.' Israel’s mostly ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, said Sunday, 'There are negotiations taking place behind the scenes, and it can be done.' Sullivan told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' show, 'We are engaged deeply with the key players in the region, and there is activity even today. There will be further conversations and consultations, and our hope is that we can generate a ceasefire and hostage deal, but we're not there yet.' Sullivan spoke a day after Hamas released a videotape of one of the hostages, Israeli American Edan Alexander. Speaking under duress, Alexander blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, saying, 'The prime minister is supposed to protect his soldiers and citizens, and you abandoned us.' Sullivan said the video was 'a cruel reminder of Hamas' brutality and of the fact that they are holding so many hostages from so many countries.' Hamas triggered the war with Israel, killing about 1,200 people and capturing 250 hostages in the attack 14 months ago. Israel says that about a third of the remaining 100 or so hostages are believed to be dead. In its counteroffensive, Israel has killed more than 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel, without providing evidence, says it has killed more than 17,000 militants. Sullivan called the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, which has largely been holding steady, 'a huge step forward in the Middle East … the opportunity for people to ultimately be able to return to their homes in Israel and in Lebanon.' He said the United States, France and other allies 'are going to work together with the Lebanese Armed Forces through a mechanism to ensure that the ceasefire is implemented effectively. Our goal is to get through these first few days, critical days of a ceasefire, when it's most fragile, have it take full hold, and then ultimately build on it so that it becomes the permanent ceasefire it's intended to be.' Whether the Israel-Hezbollah pact translates into a ceasefire in Gaza remains uncertain. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent much of the past year trying to broker a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages. But the talks have been stalemated, with Israel rejecting Hamas' demand for a complete withdrawal from the territory and Israel demanding that any vestige of Hamas control in the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea be erased. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East, without saying how, and pushed Israel to end its fight against Hamas before he takes office January 20. Trump, like Biden, has been a staunch defender of Israel’s prerogative to defend itself. On the Gaza war front, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said Sunday it is halting aid deliveries through the main cargo crossing into Gaza because of the threat of armed gangs who have looted recent convoys. It blamed the breakdown of law and order on Israeli policies. Israel had no immediate comment. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, the main aid provider in Gaza, said the route leading to the Kerem Shalom crossing is too dangerous on the Gaza side. Armed men looted nearly 100 trucks traveling on the route in mid-November, and he said gangs stole a smaller shipment Saturday. Kerem Shalom is the only crossing between Israel and Gaza that is designed for cargo shipments and has been the main artery for aid deliveries since the Rafah crossing with Egypt was shut down in May. Last month, nearly two-thirds of all aid entering Gaza came through Kerem Shalom, and in previous months it accounted for an even larger amount, according to Israeli figures. In a post on X, Lazzarini largely blamed Israel for the breakdown of humanitarian operations in Gaza, citing 'political decisions to restrict the amounts of aid,' lack of safety on aid routes and Israel's targeting of the Hamas-run police force, which had previously provided public security. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least six people overnight, including two young children, ages 6 and 8, in the tent where their family was sheltering, medical officials said Sunday. The strike in the Muwasi area, a sprawling tent camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people, also wounded the children's mother and their 8-month-old sister, according to Nasser Hospital. In still another Mideast conflict, the Syrian military rushed in reinforcements to push back insurgents from advancing farther after they seized Aleppo in a surprise offensive. The insurgents look over most of the Syrian city Saturday and claimed to have entered the city of Hama. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is traveling to the Syrian capital Damascus later Sunday. He told reporters that Tehran will back the Syrian government and army. The swift insurgent offensive is an embarrassment for Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and comes at a time when his allies — Iran and its militant groups and Russia — are preoccupied with their own conflicts. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-hamas-ceasefire-now-more-likely-us-security-official-says/7883274.html	2024-12-01T10:43:40-08:00	
LA’s sanctuary city ordinance gives hope to city’s undocumented immigrants	Los Angeles has approved a so-called sanctuary city ordinance. It’s a response to President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations when he assumes the presidency in January. The ordinance won’t stop federal officials from deporting undocumented immigrants, but it reinforces the city’s vow to protect its immigrant population. Angelina Bagdasaryan has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

US will not return nuclear weapons to Ukraine	The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear weapons it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday. Sullivan made his remarks when questioned about a New York Times article last month that said some unidentified Western officials had suggested U.S. President Joe Biden could give Ukraine the arms before he leaves office. 'That is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not [giving them] nuclear capability,' he told ABC. Last week, Russia said the idea was 'absolute insanity' and that preventing such a scenario was one of the reasons why Moscow sent troops into Ukraine. Kyiv inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United States and Britain.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-not-return-nuclear-weapons-to-ukraine-/7883247.html	2024-12-01T09:57:50-08:00	
Over 40 people hospitalized in Georgia during protests over suspension of EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia — A third night of protests in the Georgian capital against the government's decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union left 44 people hospitalized, officials said Sunday. Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the parliament Saturday night, throwing stones and setting off fireworks, while police deployed water cannons and tear gas. An effigy of the founder of the governing Georgian Dream party, Bidzina Ivanishvili — a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — was burned in front of the legislature. Georgia's Interior Ministry said Sunday that 27 protesters, 16 police and one media worker were hospitalized. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze warned that 'any violation of the law will be met with the full rigor of the law.' 'Neither will those politicians who hide in their offices and sacrifice members of their violent groups to severe punishment escape responsibility,' he said at a briefing Sunday. He insisted it wasn't true that Georgia's European integration had been halted. 'The only thing we have rejected is the shameful and offensive blackmail, which was, in fact, a significant obstacle to our country's European integration.' The government's announcement came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing last month's general election in Georgia as neither free nor fair. Kobakhidze also dismissed the U.S. State Department's statement Saturday that it was suspending its strategic partnership with Georgia. The statement condemned Georgia's decision to halt its efforts toward EU accession. 'You can see that the outgoing administration is trying to leave the new administration with as difficult a legacy as possible. They are doing this regarding Ukraine, and now also concerning Georgia,' Kobakhidze said. 'This will not have any fundamental significance. We will wait for the new administration and discuss everything with them.' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and enlargement commissioner Marta Kos released a joint statement Sunday on the Georgian government's decision to suspend negotiations. 'We note that this announcement marks a shift from the policies of all previous Georgian governments and the European aspirations of the vast majority of the Georgian people, as enshrined in the Constitution of Georgia,' the statement said. It reiterated the EU's 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country' and urged Georgian authorities to 'respect the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, and refrain from using force against peaceful protesters, politicians and media representatives.' The ruling Georgian Dream party's disputed victory in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia's aspirations to join the EU, has sparked major demonstrations and led to an opposition boycott of parliament. The opposition has said that the vote was rigged with the help of Russia, Georgia's former imperial master, with Moscow hoping to keep Tbilisi in its orbit. Speaking to The Associated Press on Saturday, Georgia's pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili said that her country was becoming a 'quasi-Russian' state and that Georgian Dream controlled the major institutions. 'We are not demanding a revolution. We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again,' Zourabichvili said. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc's recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-40-people-hospitalized-in-georgia-during-protests-over-suspension-of-eu-talks-/7883123.html	2024-12-01T07:02:12-08:00	
Thousands march in Serbia to mark 1 month since roof collapse killed 15 people	NOVI SAD, Serbia — Thousands joined a protest march on Sunday in the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad that marked one month since a concrete canopy outside of the city's railway station collapsed, killing 15 people and injuring two. Protesters held a huge banner with a red handprint at the front of the column — a message for the populist authorities that they have blood on their hands. Participants later left the same symbolic message on the pavement at the main square in Novi Sad while also painting much of the square red. Street protests and blockades have been held almost daily since the Nov. 1 roof collapse, demanding accountability after tons of concrete fell on people sitting or walking below on a sunny day. The railway station building was renovated twice in recent years. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption and opaque deals resulted in sloppy work and led to the collapse of the roof. While prosecutors have announced the arrests of 13 people, a Serbian court has since released from detention former government construction minister Goran Vesic. This has fueled widespread skepticism of the ongoing investigation, as the populists control both the police and judiciary. The march on Sunday in Novi Sad was held in silence and passed peacefully, unlike some traffic blockades in past weeks when pro-government supporters have sought to disrupt the gatherings and scuffled with the protesters. Scuffles have also erupted in Serbia's parliament between the ruling party and opposition lawmakers. The protests are seen as a challenge for Serbia's authoritarian President Aleksandar Vucic, whose populist government holds firm control over the mainstream media and institutions. Vucic on Sunday defended his supporters' appearance at the opposition-led traffic blockades. Vucic said halting traffic presented the 'ultimate violence' against citizens. Opposition parties are demanding the resignation of Serbia's prime minister and his government, as well as access to full documentation on the train station building and other infrastructure projects carried out in conjunction with Chinese state companies. The station in Novi Sad was originally built in 1964. Its renovation was part of a bigger project with China and Hungary to build a high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-march-in-serbia-to-mark-1-month-since-roof-collapse-killed-15-people/7883125.html	2024-12-01T07:01:52-08:00	
Social democrats gain and incumbents are punished in Iceland's election	REYKJAVIK, Iceland — Voters in Iceland joined a global trend of punishing incumbents in a parliamentary election, with a center-left party winning the largest share of votes in the North Atlantic island nation. With all the votes tallied on Sunday, the Social Democratic Alliance had won 15 seats in the 63-seat parliament, the Althingi — more than doubling its total — and secured almost 21% of votes, according to national broadcaster RUV. The conservative Independence Party, which led the outgoing government, had 14 seats and a 19.4% vote share, and the centrist Liberal Reform Party 11 seats and about 16% of votes. Three other parties also won seats. Social Democrat leader Kristrún Mjöll Frostadóttir, 36, will likely try to seek coalition partners to command a parliamentary majority. Icelanders voted Saturday after disagreements over immigration, energy policy and the economy forced Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson to pull the plug on his coalition government and call an early election. Counting was delayed in some areas by snowstorms that blocked roads and slowed delivery of ballot boxes to count centers. Since the 2008 financial crisis devastated the economy and ushered in a new era of political instability, Iceland has been governed by multi-party coalitions of various hues. Like many Western countries, Iceland has been buffeted by the rising cost of living and immigration pressures, and voters are taking it out on incumbent governments. Benediktsson's Independence Party and its coalition partners in the outgoing government, the Progressive Party and the Left Greens, all saw their vote share and seat count decline, with the Left Greens losing all eight of its parliamentary seats. Iceland, a volcanic island nation tucked below the Arctic Circle with a population of less than 400,000, is proud of its democratic traditions. The Althingi, founded in 930 by Viking settlers, is arguably the world's oldest legislature. Election turnout was high by international standards, with 80% of registered voters casting ballots.	https://www.voanews.com/a/social-democrats-gain-and-incumbents-are-punished-in-iceland-s-election/7883108.html	2024-12-01T06:38:50-08:00	
Taliban: Afghanistan must participate in future climate talks	Kabul — An Afghan environment official on Sunday said the country must be allowed to participate in future global climate talks, after returning from COP29 in Baku where Taliban officials attended for the first time. The Afghan delegation were invited as 'guests' of the Azerbaijani hosts, not as a party directly involved in the negotiations. It was the first time that an Afghan delegation had attended since the Taliban swept to power in August 2021, having failed to get an invite to the past two COPs (Conference of the Parties) held in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. 'Afghanistan must participate in such conferences in the future,' said Matiul Haq Khalis, the director general of Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency, at a press conference on Sunday. He described Afghanistan's attendance last month at the talks as a 'big achievement.' 'We participated in the conference this year so that we could raise the voice of the nation about the issues we are facing, what the needs of the people are, we must share these things with the world.' He said the Afghan delegation had meetings with '19 different organizations and governments,' including with delegations from Russia, Qatar, Azerbaijan and Bangladesh. Afghanistan is among the countries most vulnerable to global warming, despite minimal emissions, and the Taliban government have argued that their political isolation should not bar them from international climate talks. The government has imposed an austere version of sharia Islamic law since taking power, severely restricting women's participation in public life in what the United Nations has called a 'gender apartheid.' Among the poorest countries in the world after decades of war, Afghanistan is particularly exposed to the effects of climate change, which scientists say is spurring extreme weather including prolonged drought, frequent floods, and declining agricultural productivity. The United Nations has also called for action to help Afghanistan build resilience and for the country's participation in international talks. Developed countries have committed to providing $100 billion per year in climate finance through 2025 to help developing nations prepare for worsening climate impacts and wean their economies off fossil fuels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-afghanistan-must-participate-in-future-climate-talks/7883017.html	2024-12-01T04:13:44-08:00	
UN to halt aid deliveries through main Gaza crossing, says route is too dangerous	DEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA STRIP — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Sunday it is halting aid deliveries through the main cargo crossing into Gaza because of the threat of armed gangs who have looted recent convoys. The decision could worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as the cold, rainy winter sets in, with hundreds of thousands of people living in squalid tent camps and reliant on international food aid. Experts were already warning of famine in the territory's north, which Israeli forces have almost completely isolated since early October. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the main aid provider in Gaza, said the route leading to the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel is too dangerous on the Gaza side. Armed men looted nearly 100 trucks traveling on the route in mid-November, and he said gangs stole a smaller shipment on Saturday. Israeli strikes kill at least 6 people, including children Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip killed at least six people overnight, including two young children who died in the tent where their family was sheltering, medical officials said Sunday. The strike in the Muwasi area, a sprawling tent camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people, also wounded the children's mother and their sibling, according to the nearby Nasser Hospital. An Associated Press reporter at the hospital saw the bodies. A separate strike in the southern city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, killed four men, according to hospital records. The Israeli military said it was not aware of strikes in either location. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its daily strikes across Gaza often kill women and children. In a separate development, a projectile fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen set off air raid sirens in central Israel. The Israeli military said it intercepted the projectile before it entered Israeli territory. Former defense minister accuses Israel of war crimes A former top Israeli general and defense minister has accused the government of ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, where Israeli forces have been waging the latest in a series of offensives against Hamas since early October. The army has sealed off the northern towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, and the Jabaliya refugee camp, and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter. Tens of thousands of people have fled, while the United Nations estimates up to 75,000 remain and experts have warned of famine. Moshe Yaalon, who served as defense minister under Benjamin Netanyahu before quitting in 2016 and emerging as a fierce critic of the prime minister, said the current far-right government is determined to 'occupy, to annex, to ethnically cleanse.' Pressed by an interviewer with a local news outlet on Saturday, he said: 'There is no Beit Lahiya. No Beit Hanoun. [They are] operating now in Jabaliya, and [they] are actually cleaning the territory of Arabs.' Yaalon doubled down on the remarks Sunday in an interview with Israeli radio, saying 'war crimes are being committed here.' Netanyahu's Likud party criticized his earlier remarks, accusing him of making 'false statements' that are 'a prize for the International Criminal Court and the camp of Israel haters.' The ICC has issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu, another former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and a Hamas commander, accusing them of crimes against humanity. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations of genocide against Israel. Israel rejects the allegations and says both courts are biased against it. No end in sight to Gaza war despite ceasefire with Hezbollah The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around people 250 hostage. Some 100 captives are still being held inside Gaza, around two-thirds of whom are believed to be alive. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has destroyed vast areas of the coastal enclave and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands have crammed into squalid tent camps, where conditions have worsened as the cold, wet winter sets in. Israel reached a ceasefire with Lebanon's Hezbollah militants last week that has largely held, but that agreement, brokered by the United States and France, did not address the ongoing war in Gaza. Iran — which supports Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis and armed groups in Syria and Iraq — has exchanged fire with Israel twice this year. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent much of the past year trying to broker a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages, but those efforts stalled as Israel rejected Hamas' demand for a complete withdrawal from the territory. The Biden administration has said it will make another push for a deal in its final weeks in office. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East, without saying how. He was a staunch defender of Israel and its policies toward the Palestinians during his previous term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-to-halt-aid-deliveries-through-main-gaza-crossing-says-route-is-too-dangerous/7883001.html	2024-12-01T03:01:11-08:00	
Putin approves record Russian defense spending	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russian President Vladimir Putin approved budget plans, raising 2025 military spending to record levels as Moscow seeks to prevail in the war in Ukraine. Around 32.5% of the budget posted on a government website Sunday has been allocated for national defense, amounting to 13.5 trillion rubles (more than $145 billion), up from a reported 28.3% this year. Lawmakers in both houses of the Russian parliament, the State Duma and Federation Council had already approved the plans in the past 10 days. Russia's war on Ukraine, which started in February 2022, is Europe's biggest conflict since World War II and has drained the resources of both sides. Kyiv has been getting billions of dollars in help from its Western allies, but Russia's forces are bigger and better equipped, and in recent months the Russian army has gradually been pushing Ukrainian troops backward in eastern areas. On the ground in Ukraine, three people died in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson when a Russian drone struck a minibus on Sunday morning, Kherson regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin said. Seven others were wounded in the attack. Meanwhile, the number of wounded in Saturday's missile strike in Dnipro in central Ukraine rose to 24, with seven in serious condition, Dnipropetrovsk regional Gov. Serhiy Lysak said. Four people were killed in the attack. Moscow sent 78 drones into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine's air force, 32 drones were destroyed during the overnight attacks. A further 45 drones were 'lost' over various areas, likely having been electronically jammed. In Russia, a child was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack in the Bryansk region bordering Ukraine, according to regional Gov. Alexander Bogomaz. Russia's Defense Ministry said that 29 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in four regions of western Russia: 20 over the Bryansk region, seven over the Kaluga region, and one each over the Smolensk and Kursk regions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-approves-record-russian-defense-spending/7882994.html	2024-12-01T02:33:00-08:00	
Biden to spotlight Angola’s Lobito Corridor, his legacy to counter China in Africa	WASHINGTON — When U.S. President Joe Biden visits Angola in early December, he will put into focus his legacy infrastructure project aimed at securing crucial supply chains on the African continent. Called the Lobito Corridor, the project is the centerpiece of his administration’s strategy to counter China’s clout in global development. The Lobito Corridor is a $5 billion investment across multiple sectors that is intended to revitalize and extend the 1,300-kilometer Benguela railway line. It will connect the 120-year-old Angolan port of Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in its second phase, to Zambia. Announced in September 2023, much of the corridor’s financing comes from the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The PGI is a Biden-led 2022 initiative from the Group of Seven wealthiest economies that evolved from his Build Back Better World plan launched in 2021 as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Once operational, it will boost access to critical minerals for the United States and its partners, including cobalt and copper, that are essential in electric vehicle manufacturing. According to a U.S. congressional report, 80% of the DRC’s copper mines are Chinese owned. China is responsible for mining 85% of the DRC’s rare earth minerals, including 76% of its cobalt. The Lobito Corridor is expected to cut transportation costs, open access to arable agricultural land and drive climate-resilient economic growth, Helaina Matza, acting special coordinator for the PGI at the U.S. Department of State, said Tuesday in a briefing to reporters. The PGI’s investments will 'amplify the impact of that infrastructure' with projects such as developing solar energy, local electricity networks and desalination efforts, she said. The project is championed by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. Angola owes about $17 billion to China, more than a third of its total debt. The debt is mostly in the form of infrastructure development loans, backed by oil, that funded the country’s economic recovery following three decades of civil war that ended in 2002. PGI to counter BRI Since launching the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, in 2013, China has become the main backer of global development financing. In Africa, Beijing has signed loan commitments with 49 African governments and seven regional institutions. From 2013 to 2021, China provided $679 billion for infrastructure projects around the world, according to a U.S. government analysis, while the U.S. provided $76 billion. The U.S., alongside G7 partners, announced in 2022 that the PGI aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 as an alternative to infrastructure financing models that are 'often opaque, fail to uphold environmental and social standards, exploit workers and leave the recipient countries worse off.' That’s a lot of financing to catch up to in a few years, and Lobito is 'the first and the most developed' project in that effort, said Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. 'That's the A+ project, but I don’t see a whole lot of other projects,' Schneidman told VOA. The PGI’s other project, the Luzon Corridor, was launched in April to support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila and Batangas in the Philippines. In Lobito, the U.S. works mostly with European partners. In Luzon, the U.S. is teaming up with Japan to secure critical industries such as semiconductors. The White House pushed back against the notion that Biden has scaled back his global infrastructure ambitions to the two corridors. 'We’ve mobilized more than $60 billion, just the U.S., and that’s a part of the larger G7,' national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA in a briefing earlier this month. 'And that’s not just been for two corridors,' he said. 'That’s been for investments across Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.' US-Africa strategy In August 2022, the Biden administration launched an Africa strategy that 'reframes the region’s importance to U.S. national security interests,' the strategy says. Later that year, Biden hosted the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, where he pledged the U.S. to invest $55 billion in Africa over three years. 'We are overdelivering on that thus far,' Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said in a briefing Tuesday. 'We’ve invested more than 80% of that commitment.' But much of that $55 billion was allocated under existing programs and does not bring the kind of megaproject that is 'visible to the average African that says the United States financed that in the way that the Chinese do,' said Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Which is why the Lobito Corridor stands out, Dizolele told VOA. It is the 'one palpable project that people can look at and say, ‘If this is implemented, then maybe it would move things forward.’' On a continent where the presence of Chinese financing, businesses and migrants are so prevalent that many African countries teach Mandarin in schools and incorporate Chinese characters in public signage, that’s a start. Moving forward, activists hope the U.S. will not set aside social and environmental concerns that have besieged projects under Chinese financing. 'We have to ensure that we can hear all stakeholders engaging in the process,' said Sergio Calundungo, founder of the Social Observatory of Angola. So far, civil society groups have not been invited to the table, but they are ready to ensure that local communities can 'share as much as possible the prosperity through this important infrastructure,' he told VOA. Will it continue? President-elect Donald Trump will enter office in January. While some are concerned that the U.S. commitment to Africa might falter under his America First doctrine, analysts point to initiatives taken under his first administration. In 2018, the Trump administration launched Prosper Africa, an initiative that brings together U.S. government services to help investors do business on the continent. In 2019, it launched the Blue Dot Network, an international certification mechanism to ensure infrastructure projects meet environmental and social standards. They were aware that infrastructure investments needed 'to foster economic growth, to foster stability, but also for U.S. interests globally when competing with China,' said Joseph Lemoine, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Freedom and Prosperity Center. 'I'm hopeful that they will continue those efforts,' he told VOA. Trump also launched the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in 2020. The DFC is an agency that functions as America’s development bank, with $60 billion in lending capacity. DFC’s first CEO, Adam Boehler, a college roommate of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, spoke openly of linking development aid to foreign policy goals. In a 2020 interview, he admitted promising $2 billion for Indonesia should the country agree to join the Trump administration's Abraham Accords and recognize Israel. 'If you listen to all the Trump people, they want a foreign policy that's transactional,' Schneidman at Brookings said. Trump has promised to take a confrontational approach to China. Analysts say aligning infrastructure financing needs with Trump’s foreign policy goals may be an element in the U.S.-China rivalry that developing nations can leverage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-spotlight-angola-s-lobito-corridor-his-legacy-to-counter-china-in-africa/7879407.html	2024-12-01T01:31:20-08:00	
Nicaraguans stripped of citizenship live in limbo, scattered across the world	GUATEMALA CITY — Sergio Mena's life dissolved in hours. After years resisting President Daniel Ortega, the rural activist fled Nicaragua in 2018, joining thousands of protesters fleeing a yearslong crackdown on dissent. Mena returned from exile in neighboring Costa Rica in 2021 to continue protesting, only to be thrown in a prison where he said jailers hung prisoners by their feet and shocked them with electricity. 'We were tortured all the time, physically and psychologically, from the moment we arrived until the very last day,' said Mena, 40. Now in exile in Guatemala, Mena may be out of prison but he's far from free. Upon their release, he and hundreds of religious leaders, students, activists, dissidents and journalists were rendered 'stateless' – stripped of their citizenship, homes and government pensions. The United Nations says that they're among 4.4 million stateless people worldwide who struggle to find jobs, education and healthcare or even open bank accounts or marry without valid ID documents. 'Statelessness is torture,' said Karina Ambartsoumian-Clough executive director of United Stateless, a U.S.-based organization advocating for the stateless. 'You just legally cease to exist, even if you're here physically as a human.' Free but unfree In September, Ortega's government loaded Mena and 134 other prisoners onto the flight that took them to Guatemala. They joined 317 others whom the government has deemed adversaries who no longer deserve legal Nicaraguan identities. The Associated Press spoke to more than 24 Nicaraguan exiles who have been stripped of their citizenship and are trying to chart paths forward. They're scattered across the United States, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Mexico and Spain in limbo as they struggle to recover from physical and psychological trauma, extending the torture many suffered in Nicaragua. The Ortega government did not respond to a request for comment by the AP. The agony of statelessness The majority of stateless people worldwide are born to refugees and migrants in countries that don't offer birthright citizenship, the right to become a citizen if you're born within a country's territory. Many Nicaraguans struggle to scrape together enough money to feed themselves. Others hide away in fear that the Nicaraguan government will someday come for them. Many more reel from watching their lives go up in smoke. For those stranded in the U.S. or seeking respite there, President-elect Donald Trump's promises to crack down on immigration and asylum have added more uncertainty. Intensifying repression Ortega's government began stripping people of their citizenship early last year. It was in that crackdown that Mena, the member of a rural activist movement, said he was imprisoned. The government claimed that he had participated in drug trafficking and organized crime, which he denies. In February 2023, the government broke international law when it began sending prisoners to the U.S and most recently to Guatemala. Others in exile were stripped of their citizenship without ever having been jailed. Torment beyond borders The Nicaraguan government has not explained why it released Mena and other people from prison, although experts have speculated about the desire to duck international criticism and the costs involved while continuing to maintain a grip on enemies. Mena lives in a hotel in Guatemala City, where he flips through photos of a crumbling jail, scraps of food and his bruised, beaten body – indelible memories of more than two years in prison. His life is painted by constant fear. 'The tentacles of (the Nicaraguan government) still reach here,' he said with tears in his eyes. The Biden administration has offered the Nicaraguans temporary protections and Mena hopes the U.S. government will grant him asylum, but such protections are likely to vanish or be severely restricted under Trump. The Spanish government has offered to provide nationality to some of the stateless exiles, but few have the resources needed to build a new life in Spain, or are confused about the process. Stateless struggle Allan Bermudez, 54, was a university professor in Nicaragua. He was imprisoned after accusations that he was conspiring against the government as Ortega identified universities as hotbeds for antigovernment protests. In February 2023, he was among 222 prisoners loaded onto a flight to the United States with no idea where they were going. While the U.S. government provided Bermudez and others with temporary support, a few days at a hotel, a new phone, $400 and limited access to aid from a group of NGOs, help has since dried up. Today, Bermudez, who has multiple advanced degrees, works at a Dunkin' Donuts on the fringes of Salisbury, Maryland, struggling to pick up hours. He rents a small room, suffers from chronic heart problems and post-traumatic stress disorder, and has no medical care. 'I haven't bought my medicine, because if I do, I'll have nothing to eat,' he said. Back in Nicaragua, his mother had stroke this year. He's struggled to send money home. With his daughter and wife also back home, he's plagued with anxiety and depression. He applied for asylum in February after living in the U.S. under humanitarian parole offered by the Biden administration but said he hasn't heard back. He's put all his hopes into building a life in the U.S. and doesn't know what he'll do if asylum doesn't come through. 'I can't leave, I have my hands tied,' he said. 'All I can do is pray that God helps me.' Lives upended Like Bermudez, hundreds of thousands have fled Nicaragua. Thousands of civil society organizations have been shuttered, their assets seized as the government seeks to silence any dissent. While many of the Nicaraguan exiles hope to one day return to their country, 82-year-old Moises Hassan has given up hope as he hides away in a town in the mountains of Costa Rica. Hassan was once a guerrilla fighter against the Anastasio Somoza dictatorship and then, alongside Ortega, a member of the junta that succeeded it. He built a family and a home with thousands of books, and planned to live out the rest of his days there. He was elected mayor of the capital, Managua, but saw his life and hopes sour when he began to criticize Ortega's anti-democratic moves. He fled the country in 2021. While on a trip to visit his daughter he heard the government was detaining critics, and knew they would come for him. It was no surprise when his name appeared on a list of people who were stripped of their citizenship and home and called traitors. 'The message is ... 'Don't think that just because you're out of the country that you're out of our reach,'' he said. But he said that with his pension seized along with his belongings, it has been a shock to depend on money from his children. He and his wife remain in their corner of Costa Rica, too scared to even go to the capital, where they worry Ortega's agents could track them down. 'I feel like I'm under house arrest,' he said, cradling his worn, now useless Nicaraguan passport. 'I'm a prisoner in my own home.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nicaraguans-stripped-of-citizenship-live-in-limbo-scattered-across-the-world-/7881099.html	2024-12-01T01:30:44-08:00	
Everything is expensive!' Bolivia faces a shocking economic collapse	Fuel is rapidly becoming one of Bolivia's scarcest commodities. Long lines of vehicles snake for several kilometers outside gas stations all over Bolivia, once South America's second-largest producer of natural gas. Some of the queues don't budge for days. While frustration builds, drivers like Victor García now eat, sleep and socialize around their stationary trucks, waiting to buy just a few liters of diesel — unless the station runs dry. 'We don't know what's going to happen, but we're going to be worse off,' said García, 66, who inched closer to the pump Tuesday as the hours ticked by in El Alto, a bare-bones sprawl beside Bolivia's capital in the Andean altiplano. Bolivia's monthslong fuel crunch comes as the nation's foreign currency reserves plummet, leaving Bolivians unable to find U.S. dollars at banks and exchange houses. Imported goods that were once commonplace have become scarce. The fuel crisis has created a sense that the country is coming undone, disrupting economic activity and everyday life for millions of people, hurting commerce and farm production and sending food prices soaring. Mounting public anger has driven crowds into the streets in recent weeks, piling pressure on leftist President Luis Arce to ease the suffering ahead of a tense election next year. 'We want effective solutions to the shortage of fuel, dollars and the increase in food prices,' said Reinerio Vargas, the vice rector of Gabriel René Moreno Autonomous University in the eastern province of Santa Cruz, where hundreds of desperate truckers and residents flooded main squares Tuesday to vent their anger at Arce's inaction and demand early elections. In a similar eruption of discontent, protesters shouting, 'Everything is expensive!' marched through the streets of the capital, La Paz, last week. Bolivians say Arce's image has suffered not only because of the crisis but also because his government insists that it doesn't exist. 'Diesel sales are in the process of returning to normal,' Economy Minister Marcelo Montenegro said Tuesday. Arce has repeatedly vowed that his government will end the fuel shortages and lower the prices of basic goods by arbitrary deadlines. On November 10, he again promised he would 'resolve this issue' in 10 days. As the deadlines come and go, the black market currency exchange rate has risen to nearly 40% more than the official rate. Arce's office did not respond to interview requests. 'The queues are getting longer and longer,' said 38-year-old driver Ramiro Morales, who needed a bathroom after four hours in line Tuesday but feared losing his place if he went searching for one. 'People are exhausted.' It's a shocking turnaround for the landlocked nation of 12 million people that was a South American economic success story in the 2000s, when the commodities bonanza generated tens of billions of dollars under the nation's first Indigenous president, former President Evo Morales. Morales, Arce's onetime mentor, is his present-day rival in the fight to be the ruling party's candidate next year. But when the commodities boom ended, prices slumped and gas production dwindled. Now, Bolivia spends an estimated $56 million a week to import most of its gasoline and diesel from Argentina, Paraguay and Russia. Economy Minister Montenegro on Tuesday pledged that the government would continue providing fuel subsidies that critics say it can't afford. Banners from two years ago boasting that Bolivia's inflation is the lowest in South America still greet tourists arriving at El Alto International Airport. Now, inflation is among the highest in the region. Fuel shortages prevent farmers from getting their produce to distribution centers and markets, triggering a sharp price hike for food staples. Last week in La Paz and neighboring El Alto, hungry Bolivians jostled in long lines to buy rice after much-delayed shipments finally arrived from Santa Cruz, the country's economic engine some 850 kilometers away. With the diesel shortage affecting everything from the operation of tractors to the sourcing of machinery parts, the shortage is also hurting farmers during the crucial planting season. 'Without diesel, there is no food for 2025,' said Klaus Frerking, the vice president of the Eastern Agricultural Chamber of Bolivia. The prices of potatoes, onions and milk have doubled in El Alto's main wholesale food market in the past month, vendors said, overshooting the country's nearly 8% inflation rate. Nervous Bolivians are cutting back on their consumption. 'You have to search a lot to find the cheapest food,' said 67-year-old Angela Mamani, struggling to pull together meals for her six grandchildren at El Alto's open-air market Tuesday. She planned to buy vegetables but didn't have enough cash and went home empty-handed. This week, Arce's government presented a 2025 budget — with a 12% increase in spending — that drew backlash from lawmakers and business leaders who said it would lead to more debt and more inflation. While the governing Movement Toward Socialism party tears itself apart in the power struggle between Arce and Morales, both politicians have seen the economic morass as a way to strengthen their positions ahead of 2025 elections. 'They deny there are problems. They blame external contexts and conflicts,' said Bolivian economic analyst Gonzalo Chávez. Morales' supporters last month launched 24-day protest partly targeting Arce's handling of the economy that blocked main roads and stranded commercial shipments, costing the government billions of dollars. Security forces broke up the rallies almost a month ago. But on Tuesday, Arce's government continued to blame Morales' blockades for spawning the ubiquitous fuel lines. 'We need change,' said Geanina García, a 31-year-old architect scouring the grocery hub of El Alto for cheap deals — a once-routine errand that she said had turned into a nightmare. 'People don't live off politics, they live day to day, off of what they produce and what they earn.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/everything-is-expensive-bolivia-faces-a-shocking-economic-collapse/7881016.html	2024-12-01T01:30:11-08:00	
New EU chiefs visit Kyiv on first day of mandate	KYIV, UKRAINE — The EU's new top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, and head of the European Council, Antonio Costa, arrived in Kyiv on Sunday in a symbolic show of support for Ukraine on their first day in office. 'We came to give a clear message that we stand with Ukraine, and we continue to give our full support,' Costa told media outlets including AFP accompanying them on the trip. The European Union's new leadership team is keen to demonstrate it remains firm on backing Kyiv at a perilous moment for Ukraine nearly three years into its fight against Russia's all-out invasion. Questions are swirling around the future of U.S. support once Donald Trump assumes office in January and there are fears he could force Kyiv to make painful concessions in pursuit of a quick peace deal. Meanwhile, tensions have escalated as Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike government buildings in Kyiv with his new Oreshnik missile after firing it at Ukraine for the first time last month. The Kremlin leader said the move is a response to Kyiv getting the green light to strike inside Russia with American and British missiles, and he has threatened to hit back against the countries supplying the weaponry. As winter begins, Russia has also unleashed devastating barrages against Ukraine's power grid and on the frontline Kyiv's fatigued forces are losing ground to Moscow's grinding offensive. 'The situation in Ukraine is very, very grave,' Kallas, a former prime minister of Estonia, said. 'But it's clear that it comes at a very high cost for Russia as well.' Ceasefire? The new EU leaders -- the bloc's top officials along with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen -- were set to hold talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy on Friday appeared to begin staking out his position ahead of any potential peace talks. He called on NATO to offer guaranteed protections to parts of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv in order to 'stop the hot stage of the war,' and implied he would then be willing to wait to regain other territory seized by Russia. 'If we speak ceasefire, [we need] guarantees that Putin will not come back,' Zelenskyy told Britain's Sky News. Kallas said that 'the strongest security guarantee is NATO membership.' 'We need to definitely discuss this -- if Ukraine decides to draw the line somewhere then how can we secure peace so that Putin doesn't go any further,' she said. Diplomats at NATO say there appears little prospect of the alliance granting Ukraine membership soon given opposition from a raft of members cautious of getting dragged into war with Russia. Kallas said the EU 'shouldn't really rule out anything' in terms of the question of sending European troops to help enforce any ceasefire. 'We should have this strategic ambiguity around this,' she said. 'Transactional language' Trump has cast doubt on continuing Washington's vast aid for Ukraine and called on EU countries to do more. Europe together has spent around $125 billion on supporting Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, while the United States alone has coughed up over $90 billion, according to a tracker from the Kiel Institute. Kallas said the EU would use a 'transactional language' to try to convince Trump that backing Kyiv was in the interest of the U.S. 'Aid for Ukraine is not charity,' she said. 'A victory for Russia definitely emboldens China, Iran, North Korea.' The new EU foreign policy chief said the bloc would continue seeking to put Ukraine in the 'strongest' position -- if and when Kyiv chose it was time to negotiate with Moscow. But she conceded that it was becoming 'increasingly difficult' for the 27-nation bloc to agree on new ways to ramp up support for Ukraine. 'This war has been going on for quite some time and it is harder and harder to explain it to our own people,' she said. 'But I don't see any option.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-eu-chiefs-visit-kyiv-on-first-day-of-mandate/7882982.html	2024-12-01T01:24:44-08:00	
Interpol clamps down on cybercrime, arrests 1,006 suspects in Africa	DAKAR, SENEGAL — Interpol arrested 1,006 suspects in Africa during a massive two-month operation, clamping down on cybercrime that left tens of thousands of victims, including some who were trafficked, and produced millions in financial damages, the global police organization said Tuesday. Operation Serengeti, a joint operation with Afripol, the African Union's police agency, ran from September 2 to October 31 in 19 African countries and targeted criminals behind ransomware, business email compromise, digital extortion and online scams, the agency said in a statement. 'From multi-level marketing scams to credit card fraud on an industrial scale, the increasing volume and sophistication of cybercrime attacks is of serious concern,' said Valdecy Urquiza, the Secretary General of Interpol. Interpol pinpointed 35,000 victims, with cases linked to nearly $193 million in financial losses worldwide, stating that local police authorities and private sector partners, including internet service providers, played a key role in the operation. Jalel Chelba, Afripol's executive director, said in the statement: 'Through Serengeti, Afripol has significantly enhanced support for law enforcement in African Union Member States.' Serengeti's results were a 'drastic increase' compared to operations in Africa in previous years, Enrique Hernandez Gonzalez, Interpol's Assistant Director of Cybercrime Operations, told The Associated Press. Interpol's previous cybercrime operations in Africa had only led to 25 arrests in the last two years. 'Significant progress has been made, with participating countries enhancing their ability to work with intelligence and produce meaningful results,' Gonzalez said. In Kenya, the police made nearly two dozen arrests in an online credit card fraud case linked to losses of $8.6 million. In the West African country of Senegal, officers arrested eight people, including five Chinese nationals, for a $6 million online Ponzi scheme. Chelba said Afripol's focus now includes emerging threats like Artificial Intelligence-driven malware and advanced cyberattack techniques. Other dismantled networks included a group in Cameroon suspected of using a multi-level marketing scam for human trafficking, an international criminal group in Angola running an illegal virtual casino and a cryptocurrency investment scam in Nigeria, the agency said. Interpol, which has 196 member countries and celebrated its centennial last year, works to help national police forces communicate with each other and track suspects and criminals in fields like counterterrorism, financial crime, child pornography, cybercrime and organized crime. The world's biggest — if not best-funded — police organization has been grappling with new challenges including a growing caseload of cybercrime and child sex abuse, and increasing divisions among its member countries. Interpol had a total budget of about 176 million euros (about $188 million) last year, compared to more than 200 million euros at the European Union's police agency, Europol, and some $11 billion at the FBI in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/interpol-clamps-down-on-cybercrime-arrests-1-006-suspects-in-africa/7879846.html	2024-12-01T00:01:58-08:00	
Berlin's traditional Christmas markets reflect city's growing diversity	BERLIN — The smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and hot bratwurst are wafting through the air across the German capital again, as the city's more than 100 Christmas markets are opening their doors this week. But the annual tradition that Germans have cherished since the Middle Ages — and successfully exported to much of the Western world — has become a pretty diverse affair, at least in Berlin. The city of 3.8 million, which takes pride in its tolerance and diversity, offers Christmas markets for pretty much every taste these days. Nowadays, almost 40% of Berliners have immigrant roots, and the city's LGBTQ+ community is considered one of the biggest in the country. So it comes as no surprise that popular Christmas markets include a LGBTQ+ one offering rainbow pierogi and entertainment by drag queens, a Scandinavian market selling moose goulash and reindeer salami and a market tempting revelers with naughty gift ideas, along with a historical market that takes visitors back to medieval times. 'It's a lovely atmosphere,' Paul Middleton said of the LGBTQ+ market Christmas Avenue, which is illuminated in the colors of the rainbow. 'It's great to do something for the LGBTQ+ community and offer something positive in a safe environment where everyone's welcome, no matter what background,' said Middleton, who moved to Berlin from London three years ago 'for love.' Middleton was busy selling gay-themed Christmas shirts next to stalls offering suggestive candles and soaps in neon colors. The market also attracts heterosexual couples, neighborhood residents and groups of moms with baby strollers, said Sebastian Ahlefeld, a spokesperson for Christmas Avenue. 'You can meet lots of friends, relax, enjoy a mulled wine and simply kick off the Christmas season,' said Marco Klingberg, who visited the market with friends on Monday night. Klingberg, a police officer and member of the LGBTQ+ police organization in Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, pointed out that despite the city's reputation as a gay-friendly city, attacks on members of the community are a concern, and it was great to have a protected environment for celebrating. 'First and foremost, it's a safe space,' he said. Security is an issue not only at the LGBTQ+ market, where all visitors undergo a bag check before entering. Groups of police officers were patrolling most markets on Monday night, as memories of a deadly terror attack on a Christmas market eight years ago are still fresh for many Berliners. On December 19, 2016, an Islamist attacker plowed through a crowd of Christmas market-goers with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more in the German capital. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Despite increased surveillance, visitors at the Scandinavian-themed Lucia market in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood were hanging out in crowds on the compound of a former brewery. Kids enjoyed merry-go-rounds while their parents stood in line for Finnish honey and Icelandic mulled wine infused with hard liquor or chatted and warmed up at fire pits. 'I've been coming here every year since kindergarten times,' said Mathilda Schmidt, 21, pointing to kids cheering as they jumped on a trampoline. She was standing in line with her boyfriend for bratwurst and potato pancakes. At Humboldt Forum Christmas market near the Spree river, vendors were offering more exotic dishes including jerk chicken with cooked bananas at a Jamaican food stand, Argentinian empanadas, French salamis and Hungarian langos, a deep-fried flatbread. While the city's biggest markets are open for weeks and usually close only the day before Christmas Eve, smaller markets often open for a weekend or a day. They include the Kinky Christmas market in the Kreuzberg neighborhood that invites visitors on December 1 only, seeking those who may find traditional markets 'too overwhelmingly contemplative and traditional.' More than 20 stalls will offer sexy 'fashion, accessories, jewelry, toys and all kinds of naughty gift ideas,' the city of Berlin says on its website. While Berliners seem to nonchalantly enjoy the variety of Christmas market offerings, they were fiercely united in their complaint about the increasing price of mulled wine — with one small cup now selling for up to seven euros ($7.36).	https://www.voanews.com/a/berlin-s-traditional-christmas-markets-reflect-city-s-growing-diversity/7879819.html	2024-12-01T00:00:40-08:00	
Eggs are available but pricier as the holiday baking season begins	U.S. egg prices are rising once more as a lingering outbreak of bird flu coincides with the high demand of the holiday baking season. But prices are still far from the recent peak they reached almost two years ago. And the American Egg Board, a trade group, says egg shortages at grocery stores have been isolated and temporary so far. 'Those are being rapidly corrected, sometimes within a day,' said Emily Metz, the Egg Board's president and chief executive officer. The average price for a dozen eggs in U.S. cities was $3.37 in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was down slightly from September, and down significantly from January 2023, when the average price soared to $4.82. But it was up 63% from October 2023, when a dozen eggs cost an average of $2.07. Sometimes, supermarkets may be to blame for price spikes. During testimony in August in the Federal Trade Commission's case seeking to block Kroger's merger with Albertsons, Kroger's senior director for pricing acknowledged that the company has raised the cost of milk and eggs beyond the levels of inflation. But there are other factors behind the price increases. Metz said the egg industry sees its highest demand in November and December, for example. 'You can't have your holiday baking, your pumpkin pie, your stuffing, without eggs,' she said. Avian influenza is another big reason for the higher prices. The current bird flu outbreak that began in February 2022 has led to the slaughter of more than 111 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens. Anytime the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the spread of the disease. More than 6 million birds have been slaughtered just this month because of bird flu. They were a relatively small part of the total U.S. egg-laying flock of 377 million chickens. Still, the flock is down about 3% over the past year, contributing to a 4% drop in egg production, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The latest wave of bird flu is scrambling supplies of cage-free eggs because California has been among the hardest hit states. California, Nevada, Washington and Oregon all require eggs sold in their states to be cage-free. 'We're having to move eggs from other areas of the country that are producing cage-free to cover that low supply in those states, because those states only allow for cage-free eggs to be sold,' Metz said. Cage-free requirements are set to go into effect in Arizona, Colorado and Michigan next year and in Rhode Island and Utah in 2030. Demand for such specialty eggs may also be contributing to avian flu, which is spread through the droppings of wild birds as they migrate past farms. Allowing chickens to roam more freely puts them at greater risk, said Chad Hart, a professor and agricultural economist at Iowa State University. 'It's really hard to control that interaction between domesticated birds and wild birds,' Hart said. 'Some of those vectors have been opened up because we're asking the egg industry to produce in ways that we didn't ask them to before.' Metz said climate change and extreme weather are also blowing some wild birds off course. 'We have birds that have been displaced by hurricanes, by wildfires, and those birds are now circulating in areas that they otherwise might not circulate or at times of the year that they otherwise may not be circulating,' she said. 'And those are all new variables that our farmers are having to deal with.' Hart said the egg industry is trying to rebuild the flock, but that also can limit supplies, since farmers have to hold back some eggs to hatch into new chickens. Still, there is some good news on U.S. poultry farms. The price of chicken feed — which represents 70% of a farmer's costs — has fallen significantly after doubling between 2020 and 2022, Hart said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eggs-are-available-but-pricier-as-the-holiday-baking-season-begins/7879804.html	2024-11-30T23:59:30-08:00	
More sand is in sight for a Jersey Shore resort town's deteriorating beaches	NORTH WILDWOOD, NEW JERSEY — A decade-long conflict over the condition of a New Jersey resort town's beaches, involving tens of millions of dollars in litigation and fines, could come to an end soon. Patrick Rosenello, the mayor of North Wildwood, says his town has reached an agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to drop claims on both sides and move forward with measures to widen beaches in the community, popular with tourists from the Philadelphia area. The agreement, which is up for a vote Tuesday by North Wildwood's council, would resolve all outstanding disputes between the parties, the Republican mayor said. The tentative timing of the replenishment is sometime in 2025, he said. The agreement includes canceling the $12 million New Jersey has fined North Wildwood for unauthorized beach repairs that the state says could actually worsen erosion. It also calls for the city to drop a lawsuit against the state seeking reimbursement for the $30 million it has spent trucking in sand for emergency repairs to eroded sections of its beach over the past decade. 'We agreed that we will concentrate on protecting our beaches instead of suing each other,' Rosenello said Wednesday. At the root of the dispute is the fact that North Wildwood is virtually the only Jersey Shore community that has yet to receive a full beach replenishment project from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Officials say difficulty in getting easements from affected property owners has contributed to the delay. Erosion had become so bad in parts of North Wildwood that protective sand dunes were obliterated, leaving homes and businesses vulnerable to flooding and wave damage in the event of a major storm, At one point in January, Rosenello posed for photos on the beach with what was left of a dune barely reaching his knees. The state Department of Transportation did an interim replenishment project last summer after Democratic Governor Phil Murphy called the erosion in North Wildwood 'shocking.' Rosenello said that work has held up well in the ensuing months. The environmental department declined to comment on the proposed agreement. Rosenello predicted it will be approved by the council and signed and sent to the state Tuesday. In addition to ending the litigation, North Wildwood will contribute $1 million to the eventual cost of the federal beach replenishment project once it arrives in the city, and will pay $700,000 into a state water pollution control fund, the mayor said. The agreement also lays out a clear regulatory path for North Wildwood to obtain the environmental permits it needs to carry out other shore protection work including extension of a sea wall. On several occasions, North Wildwood carried out emergency repairs, including construction of an earlier bulkhead without approval from the state. Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environment protection commissioner, warned the town in 2023 that unauthorized work could have more serious consequences if it continues, including potential loss of future shore protection funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-sand-is-in-sight-for-a-jersey-shore-resort-town-s-deteriorating-beaches-/7878895.html	2024-11-30T23:58:51-08:00	
US proposes new habitat protections in southern Rockies for Canada lynx	BILLINGS, MONTANA — U.S. wildlife officials finalized a recovery plan for imperiled populations of Canada lynx on Wednesday and proposed new habitat protections in the southern Rocky Mountains for the forest-dwelling wildcats that are threatened by climate change. The fate of the proposal is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump: Officials during the Republican's first term sought unsuccessfully to strip lynx of protections that they've had since 2000 under the Endangered Species Act. Almost 20,000 square kilometers of forests and mountains in Colorado and northern New Mexico are covered under the habitat proposal. That's different from a previous plan that left out the southern Rockies and concentrated instead on recovery efforts elsewhere, including Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota and Maine. 'This is a significant change and a good one,' said Matthew Bishop, an attorney for Western Environmental Law Center who has been involved in efforts to protect lynx through court actions. 'They weren't really committing to conserve lynx in Colorado anymore, and now they are.' Areas of protected habitat also are being added in Idaho and Montana. Protected areas in Wyoming would be sharply reduced under Wednesday's proposal. Wildlife officials said they were removing locations where they consider lynx unlikely to thrive in the future, while adding new areas that the latest science suggests are more suitable to their long-term survival. Lynx are elusive animals that live in cold boreal forests and prey primarily on snowshoe hares. They originally received federal protections because the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management didn't have sufficient regulations in place to shield their populations from potential harm. Those protective rules are now in place, but climate change has emerged as a new, worsening threat. Warmer temperatures are melting away the lynx's snowy habitat and could decrease the availability of snowshoe hares. Declines for lynx are expected across the contiguous U.S. under even the most optimistic warming scenario that officials have considered. Most areas suitable for lynx are in Canada and Alaska, where the animals are widespread and hunting and trapping of them is allowed. Their numbers never were great in the contiguous U.S., which is at the southern fringe of the species range, but the hope is to maintain some population strongholds so they can persist in a warmer world. The changes announced Wednesday follow a 2016 court ruling that faulted federal wildlife officials for not designating protections for lynx habitat in Colorado and some parts of Montana and Idaho. There are more than 1,100 lynx in the contiguous U.S., according to estimates from scientists. Those numbers are expected to plummet in some areas, and officials are aiming for a minimum contiguous U.S. population of a combined 875 lynx over a 20-year period. More than 200 lynx were reintroduced in Colorado beginning in 1999 and at the time their prospects were considered uncertain. 'There were concerns about whether it would stick,' said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lynx biologist Jim Zelenak. 'But they do seem to be hanging on.' Now that area could become one of the future population strongholds, with the southern Rockies in Colorado and the region around Yellowstone National Park are most likely to have temperatures favorable to lynx for the longest time, he said. Maine has the most lynx currently but is expected to be hit harder by climate change. 'We've got this overarching threat of climate warming, and so we want to do everything we can to minimize the effects that we can control,' Zelenak said. 'So we don't want to put roads in the wrong places. We don't want to permanently convert very much of the habitat at all in the hopes that we can keep these populations viable coming into a warming future.' Habitat protections in Maine and Minnesota would remain unchanged under the proposal. A final decision is expected late next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-proposes-proposed-for-new-habitat-protections-in-southern-rockies-for-canada-lynx-/7879839.html	2024-11-30T23:56:53-08:00	
Turmoil overshadows Romania vote as far right hopes to gain ground	BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — Still reeling from this week's shock developments, Romanians returned to the polls Sunday to elect their Parliament, with the far right tipped to win, potentially heralding a shift in the NATO country's foreign policy. Romania was thrown into turmoil after a top court ordered a recount of the first round of last week's presidential election won by Calin Georgescu, a little-known far-right admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin. A runoff in that poll is slated for December 8. Despite accusations of Russian influence and alleged interference via TikTok, Sunday's parliamentary elections went ahead as planned. While the recounting of more than 9 million ballots appeared to proceed quickly, people on the streets of Bucharest expressed worries about the recent twists and turns. 'What's going on now doesn't seem very democratic,' Gina Visan told AFP at a Christmas market in Bucharest. 'They should respect our vote. We're disappointed, but we're used to this kind of behavior,' said the 40-year-old nurse, echoing voter's distrust in traditional parties. Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and will close at 9 p.m., with an exit poll due to be published shortly afterward. The first official results are expected later in the evening. Confusion, anger and fear Amid allegations of irregularities and possible interference in the election, concerns over the transparency of the electoral process have emerged, with independent observers being denied access to the recount. According to Septimius Parvu of the Expert Forum think tank, the recount order by Romania's Constitutional Court had 'many negative effects,' including undermining confidence in institutions. 'We've already recounted votes in Romania in the past, but not millions of votes, with parliamentary elections in the middle of it all,' said Parvu. 'No decision made during this crucial period should limit the right of Romanians to vote freely nor further put at risk the credibility of the election process,' the U.S. Embassy in Romania stressed. But the top court's decision is likely to boost the far right, Parvu said. The NATO member of 19 million people has so far resisted rising nationalism in the region, but experts say it faces an unprecedented situation as anger over soaring inflation and fears of being dragged into Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine have mounted. George Sorin in Bucharest said he hopes the far right will score well, claiming the current Parliament had mostly served the interests of 'Brussels and Ukraine' instead of 'national interests.' Outgoing President Klaus Iohannis said Sunday's vote would determine Romania's future -- whether it will 'remain a country of freedom and openness or collapse into toxic isolation and a dark past.' Far right eyes breakthrough Romania's political landscape has been shaped by two major parties for the past three decades, but analysts predict a fragmented Parliament to emerge from Sunday's vote, influencing the chances of forming a future government. Polls show that three far-right parties are predicted to claim more than 30% of the vote share combined. Among them is the AUR party, whose leader George Simion won nearly 14% of the presidential vote, which topped the latest polls on more than 22%. 'We are here, standing, alive, more numerous than ever, and with a huge opportunity ahead of us,' Simion -- a fan of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump -- recently told his supporters. The Party of Young People (POT), which was founded in 2023 and has meanwhile thrown its support behind Georgescu, could reach the 5% threshold to enter Parliament and there is also the extreme-right SOS Romania party, led by firebrand Diana Sosoaca. In recent years, around 30% of Romanians have embraced far-right views, even if they have not always voted for them in elections. Elena Lasconi's pro-European USR party has warned that the country faces 'a historic confrontation' between those who wish to 'preserve Romania's young democracy' and those who want to 'return to the Russian sphere of influence.' The ruling Social Democrats (PSD) and the National Liberal Party (PNL), which suffered a defeat in the presidential ballot, have centered their campaigns on their 'experience.' 'The political scene is completely reset,' said political scientist Remus Stefureac, adding that 2025 'will be extremely complicated in terms of security risks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/turmoil-overshadows-romania-vote-as-far-right-hopes-to-gain-ground/7882956.html	2024-11-30T22:10:43-08:00	
India's top court weighs in on mosque–temple controversy	A trial court's order that triggered violence this week, leaving six Muslims dead, should be taken to the Uttar Pradesh state's highest court, India's Supreme Court said Friday. The Supreme Court also asked the trial court not to proceed with the order against Shahi Jama Masjid, a 16th century mosque, until the Allahabad High Court acts on the lawsuit that the mosque will likely file shortly. A trial court, acting on a petition by some Hindu groups, on November 19 ordered a survey team to inspect the mosque in Sambhal. In the petition, the Hindu groups claimed that the mosque was built in 1526 at the site of a Hindu temple demolished by the Muslim Mughal emperor Babur. Former Indian Supreme Court Justice Madan Lokur said to VOA in an email that the court order for the inspection of the mosque was 'a clear violation of the Places of Worship Act, 1991,' referring to a law that froze the status of all religious places of worship as they were on August 15, 1947, the date of India's independence, and prohibits their conversion to any other religion. 'I'm quite shocked that the (Sambhal) court even took 'cognizance of the case' [actively considering the matter]. The damage caused by the court taking cognizance can have a long-term effect,' Lokur told the VOA. 'Instead of directing the case to the High Court, the Supreme Court itself should have entertained the appeal against the order anticipating an escalation of cases. There is an urgent need to avoid even the slightest delay, otherwise cases will keep multiplying causing great damage to the polity.' A 'hasty' order? Muslims have been using the Shahi Jama Masjid Mosque in Sambhal for almost 500 years. In recent years, some right-wing Hindu groups began claiming that Babur, founder of the 16th-century Mughal Empire, destroyed the Harihar Temple and used the rubble to build the mosque. A survey by experts could lead to the discovery of the ruins of the ancient temple, the groups said. After the Hindu groups filed the petition on November 19, the local court in Sambhal ordered a survey of the functioning mosque's premises. In an unusually quick response, a team of experts from the Uttar Pradesh state authorities inspected the site of the mosque on the same day, apparently looking for the ruins of any Hindu temple. When the team returned to the mosque on a second visit on November 24, allegedly not notifying mosque authorities in advance, local Muslims tried to resist them. Violence erupted as the police tried to disperse the Muslim protesters. At one point the police allegedly opened fire, killing six Muslims and injuring many others. Supreme Court lawyer Balraj Singh Malik said the judge at the court in Sambhal acted 'in a haste' when ordering the survey, leading to the six deaths. 'In the case of such a sensitive matter, the court should have given the respondents a chance to speak before passing an order. The due course of law was not followed, and instead an immediate order was issued,' Malik told VOA. A stubborn problem For decades, Hindu right-wing groups have claimed that many mosques and Islamic shrines in the country were built after razing 'thousands' of Hindu temples during the period of the Muslim rulers. The groups launched a campaign insisting that 'one by one' they would reclaim the lands where, according to them, the ancient temples had stood. A year after the 1991 act protecting places of worship came into force, a Hindu mob pulled down the 16th-century Babri Masjid mosque in the Indian city of Ayodhya, triggering communal violence that killed around 2,000 people across the country. Hindu groups claimed that the mosque stood where the Hindu deity Ram had been born. In 2019, the Supreme Court awarded the land where Babri Masjid had stood to Hindus and said that in the future the Places of Worship Act would be strictly enforced and no such Hindu claim against any mosque would be entertained by any court. Yet, over the past few years, right-wing Hindu groups have filed hundreds of petitions with courts across the country seeking control of many mosques and other Islamic structures claiming that they stood on the sites of razed Hindu temples. Professor and social activist Apoorvanand said that while the deaths in Sambhal are concerning, it is more worrying that Indian courts are 'too willing' to initiate processes aimed at turning sacred Islamic sites into disputed structures. 'Across India, courts are admitting petitions claiming that Islamic places of worship were earlier Hindu ones,' the Delhi University professor, who goes by only his first name, told VOA in an email. 'The violence at Sambhal also shows that the civil and police administration work as the coercive arms of the Hindutva bodies. They criminalize protests by Muslims and are not shy of firing on them at the first instance,' he added. Former chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, Zafarul-Islam Khan told VOA that old monuments like ancient mosques are 'easy targets' for Hindu nationalist forces because such sites usually do not have any documents from when they were first built. 'The Hindutva party, too, does not possess any papers or historical evidence. So, they demand a 'survey' of any particular mosque and such surveys are done by people sympathetic towards them, eager to support the Hindutva claim,' he said, adding that the Hindu Nationalist groups have prepared a list of 3,000 such mosques, which means that such anti-Muslim cases may continue for years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-top-court-weighs-in-on-mosque-temple-controversy/7882935.html	2024-11-30T19:26:16-08:00	
France accuses countries of 'obstruction' at plastic talks	BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA — France on Sunday accused a handful of countries of obstructing negotiations in South Korea to reach the world's first treaty to curb plastic pollution. 'We also are worried by the continuing obstruction by the so-called like-minded countries,' Olga Givernet, France's minister delegate for energy, told reporters, referring to a group of mostly oil-producing nations. Nearly 200 countries are in the port city of Busan for negotiations on a deal to curb plastic pollution, with only a few hours left on the clock. 'Finding an agreement for us on (an) ambitious treaty that reduces plastic pollution remains an absolute priority for France,' Givernet said. 'We are planning on pushing it, pushing it again.' More than 90% of plastic is not recycled, while plastic production is expected to triple by 2060. Efforts to reach the landmark agreement have been locked over several key sticking points, particularly reducing production and phasing out chemicals believed or known to harm human health. More than 100 countries back those measures and insist a treaty without them will fail to solve the pollution crisis. But around a dozen nations -- mostly producers of plastic precursors derived from fossil fuels -- are strongly opposed. 'We still have a few hours left in these negotiations, there is time to find common ground, but Rwanda cannot accept a toothless treaty,' said Juliet Kabera, director general of the Rwanda Environment Management Authority. The latest draft text remains full of opposing views and contradictory language, and a promised new version after long hours of negotiations into Saturday night has not yet been published.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-accuses-countries-of-obstruction-at-plastic-talks-/7882924.html	2024-11-30T18:37:44-08:00	
President-elect Trump has sought Orban's take on Ukraine war, sources say	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has held multiple phone conversations with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban since winning the November 5 presidential election, according to sources who spoke to RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service. Hungarian government sources said Trump has sought Orban’s opinion on ending the Ukraine war, which has continued to drag on since Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the billions of dollars that the United States has poured into Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. He has also said he could end the war within 24 hours of retaking the White House, a statement that some have interpreted as meaning that Ukraine would have to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. Orban, who has maintained friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, has been critical of EU aid for Ukraine and has obstructed the bloc’s sanctions regime against Moscow. Preparations reportedly are under way for Orban to take a second crack at a peace mission in December to bookend Hungary’s rotating EU presidency after his first attempt in July when Budapest’s tenure started. In a move criticized by several EU leaders, Orban traveled to Moscow to meet Putin in July after a trip to Kyiv with a mystery ceasefire proposal for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He then traveled to China and finally the United States to meet Trump, who was then on the presidential campaign trail. Details of a potential peace mission in December are not clear, but sources suggested to RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service that it may involve delivering Trump’s messages to Zelenskyy, Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.	https://www.voanews.com/a/president-elect-trump-has-sought-orban-s-take-on-ukraine-war-sources-say/7882921.html	2024-11-30T18:24:37-08:00	
Trump set to nominate former prosecutor to head FBI	WASHINGTON — Republican President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday night that he will nominate former National Security official and loyalist Kash Patel to lead the FBI, signaling an intent to replace the bureau's current director, Christopher Wray. Patel, who during Trump's first term advised both the director of national intelligence and the secretary of defense, has previously called for stripping the FBI of its intelligence-gathering role and purging its ranks of any employee who doesn’t support Trump's agenda. 'The biggest problem the FBI has had has come out of its intel shops. I'd break that component out of it. I'd shut down the FBI Hoover building on day one and reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state,' Patel said in a September interview on the conservative 'Shawn Ryan Show.' 'And I'd take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to chase down criminals. Go be cops. You're cops. Go be cops.' With the nomination of Patel, Trump is signaling that he is preparing to carry out his threat to oust Wray, a Republican first appointed by Trump, whose 10-year term at the FBI does not expire until 2027. FBI directors by law are appointed to 10-year terms as a means of insulating the bureau from politics. Wray, whom Trump tapped after firing James Comey in 2017 for investigating his 2016 campaign, has been a frequent target of Trump's supporters' ire. During Wray's tenure, the FBI carried out a court-approved search at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate to look for classified documents. He has also faced criticism for his oversight role of a directive by Attorney General Merrick Garland aimed at working to protect local school boards from violent threats and harassment. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the two federal prosecutions against Trump for his role in subverting the 2020 election and retaining classified documents, on November 25 asked the judges overseeing those cases to dismiss them before Trump takes office on January 20, citing a Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president. Wray had previously signaled no intention of stepping down early and was busy planning events well into his 2025 calendar, according to a person familiar with the matter. Patel, 44, who previously worked as a federal public defender and a federal prosecutor, emerged as a controversial figure during Trump's first term in the White House. He was instrumental in working to lead the House Republicans' probe into the FBI's 2016 investigation into contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia during his time as an aide to former House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes. Later, during Trump's first impeachment trial, ex-National Security Council official Fiona Hill told House investigators she was concerned that Patel was secretly serving as a back channel between Trump and Ukraine without authorization. Patel denied those allegations. After Trump left office in January 2021, Patel was one of several people Trump designated as a representative for access to his presidential records. He was one of the few former Trump administration officials who claimed, without evidence, that Trump had declassified all the records in question. He was later subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in connection with the probe. As a private citizen, Patel wrote a book called 'Government Gangsters' which Trump in 2023 declared would be used as a 'roadmap to end the Deep State's Reign.' Patel's nomination is likely to garner pushback from Senate Democrats and possibly even some Republicans, though Patel has received public support from some high-profile Republicans such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-set-to-nominate-former-prosecutor-to-head-fbi-/7882917.html	2024-11-30T18:06:35-08:00	
Namibia opposition leader says party will not recognize vote	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Namibia's top opposition presidential candidate, Panduleni Itula, said Saturday that his party would not recognize the results of a controversially extended election marred by chaos and allegations of foul play. Speaking just before the close of polls on the final day of voting, Itula, whose Independent Patriots for Change (IPC) is hoping to end 34 years of rule by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), said that no matter the result, 'the IPC shall not recognize the outcome of that election.' 'The rule of law has been grossly violated, and we cannot call these elections by any means or measure as free, fair and legitimate,' said Itula, who finished second in the 2019 vote. With just 10 of the country's 121 constituencies counted, partial results showed SWAPO's candidate, Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, leading with 48% of the vote, followed by Itula with 29%. Electoral authorities decided to prolong voting in the presidential and legislative polls, after the original election day — Wednesday — was marred by logistical and technical failures that led to hours-long queues, which some voters eventually abandoned. Opposition parties have complained about the chaos and alleged voter suppression by the authorities in the face of a strong turnout for the ruling party's rivals. An organization of southern African human rights lawyers serving as election monitors said that the delays at the ballot box were intentional and widespread. 'There were deliberate delays of voting processes in more than 63% of the total polling stations across the country,' the lawyers said in a report. Itula said that the IPC would 'fight... to nullify the elections through the processes that are established within our electoral process,' calling on Namibia's President Nangolo Mbumba to call a cabinet meeting 'to determine exactly what should be done.' On Saturday, hundreds of people queued up at the sole polling station in the capital Windhoek, where some 2,500 voters had cast their ballots Friday. Sielfriedt Gowaseb, 27, managed to vote in less than 30 minutes Saturday but was critical of the arrangements. 'They should have set up at least another polling station where the majority of Namibians live. We would have needed more venues, one in the suburbs. Most Namibians don't live in the central business district,' he said. Namibia's opposition is hoping to unseat SWAPO, which is facing its toughest challenge ever as disenchanted younger voters across southern Africa reject traditionally dominant liberation-era parties. SWAPO has governed Namibia since leading it to independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990, but high youth unemployment and enduring inequalities have eroded its support. Around 42% of the 1.5 million registered voters are aged under 35. Naita Hishoono, executive director of the Namibia Institute for Democracy, a nonpartisan group, echoed popular dissatisfaction. 'It would have been helpful to open more than 36 polling stations... each constituency should have at least one polling station open to accommodate everybody. Every voter should only stay half an hour to an hour in line and the whole voting process should take no more than 15 minutes,' she said. SWAPO's Nandi-Ndaitwah, 72, could become the first woman to lead the country if she is elected. But she is facing a fierce challenge from Itula, who said that Namibia had been 'betrayed' by the electoral authority's incompetence. The Electoral Commission of Namibia (ECN) has admitted to failures in the organization of the vote, including a shortage of ballot papers and the overheating of electronic tablets used to register voters. Itula, a former dentist and lawyer, came second in the last presidential election with 29% of the vote while standing as an independent. That performance was all the more remarkable for the fact it reduced SWAPO leader Hage Geingob's vote share to just 56%. Geingob, who died in February, had won nearly 87% of the vote five years before that.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-opposition-leader-says-party-will-not-recognize-vote/7882916.html	2024-11-30T17:45:12-08:00	
Biden makes historic first visit by US president to Angola	THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden is 'excited' to make his first trip to the African continent next week and will first stop briefly in the small island nation of Cabo Verde before making landfall in the Southwest African nation of Angola, a top White House official told VOA Friday. 'He is excited and really looking forward to the trip,' Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, told VOA at the White House. 'I think the president really sees this as a way to sum up all that he's tried to put forward during this administration on our Africa strategy.' While there, she said, he will work on three objectives: on bolstering regional security, notably in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo; on growing economic opportunities in the region; and on improving technological and scientific cooperation. 'He sees Angola as the perfect place for this,' she said. Some analysts say the fulfillment of Biden's vow to visit Africa — made in 2022 — is well overdue. Biden originally planned to visit Angola in October; he postponed that trip because Hurricane Milton was bearing down on the eastern United States. 'I think coming, as it does, at the very tail end of his administration, without much to, I think, really celebrate in terms of his involvement in Africa, that I think the visit will ring rather hollow,' Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA. The main attraction of the short visit is a major U.S.-financed development project: the 1,300-kilometer Lobito rail corridor, which connects the mineral-rich African interior to the southwestern port. The U.S. says it has pulled together more than $4 billion in U.S. investment on the project. When asked by VOA if Biden will attempt to discuss Angola's many documented human rights problems, Brown repeated a refrain often voiced by Biden administration officials, saying: 'he never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts.' The short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde could be seen as a way to balance this concern, Michael Walsh, a visiting researcher at the Lasky Center of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, told VOA. 'They're trying to, you know, add a stop that provides an opportunity for the Biden administration to say, look, we actually are visiting a flawed democracy as well as a hybrid regime,' he said. He added, 'That provides them with an opportunity to try to, I guess, mitigate some of the criticism that would be forthcoming during the visit by saying that the Biden administration isn't just stopping in one African country. They actually stopped in two and one of those is on the other side of the democracy spectrum.' Angola's president, Joao Lourenco, is a prominent figure on the African continent, using his status as leader of a subcontinental oil giant to build his influence and to work to settle conflicts near and far, both in neighboring Congo and in the West African 'coup belt.' This, Brown said, ties into one of Biden's core beliefs as he prepares to leave office: That the U.S. sees African nations as partners and problem-solvers. While there, she said, Biden plans to deliver remarks on how he sees the future of relations between Washington and the continent. 'I think he wants to leave behind his recognition that African leadership for solving some of these challenges is essential, and that's why he'll be amplifying Angola's role mediating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere,' she said. 'And I think he wants to convey the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angolan partnership, which is in many ways the story of the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-African relationship over many centuries.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-makes-historic-1st-visit-by-us-president-to-angola/7882003.html	2024-11-30T17:29:46-08:00

Trump names pardoned real estate developer Charles Kushner for US ambassador	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France. Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, calling Charles Kushner 'a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker.' Kushner is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. Jared Kushner is a former White House senior adviser to Trump who is married to Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka. The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after pleading guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Prosecutors alleged that after Charles Kushner discovered his brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation, he hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation. Kushner hired a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law, then arranged to have the encounter in a New Jersey motel room recorded with a hidden camera and the recording sent to his own sister, the man’s wife, prosecutors said. Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to 18 counts including tax evasion and witness tampering. He was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison — the most he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought. Christie has blamed Jared Kushner for his firing from Trump’s transition team in 2016, and has called Charles Kushner’s offenses 'one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was U.S. attorney.' Trump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles and their children were married in 2009.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-names-pardoned-real-estate-developer-charles-kushner-for-us-ambassador/7882913.html	2024-11-30T17:20:41-08:00	
Clashes erupt outside Georgia parliament between police, pro-EU protesters	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Violent clashes erupted on Saturday outside Georgia's parliament between police and demonstrators protesting the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis, Agence France-Presse reporters witnessed. Thousands of people gathered in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, on Saturday for a third night of protests that saw dozens of protesters arrested. The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-European opposition said was fraudulent. Masked police in riot gear fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons as they moved in to disperse protesters hurling fireworks, while flames were seen coming from a window of the parliament building. Demonstrators erected barricades on Tbilisi's main avenue. 'I am afraid — I won't hide it — that many people will get injured, but I am not afraid to stand here,' 39-year-old Tamar Gelashvili told AFP near the parliament building earlier in the day. Protests were also reported in numerous cities across Georgia. 'The actions of some individuals present at the protest became violent shortly after the demonstration began,' said the interior ministry. 'Police will respond appropriately and in accordance with the law to every violation.' More than 100 people have been arrested over the last two days, when law enforcement cracked down on protesters, firing water cannon and tear gas at demonstrators. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's announcement on Thursday that Georgia would not seek accession talks with the EU until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition. Critics accuse Georgian Dream, in power for more than a decade, of having steered the country away from the EU in recent years and of moving closer to Russia, an accusation it denies. Hundreds of public servants, including from the ministries of foreign affairs, defense and education, as well as a number of judges, issued joint statements protesting Kobakhidze's decision. Some 160 Georgian diplomats criticized the move as contradicting the constitution and leading the country 'into international isolation.' A number of Georgia's ambassadors resigned in protest. On Friday, AFP reporters saw riot police fire water cannon and tear gas at pro-EU protesters gathered outside parliament who tossed eggs and fireworks. Clashes broke out later between protesters and police, who moved in to clear the area, beating demonstrators — some of whom threw objects — and journalists, deliberately targeting those identified as members of the media. Georgia's special investigation service said it had opened a probe into 'allegations of abuse of official authority through violence by law enforcement officers against protesters and media representatives.' More than 100 schools and universities suspended academic activities in protest. Pro-Western opposition parties are boycotting the new parliament, while President Salome Zurabishvili, who is at loggerheads with Georgian Dream, has sought to annul the election results through the country's constitutional court. In an exclusive interview to AFP on Saturday, Zurabishvili said she will not step down until last month's contested parliamentary elections are re-run. The Paris-born former French diplomat said on Saturday that she had set up a 'national council' — consisting of opposition parties and civil society representatives — that will ensure 'stability in this country.' 'I will be the representative of this legitimate, stable transition.' After the October vote, a group of Georgia's leading election monitors said they had evidence of a complex scheme of large-scale electoral fraud. Brussels has demanded an investigation into what it said were serious irregularities reported by election monitors. Georgian Dream MPs voted unanimously on Thursday for Kobakhidze to continue as prime minister, even as the opposition boycotted parliament, deepening a serious legitimacy crisis at the legislature and the government. The crackdown on protests has provoked international condemnation. 'We condemn excessive force used against Georgians exercising their freedom to protest and have suspended our Strategic Partnership with Georgia,' U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Saturday. 'Georgian Dream's decision to suspend EU accession is a betrayal of the Georgian constitution.' France, Britain, Ukraine, Poland, Sweden and Lithuania were among the countries to voice concern. The human rights office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said: 'The action of law enforcement officials while policing peaceful protests in Georgia is of deep concern and a serious breach of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-erupt-outside-georgia-parliament-between-pro-eu-protesters-police-/7882908.html	2024-11-30T17:12:19-08:00	
Activists: Mexico breaks up 2 migrant caravans heading to US	TAPACHULA, Mexico — Mexican immigration authorities have broken up two small migrant caravans headed to the U.S. border, activists said Saturday. Some migrants were bused to cities in southern Mexico, and others were offered transit papers. The action comes a week after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican products unless the country does more to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. On Wednesday, Trump wrote that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States. Sheinbaum wrote on her social media accounts the same day that 'migrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the border.' Migrant rights activist Luis Garcia Villagran said the breaking-up of the two caravans appeared to be part of 'an agreement between the president of Mexico and the president of the United States.' The first of the caravans started out from the southern Mexico city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, on November 5, the day Trump was elected. At its height it had about 2,500 people. In almost four weeks of walking, it had gone about 270 miles (430 kilometers) to Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca. In Tehuantepec, Mexican immigration officials offered the tired migrants free bus rides to other cities in southern or central Mexico. 'They took some of us to Acapulco, others to Morelia, and others from our group to Oaxaca city,' said Barbara Rodriguez, an opposition supporter who left her native Venezuela after that country's contested presidential elections earlier this year. Rodriguez said by telephone she later caught a bus on her own to Mexico City. The second caravan of about 1,500 migrants set out on November 20 and made it about 140 miles (225 kilometers) to the town of Tonala, in Chiapas state. There, authorities offered a sort of transit visa that allows travel across Mexico for 20 days. Sheinbaum has said she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted. But her statement — the day after she held a phone call with Trump — did not make clear who had offered what. Apart from the much larger first caravans in 2018 and 2019 — which were provided buses to ride part of the way north — no caravan has ever reached the U.S. border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way, though some individual members have made it. For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/activists-mexico-breaks-up-2-migrant-caravans-heading-to-us-/7882905.html	2024-11-30T16:52:51-08:00	
Snow blankets parts of US during busy holiday travel weekend	BUFFALO, NEW YORK — The first big snowfall of the season blanketed towns along Lake Erie on Saturday in the middle of the hectic holiday travel and shopping weekend. Numbing cold and heavy snow are forecast to persist into next week and cause hazards in the Great Lakes, Plains and Midwest regions. The heavy snow led to a state of emergency declaration in parts of New York and a disaster declaration in Pennsylvania, with officials warning of dangerous conditions for Thanksgiving travelers trying to return home. 'Travel will be extremely difficult and hazardous this weekend, especially in areas where multiple feet of snow may accumulate very quickly,' the National Weather Service said. Part of I-90 in Pennsylvania was closed, as were westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania. Nearly 2 feet (61 centimeters) of snow fell in parts of New York, Ohio and Michigan, and 29 inches (73 centimeters) was recorded in Pennsylvania's northwestern tip. With roads in some parts impassable in northwestern Pennsylvania, scores of people took refuge overnight in the lobby and hallways of a fully booked Holiday Inn near I-90. Hotel staffer Jeremiah Weatherley said dozens of people rolled in as the snow piled up, and workers opened the conference room and gave them blankets to sleep on the floor. 'It was hard to manage, but we had no choice,' he said. 'They just showed up, and we don't want to turn people away.' Weatherley was handing out bagels, juice and cereal Saturday morning as people helped one another dig out their cars from the snow. 'Everyone helped each other,' he said. 'It was pretty cool.' This week's blast of Arctic air also brought temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average to the Northern Plains, the weather service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the United States by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees below average. Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow that have been rolling off Lake Superior for the past three days buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 2 feet (61 centimeters) or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's office in Marquette, Michigan. Twenty-seven inches (69 centimeters) of snow was on the ground just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula's western reaches, she said. Another 2 feet (61 centimeters) fell in Munising, in the eastern part of the peninsula. Chapman said continued lake-effect snow could add more than a foot (30.5 centimeters) over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 centimeters) or higher to the west. Meanwhile steady winds that trained snow bands Friday on Gaylord, Michigan, dumped 24.8 inches (63 centimeters), setting a new single-day record for the city, which sits in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger, a meteorologist with the weather service's Gaylord office. The previous record of 17.0 inches (43 centimeters) was from March 9, 1942. The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 80 acres (32 hectares) of ski hill terrain among its 2,000 acres (809 hectares), said Doug Hoeh, the resort's director of recreation. It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will be adding to in the coming days before the resort opens for the season next weekend. 'Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it's great for the snow hills, but it's bad for the parking lots, so we're kind of digging out,' Hoeh said. 'But we're close to being ready to pull the trigger on skiing, and the natural snowfall definitely helps.' In Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro signed a proclamation of disaster emergency and said parts of Erie County in the state's northwest had already received nearly 2 feet (1 meter) of snow with more expected through Monday night. State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/snow-blankets-parts-of-us-during-busy-holiday-travel-weekend-/7882903.html	2024-11-30T16:35:37-08:00	
9 killed in Ethiopia Oromia region attack	ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — Residents and relatives say at least nine people were killed during an attack in the Arsi Zone of the Oromia region of Ethiopia on Thursday. Adebebu Workineh is a resident of the Shirka Woreda — or district — in the Arsi Zone, about 250 kilometers southeast of Addis Ababa. He told VOA his younger brother, Haile Workineh, was among the nine victims. 'The perpetrators called him from his house and later killed him at a nearby river alongside others,' Workineh said in Amharic. Among the dead were women and elders, he added. 'During the raid I heard [about] the abduction by phone, but I thought they would ask for ransom as usual. They were carrying rifles, and we were afraid to confront them at the time,' he said in Amharic. A second resident of Shirka, who would not give his name because of fear for his safety, said most of the victims were Christians. The whereabouts of four other people who were abducted are not known, he told VOA. Social media sites published purported video of nine bodies wrapped in white clothes being buried together. VOA was not able to independently verify the video. The Arsi Zone, a region known for agriculture, is now marred by violence and killing. Residents blamed the Oromo Liberation Army, an outlawed rebel group fighting against the Ethiopian government army, for the killings. Jiregna Gudeta, an adviser to the OLA commander, told VOA he has no detailed information about the incident and denied OLA was involved. Residents say local authorities do little to protect civilians. The ENAT Party, one of the opposition political parties in Ethiopia, has condemned the attack. 'Our concern is not the dead ones, we [are] reaching out to the state officers for the people who are about to be the victim of such killing, we immediately call for the state to act,' said Getnet Worku, secretary-general of the party. Oromia regional authorities declined to comment on the attack. Peace rallies were held in six zones in the Oromia region in mid-November. Participants of the demonstrations said the aim was to condemn OLA and demand peace in the region. Oromia region spokesperson Hailu Adugna said at the time that the rallies were organized by the local communities and that government officials had no role. But some witnesses told VOA that government officials were urging people to participate in the demonstrations. Jiregna, reacting to the demonstrations in mid-November, said their group is ready to resolve conflicts peacefully. He said it is doubtful whether the people or the government organized the rally for peace. A previous round of peace talks last year between Ethiopia's federal government and the OLA in Tanzania's semi-autonomous island of Zanzibar — has failed to end the violence. The two sides blamed each other for the failure of the talks. The government cited 'unrealistic demands' by the armed group while OLA accused the government of failing to address 'fundamental problems' facing the country, according to Reuters. This story originated in VOA's Horn of Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-ethiopia-oromia-region-attack/7882733.html	2024-11-30T15:36:38-08:00	
After entering Aleppo, Syrian insurgents advance to nearby province	BEIRUT — Thousands of Syrian insurgents took over most of Aleppo on Saturday, establishing positions in the city and controlling its airport before expanding their shock offensive to a nearby province. They faced little to no resistance from government troops, according to fighters and activists. A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham seized control of Aleppo International Airport, the first international airport to be controlled by insurgents. Thousands of fighters moved on, facing almost no defense from government forces, to seize towns and villages in northern Hama, a province where they had a presence before being expelled by government troops in 2016. They claimed Saturday evening to have entered Hama city. The surprise offensive is a huge embarrassment for Syria's President Bashar Assad and raised questions about his armed forces' preparedness. The insurgent offensive launched from their stronghold in the country's northwest appeared to have been planned for years. It comes at a time when Assad's allies were preoccupied with their own conflicts. Turkey, a main backer of Syrian opposition groups, said its diplomatic efforts had failed to stop government attacks on opposition-held areas in recent weeks, which were in violation of a de-escalation agreement sponsored by Russia, Iran and Ankara. Turkish security officials said a limited offensive by the rebels was planned to stop government attacks and allow civilians to return, but the offensive expanded as Syrian government forces began to retreat from their positions. Two-pronged attack The insurgents, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and including Turkey-backed fighters, launched their shock offensive Wednesday. They first staged a two-pronged attack in Aleppo and the Idlib countryside, entering Aleppo two days later and securing a strategic town that lies on the highway that links the city to the capital and the coast. By Saturday evening, they seized at least four towns in the central Hama province and claimed to have entered the provincial capital. Syria's armed forces said in a statement Saturday that to absorb the large attack on Aleppo and save lives, it redeployed troops and equipment and was preparing a counterattack. The statement acknowledged that insurgents entered large parts of the city but said they have not established bases or checkpoints. Later Saturday, the armed forces sought to dispel what it said were lies about its forces retreating or defecting, saying the general command was carrying out its duties in 'combatting terrorist organizations.' The return of the insurgents to Aleppo was their first since 2016, following a grueling military campaign in which Assad's forces were backed by Russia, Iran and its allied groups. The 2016 battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters after 2011 protests of Assad's rule turned into an all-out war. After appearing to be losing control of the country to the rebels, the Aleppo battle secured Assad's hold on strategic areas of Syria, with opposition factions and their foreign backers controlling areas on the periphery. This week's lightning offensive threatened to reignite the country's civil war, which had been largely in a stalemate for years. Late Friday, witnesses said two airstrikes hit the edge of Aleppo, targeting insurgent reinforcements and falling near residential areas. The Observatory said 20 fighters were killed. Insurgents were filmed outside police headquarters, in the city center, and outside the Aleppo citadel, the medieval palace in the old city center, and one of the largest in the world. They tore down posters of Assad. The push into Aleppo followed weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. The offensive came as Iran-linked groups, primarily Lebanon's Hezbollah, which has backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battles at home. A ceasefire in Hezbollah's two-month war with Israel took effect Wednesday, the same day that Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days. Speaking from the heart of the city in Saadallah Al-Jabri square, opposition fighter Mohammad Al Abdo said it was his first time back in Aleppo in 13 years, when his older brother was killed at the start of the war. Abdulkafi Alhamdo, a teacher who fled Aleppo in 2016 and returned Friday night after hearing the insurgents were inside, described 'mixed feelings of pain, sadness and old memories.' 'As I entered Aleppo, I kept telling myself this is impossible. How did this happen?' Alhamdo said he walked through the city at night visiting the Aleppo citadel, where the insurgents raised their flags, a major square and the university of Aleppo, as well as the last spot he was in before he was forced to leave for the countryside. 'I walked in (the empty) streets of Aleppo, shouting, 'People, people of Aleppo. We are your sons,'' he told The Associated Press in a series of messages. Aleppo residents reported hearing clashes and gunfire, but most stayed indoors. Some fled the fighting. Schools and government offices were closed Saturday as most people stayed indoors, according to Sham FM radio, a pro-government station. Bakeries were open. Witnesses said the insurgents deployed security forces around the city to prevent any acts of violence or looting. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday Aleppo's two key public hospitals were reportedly full of patients while many private facilities closed. In social media posts, the insurgents were pictured outside of the citadel, the medieval palace in the old city center, and one of the largest in the world. The Syrian Kurdish-led administration in the country's east said nearly 3,000 people, most of them students, had arrived in their region after fleeing the fighting in Aleppo, which has a sizeable Kurdish population. On a state TV morning show Saturday, commentators said army reinforcements and Russia's assistance would repel the 'terrorist groups,' blaming Turkey for supporting the insurgents' push into Aleppo and Idlib provinces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-entering-aleppo-syrian-insurgents-advance-to-nearby-province-/7882716.html	2024-11-30T15:11:22-08:00	
Hamas releases video of US-Israeli hostage in Gaza	JERUSALEM — The Palestinian militant group Hamas released on Saturday a video of an Israeli-American hostage pleading for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to secure his release. The mother of hostage Edan Alexander said she was shaken by the 3 1/2-minute video that showed the 20-year-old captive looking pale and seated in a dark space against a wall. He identified himself and addressed his family, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump. The video 'gives us hope, but it also shows how difficult it is for Edan and for the other hostages, and how much they are crying out and praying for us to rescue them,' his mother, Yael Alexander, said at a Tel Aviv rally calling for the hostages' release. 'My dear, beloved Edan, we miss you painfully,' she said before she called on Israel's leaders to end the war in Gaza and make a deal with Hamas to release the hostages. Netanyahu said in a statement that the video was cruel psychological warfare and that he had told Alexander's family in a phone call that Israel was working tirelessly to bring the hostages home. Alexander, a soldier at the time, was abducted and taken to Gaza during the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on southern Israel. Around half of the 101 foreign and Israeli hostages still held incommunicado in Gaza are believed to still be alive. Hamas leaders were expected to arrive in Cairo on Saturday for ceasefire talks with Egyptian officials to explore ways to reach a deal that could secure the release of hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners. The fresh bid comes after Washington said this week it was reviving efforts toward that goal. The Hostages Families Forum urged the administrations of both outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and Trump — who takes office in January — to step up efforts to secure a hostage release. 'The hostages' lives hang by a thread,' the group said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-releases-video-of-us-israeli-hostage-in-gaza-/7882705.html	2024-11-30T13:58:55-08:00	
Trump threatens BRICS nations with 100% tariff if they replace US dollar	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs Saturday against a bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. His threat was directed at countries in the so-called BRICS alliance, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members of the alliance, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. While the U.S. dollar is by far the most-used currency in global business and has survived past challenges to its preeminence, members of the alliance and other developing nations say they are fed up with America's dominance of the global financial system. Trump, in a Truth Social post, said, 'We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy.' At a summit of BRICS nations in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the U.S. of 'weaponizing' the dollar and described it as a 'big mistake.' 'It's not us who refuse to use the dollar,' Putin said at the time. 'But if they don't let us work, what can we do? We are forced to search for alternatives.' Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network, SWIFT, and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Trump said there is 'no chance' BRICS will replace the U.S. dollar in global trade and any country that tries to make that happen 'should wave goodbye to America.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-threatens-brics-nations-with-100-tariff-if-they-replace-us-dollar-/7882696.html	2024-11-30T13:16:28-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau returns home without assurances US tariffs are off table	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau returned home Saturday after his meeting with Donald Trump without assurances the president-elect will back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner. Trump called the talks productive but signaled no retreat from a pledge that Canada says unfairly lumps it in with Mexico over the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States. After the leaders' hastily arranged dinner Friday night at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trudeau spoke of 'an excellent conversation.' Trump said in a Truth Social post later Saturday that they discussed 'many important topics that will require both Countries to work together to address.' Among the issues in need of such cooperation, Trump cited fentanyl and the 'Drug Crisis that has decimated so many lives as a result of Illegal Immigration,' fair trade deals 'that do not jeopardize American Workers' and the U.S. trade deficit with its ally to the north. Trump asserted that the prime minister had made 'a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation' of American families from fentanyl from China reaching the United States through its neighbors. The U.S., he said, 'will no longer sit idly by as our Citizens become victims to the scourge of this Drug Epidemic.' The Republican president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders when he takes office in January. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024 — and Canadian officials say they are ready to make new investments in border security. Trudeau called Trump after the Republican's social media posts about the tariffs last Monday and they agreed to meet, according to an official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the private talks. The official said other countries are calling Canadian officials to hear how the meeting was arranged and to ask for advice. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, after speaking with Trump on the telephone, said Thursday she was confident a tariff war with Washington would be averted. At the dinner that was said to last three hours, Trump said he and Trudeau also discussed energy, trade and the Arctic. A second official cited defense, Ukraine, NATO, China, the Mideast, pipelines and the Group of Seven meeting in Canada next year as other issues that arose. Trudeau's office said in a statement that the leaders 'shared a productive wide-ranging discussion' centering on 'collaboration and strengthening our relationship,' adding, 'As Canada's closest friend and ally, the United States is our key partner, and we are committed to working together in the interests of Canadians and Americans.' Trump, during his first term as president, once called Trudeau 'weak' and 'dishonest,' but it was the prime minister who was the first G7 leader to visit Trump since the November 5 election. 'Tariffs are a crucial issue for Canada and a bold move was in order. Perhaps it was a risk, but a risk worth taking,' said Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. Trudeau said Friday that Trump was elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries but now was talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products, including potatoes from Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada. 'It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There's no question about it,' Trudeau said. 'Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for Americans citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,' he said. The threatened tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump's team negotiated during his first term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully renegotiate the deal, which he calls a win for both countries. When Trump imposed higher tariffs as president, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada's exports go to the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7882686.html	2024-11-30T12:48:49-08:00	
Kosovo arrests 8 linked to canal explosion, tensions with Serbia rise	PRISTINA, KOSOVO — Kosovo's Interior minister Xhelal Svecla said Saturday that police had arrested eight people after an explosion hit a canal that sends water to its two main power plants, an incident Pristina labeled a 'terrorist act' by neighboring Serbia. 'Somehow we managed to fix the damage, arrest the suspects and confiscate a huge arsenal of weapons,' Svecla said during a live-streamed news conference. Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic denied what he said were 'baseless accusations' about Belgrade's involvement in the incident, which occurred Friday around 7 p.m. (1800 GMT). Police commander Gazmend Hoxha said those arrested 'are suspected of inciting, organizing and even executing these recent terrorist acts and in particular the one in the canal of Iber Lepenc.' Hoxha said an initial investigation had shown that between 15 and 20 kilos of explosives were used in the attack. Police raided 10 locations, confiscating more than 200 military uniforms, six shoulder-fired rocket launchers, long weapons, pistols and ammunition, he said. Police said most of the people arrested belong to the local Serb organization Civilna Zastita (Civil Protection), which the government in Kosovo has declared as a terrorist organization. Reuters was unable to contact the group. Tensions with Serbia The explosion has increased tensions between the two Balkan countries. Ethnic Albanian-majority Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 almost a decade after a guerrilla uprising against its rule, but Serbia has not recognized Kosovo as an independent state. Relations remain especially frayed in the north of the country where the blast occurred, and where the Serb minority refuses to recognize Kosovo's statehood and still sees Belgrade as their capital. Kosovo's Security Council, which held emergency talks early Saturday, said it had activated armed forces to prevent similar attacks. Security was already heightened after two recent attacks where hand grenades were hurled at a police station and municipality building in northern Kosovo where ethnic Serbians live. 'The Security Council has approved additional measures to strengthen security around critical facilities and services such as bridges, transformer stations, antennas, lakes, canals,' the council said in a statement Saturday. NATO, which has maintained a peacekeeping force in Kosovo since 1999, condemned the attack in a statement Saturday. Its personnel have provided security to the canal and the surrounding area since the blast, it said. A Reuters reporter visited the site Saturday, where silt had poured through a hole in the canal's concrete wall. Workers had installed a series of large tubes to bypass the leak. Power supplies appeared to be largely intact, but the drinking water supply was disrupted in some areas. Energy minister Artane Rizvanolli said Kosovo was coordinating with Albania's power company to provide more electricity. She said water will be trucked to affected areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7882675.html	2024-11-30T12:19:35-08:00	
Russian police raid Moscow nightclubs in LGBTQ+ crackdown	MOSCOW — Russian police raided several bars and nightclubs across Moscow on Saturday as part of the government’s crackdown on 'LGBTQ+ propaganda,' state media reported. Smartphones, laptops and video cameras were seized, while clubgoers had their documents inspected by officers, Russia’s Tass news agency said, citing sources in law enforcement. The raids come exactly a year since Russia’s Supreme Court ruled that the 'LGBTQ+ movement should be banned as an 'extremist organization.' Its decision followed a decadeslong crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has touted 'traditional family values' as a cornerstone of his quarter-century in power. Footage shared on social media appeared to show police ordering partygoers to lie on the floor as officers moved through Moscow’s Arma nightclub. The capital’s Mono bar was also targeted, Russian media reported. In a post on Telegram on Saturday, the club’s management didn't directly reference an incident with law enforcement, but wrote, 'Friends, we’re so sorry that what happened, happened. They didn’t find anything forbidden. We live in such times, but life must go on.' Police also detained the head of the 'Men Travel' tour agency Saturday under anti-LGBT laws, Tass reported. The news agency said that the 48-year-old was suspected of preparing a trip for 'the supporters of nontraditional sexual values' to visit Egypt over Russia’s New Year's holidays. The raids mirror the concerns of Russian activists who warned that Moscow’s designation of the 'LGBTQ+ movement' as 'extremist' — despite it not being an official entity — could see Russian authorities crack down at will on groups or individuals. Other recent laws have also served to put pressure on those that the Russian government believes aren't in line with the country’s 'traditional values.' On November 23, Putin signed into law a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender-affirming care is legal. The Kremlin leader also approved legislation that outlaws the spread of material that encourages people not to have children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-police-raid-moscow-nightclubs-in-lgbtq-crackdown-/7882661.html	2024-11-30T11:56:06-08:00	
Rapid collapse of Syrian forces around Aleppo stuns many	CAIRO — The rapid collapse of Syrian government forces inside and around the country's second-largest city, Aleppo, has caught many observers by surprise and is causing a domino effect on many parts of the country. Rebel fighters, who oppose Syrian President Bashar Assad and include those from the terrorist Jabhat al Nusra group, fired weapons Saturday inside Syria's northern 'economic capital' of Aleppo after the withdrawal of government forces from the city. Amateur video showed rebel fighters in control of Aleppo's central Saadallah Jabari Square, in addition to Aleppo University and the city's provincial government headquarters. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV reported that Syrian government forces also withdrew from Aleppo's civilian and military airports. Abu Dhabi-based Sky News Arabia showed amateur video of rebels apparently in control of the military airport. Britain-based Syrian analyst Rami Abdulrahman, of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told Arab media that Iranian forces and their proxy militia allies have withdrawn from many positions in and around Aleppo. Abdulrahman said that Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces withdrew from the region after a drone attacked them and their allies, including Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite militia fighters, who pulled out alongside them. Arab media reported that the entire region between Aleppo and the rebel-controlled province of Idlib had fallen and that large towns south of Aleppo on the main Aleppo-Damascus highway, including Saraqib and Maarat al-Numan, also were captured. It was not clear if other large Syrian cities would fall, but Joshua Landis, who heads the Middle East studies program at the University of Oklahoma, told VOA that all eyes are now on Hama, which is Syria's fourth-largest city. Landis said he believes it is possible the capital of Damascus may fall, because government supporters are dispirited and have lost the will to fight. Despite Turkish government denials, Landis says the entire operation has 'Turkish fingerprints written all over it,' since 'all the arms and food and money that enter Idlib come from Turkey.' 'I'm sure Turkey wanted to give Assad a slap in the face and bring him to the [negotiating] table,' Landis said, 'but it's clearly set off dominoes that I don't think anyone expected [to fall].' Landis said there are several reasons for Assad's weakness, including Israel's 'pulling the stuffing out of [his ally] Hezbollah' and the 'relentless Israeli pounding of Syrian government positions' and those of their allies inside the country since the outset of the Gaza conflict on October 7, 2023. Syrian analysts also told Arab media that the Iran-Syria axis 'has been weakened since the road from Tehran to Beirut is no longer open and arms are no longer able to reach Iran's proxy militia allies. In addition, Syrian ally Russia 'has its hands tied at the moment because of its conflict with Ukraine.' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan denied that his government had any responsibility in the Syrian rebel onslaught on Aleppo. 'Turkey is playing an increasing role in trying to achieve peace in the region.' Russian forces reportedly pulled out of several strategic positions in the region overnight, but Russian and Syrian warplanes bombed rebel forces in Aleppo and other parts of the region, causing numerous rebel casualties, according to the Syrian military.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rapid-collapse-of-syrian-forces-around-aleppo-stuns-many/7882626.html	2024-11-30T10:27:37-08:00	
East African summit urges peace in eastern Congo	ARUSHA, TANZANIA — East African heads of state made another push for peace Saturday in eastern Congo, but its prospects remained bleak following a regional summit that was marked by the Congolese president's absence and an early departure of his Rwandan counterpart. A communique read at the end of the closed-door meeting of the East African Community in Arusha, Tanzania, stated only the need to combine regional and broader peace initiatives for sustainable peace in eastern Congo. Violence has reemerged in one of the world's most protracted conflicts in eastern Congo, where Congo’s government accused the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group of 'ethnic cleansing' in mineral-rich areas close to Rwanda's border. Rwandan President Paul Kagame left shortly after the closed-door meeting in Arusha. There was no official explanation for Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi's absence at the summit. Congo alleges that Rwanda has been involved in war crimes in the east, and U.S. and U.N. experts accuse it of giving military backing to M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces but fighting between M23 and other militias continues. Other leaders at the summit were Presidents Salva Kiir of South Sudan, Samia Suluhu Hassan of Tanzania, William Ruto of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia. Burundi was represented by its vice president. Ruto was elected as the new chairperson of the EAC Summit, succeeding Kiir. 'Our focus must be on increasing competitiveness, promoting value-added production and boosting intra-regional trade to create jobs and transform our economies,' Ruto said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/east-african-summit-urges-peace-in-eastern-congo/7882618.html	2024-11-30T10:16:30-08:00	
Polish leader visits defensive fortifications on border with Russia	DABROWKA, POLAND — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk traveled Saturday to his country's border with the Russian region of Kaliningrad to inspect progress in the construction of military fortifications along the eastern frontier, calling it 'an investment in peace.' Tusk’s visit comes a month before Poland is to take over the rotating presidency of the 27-member European Union. Polish officials say their priority is to urge Europeans to beef up defenses at a time of Russian aggression and with change coming soon in Washington. Some European leaders are concerned that the incoming administration of Donald Trump might be less committed to Europe’s defense. Tusk also proposed this week that Poland and the Nordic and Baltic countries carry out joint navy patrols in the strategically important Baltic Sea, following the suspected sabotage of undersea data cables. Poland's government and army began building the system dubbed East Shield this year. It will eventually include approximately 800 kilometers (500 miles) along the Polish borders with Russia and Belarus, at a time when Western officials accuse Russia of waging hybrid attacks against the West that include sabotage, the weaponization of migration, disinformation and other hostile measures. 'The better the Polish border is guarded, the more difficult it is to access for those with bad intentions,' Tusk said at a news conference near the village of Dabrowka as he stood in front of concrete antitank barriers. Poland has been at the mercy of aggressive neighbors over the past centuries and has become a leading European voice for security at a time when France and Germany are weakened by internal political problems. Poland aims to spend 4.7% of its gross domestic product on defense next year, making it one of NATO's leaders in defense spending. Tusk's government estimates that the strategic military project will cost at least 10 billion zlotys ($2.5 billion). Poland’s borders with Russia, Belarus — as well as Ukraine — are the easternmost external borders of the European Union and NATO. Tusk said he expected the East Shield to eventually be expanded to protect the small Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 'Everything we are doing here — and we will also be doing this on the border with Belarus and Ukraine — is to deter and discourage a potential aggressor, which is why it is truly an investment in peace,' Tusk said. 'We will spend billions of zlotys on this, but right now the whole of Europe is observing these investments and our actions with great satisfaction and will support them if necessary.' Tusk did not elaborate on his plans for reinforcing the border with Ukraine, a close ally. Along the frontier, antitank barriers known as 'hedgehogs' will be integrated with natural barriers like ditches. Tusk said parts of the project are not visible to the naked eye, but it is nonetheless the largest project of its nature in Europe since the end of World War II. The plans also include the construction of threat reconnaissance and detection systems, forward bases, logistics hubs, warehouses and the deployment of antidrone systems, the state news agency PAP reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polish-leader-visits-defensive-fortifications-on-border-with-russia/7882608.html	2024-11-30T10:09:20-08:00	
What to know about plastic pollution crisis as treaty talks conclude	BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA — The world’s nations will wrap up negotiating a treaty this weekend to address the global plastic pollution crisis. Their meeting is scheduled to conclude Sunday or early Monday in Busan, South Korea, where many environmental organizations have flocked to push for a treaty to address the volume of production and toxic chemicals used in plastic products. Greenpeace said it escalated its pressure Saturday by sending four international activists to Daesan, South Korea, who boarded a tanker headed into port to load chemicals used to make plastics. Graham Forbes, who leads the Greenpeace delegation in Busan, said the action is meant to remind world leaders they have a clear choice: Deliver a treaty that protects people and the planet, or side with industry and sacrifice the health of every living person and future generations. Here’s what to know about plastics: Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. The use of plastics has quadrupled over the past 30 years. Plastic is ubiquitous. And every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic are dumped into the world’s oceans, rivers and lakes, the U.N. said. Most nations agreed to make the first global, legally binding plastic pollution accord, including in the oceans, by the end of 2024. Plastic production could climb about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. The production and use of plastics globally is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, according to the intergovernmental Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Panama is leading an effort to address the exponential growth of plastic production as part of the treaty, supported by more than 100 countries. There’s just too much plastic, said Juan Carlos Monterrey, head of Panama’s delegation. 'If we don’t have production in this treaty, it is not only going to be horribly sad, but the treaty may as well be called the greenwashing recycling treaty, not the plastics treaty,' he said in an interview. 'Because the problem is not going to be fixed.' China, the United States and Germany are the biggest plastics players. China was by far the biggest exporter of plastic products in 2023, followed by Germany and the U.S., according to the Plastics Industry Association. Together, the three nations account for 33% of the total global plastics trade, the association said. The United States supports having an article in the treaty that addresses supply, or plastic production, a senior member of the U.S. delegation told The Associated Press Saturday. Most plastic ends up as waste Less than 10% of plastics are recycled. Most of the world’s plastic goes to landfills, pollutes the environment or is burned. Sarah Dunlop, head of plastics and human health at the Minderoo Foundation, said chemicals are leaching out of plastics and 'making us sick.' The International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Plastics held an event about the impact of plastics Saturday on the sidelines of the talks. They want the treaty to fully recognize their rights and the universal human right to a healthy, clean, safe and sustainable environment. Juan Mancias of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation in Texas spoke about feeling a spiritual connection to the land. 'Five hundred years ago, we had clean water, clean air, and there was no plastics,' he said. 'What happened?' Many plastics are used for packaging About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations. This includes single-use plastic food and beverage containers — water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, straws and shopping bags — that often end up polluting the environment. U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen told negotiators in Busan the treaty must tackle this problem. 'Are there specific plastic items that we can live without, those that so often leak into the environment? Are there alternatives to these items? This is an issue we must agree on,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-to-know-about-plastic-pollution-crisis-as-treaty-talks-conclude/7882600.html	2024-11-30T09:53:27-08:00	
More than 100 Rohingya refugees rescued off Indonesia, UN says	BANDA ACEH, INDONESIA — More than 100 Rohingya refugees, including women and children, have been rescued after their boat sank off the coast of Indonesia, the United Nations refugee agency said Saturday. The mostly Muslim ethnic Rohingya are heavily persecuted in Myanmar and thousands risk their lives each year on long and dangerous sea journeys to reach Malaysia or Indonesia. 'We received a report from the East Aceh government that there are 116 refugees in total,' UNHCR's Faisal Rahman told AFP on Saturday. 'The refugees are still on the beach right now; it has not been decided where they would be taken,' Rahman said. He said the flimsy wooden boat carrying the Rohingyas was found half-submerged not far from the beach off the coast of northeastern Sumatra island. Local fisherman Saifudin Taher said the boat was first spotted entering East Aceh waters Saturday morning, and a few hours later it nearly sank. 'All passengers survived, but one of them was ill and ... immediately received treatment,' Saifudin told AFP, adding that the boat was only 100 meters away from the shore and that the refugees could walk easily to safety. Rohingya arrivals in Indonesia tend to follow a cyclical pattern, slowing during the stormy months and picking back up when sea conditions calm down. Last month, 152 Rohingya refugees were finally brought ashore after being anchored for days off the coast of South Aceh district while officials decided whether to let them land. Indonesia is not a signatory to the U.N. refugee convention and says it cannot be compelled to take in refugees from Myanmar, calling instead on neighboring countries to share the burden and resettle Rohingya who arrive on its shores. Many Acehnese, who have memories of decades of bloody conflict themselves, are sympathetic to the plight of their fellow Muslims. But others say their patience has been tested, claiming the Rohingya consume scarce resources and occasionally come into conflict with locals. In December 2023, hundreds of students forced the relocation of more than 100 Rohingya refugees, storming a community hall in Aceh where they were sheltering and vandalizing their belongings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-100-rohingya-refugees-rescued-off-indonesia-un-says/7882564.html	2024-11-30T09:07:43-08:00	
Ukraine says war has damaged most of its civilian airports	KYIV, UKRAINE — Fifteen of Ukraine's civilian airports have been damaged since Russia invaded the country in February 2022, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal was quoted as saying by local media on Saturday. Ukraine, which the state aviation service says has 20 civilian airports, has been exploring avenues to partially open its airspace. It has been closed since the start of the war. Ukrainians who want to fly abroad currently must go via road or rail to neighboring countries to catch flights. For those living in the east, the journey out of Ukraine can take a day in itself. 'We conducted a risk assessment and determined the needs of the air defense forces to partially open the airspace,' local news agency Ukrinform quoted Shmyhal as saying at a transportation conference. 'Security issues and the military situation remain key to this decision,' he said. Shmyhal said that Russia attacked Ukraine's port infrastructure nearly 60 times in the last three months, damaging or destroying nearly 300 facilities and 22 civilian vessels. A senior partner at insurance broker Marsh McLennan told Reuters earlier this month that Ukraine could reopen the airport in the western city of Lviv in 2025 if regulators deem it safe and a political decision is made.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-war-has-damaged-most-of-its-civilian-airports/7882524.html	2024-11-30T08:17:26-08:00

Taiwan's president departs for Pacific visit with 2-day stop in US	TAOYUAN, TAIWAN — Taiwan's president departed Saturday on a trip to the South Pacific that will include a two-day transit in the United States, his first since assuming office. The planned stopovers in Hawaii and the territory of Guam have already drawn fierce criticism from Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and objects to official exchanges between it and the U.S., the island's biggest backer and military provider. Lai Ching-te left on a weeklong trip to visit the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — three diplomatic allies of the self-governed island in the Pacific. 'I want to use the values of democracy, peace and prosperity to continue to expand our cooperation with our allies, to deepen our partnership and let the world see Taiwan not just as a model of democracy, but a vital power in promoting the world's peace and stability, and prosperous development,' he said at Taoyuan International Airport ahead of his departure. Although Taiwan retains strong contacts with dozens of other nations, it has only 12 formal diplomatic allies. The self-ruled democracy has recently been facing increasing pressure from China. It is unclear whether Lai will meet with any members of the incoming U.S. administration during his transit. President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S. Trump avoided answering whether he would defend the island from Chinese military action. On Friday, the U.S. State Department said it approved the sale of $385 million in spare parts and equipment for the fleet of F-16s, as well as support for a tactical communication system to Taiwan. While the U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act, it has maintained a position of strategic ambiguity over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by China. A second Trump administration is expected to test U.S.-China relations even more than the Republican’s first term, when the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion in Chinese products. Taiwan is one of the main sources of tension in the bilateral relationship. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday if the U.S. wanted to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it is important for it to handle the Taiwan issue 'with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China’s peaceful reunification.' She also said China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, including visits by Taiwan’s leaders to the U.S. for any reason. When former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen went to the U.S. last year as part of a transit to Latin America, it drew vocal opposition from China. Tsai met with the former House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the time. The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a 'stern warning' over what it called collusion between 'separatists and foreign forces' days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped over in the U.S. China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting the island, as it views any official contact with foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-president-departs-for-pacific-visit-with-2-day-stop-in-us/7882513.html	2024-11-30T08:05:39-08:00	
Kenya, Uganda to mediate Ethiopia-Somalia dispute	NAIROBI, KENYA — Kenyan President William Ruto said Saturday that he and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni will help mediate a dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia, which threatens the stability of the region. Landlocked Ethiopia, which has thousands of troops in Somalia to fight al-Qaida-linked insurgents, has fallen out with the Mogadishu government over its plans to build a port in the breakaway region of Somaliland in exchange for possible recognition of its sovereignty. Somaliland has struggled to gain international recognition, despite governing itself and enjoying comparative peace and stability since declaring independence in 1991. The spat has drawn Somalia closer to Egypt, which has quarreled with Ethiopia for years over Addis Ababa's construction of a vast hydro dam on the Nile River, and Eritrea, another of Ethiopia's foes. 'Because the security of Somalia ... contributes significantly to the stability of our region and the environment for investors and businesspeople and entrepreneurs to thrive,' Ruto said at a news conference. Several attempts to resolve the feud in Ankara, Turkey, failed to achieve a breakthrough. Ethiopia's government and foreign affairs spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Somalia's foreign minister could not immediately be reached by Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-uganda-to-mediate-ethiopia-somalia-dispute/7882430.html	2024-11-30T06:09:44-08:00	
Georgia arrests 107 more people as pro-EU protests continue	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Georgia on Saturday said authorities arrested 107 people during a second day of protests sparked by the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks. The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-EU opposition said was fraudulent. The Interior Ministry said 107 people were detained for 'disobedience to lawful police orders and petty hooliganism.' 'Throughout the night ... protesters threw various objects, including stones, pyrotechnics, glass bottles and metal items, at law enforcement officers,' it said, adding that '10 employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were injured.' The ministry earlier said 32 police officers were wounded and 43 protestors detained on Thursday. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's statement Thursday that Georgia will not seek to open accession talks with the European Union until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition and two days of protests. He later accused the opposition and the EU ambassador to Georgia of distorting his words. He insisted membership in the bloc 'by 2030' remains his 'top priority.' 'Resistance movement' On Friday, AFP reporters saw riot police fire water cannons and tear gas at pro-EU protesters gathered outside the parliament in Tbilisi, who tossed eggs and fireworks. Clashes broke out later between protesters and police, who moved in to clear the area outside parliament, beating demonstrators, some of whom threw objects. Independent TV station Pirveli said one of its journalists was hospitalized with serious injuries. Protests were also held in other cities across Georgia on Friday, independent TV station Mtavari reported. Pro-Western opposition parties are boycotting the new parliament, while President Salome Zurabishvili has sought to annul the election results through the country's constitutional court. In a televised address to the nation on Friday evening, the pro-Western president — who is at loggerheads with the ruling party — said: 'The resistance movement has begun. ... I stand in solidarity with it. We will remain united until Georgia achieves its goals: to return to its European path, secure new elections.' 'Brutal repression' After the October vote, a group of Georgia's leading election monitors said they had evidence of a complex scheme of large-scale electoral fraud. Brussels has demanded an investigation into what it said were 'serious irregularities' reported by election monitors. Georgian Dream MPs voted unanimously Thursday for Kobakhidze to continue as prime minister, even as the opposition boycotted parliament, which faces a serious legitimacy crisis. 'Police actions in Tbilisi mark another punitive attack on the right to peaceful assembly,' said Amnesty International. France, Britain, Ukraine, Poland, Sweden and Lithuania were among the countries to voice concern. The Council of Europe condemned what it described as 'brutal repression,' urging Georgia to remain 'faithful to European values.' In recent years, critics accused Georgian Dream — in power for more than a decade — of moving the country away from Europe and closer to Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7882387.html	2024-11-30T04:18:15-08:00	
Israeli military strikes kill 25 Palestinians in Gaza, medics say	The Israeli military said it killed a Palestinian it accused of involvement in Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel in a vehicle strike in the Gaza Strip, and is investigating claims that the person was an employee of aid group World Central Kitchen. At least 25 Palestinians were killed in Israeli military strikes across Gaza overnight and into Saturday, with most casualties reported in northern areas, medics told Reuters. Among those killed, at least seven died in an Israeli strike on a house in central Gaza City, according to a statement from Gaza Civil Defense and official Palestinian news agency WAFA early Saturday. Gaza Civil Defense also reported that one of its officers was killed in attacks in northern Gaza's Jabalia, bringing the total number of civil defense workers killed since October 7, 2023, to 88. Earlier on Saturday, WAFA reported that three employees of the World Central Kitchen, a U.S.-based, nongovernmental humanitarian agency, were killed when a civilian vehicle was targeted in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. The World Central Kitchen has not yet commented on the incident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-strikes-kill-25-palestinians-in-gaza-medics-say/7882381.html	2024-11-30T04:02:56-08:00	
Ukrainian president says NATO membership can end 'hot phase' of war	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says being admitted into NATO could end what he described as the 'hot phase of the war' waged by Russia. In an interview with Sky News aired on November 29, Zelenskyy suggested that he would be willing to consider a ceasefire if Ukraine’s unoccupied territories fell under NATO’s protection and the invitation to join the alliance recognized Ukraine’s international borders. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has been occupying 20% of Ukrainian territory since launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022. 'If we want to stop the hot phase of the war, we need to take under the NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control,' Zelenskyy said, adding that the occupied eastern parts of the country could then be taken back 'in a diplomatic way.' This comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the United States has poured into Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. Trump has also said he could end the war within 24 hours of retaking the White House, a statement that has been interpreted as meaning that Ukraine would have to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. Earlier this week, Trump named Keith Kellogg, a retired army lieutenant general who has long served as a top adviser to Trump on defense issues, as his nominee to be special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg has advocated telling the Ukrainians that if they don't come to the negotiating table, U.S. support would dry up, while telling Russian President Vladimir Putin that if he doesn't come to the table, the United States would give the Ukrainians 'everything they need to kill you in the field.' For the past several months, Russia has been battering Ukrainian cities with increasingly heavy drone, missile and glide-bomb strikes, causing casualties and damaging energy infrastructure as the cold season settles in. Earlier this month, a senior United Nations official, Rosemary DiCarlo, warned that Moscow's targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure could make this winter the 'harshest since the start of the war' nearly three years ago. Ukraine has launched several counterattacks since the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, the top foreign supporter of Ukraine in its battle against Russia's invasion, and Kyiv's European allies authorized the use of long-range missiles against targets inside Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-president-says-nato-membership-can-end-hot-phase-of-war/7882377.html	2024-11-30T03:54:25-08:00	
Iceland votes for new parliament amid disagreements on immigration, economy	REYKJAVIK, ICELAND — Icelanders will elect a new parliament Saturday after disagreements over immigration, energy policy and the economy forced Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson to pull the plug on his coalition government and call early elections. This is Iceland’s sixth general election since the 2008 financial crisis devastated the economy of the North Atlantic island nation and ushered in a new era of political instability. Opinion polls suggest the country may be in for another upheaval, with support for the three governing parties plunging. Benediktsson, who was named prime minister in April following the resignation of his predecessor, struggled to hold together the unlikely coalition of his conservative Independence Party with the centrist Progressive Party and the Left-Green Movement. Iceland, a nation of about 400,000 people, is proud of its democratic traditions, describing itself as arguably the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy. The island’s parliament, the Althingi, was founded in 930 by the Norsemen who settled the country. Here’s what to look for in the contest. How does the election work? Voters will choose 63 members of the Althingi in an election that will allocate seats both by regional constituencies and proportional representation. Parties need at least 5% of the vote to win seats in parliament. Eight parties were represented in the outgoing parliament, and 10 parties are contesting this election. Turnout is traditionally high by international standards, with 80% of registered voters casting ballots in the 2021 parliamentary election. Why now? A windswept island near the Arctic Circle, Iceland normally holds elections during the warmer months of the year. But on Oct. 13 Benediktsson decided his coalition couldn’t last any longer, and he asked President Halla Tómasdóttir to dissolve the Althingi. 'The weakness of this society is that we have no very strong party and we have no very strong leader of any party,’' said Vilhjálmur Bjarnson, a former member of parliament. 'We have no charming person with a vision … That is very difficult for us.' Why is Iceland's politics so fractured? The splintering of Iceland's political landscape came after the 2008 financial crisis, which prompted years of economic upheaval after its debt-swollen banks collapsed. The crisis led to anger and distrust of the parties that had traditionally traded power back and forth, and prompted the creation of new parties ranging from the environment focused Left-Green Alliance to the Pirate Party, which advocates direct democracy and individual freedoms. 'This is one of the consequences of the economic crash,' said Eva H. Önnudóttir, a professor of political science at the University of Iceland. 'It’s just the changed landscape. Parties, especially the old parties, have maybe kind of been hoping that we would go back to how things were before, but that’s not going to happen.' What are the issues? Like many Western countries, Iceland has been buffeted by the rising cost of living and immigration pressures. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 10.2% in February 2023, fueled by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While inflation slowed to 5.1% in October, that is still high compared with neighboring countries. The U.S. inflation rate stood at 2.6% last month, while the European Union’s rate was 2.3%. Iceland is also struggling to accommodate a rising number of asylum-seekers, creating tensions within the small, traditionally homogenous country. The number of immigrants seeking protection in Iceland jumped to more than 4,000 in each of the past three years, compared with a previous average of less than 1,000. What about the volcano? Repeated eruptions of a volcano in the southwestern part of the country have displaced thousands of people and strained public finances. One year after the first eruption forced the evacuation of the town of Grindavik, many residents still don’t have secure housing, leading to complaints that the government has been slow to respond. But it also added to a shortage of affordable housing exacerbated by Iceland’s tourism boom. Young people are struggling to get a foot on the housing ladder at a time when short-term vacation rentals have reduced the housing stock available for locals, Önnudóttir said. 'The housing issue is becoming a big issue in Iceland,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iceland-votes-for-new-parliament-amid-disagreements-on-immigration-economy-/7882357.html	2024-11-30T02:36:25-08:00	
As numbers of globetrotting Indians surge, many turn to Asia	NEW DELHI — The rebound of India’s economy in the wake of COVID-19 has spurred a renewed interest in overseas vacations by Indians, beyond prepandemic levels, with many of them now turning to Asian destinations. Travel companies say business is booming throughout the year, driven by growing disposable incomes in a growing middle class and an ambitious young population. 'Earlier travel picked up in the summer and festive seasons, but post the pandemic we have observed that Indians travel throughout the year. Younger Indians want to do multiple short-haul holidays while older people want to do longer overseas holidays,' according to Neil Patel, cofounder of Veena World, a Mumbai-based travel agency. Meanwhile, tastes are changing. While Europe, once the preferred holiday destination for many Indians, still remains popular, many are turning their attention to Asia -- from countries in the east like Japan and Vietnam to Middle Eastern destinations like Dubai and Abu Dhabi and Central Asian republics such as Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Some find the elaborate documentation required to visit a European country cumbersome. Others find Asian destinations far more affordable. After a European vacation in 2022, Kumkum Sharma and her husband, Vinayak Gawankar, have turned their attention to Southeast Asia. Last year, the Mumbai-based couple headed to Singapore and Malaysia and this year they vacationed in Vietnam and Thailand. 'Europe is slightly expensive. After getting married, much of our budget goes into household expenses, so we decided Southeast Asian countries are better. You get to experience a new culture as well,' Gawankar, a marketing consultant, said. Sharma, a corporate employee, took her parents with her to Singapore and Malaysia for their first overseas trip. 'Traveling through Southeast Asian countries is definitely friendlier for Indians. Also you need more time and more planning to travel to Europe,' she said. Kalyani Jagwani, a Kolkata homemaker, and her businessman husband, Devanand, spent two weeks in Japan in October, visiting such places as Kyoto, Tokyo and Hakone, well known for its hot springs and for its natural beauty. 'We had already visited Europe a few times and we wanted a new experience. And we were really attracted by the videos we saw of the fall season when the landscape turns beautiful,' Kalyani Jagwani said. With the number of Indian tourists surging, several Asian countries are wooing them. Some are offering visa-free travel, while budget airlines are opening more routes from India. Two years ago, Vietair, a low-cost Vietnamese carrier that only flew to Delhi and Mumbai expanded flights to several smaller cities, a move that paid dividends. Nearly half a million Indian tourists are expected to visit Vietnam this year, attracted by fares under $400. Tourism-reliant Thailand, which eliminated visa requirements for Indians in November 2023 for one year, extended the facility indefinitely last month. It is helping boost numbers – compared to the 1 million Indians who visited a decade ago, more than 1.5 million visited through October of this year. Sri Lanka has also allowed visa-free travel for Indians while Japan has introduced a simplified e-visa process. Middle Eastern countries are roping in Bollywood stars to promote their destinations -- India’s hugely popular Hindi film industry has always had a strong influence on Indian travelers’ choice of destinations. A top actor, Ranveer Singh, who once promoted Switzerland, is brand ambassador for Abu Dhabi. Popular actors Saif Ali Khan and his daughter Sara Ali Khan, promote Dubai. Other countries are flying in travel writers and influencers in bigger numbers than ever earlier. Those with deeper pockets are exploring more distant places. Sumitra Senapaty, whose travel club 'Women on Wanderlust' organizes all-women trips, says her clients want to explore more off-beat destinations. 'They are tired of doing the usual touristy places and want to go to different places. This year, I have organized vacations to Easter Island and Puerto Natales in Chile, Patagonia in South America and Azores, a Portuguese archipelago,' she said. The number of Indians taking two or more overseas trips grew 32% last year, according to a report by India’s leading online travel company, MakeMyTrip. 'I think people want to live in the moment, because we don’t know what tomorrow brings,' Patel, of Veena World, said. 'As incomes increase, people want to invest more in experiences – this is the big change we have seen post the pandemic.' Many travelers agree. Besides visiting monasteries, gardens and the usual tourist spots in Japan, the Jagwanis spent one day in a ryokan, a traditional Japanese inn that offers a window into the way of life in the old days. 'We slept on the floor on mattresses, had typical Japanese food, and a traditional bath with mineral salts,' Kalyani Jagwani recalled. 'It was a novelty experience that plugged us into Japanese culture.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-numbers-of-globetrotting-indians-surge-many-turn-to-asia/7882354.html	2024-11-30T02:17:56-08:00	
Icebreaker deal would challenge Russian supremacy in Arctic	HALIFAX, CANADA — With the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding this month, the United States, Canada and Finland are moving ahead on what military analysts see as a belated but much-needed answer to a mounting Russian and Chinese threat in the Arctic Ocean. Under the arrangement whimsically labeled the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE Pact, the three nations have agreed to share research, knowledge and capabilities in building a still unspecified number of icebreakers capable of enforcing each nation's sovereignty in an ocean that has become increasingly navigable because of climate change. While the retreat of the polar icecap is steadily opening the region for commercial traffic and mineral exploration, the ICE Pact is largely driven by concerns over the Arctic capabilities of an increasingly hostile Russia and the rapidly growing presence of China. 'Up until this past summer, you would expect one Chinese research vessel in the Arctic. This past summer, there were five,' said U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Linda Fagan at a security forum in the Canadian city of Halifax this month. 'This summer they were operating in tandem surface action groups with both China and Russia, 60 to 70 miles off the coast of Alaska,' Fagan added. 'If we were to see that same pattern of behavior off the East or the West Coast of the [contiguous] United States, it would have the attention of the United States.' Speaking at the same forum, Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair said his country has been watching 'the activities of two particular adversaries, China and Russia, in the area, which are deeply concerning to us and, frankly, their aggression and assertions in the region are somewhat different.' Blair said that in passages through the Arctic, the Russians 'have not demonstrated respect to the international rules-based order and respect for other countries sovereignty and economic interests.' China, he said, approaches the Arctic in two ways, the first being significant investment in critical and other infrastructure. 'And the second one is through what they term scientific research. And we've seen a huge increase in their presence in the Arctic. And it's not just scientific research. They're mapping the sea floor. They're gathering intelligence,' he said. Experts say Russia is far ahead of the United States and its NATO allies in icebreaker capability, largely because it has for years been developing a commercial shipping route across its Arctic coast known as the Northern Sea Route. The route is of particular interest to China as a shortcut for its lucrative trade with Europe. But Russian icebreaking is no longer limited to economic development, according to Heather Exner-Pirot, a global fellow at the Washington-based Wilson Center's Polar Institute. 'Its first armed combat icebreaker, the Ivan Papanin, is in sea trials and scheduled to join Russia's Northern Fleet by the end of 2024,' she wrote on the Wilson Center website in July. 'And China is quickly gaining capacity, having commissioned its fourth polar-capable vessel, the Jidi, last week,' added Exner-Pirot, who is also the director of energy, natural resources and environment at the Ottawa-based Macdonald-Laurier Institute. If the Western alliance hopes to match Russian and Chinese capabilities in the Arctic, it has a lot of catching up to do. While precise counts vary according to how one defines a polar-capable icebreaker, the CIA World Factbook says Russia has 18 such vessels of varying classes, part of a world-leading fleet of 46 icebreakers including the world's only two nuclear-powered icebreakers. It has 11 more planned or under construction, according to a chart prepared by the U.S. Coast Guard Office of Waterways and Ocean Policy. Icebreakers - The World Factbook Canada ranks second in the world with 18 total icebreakers, according to the CIA World Factbook, but only one is suitable for polar missions. The others are mostly deployed to maintain commercial shipping channels through the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes in winter. Canada has two more polar icebreakers under construction and another five planned. Finland has at least eight polar-capable icebreakers, according to most assessments, and uses them mainly to clear ice around its Baltic Sea ports. It is also regarded as the world leader in the design and construction of icebreakers but has been unable to sell them to its main customer, Russia, since that country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Its expertise will be critical to the ICE Pact program. The United States has only two operational polar-capable vessels, both of which are nearing the end of their lifespan, a senior administration official told Reuters earlier this year. A third vessel is being cannibalized for parts. The U.S. currently has three more polar-capable icebreakers planned and hopes to secure funding for an additional three, according to a RAND Corporation report. The U.S. Coast Guard Is Building an Icebreaker Fleet: What Comes Next? Issues and Challenges 'While Russia has steadily expanded its world-leading fleet, and China is making significant inroads, Canada and the U.S. have let their icebreakers age and their shipbuilding capacity atrophy,' Exner-Pirot wrote in her Wilson Center article. 'Even with the recent resolve to reverse trend and commit billions in new dollars to icebreakers, previous neglect has led to shipbuilding programs that are frequently over time and over budget,' she wrote. 'The ICE Pact aims to turn the ship around.' Deep-water ports where the West's new icebreakers can take on provisions and fuel may be an even tougher problem to solve. 'Russia also has 17 deep-water ports on that [Arctic] Ocean, Canada has none, and so we need to do better,' Blair said at the Halifax International Security Forum. 'They also have significant additional capabilities in icebreakers and military presence in the region.' Canada does hope to open a deep-water naval facility soon at Nanisivik, at the north end of Baffin Island, which would allow it to command the entrance to the Northwest Passage across Canada's Arctic. But the facility is 10 years behind schedule as a result of logistical and environmental delays. Due to escalating costs, plans for the facility were scaled back to make it operational for only four months a year rather than 12. The station is primarily intended for use as a refueling station for vessels patrolling Arctic Sea routes. It remains unclear how many new vessels will be built under the ICE Pact or how soon they will be completed, though it is expected that each of the three participants will send the work to shipyards in its own country. Finnish shipyards are said to be capable of building an icebreaker within two years, but progress in the United States and Canada has often stretched out much longer. At the Halifax forum, U.S. Admiral Fagan brushed off a mischievous suggestion that, given the rate at which the Arctic ice pack is retreating, by the time the new icebreakers are completed they may no longer be needed. 'The ability to create year-round presence [in the Arctic] from a sovereignty and defense standpoint requires heavy icebreakers,' she said. 'It requires it now and into the foreseeable future. And so, this is not a waste there, but we need to accelerate. We need to continue the partnership.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/icebreaker-deal-would-challenge-russian-supremacy-in-arctic/7881858.html	2024-11-30T00:20:32-08:00	
Chinese scientists rush to climate-proof potatoes	YANQING, CHINA — In a research facility in the northwest of Beijing, molecular biologist Li Jieping and his team harvest a cluster of seven unusually small potatoes, one as tiny as a quail's egg, from a potted plant. Grown under conditions that simulate predictions of higher temperatures at the end of the century, the potatoes provide an ominous sign of future food security. At just 136 grams, the tubers weigh less than half that of a typical potato in China, where the most popular varieties are often twice the size of a baseball. China is the world's biggest producer of potatoes, which are crucial to global food security because of their high yield relative to other staple crops. But they are particularly vulnerable to heat, and climate change, driven by fossil fuel emissions, is pushing temperatures to dangerous new heights while also worsening drought and flooding. With an urgent need to protect food supplies, Li, a researcher at the International Potato Center (CIP) in Beijing, is leading a three-year study into the effects of higher temperatures on the vegetable. His team is focusing on China's two most common varieties. 'I worry about what will happen in the future,' Li said. 'Farmers will harvest fewer potato tubers, it will influence food security.' Li's team grew their crop over three months in a walk-in chamber set at 3 degrees Celsius above the current average temperature in northern Hebei and Inner Mongolia, the higher altitude provinces where potatoes are usually grown in China. Their research, published in the journal Climate Smart Agriculture this month, found the higher temperatures accelerated tuber growth by 10 days, but cut potato yields by more than half. Under current climate policies, the world is facing as much as 3.1 C of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100, according to a United Nations report released in October. Farmers in China say they are already feeling the effect of extreme weather events. In Inner Mongolia, dozens of workers clutching white sacks rush to gather potatoes dug up from the soil before the next downpour. 'The biggest challenge for potatoes this year is the heavy rain,' said manager Wang Shiyi. 'It has caused various diseases... and greatly slowed down the harvest progress.' Meanwhile, seed potato producer Yakeshi Senfeng Potato Industry Company has invested in aeroponic systems where plants are grown in the air under controlled conditions. Farmers are increasingly demanding potato varieties that are higher-yielding and less susceptible to disease, particularly late blight, which caused the Irish Potato Famine of the mid-19th century and thrives in warm and humid conditions. 'Some new and more aggressive (late blight) strains have begun to appear, and they are more resistant to traditional prevention and control methods,' said general manager Li Xuemin, explaining the Inner Mongolia-based company's strategy. The research by CIP, which is headquartered in Lima, is part of a collaborative effort with the Chinese government to help farmers adapt to the warmer, wetter conditions. In the greenhouse outside Li's lab, workers swab pollen on white potato flowers to develop heat-tolerant varieties. Li says Chinese farmers will need to make changes within the next decade, planting during spring instead of the start of summer, or moving to even higher altitudes to escape the heat. 'Farmers have to start preparing for climate change,' Li said. 'If we don't find a solution, they will make less money from lower yields and the price of potatoes may rise.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-scientists-rush-to-climate-proof-potatoes/7881022.html	2024-11-30T00:19:42-08:00	
Ghana parties stoke anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment ahead of election	LAGOS, NIGERIA — Ghana's LGBTQ+ community faces an impossible choice in next month's general elections after the leading presidential candidates all promised to crack down on gay rights to tap into widespread anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment in the country. One of the first tasks the winner of the December 7 vote may face is to sign into law or veto a bill parliament passed earlier this year that includes jail time for anyone identifying as LGBTQ+. The Supreme Court is due to rule on the bill's constitutionality on December 18 after weighing legal challenges against it. The ruling party candidate, Mahamudu Bawumia, has repeatedly vowed to sign the bill. While his main challenger, former president John Dramani Mahama, has not explicitly said whether he will approve it, he has argued that Ghana must strengthen laws against LGBTQ+ activities and persons, accusing the West of promoting homosexuality in the West African nation. 'These are people who are actually supposed to protect me. My vote and the rest of the community's will put them in a position of leadership,' Abena told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 'I feel like I do not belong.' Ghana already criminalizes gay sex, but the proposed law broadens what counts as illegal activity and increases penalties, which human rights groups say will worsen the persecution of sexual and gender minorities. The bill stipulates up to five years in prison for same-sex activities, allows for the prosecution of those who identify as non-binary and punishes advocacy work, including funding programs for sexual minorities. It also includes prison terms for friends, family members and property owners who fail to report anyone perceived or identified as LGBTQ+. 'The bill seeks to divide me and my family,' Abena said. 'Anybody who knows (my identity)within the family and does not report (me and)someone else does ... could also go to jail.' 'Public psyche' The long-running debate around the bill, first introduced in 2021, has exacerbated already prevalent anti-LGBTQ+ attitudes in the religiously conservative country. An Afrobarometer survey published in 2021showed just 7% of the public in Ghana expresses tolerance for same-sex relationships. In October, religious groups took to the streets to ask for the immediate passage of the bill. Church leaders have called same-sex acts 'immoral' and against 'Christianity, the Ghanaian tradition and culture.' 'Even though it has not become law, it has seeped into the psyche of the public, which is basically homophobic, in the sense that they want the passage of the bill, and there have been increases in the level of attacks and intimidation against LGBTQ persons,' said Michael Akagbor, the senior officer on human rights at the Centre for Democracy and Development Ghana. Akagbor also said the contest between political parties vying for the most anti-LGBTQ+ label had come to a draw, effectively making it a 'non-election issue.' But other advocates warn that LGBTQ+ individuals risk increased attacks in an already hostile environment and they and their supporters could face greater discrimination if the law passes. The law's provision criminalizing friends and family who do not report on their loved ones 'has already forced many LGBTQ individuals into hiding(and)led to loss of employment, housing and even educational opportunities,' said Hans Burinyuy, director of communications at LGBT+ Rights Ghana. 'If the bill becomes law, professional options for openly LGBTQ-friendly educators and advocates like me may narrow, especially if more institutions adopt rigid stances in response,' Burinyuy told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 'For me, maintaining personal safety has now involved more caution regarding who I interact with and what information I disclose,' he said. International response The European Union called the passage of the bill in February 'profoundly disturbing,' pointing out that it violated Ghana's constitution and its international human rights commitments. 'There is also the issue of losing the donor funding if the country goes on with the bill, and that has already been communicated by the Ministry of Finance to the Ghanaian populace,' said Akagbor. The Supreme Court is considering legal petitions that parliament failed to comply with procedural issues when passing the bill, including failure to assess the economic implications of the law. The court can either send it back to parliament for amendment, allow it to be passed onto the president for assent, or strike it out. For Abena, the court decision will come too late to help her decide how to cast her ballot in the general election. 'I feel the country isn't safe for people like me if the first, second and third options are all using the LGBT bill to score more points,' she said. 'When they come into power, they are going to make sure that these persons are criminalized.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-parties-stoke-anti-lgbtq-sentiment-ahead-of-election/7881015.html	2024-11-30T00:18:59-08:00	
Intimate documentary captures the Beatles goofing around as they take America by storm in 1964	NEW YORK — Likely most people have seen iconic footage of the Beatles performing on 'The Ed Sullivan Show.' But how many have seen Paul McCartney during that same U.S. trip feeding seagulls off his hotel balcony? That moment — as well as George Harrison and John Lennon goofing around by exchanging their jackets — are part of the Disney+ documentary 'Beatles '64,' an intimate look at the English band's first trip to America that uses rare and newly restored footage. It streams Friday. 'It's so fun to be the fly on the wall in those really intimate moments,' says Margaret Bodde, who produced alongside Martin Scorsese. 'It's just this incredible gift of time and technology to be able to see it now with the decades of time stripped away so that you really feel like you're there.' 'Beatles '64' leans into footage of the 14-day trip filmed by documentarians Albert and David Maysles, who left behind 11 hours of the Fab Four goofing around in New York's Plaza hotel or traveling. It was restored by Park Road Post in New Zealand. 'It's beautiful, although it's black and white and it's not widescreen,' says director David Tedeschi. 'It's like it was shot yesterday and it captures the youth of the four Beatles and the fans.' The footage is augmented by interviews with the two surviving members of the band and people whose lives were impacted, including some of the women who as teens stood outside their hotel hoping to catch a glimpse of the Beatles. 'It was like a crazy love,' fan Vickie Brenna-Costa recalls in the documentary. 'I can't really understand it now. But then, it was natural.' The film shows the four heartthrobs flirting and dancing at the Peppermint Lounge disco, Harrison noodling with a Woody Guthrie riff on his guitar and tells the story of Ronnie Spector sneaking the band out a hotel back exit and up to Harlem to eat barbeque. The documentary coincides with the release of a box set of vinyl albums collecting the band's seven U.S. albums released in '64 and early '65 — 'Meet The Beatles!,' 'The Beatles' Second Album,' 'A Hard Day's Night' (the movie soundtrack), 'Something New,' 'The Beatles' Story,' 'Beatles '65' and 'The Early Beatles.' They had been out of print on vinyl since 1995. The Beatles' U.S. visit in 1964 also included concerts at Carnegie Hall, a gig at the Washington Coliseum in Washington, D.C., and a visit to Miami, where the band met Muhammad Ali. The documentary shows members of the band reading newspaper coverage of themselves. Viewers may learn that the Beatles — now revered — were often met with ridicule or rudeness from the older generation. At the British Embassy in New York, the four were treated as lower class, while renowned broadcaster Eric Sevareid, doing a piece for CBS, compared the reaction to the Beatles to the German measles. 'You're nothing but four Elvis Presleys,' one reporter told them during a press conference, to which the boys good-naturedly started gyrating as Ringo Starr screamed 'It's not true!' 'Why the establishment was against them is sort of a mystery to me,' says Tedeschi. 'I think older people believed that music would go back to the big bands.' Musicians like Sananda Maitreya, Ron Isley and Smokey Robinson also discuss the Fab Four and what they took from Black music. There also are interviews with residents of Harlem, critic Joe Queennan and filmmaker David Lynch, who saw the Beatles play the Washington Coliseum. 'Beatles '64' tries to explain why young people were so besotted by John, Paul, George and Ringo. Their visit came just months after the assassination of President John. F. Kennedy and Tedeschi argues Beatlemania was a salve for a nation in mourning. 'Part of it is I think that the light was just off. They were depressed. Everything was dark. And 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' lit them up,' says Tedeschi. As McCartney says in the documentary: 'Maybe America needed something like the Beatles to lift it out of mourning and just sort of say 'Life goes on.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/intimate-documentary-captures-the-beatles-goofing-around-as-they-take-america-by-storm-in-1964/7879844.html	2024-11-30T00:17:56-08:00	
Will Trump's return lead to a new wave of bestselling books?	NEW YORK — As she anticipates her estranged uncle's return to the White House, Mary Trump isn't expecting any future book to catch on like such first-term tell-alls as Michael Wolff's million-selling Fire and Fury or her own blockbuster, Too Much and Never Enough. 'What else is there to learn?' she says. 'And for people who don't know, the books have been written. It's all really out in the open now.' For publishers, Donald Trump's presidential years were a time of extraordinary sales in political books, helped in part by Trump's legal threats and angered tweets. According to Circana, which tracks around 85% of the hardcover and paperback market, the genre's sales nearly doubled from 2015 to 2020, from around 5 million copies to around 10 million. Besides books by Wolff and Trump, other bestsellers included former FBI Director James Comey's A Higher Loyalty, former national security adviser John Bolton's The Room Where it Happened and Bob Woodward's Fear. Meanwhile, sales for dystopian fiction also jumped, led by Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, which was adapted into an award-winning Hulu series. But interest has dropped back to 2015 levels since Trump left office, according to Circana, and publishers doubt it will again peak so highly. Readers not only showed little interest in books by or about President Joe Biden and his family — they even seemed less excited about Trump-related releases. Mary Trump's Who Could Ever Love You and Woodward's War were both popular this fall, but neither has matched the sales of their books written during the first Trump administration. 'We've been there many times, with all those books,' HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham says of the various Trump tell-alls. He added that he still sees a market for at least some Trump books — perhaps analyzing the recent election — because 'there's a general, serious smart audience, not politically aligned in a hard way,' one that would welcome 'an intelligent voice.' 'It's like the reboot of any hit TV show,' says Eric Nelson, publisher and vice president of Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins that's released books by Jared Kushner, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump Cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Sen. Marco Rubio. 'You're not hoping for ratings like last time, just better ratings than the boring show it's replacing.' In the days following Trump's victory, The Handmaid's Tale and George Orwell's 1984 returned to bestseller lists, along with more contemporary works such as Timothy Snyder's On Tyranny, a 2017 bestseller that expanded upon a Facebook post Snyder wrote soon after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Books appealing to pro-Trump readers also surged, including those written by Cabinet picks — Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s The Real Anthony Fauci and Hegseth's The War on Warriors — and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, his 2016 memoir that's sold hundreds of thousands of copies since Trump selected him as his running mate. First lady Melania Trump's memoir, Melania, came out in October and has been high on Amazon.com bestseller lists for weeks, even as critics found it contained little newsworthy information. According to Circana, it has sold more than 200,000 copies, a figure that does not include books sold directly through her website. 'The Melania book has done extraordinarily well, better than we thought,' says Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt. 'After Election Day, we sold everything we had of it.' Conservative books have sold steadily over the years, and several publishers — most recently Hachette Book Group — have imprints dedicated to those readers. Publishers expect at least some critical books to reach bestseller lists — if only because of the tradition of the publishing market favoring the party out of power. But the nature of what those books would look like is uncertain. Perhaps a onetime insider will have a falling out with Trump and write a memoir, like Bolton or former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, or maybe some of his planned initiatives, whether mass deportation or the prosecution of his political foes, will lead to investigative works. A new Fire and Fury is doubtful, with the originally only possible because Wolff enjoyed extraordinary access, spending months around Trump and his White House staff. Members of the president-elect's current team have already issued a statement saying they have refused to speak with Wolff, calling the author a 'known peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened.' A publicist for Wolff declined to comment. Woodward, who interviewed Trump at length for the 2020 bestseller Rage, told The Associated Press that he had written so much about Trump and other presidents that he wasn't sure what he'd take on next. He doesn't rule out another Trump book, but that will depend in part on the president-elect, how 'out of control he gets,' Woodward said, and how far he is able to go. 'He wants to be the imperial president, where he gets to decide everything and no one's going to get in his way,' Woodward said.

Foreign smartphone sales in China drop 44% in October, data show	New data released Wednesday from a Chinese government-affiliated research firm showed sales of foreign-branded smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone, fell 44.25% year-on-year in China in October, while overall phone sales in China have increased 1.8%, Reuters reported. The data released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology revealed sales of foreign-branded phones in China decreased to 6.22 million units last month, down from 11.149 million units a year earlier. The decrease of foreign phone sales comes in the wake of Chinese tech conglomerate Huawei’s rise to the top of the phone market in China. Huawei was widely popular in China’s smartphone market last year when it released the Mate 60 Pro, a phone with a tiny computer chip more advanced than any other chip previously made by a Chinese company. Chinese consumers have eagerly embraced Huawei's smartphones, drawn to the appeal of locally made technology — an option that has swayed many who might have previously chosen iPhones. On Tuesday, the Chinese phone maker launched the next generation of the Mate 60 Pro, the Mate 70 series. The smartphone was described by Huawei’s consumer group chairman Richard Yu as the 'smartest' Mate phone, The New York Times reported. The Mate 70 series features hardware and software that are the most independent from Western influence to date. Highlights of Huawei’s newest phone include artificial intelligence-enabled functions and improved photography. The phone uses an operating system of HarmonyOS, which allows the smartphones to connect with smart devices. Huawei’s ability to self-supply the chips required for its hardware and software represents a notable development, following previous U.S. measures to restrict the company’s access to key partners and suppliers. AI technology relies on advanced semiconductor chips, a critical resource that has received attention amid tensions between Beijing and Washington, as both countries compete to dominate the advanced technology industry. Apple’s iPhone 16 features AI capabilities, but these features have yet to be implemented in iPhones in China. Apple, which considers China its second-most important market, has seen its market share decrease substantially. Apple CEO Tim Cook is traveling to China this week for the third time this year to attend an industry conference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-smartphone-sales-in-china-drop-44-in-october-data-show/7879120.html	2024-11-30T00:16:53-08:00	
As Arctic climate warms, even Santa runs short of snow	ROVANIEMI, FINLAND — With less than a month to go until Christmas, Santa Claus is busy preparing, but the warming climate and lack of snow in his Arctic hometown have him worried. By this time of year, the town of Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland — marketed by tourism officials since the 1980s as the 'real' home of Santa Claus — should be white and pretty. But on a recent visit, rain poured down from a gloomy slate sky and the temperature was well above freezing, with the thermometer showing +2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 'My reindeer can fly, so that's no problem,' said the man in the red suit and long white beard, resting his weary legs after a long day of meeting excited children and adults. But 'we can see that climate change is real. And it's affecting the reindeer. It's affecting life here in the Arctic,' added the man, whose employers declined to identify him by his real name. Herders say milder and more unpredictable winters have left reindeer struggling to dig up their main food, lichen. Snow and ice have melted and refrozen, burying it under layers of packed ice. The Arctic is warming faster than other parts of the world due to climate change — nearly four times as fast, according to research published by Finland-based scientists in the journal Nature in 2022. Warming global temperatures, driven by humans burning fossil fuels, have been aggravating weather disasters such as floods and droughts worldwide in recent years. In Finnish Lapland, after a historically warm summer, a new November temperature record was set a few weeks ago when 11.1 C (51.98 F) was measured in the town of Utsjoki, breaking the previous record of 11.0 C (51.8 F) from 1975. Tourism boom Tourists flock to Rovaniemi from around the world to see its enchanting snowy landscapes and experience the Arctic cold. With only a few hours of daylight this time of the year, many also hope to see the spectacular colors of the Northern Lights streaking across the dark skies. Last year, the town registered a record high of more than one million overnight stays. Visitors looking to get a glimpse of Santa can meet the man himself at different locations in Rovaniemi, including the Santa Park underground theme park and the nearby Santa Claus Village. 'It's super nice. It's like in the Christmas movies, super magical,' said Maria Batista Torres from Tenerife in Spain, visiting the Santa Claus Village with her two young children. Glittering fairy lights illuminate rooftops and trees in the Santa Claus Village, which is open all year round. 'I figured it would be much more snowy,' however, said Wenguel, a visitor from the United States. 'I mean, it still feels like Christmas ... but I figured it would be a little bit more Santa-like.' In addition to meeting Santa Claus, visitors can pay to go snowmobiling or jump on a reindeer sleigh ride. While visiting Santa Claus Village is free, a picture taken with Santa costs a minimum of 40 euros ($42). Wishing for peace Gloomy skies aside, Santa Claus's Post Office in Santa Claus Village was bustling with activity, as red-hooded elves busily stamped cards and sorted piles of letters in the Christmas rush. 'In December there can be about 30,000 letters each day,' said postal elf Heidi Mustonen, who has worked here for 20 years. Over half a million letters to Santa find their way here every year, Heidi said, insisting that every letter gets opened and read thoroughly. Most of the letters were wish lists, but both children and adults also wrote to tell Santa about their personal concerns, fears, wishes and joys, with many of the envelopes containing drawings and small gifts. 'This year many people have wished for peace,' Heidi said. Most letters sent from Asian countries were written by young adults, with many wishing for strength to cope with their studies, she said. Letters from European countries were mostly written by children. Heidi said she loved the warm and happy atmosphere in Santa's village, but did wish for snowfall to brighten up the landscape. 'We would make snow everywhere if we could. But we are just postal elves.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-arctic-climate-warms-even-santa-runs-short-of-snow/7879054.html	2024-11-30T00:16:18-08:00	
Biden plans to highlight investment, partnership during Africa trip	WHITE HOUSE — President Joe Biden will make his first presidential trip to Africa next week, visiting Angola and making a stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde, a top White House official told VOA. His short visit will center around the Lobito Corridor, a 1,300-kilometer rail line that brings resources from the continent’s rich interior to Angola’s busiest port. VOA’s Philip Alexiou spoke exclusively with Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: How is the president feeling about this trip and what does he want to accomplish? Frances Brown, White House director for African affairs: He is excited and really looking forward to the trip. The president often talks about how it's impossible to meet today's global challenges without African leadership and African partnership, and we really see Angola as exhibit A. We are working with Angola on a few really important things. One is bolstering peace and security in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Another is growing economic opportunities in the region. A third is technological and scientific cooperation. VOA: What are the deliverables? Are they going to be substantial? Brown: You will see a lot of announcements and deliverables on the Lobito Corridor. Already the U.S. has mobilized billions of dollars towards the corridor. I think you can expect the president to engage with various components of that infrastructure effort. I think you can expect to hear more as well on the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which recently signed a compact in Zambia. And I think you'll hear a lot of new deliverables on global health security, on agribusiness, on new forms of security sector cooperation. VOA: With so many moving parts in these efforts, what level of transparency can the U.S. ensure? What kind of accountability can it offer the people in the region? Brown: This is something that's really important to the president. The Lobito Corridor is about investment, it's about infrastructure, but it's also about ensuring that it benefits communities more broadly. It's part of the broader initiative, the Partnership on Global Investment and Infrastructure, that the president has laid out. And this is really signaling how under President Biden's administration, we've gone from an aid-driven model on engagement with Africa to an investment-driven model, and how we're thinking creatively about how to demonstrate that value proposition. When we think about the Lobito Corridor, it's all about sustainable economic development, it's all about a transparent contracting process. It's about ensuring that it boosts regional trade, that it creates quality jobs and improves lives. VOA: Is President Biden going to bring up human rights issues with Angolan President Joao Lorenzo? Brown: President Biden never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts. And I think that's pretty consistent with the way he's been throughout his long career in public service. VOA: Focusing now on Sudan, President Biden has called for peace. It’s one of the worst crises that we've seen in a long time. The U.N. is saying it's a neglected and ignored crisis, the worst humanitarian situation in recent history. Does the administration see it that way? And what can be done? Brown: President Biden has been really outspoken on Sudan. You might have seen in his big speech at the U.N. General Assembly, he talked about the level of suffering in Sudan. He talked about how it was essential that the generals silence the guns and that we avert a wider famine. He's also been pretty forthright on calling for those who are obstructing humanitarian assistance to let that aid in. He's also talked about outside actors being an important part of this equation. This month, every member of the Security Council at the U.N., except for Russia, voted in favor of a resolution that would have further called for humanitarian assistance, protections for civilians and an end to the violence. The president has instructed his team to work this hard. Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken, in the last couple of weeks, has continued to engage regional states and other actors to press for unhindered humanitarian access. VOA: Moving on to the Sahel, a number of Francophone countries are forming new regional blocs, shifting away from the West and sort of aligning themselves with Russian mercenaries, the Wagner Group, and groups of this nature. How concerning is this to the administration? Brown: Even though there have been those changes that you've mentioned in the Sahelian states — particularly Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali — other West African partners, including those along the coast, have been really clear to us that they want the durability and longevity of U.S. security engagement in the region. So, we continue to work very closely on that. I'd also say more broadly that President Biden has made it really clear that he thinks it's important we continue to engage particularly with democratic partners. And on this trip that is forthcoming, the president will be stopping as well in West Africa, in Cabo Verde, which is a key democratic partner on the continent. VOA: Is there anything that the U.S. can do to counter extremism on the continent, especially since U.S. influence has been sort of downgraded since they've had to leave Niger? Brown: It’s worth remembering that we don't have a military footprint in the majority of countries on the continent. And that's been the case always. We make security arrangements with host countries, with partners based on specific shared interests. And through the administration, we've worked to foster mutually beneficial security partnerships by working by, with and through African partners. So that's how we see those collaborations. VOA: Finally, the continent is very young — the median age around 19 years old. And its leaders are really old. How does the U.S. leadership deal with that? Brown: You’re absolutely right. It is an extremely young continent, and it is the future. President Biden often talks about how by 2050, one in four humans on Earth will be from Africa. So that's very much guiding President Biden's engagement with the continent. I think the way the administration takes that forward is by thinking about how no challenge that we're trying to solve globally, we can solve without African partnership and African leadership. That's why we've championed African voices at the U.N. Security Council, on the boards of the international financial institutions, at the G20 — we successfully got the African Union seat there. So, I think from the administration's perspective, just continuing to elevate and champion African voices so they can be part of shaping the future is how we think that's best approached. VOA: What does the president want to leave behind when he departs the continent and he winds down as president? Brown: I think the president wants to leave, first, the recognition of U.S. leadership and partnership, particularly on trade, investment and a new approach to the continent that's not defined by assistance, but instead by investment and partnership. I think he wants to leave behind his recognition that African leadership for solving some of these challenges is essential, and that's why he'll be amplifying Angola's role mediating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere. And I think he wants to convey the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angolan partnership, which is in many ways the story of the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-African relationship over many centuries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-plans-to-highlight-investment-partnership-during-africa-trip-/7882037.html	2024-11-30T00:15:09-08:00	
As US faces Iran threats, Trump’s security picks favor ‘maximum pressure’	Iran is likely high on the foreign policy agenda of the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The Islamic Republic has engaged in a major escalation of conflict with U.S. ally Israel while advancing its nuclear program to the point it could rapidly produce enough fissile material for a bomb. VOA’s Michael Lipin looks at what Trump and his prospective team members have said should be done about these threats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-us-faces-iran-threats-trump-s-security-picks-favor-maximum-pressure-/7882273.html	2024-11-29T19:39:39-08:00	
Explosion damages canal feeding Kosovo's main power plants	PRISTINA, KOSOVO — An explosion Friday evening damaged a canal in northern Kosovo supplying water to two coal-fired power plants that generate nearly all of the country's electricity, Prime Minister Albin Kurti said, blaming what he called 'a terrorist act' by neighboring Serbia. There were no immediate reports of injuries and the cause of the blast, which also impacted drinking water supplies, was not clear. Serbian officials did not respond to requests for comment, and Reuters found no immediate evidence of Belgrade's involvement. 'This is a criminal and terrorist attack with the aim to destroy our critical infrastructure,' Kurti said in a televised address. He said that some of the country could be without power if the problem is not fixed by morning. In a sign of ethnic tensions between the two Balkan countries, Kurti echoed Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani by blaming Serbian criminal gangs without providing proof. Earlier on Friday, Kosovo police announced increased security measures after two recent attacks where hand grenades were hurled at a police station and municipality building in northern Kosovo where ethnic Serbians live. It was not clear if the incidents were linked. Local media showed pictures of part of the canal destroyed and leaking water and a heavy police presence at the site. Faruk Mujka, the head of water company Ibar-Lepenci, told local news portal Kallxo that an explosive device was thrown into the canal and damaged the wall of a bridge. He said the water supply, which also feeds drinking water to the capital, Pristina, must be halted to fix the problem as soon as possible since it was the main channel for supplying Kosovo Energy Corporation, the country's main power provider. Independence for ethnic Albanian-majority Kosovo came in 2008, almost a decade after a guerrilla uprising against Serbian rule. However, tensions persist, mainly in the north where the Serb minority refuses to recognize Kosovo's statehood and still sees Belgrade as their capital. The EU's Kosovo ambassador, Aivo Orav, condemned the attack that he said was already 'depriving considerable parts of Kosovo from water supply.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/explosion-damages-canal-feeding-kosovo-s-main-power-plants-/7882268.html	2024-11-29T18:40:31-08:00	
Israeli strikes kill dozens in Gaza; Egypt to host Hamas leaders for ceasefire talks	cairo — Israeli military strikes killed at least 40 Palestinians overnight and on Friday in the Gaza Strip, medics said, as efforts to revive Gaza ceasefire talks received a boost with officials from the Palestinian group Hamas headed to Cairo for a new round of talks. Medics said they had recovered 19 bodies of Palestinians killed in northern areas of Nuseirat, one of the enclave's eight long-standing refugee camps. Later Friday, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 10 Palestinians in a house in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, medics said. Others were killed in the northern and southern areas of the Gaza Strip, medics added. There was no fresh statement by the Israeli military on Friday, but on Thursday it said its forces were continuing to 'strike terror targets as part of the operational activity in the Gaza Strip.' Israeli tanks entered northern and western areas of Nuseirat on Thursday. They withdrew from northern areas on Friday but remained active in western parts of the camp. The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said teams were unable to respond to distress calls from residents trapped in their homes. Dozens of Palestinians returned on Friday to areas where the army had retreated to check on damage to their homes. Medics and relatives covered bodies, including of women, that lay on the road with blankets or white shrouds and carried them away on stretchers. 'Forgive me, my wife, forgive me, my Ibtissam, forgive me, my dear,' one grief-stricken man said through tears beside her corpse, laid out on a stretcher on the ground. Drone reportedly kills ICU leader Medics said an Israeli drone on Friday had killed Ahmed Al-Kahlout, head of the Intensive Care Unit at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, where the army has been operating since early October. Contacted by Reuters, the Israeli military said it was unaware of a strike occurring at that location or time. Kamal Adwan Hospital is one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip that barely function now because of shortages of medical, fuel, and food supplies. Most of its medical staff have been detained or expelled by the Israeli army, health officials say. The Palestinian civil emergency service, Hamas and the Palestinian official news agency WAFA put the number of Palestinians killed in two Israeli strikes in Beit Lahiya in the past 24 hours at 70. There was no immediate confirmation of the figure by the local health ministry. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and accused Israel of 'using the weapon of starvation against the people (in northern Gaza) to displace them from their land and homes.' The Israeli army said forces operating in Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia since October 5 aimed to prevent Hamas militants from regrouping and waging attacks from those areas. Residents said the army was depopulating the towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun as well as the Jabalia refugee camp. Late on Friday, two Hamas officials told Reuters a Hamas delegation would arrive in Cairo on Saturday for talks with Egyptian officials. The visit comes days after the U.S. said it would begin new efforts with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to revive Gaza ceasefire talks. Biden pushes for ceasefire Months of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza have yielded scant progress, and negotiations are now on hold. A ceasefire in the parallel conflict between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, took effect before dawn on Wednesday, stopping hostilities that had escalated sharply in recent months and had overshadowed the Gaza conflict. Hamas and Hezbollah are both U.S.-designated terror organizations. Announcing the Lebanon accord on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said he would now renew his push for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza and he urged Israel and Hamas to seize the moment. The Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities 13 months ago, triggering the war. They killed about 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages, Israel has said. Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 44,300 people and displaced nearly all the enclave's population at least once, Gaza officials say. Vast swaths of the territory are in ruins.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-kill-dozens-in-gaza-egypt-to-host-hamas-leaders-for-ceasefire-talks-/7882261.html	2024-11-29T18:35:10-08:00	
Canadian news publishers sue OpenAI over alleged copyright infringement	OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA — A coalition of Canadian news publishers, including The Canadian Press, Torstar, Globe and Mail, Postmedia and CBC/Radio-Canada, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for using news content to train its ChatGPT generative artificial intelligence system. The outlets said in a joint statement on Friday that OpenAI regularly breaches copyright by scraping large amounts of content from Canadian media. 'OpenAI is capitalizing and profiting from the use of this content, without getting permission or compensating content owners,' the statement said. The publishers argue that OpenAI practices undermine the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in journalism, and that content is protected by copyright. 'News media companies welcome technological innovations. However, all participants must follow the law, and any use of intellectual property must be on fair terms,' the statement said. Generative AI can create text, images, videos and computer code based on a simple prompt, but the systems must first study vast amounts of existing content. OpenAI said in a statement that its models are trained on publicly available data. It said they are 'grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation.' The company said it collaborates 'closely with news publishers, including in the display, attribution and links to their content in ChatGPT search' and offers outlets 'easy ways to opt out should they so desire.' This is the first such case in Canada, though numerous lawsuits are underway in the United States, including a case by The New York Times against OpenAI and Microsoft. Some news organizations have chosen to collaborate rather than fight with OpenAI by signing deals to get compensated for sharing news content that can be used to train its AI systems. The Associated Press is among the news organizations that have made licensing deals over the past year with OpenAI. Others include The Wall Street Journal and New York Post publisher News Corp., The Atlantic, Axel Springer in Germany and Prisa Media in Spain, France's Le Monde newspaper and the London-based Financial Times. Canada has passed a law requiring Google and Meta to compensate news publishers for the use of their content but has previously declined to say whether the Online News Act should apply to use by AI systems. In response to that legislation, Meta pulled news from its platforms in Canada, while Google has reached a deal to pay $100 million Canadian ($71 million) to Canadian news outlets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canadian-news-publishers-sue-openai-over-alleged-copyright-infringement-/7882248.html	2024-11-29T17:38:57-08:00	
Who were the prisoners in US-China swap?	washington — This week’s rare prisoner swap between the United States and China saw each side claim victory and accuse the other of wrongfully detaining its citizens, while Beijing has kept quiet about the identities of the returned Chinese. China confirmed the repatriation of at least three Chinese nationals convicted of espionage and other crimes in the U.S. Among them was an individual whom Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, speaking at a regular briefing Thursday, described as 'a fugitive who fled to the U.S. many years ago.' Some media reports indicated four individuals were returned to China. Mao did not name those who were returned and did not confirm a prisoner swap, or the release of any Americans detained in China. But media reports, including one from the Financial Times, cited unnamed U.S. government officials as saying three Americans were exchanged for three Chinese. Released Chinese Xu Yanjun Though U.S. officials have not confirmed their identities, NBC News cited unnamed U.S. officials as saying the prisoner swap included Xu Yanjun, a Chinese intelligence officer sentenced to 20 years in prison for attempting to steal aviation trade secrets from GE Aviation. Records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons show that Xu's status is now listed as 'not in federal custody.' Ji Chaoqun NBC reported that those returned to China also included Ji Chaoqun, a naturalized U.S. citizen convicted in 2022 of providing classified defense information to Chinese intelligence. Jin Shanlin The Financial Times on Thursday reported the third Chinese released was Jin Shanlin, a former doctoral student at Southern Methodist University in northern Texas, who was sentenced in 2021 for possessing and distributing child pornography, with his sentence set to end in 2027. Records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons also show Jin’s status as 'not in federal custody.' Jin's case has sparked controversy because of his crime and his family's alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The FBI testified that his family had 'important political connections,' The Dallas Morning News reported in 2022, raising questions about why he was chosen for the exchange over other Chinese nationals in U.S. custody. Released Americans The White House National Security Council said Wednesday in a statement that it had secured the release of three Americans it said were 'wrongfully detained' in China, though it did not confirm a prisoner swap. Their detentions had drawn international condemnation. Mark Swidan Swidan, a Texas businessman, was arrested in 2012 in Dongguan. Despite a lack of direct evidence — no drugs or incriminating records were ever found — he was sentenced to death for drug trafficking but granted a reprieve in 2019. His mother, Katherine Swidan, led a tireless campaign for his release. 'I feared I would never see my son again,' she told VOA, recounting his years in a Guangdong prison marked by overcrowding, intense heat and deteriorating health. Kai Li Li, a Chinese American businessman, was arrested in 2016 in Shanghai on charges of stealing state secrets. His family has consistently denied the allegations, calling his 10-year sentence politically motivated. 'We thank President [Joe] Biden for prioritizing my father’s case,' said his son, Harrison Li. 'But we also urge the administration to stand firm against such detentions in the future.' John Leung Leung, 79, a Hong Kong-based American citizen, was arrested in 2021 on espionage charges. His case saw minimal public advocacy, and his family remained largely silent throughout his detention. John Kamm, founder of the San Francisco-based rights group Dui Hua, meaning 'dialogue' in Chinese, said his organization played a role in the prisoner swap in negotiations that took years to complete. 'We submitted 54 lists with Mark Swidan’s name to the Chinese government and received 10 responses,' Kamm told VOA Mandarin. 'The process was arduous but ultimately effective.' A spokesperson for the National Security Council hailed the release of the three Americans as a significant diplomatic achievement for Biden, emphasizing that all Americans classified as 'wrongfully detained Americans' in China have now been brought home. While the move brought relief to the families of the freed Americans, it has sparked concerns about its implications for U.S.-China relations and the growing trend of 'hostage diplomacy.' Kamm cautioned against declaring the issue resolved. 'There are at least 200 American citizens under coercive measures in China. Many face exit bans or detentions with little transparency,' he said. Critics like Peter Humphrey, a former detainee in China and a nonresident associate at Harvard University’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, argue that no Americans held in China should be considered normal prisoners. He noted to VOA Mandarin that China’s legal processes are fundamentally flawed, as prisoners do not have fair and transparent trials. 'They have never had a trial where they were able to defend themselves properly and freely. They were under tremendous pressure in detention cells, and that pressure amounts to torture,' Humphrey said. Humphrey called this week’s prisoner swap 'capitulation to hostage diplomacy' and warned it could incentivize Beijing to detain more Americans. Diplomatic balancing act The prisoner exchange occurred amid strained U.S.-China relations, with both nations navigating a complex mix of strategic competition and occasional cooperation, and just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump is to return to the White House promising to impose hefty tariffs on Beijing. The U.S. on Wednesday lowered its travel advisory for China from Level 3 ('Reconsider Travel') to Level 2 ('Exercise Increased Caution'), raising questions about the advisory's role in the negotiations. Kamm told VOA, 'The lowering of the travel warning was part of the deal, as I understand it.' Humphrey expressed concerns about the change in travel advisory. 'China did not suddenly become safer for Americans, or any other foreigners actually, to travel to China,' he told VOA. 'It has not become safer.' Bo Gu contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-were-the-prisoners-in-us-china-swap-/7882232.html	2024-11-29T17:27:53-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau arrives in Florida for Trump meeting	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has arrived in Palm Beach, Florida, ahead of a meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort, according to media reports. Trudeau's public itinerary does not list a scheduled visit to Florida. Neither Trudeau's office nor Trump's representatives immediately responded to requests for comment. Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper, citing two unidentified sources, reported that Trudeau was in Florida to meet with Trump. CNN, citing a source, later reported that Trump was going to have dinner with Trudeau on Friday night at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc is traveling with Trudeau, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Trump threatened Monday to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico until the countries clamped down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and migrants crossing the border. Officials from Mexico, Canada and China, along with major industry groups, have warned that the hefty tariffs threatened by Trump would harm the economies of all countries involved, cause inflation to spike and damage job markets. Any hit to the Canadian economy would add to Trudeau's woes at a time when his popularity has sunk in part due to a slowing economy and a rapid surge in the cost of living over the past few years. Polls show Trudeau's Liberals would lose to the opposition Conservative party in an election that must be held by late October 2025. Trudeau this week pledged to stay united against Trump's tariffs threat and called a meeting with the premiers of all 10 Canadian provinces to discuss U.S. relations. Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and sixth-largest natural gas producer. The vast majority of its 4 million barrels per day of crude exports go to the U.S. Trump's plan does not exempt crude oil from the trade penalties, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-s-trudeau-arrives-in-florida-for-trump-meeting-/7882217.html	2024-11-29T17:01:29-08:00	
Moody's downgrades Hungary outlook on institutional 'weaknesses'	washington — The U.S. ratings agency Moody's downgraded its outlook for Hungary's government debt Friday citing 'institutional and governance weaknesses' and concerns its antagonistic relationship with the EU could have financial consequences. Hungary is a recipient of substantial amounts of funding from the European Union, which are conditional on meeting certain criteria, including adherence to the rule of law. The country's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, has clashed with Brussels on a range of issues in recent years, some of which could see it lose out on those EU funds, Moody's indicated in a note explaining its decision. 'Our decision to change the outlook to negative (from stable) reflects downside risks related to the quality of Hungary's institutions and governance,' Moody's analysts wrote in a note explaining their decision. What that means, they said, is that Hungary could ultimately lose out on a 'substantial' amount of EU money 'because it does not meet the conditions for the release of these funds.' 'In turn, this could lower trend GDP growth and weaken fiscal and debt metrics,' they added. In the same note, Moody's affirmed Hungary's investment grade foreign- and local-currency credit rating of Baa2. Moody's said that the total EU funds allocated to Hungary were equivalent to around 3.4% of economic output per year. Given the ongoing 'difficult negotiations' between Hungary and the EU, Moody's noted there were 'elevated risks that Hungary will miss out on a substantial amount' of some of that funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7882207.html	2024-11-29T16:22:26-08:00	
Georgian protesters clash with police for 2nd night after EU talks suspended	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Thousands of demonstrators protesting the Georgian government's decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union rallied outside the parliament and clashed with police for a second straight night Friday. The night before, police used water cannons, pepper spray and tear gas to disperse protesters who took to the streets of Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the ruling Georgian Dream party announced the suspension. The interior ministry said it detained 43 people during the protests. On Friday evening, protesters again swarmed the parliament, with some trying to break the metal gates to the building. Riot police used water cannons to push them away from the building and later moved to force them farther back along Rustaveli Avenue, the city's main boulevard. Some of the protesters used garbage bins and benches to try to build barricades. Clashes between police and protesters also erupted late Friday in the Black Sea port of Batumi. Georgian Dream's disputed victory in the October 26 election, which was widely seen as a referendum on the country's aspirations to join the European Union, has sparked massive demonstrations and led to an opposition boycott of the parliament. The opposition said the vote was rigged under the influence of Russia, which seeks to keep Georgia in its orbit. President Salome Zourabichvili joined protesters Thursday after accusing the government of declaring 'war' on its own people. In Friday's address to the nation, Zourabichvili urged police not to use force against protesters. The Georgian president, who has a largely ceremonial role, has declared that the ruling party rigged the election with the help of Russia, Georgia's former imperial master. The government's announcement that it was suspending negotiations to join the EU came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution that condemned last month's vote as neither free nor fair, representing yet another manifestation of the continued democratic backsliding 'for which the ruling Georgian Dream party is fully responsible.' European election observers said October's vote took place in a divisive atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on the condition that it meet the bloc's recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. EU lawmakers urged for a rerun of the parliamentary vote within a year under thorough international supervision and by an independent election administration. They also called on the EU to impose sanctions and limit formal contacts with the Georgian government. The Georgian prime minister fired back, denouncing what he described as a 'cascade of insults' from the EU politicians and declaring that 'the ill-wishers of our country have turned the European Parliament into a blunt weapon of blackmail against Georgia, which is a great disgrace for the European Union.' 'We will continue on our path toward the European Union; however, we will not allow anyone to keep us in a constant state of blackmail and manipulation, which is utterly disrespectful to our country and society,' Kobakhidze said. 'We must clearly show certain European politicians and bureaucrats, who are completely devoid of European values, that they must speak to Georgia with dignity, not through blackmail and insults.' Kobakhidze also said Georgia would reject any budgetary grants from the EU until the end of 2028. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws like those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. The EU suspended Georgia's membership application process indefinitely in June, after parliament passed a law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-protesters-clash-with-police-for-2nd-night-after-eu-talks-suspended-/7882026.html	2024-11-29T15:54:16-08:00	
North Korea: Russia has right to exercise self-defense against Ukraine	seoul — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has told the Russian defense minister that Ukraine's use of long-range weapons is the result of direct military intervention by the United States and that Moscow is entitled to fight in self-defense, state media said Saturday. The state-run Korean Central News Agency said Kim met Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov on Friday, and it quoted the North Korean leader as saying, 'The U.S. and the West made Kyiv authorities attack Russia's territory with their own long-range strike weapons.' Russia should take action to make 'hostile forces pay the price,' Kim said. 'The DPRK government, army and people will invariably support the policy of the Russian Federation to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity from the imperialists' moves for hegemony,' KCNA quoted Kim as saying. DPRK is short for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Kim pledged to expand ties with Russia in all areas, including military affairs, under the comprehensive strategic partnership he signed with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June, which includes a mutual defense agreement, KCNA said. Moscow and Pyongyang have dramatically advanced ties since their leaders held a summit in September 2023 in Russia, and the North has since shipped to Russia more than 10,000 containers of ammunition, as well as self-propelled howitzers and multiple rocket launchers, according to South Korea's spy agency. KCNA made no mention of whether Kim and Belousov discussed North Korea's deployment of troops to Russia. South Korea's spy agency has said that North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia and that they have been moved to the front lines, including the Kursk region, where Russian forces are trying to expel Ukrainian forces. Ukraine has fired U.S. ATACMS missiles to strike Russian territory after the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden gave permission to use them for such an attack this month. Russia in turn unleashed attacks against Ukraine's military and energy infrastructures, saying they were made in response to the use of U.S. medium-range missiles. Belousov separately held talks with North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol and said the partnership pact signed by Kim and Putin would contribute to maintaining the balance of power in Northeast Asia. Kim personally attended a reception hosted by the defense ministry for Belousov's delegation, KCNA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-russia-has-right-to-exercise-self-defense-against-ukraine-/7882032.html	2024-11-29T15:33:11-08:00

Kremlin critic convicted again, handed new prison term for opposing war in Ukraine	TALLINN, ESTONIA — Imprisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Gorinov was convicted again on Friday for opposing Russia's war in Ukraine and handed a three-year prison term. A swift, three-day trial against Gorinov, once a low-profile activist, underscored Moscow's intolerance of any dissenting voices. Gorinov, a 63-year-old former member of a Moscow municipal council, is already serving a seven-year prison term for public criticism of the full-scale invasion. Taking into account his previous conviction and sentence, a court in Russia's Vladimir region ordered him to serve a total of five years in a maximum-security prison, a facility with stricter conditions than the one he's currently in. Russia's independent news site Mediazona quoted Gorinov's lawyer as saying that it means he will spend a year more behind bars compared to his previous sentence. Gorinov was first convicted in July 2022, when a court in Moscow sentenced him to seven years in prison for 'spreading false information' about the Russian army at a municipal council meeting. Gorinov allegedly voiced skepticism about a children’s art competition in his constituency while saying that 'every day children are dying' in Ukraine. He was the first known Russian sent to prison under a 2022 law that essentially bans any public expression about the war that deviates from the official narrative. His arrest, conviction and imprisonment has shocked many. In written comments to The Associated Press from behind bars in March 2023, Gorinov said that 'authorities needed an example they could showcase to others (of) an ordinary person, rather than a public figure.' Authorities launched a second case against him last year, according to his supporters. He was accused of 'justifying terrorism' in conversations with his cellmates about Ukraine’s Azov battalion, which Russia outlawed as a terrorist organization, and the 2022 explosion on the Crimean bridge, which Moscow deemed an act of terrorism. Gorinov vehemently rejected the accusations Wednesday, independent news site Mediazona reported. It quoted him as telling the court that he merely said the annexed Crimean Peninsula was Ukrainian territory and called Azov a part of the Ukrainian army. Gorinov’s trial began Wednesday in the Vladimir region, where he is serving time stemming from his previous conviction. Photos from the courtroom, published by Mediazona, showed a weary Gorinov in the defendant’s cage, with a hand-drawn peace symbol on a piece of paper covering his prison badge. He held a hand-written placard saying: 'Stop killing. Let’s stop the war.' He had part of a lung removed before prison and has struggled with respiratory illnesses behind bars. In his closing statement in court on Friday, Gorinov remained defiant and once again condemned the Russian authorities for the war in Ukraine. 'My guilt is that I, as a citizen of my country, allowed this war to happen and could not stop it,' Mediazona quoted him as saying. 'But I would like my guilt and responsibility to be shared with me by the organizers, participants, supporters of the war, as well as the persecutors of those who advocate peace. I continue to live with the hope that this will happen someday. In the meantime, I ask those who live in Ukraine and my fellow citizens who suffered from the war to forgive me,' Gorinov said. According to OVD-Info, a prominent rights group that tracks political arrests, some 1,100 people have been implicated in criminal cases over their anti-war stance since February 2022. A total of 340 of them are currently behind bars or have been involuntarily committed to medical institutions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kremlin-critic-convicted-again-handed-new-prison-term-for-opposing-war-in-ukraine-/7881849.html	2024-11-29T12:18:04-08:00	
Iran to begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges, UN watchdog says	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran will begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges at its two main nuclear facilities at Fordo and Natanz, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Friday, further raising tensions over Tehran's program as it enriches at near weapons-grade levels. The notice from the International Atomic Energy Agency only mentioned Iran enriching uranium with new centrifuges to 5% purity, far lower than the 60% it currently does — likely signaling that it still wants to negotiate with the West and the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. However, it remains unclear how Trump will approach Iran once he enters office, particularly as it continues to threaten to attack Israel amid its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and just after a ceasefire started in its campaign in Lebanon. Trump withdrew America from the accord in 2018. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment over the IAEA's report. Tehran had threatened to rapidly advance its program after the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemned Iran at a meeting in November for failing to cooperate fully with the agency. In a statement, the IAEA outlined the plans Iran informed it about, which include feeding uranium into some 45 cascades of its advanced IR-2M, IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges. Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. Each of these advanced classes of centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran’s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country’s atomic program. The IAEA did not elaborate on how many machines would be in each cascade, but Iran has put around 160 centrifuges into a single cascade in the past. It's unclear if Iran has begun feeding the uranium yet into the centrifuges. Tehran so far has been vague about its plans. But starting the enrichment at 5% gives Tehran both leverage at negotiations with the West and another way to dial up the pressure if they don't like what they hear. Weapons-grade levels of enrichment are about 90%. Since the collapse of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers following the United States’ unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, it has pursued nuclear enrichment just below weapons-grade levels. U.S. intelligence agencies and others assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program. The U.S. State Department said in a statement to The Associated Press it was 'deeply concerned with Iran’s announcement that it is choosing the path of continued escalation as opposed to cooperation with the IAEA.' 'Iran’s continued production and accumulation of uranium enriched up to 60% has no credible civilian justification,' it added. Iran, as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has pledged to allow the IAEA to visit its atomic sites to ensure its program is peaceful. Tehran also had agreed to additional oversight from the IAEA as part of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw sanctions lifted in exchange for drastically limiting its program. However, for years Iran has curtailed inspectors’ access to sites, while also not fully answering questions about other sites where nuclear material has been found in the past after the deal's collapse. Iranian officials in recent months, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian, had signaled a willingness to negotiate with the West. But Iran also has launched two attacks on Israel amid the war. Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian diplomat, said in a post on the social platform that he met with EU diplomat Enrique Mora, criticizing Europe as being 'self-centered' while having 'irresponsible behavior.' 'With regard to the nuclear issue of Iran, Europe has failed to be a serious player due to lack of self-confidence and responsibility,' Gharibabadi wrote. For his part, Mora described having a 'frank discussion' with Gharibabadi and another Iranian diplomat. Those talks included 'Iran’s military support to Russia that has to stop, the nuclear issue that needs a diplomatic solution, regional tensions (important to avoid further escalation from all sides) and human rights,' he wrote on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-to-begin-enriching-uranium-with-thousands-of-advanced-centrifuges-un-watchdog-says-/7881801.html	2024-11-29T11:34:48-08:00	
Ukraine asks NATO for membership invite next week, letter shows	Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has urged his NATO counterparts to issue an invitation at a meeting in Brussels next week to Kyiv to join the Western military alliance, according to the text of a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. The letter reflects Ukraine's renewed push to secure an invitation to join NATO, which is part of a 'victory plan' outlined last month by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to end the war triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion. Ukraine says it accepts that it cannot join the alliance until the war is over but extending an invitation now would show Russian President Vladimir Putin that he could not achieve one of his main goals — preventing Kyiv from becoming a NATO member. 'The invitation should not be seen as an escalation,' Sybiha wrote in the letter. 'On the contrary, with a clear understanding that Ukraine's membership in NATO is inevitable, Russia will lose one of its main arguments for continuing this unjustified war,' he wrote. 'I urge you to endorse the decision to invite Ukraine to join the Alliance as one of the outcomes of the NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting on 3-4 December 2024.' NATO diplomats say there is no consensus among alliance members to invite Ukraine at this stage. Any such decision would require the consent of all NATO's 32 member countries. NATO has declared that Ukraine will join the alliance and that it is on an 'irreversible' path to membership. But it has not issued a formal invitation or set out a timeline. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister in charge of NATO affairs, said Kyiv understood that the consensus for an invitation to join NATO 'is not yet there' but the letter was meant to send a strong political signal. 'We have sent a message to the allies that invitation is not off of the table, regardless of different manipulations and speculations around that,' she told Reuters. In his letter, Sybiha argued an invitation would be the right response 'to Russia's constant escalation of the war it has unleashed, the latest demonstration of which is the involvement of tens of thousands of North Korean troops and the use of Ukraine as a testing ground for new weapons.' In recent days, however, diplomats have said they do not see any changes of stance among NATO countries, particularly as they await the Ukraine policy of the United States — the alliance's dominant power — under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-asks-nato-for-membership-invite-next-week-letter-shows/7881774.html	2024-11-29T11:26:30-08:00	
At least 100 people missing after boat capsizes in northern Nigeria	ABUJA, NIGERIA — At least 100 people, most of them women, were missing after a boat transporting them to a food market capsized along the River Niger in northern Nigeria, authorities said Friday. The boat was taking the passengers from Kogi state along the river to neighboring Niger early Friday when it capsized, Niger State Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Ibrahim Audu told The Associated Press. At least eight people were confirmed dead at the scene while local divers were trying to rescue others, the local Channels Television reported, citing witness accounts. Authorities have not confirmed what caused the sinking. However, local media reported that the boat was carrying more than 200 passengers, suggesting it might have been overloaded. Overcrowding in vehicles is common in remote parts of Nigeria where the lack of good roads leaves many with no alternative routes. Officials in Kogi are yet to locate the exact location of the incident and were seeking assistance from other agencies, according to Justin Uwazuruonye, who oversees Nigeria’s National Emergency Management Agency operations in the state. Such deadly incidents are increasingly becoming a source of concern in Nigeria, Africa’s most-populous country, as authorities struggle to enforce safety measures and regulations for water transportation. Most of the accidents have been attributed to overcrowding and the lack of maintenance of the boats, often built locally to accommodate as many passengers as possible in defiance of safety measures. Authorities have not been able to enforce the use of life jackets on such trips, often because of lack of availability or cost.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-100-people-missing-after-boat-capsizes-in-northern-nigeria/7881713.html	2024-11-29T10:20:08-08:00	
SunFed recalls cucumbers in US, Canada due to potential salmonella	Cucumbers shipped to 13 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces have been recalled because of potential salmonella contamination, the Food and Drug Administration said this week. SunFed Produce, based in Arizona, recalled the cucumbers sold between October 12 and November 26, the FDA said Thursday. No illnesses were immediately reported. People who bought cucumbers during the window should check with the store where they purchased them to see if the produce is part of the recall. Wash items and surfaces that may have been in contact with the produce using hot, soapy water or a dishwasher. Salmonella can cause symptoms that begin six hours to six days after ingesting the bacteria and include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Most people recover without treatment within a week, but young children, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems can become seriously ill. Earlier this summer, a separate salmonella outbreak in cucumbers sickened 450 people in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sunfed-recalls-cucumbers-in-us-canada-due-to-potential-salmonella/7881652.html	2024-11-29T09:40:13-08:00

Notre Dame Cathedral unveils new interior 5 years after devastating fire	After more than five years of frenetic reconstruction work, Notre Dame Cathedral showed its new self to the world Friday, with rebuilt soaring ceilings and creamy good-as-new stonework erasing somber memories of its devastating fire in 2019. Images broadcast live of a site visit by French President Emmanuel Macron showed the inside of the iconic cathedral as worshippers might have experienced it back in medieval times, its wide, open spaces filled with bright light on a crisp and sunny winter’s day that lit up the vibrant colors of the stained-glass windows. Outside, the monument is still a construction site, with scaffolding and cranes. But the renovated interior — shown in its full glory Friday for the first time before the public is allowed back in on December 8 — proved to be breathtaking. Stonemasons fixed the ripped-open ceilings Gone are the gaping holes that the blaze tore into the vaulted ceilings, leaving charred piles of debris. New stonework has been carefully pieced together to repair and fill the wounds that had left the cathedral's insides exposed to the elements. Delicate golden angels look on from the centerpiece of one of the rebuilt ceilings, soaring again above the transept. The cathedral's bright, cream-colored limestone walls look brand new, cleaned not only of dust from the fire but also of grime that had accumulated for centuries. The cathedral attracted millions of worshippers and visitors annually before the April 15, 2019, fire forced its closure and turned the monument in the heart of Paris into a no-go zone except to artisans, architects and others mobilized for the reconstruction. Macron entered via the cathedral’s giant and intricately carved front doors and stared up at the ceilings in wonder. He was accompanied by his wife, Brigitte, the archbishop of Paris and others. Techniques new and old deployed Powerful vacuum cleaners were used to first remove toxic dust released when the fire melted the cathedral's lead roofs. Fine layers of latex were then sprayed onto the surfaces and removed a few days later, taking dirt away with them. Cleaning gels were also used on some walls that had been painted, removing many years of accumulated dirt and revealing their bright colors once again. Carpenters worked by hand like their medieval counterparts as they hewed giant oak beams to rebuild the roof and spire that collapsed like a flaming spear into the inferno. The beams show the marks of the carpenters' handiwork, with dents made on the woodwork by their hand axes. Some 2,000 oak trees were felled to rebuild roof frameworks so dense and intricate that they are nicknamed 'the forest.' Sneak peek ahead of reopening Macron's visit kicked off a series of events ushering in the reopening of the 12th-century Gothic masterpiece. Macron will return on December 7 to deliver an address and attend the consecration of the new altar during a solemn Mass the following day. Macron's administration is hailing the reconstruction as a symbol of national unity and French can-do.	https://www.voanews.com/a/notre-dame-cathedral-unveils-new-interior-5-years-after-devastating-fire-/7881541.html	2024-11-29T09:08:16-08:00	
Paraguay vows to uphold Taiwan ties amid growing Chinese influence in Latin America	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Dario Ramirez Lezcano said Friday the country remains committed to diplomatic ties with Taiwan despite farm sector calls for it to switch to having formal relations with China. At the same time, Ramirez Lezcano said his government is open to establishing trade and other relations with Beijing as long as it would not have to break off its ties with Taiwan. Paraguay is one of only 12 countries maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan — and the only one in South America. 'Paraguay is open to establishing diplomatic, consular or commercial relations with China without conditions,' Ramirez Lezcano told VOA and five other U.S. news organizations. 'We are still committed to supporting the Taiwan government, and we don’t accept any condition to break our relations with Taiwan,' he said. Paraguay has been seeking to gain access to the Chinese market though a trade deal between Beijing and the South American Common Market, known by its Spanish initials Mercosur, which includes countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Uruguay as well as Paraguay. 'Our position with China is one of total openness,' said Paraguayan President Santiago Pena during an August interview with Reuters. 'We are in favor of advancing trade agreements.' However, talks toward a China-Mercosur trade deal have so far been frustrated by disagreements among the Mercosur members and China’s insistence that any country seeking relations with Beijing must renounce its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. 'Principles and values' matter, too Ramirez Lezcano reiterated Friday that economic benefit is not the only consideration for Paraguay when deciding whether to maintain diplomatic relations with any country. 'The most important factors are principles and values, rather than just trade and money,' he said. Analysts say Paraguay’s recognition of Taiwan is not the only obstacle to a China-Mercosur trade deal. There are also fears by some countries within the bloc about overreliance on China and the impact that a deal would have on their own industries. Kung Kwo-Wei, a Latin American affairs expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, noted that Brazil imposed new tariffs In October on Chinese and other Asian imports such as iron, steel and fiber, describing the move as an effort to combat dumping and protect Brazil’s domestic industries. 'Mercosur can only sign a free-trade agreement with China if all member states approve the proposal, but so far, there is no consensus among all member states because Brazil remains cautious about the move,' said Su Yen-pin, an expert on Latin American affairs at National Chengchi University in Taiwan. 'Since Paraguay has repeatedly said it won’t sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan in exchange for signing trade deals with China, that makes it impossible for Mercosur to approve the free-trade agreement with China anytime soon,' he told VOA by phone. China has repeatedly emphasized that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and urged Paraguay to 'follow the trend of history.' 'We hope the government and leader of Paraguay will follow the trend of history, meet the aspiration of its people, stand on the right side of history as early as possible, join the overwhelming majority of the international community, and make the right decision that serves the fundamental and long-term interests of the country,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters in August. Trade with Taiwan While Paraguay is unlikely to sign trade deals with China anytime soon, experts say Taiwan faces pressure to increase its imports from Paraguay and its investments there. 'Members of the Paraguayan Congress tend to discuss the benefits for Paraguay to maintain ties with Taiwan, and there is an increasing sense among Paraguay’s agricultural businesses that they are losing a lot of economic benefits from maintaining ties with Taiwan,' said Fabricio Fonseca, an assistant professor of diplomacy at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University. He said that while Taiwan continues to increase its imports of beef and other agricultural products from Paraguay, farmers in other Mercosur states want the greater access to the China market a trade deal would offer, contributing to the pressure on the Paraguayan government. 'Every once in a while, not only during election cycles, we see these push to discuss the topic of Paraguay’s relations with Taiwan in the Congress, and this will continue to affect bilateral ties between Taiwan and Paraguay,' Fonseca told VOA by phone. Paraguay has also been seeking more Taiwanese investment. Ramirez Lezcano said Asuncion is trying to attract more Taiwanese investments in the high-tech sector. 'Taiwan is establishing an industrial park in Paraguay, and we are working to establish a technological ecosystem with Taiwanese companies,' he told the reporters Friday. While Taiwan has sent several trade delegations to Paraguay in recent years, some Taiwanese analysts say the number of Taiwanese businesses investing in Paraguay remains limited. 'Paraguay is geographically far from Taiwan, and Taiwanese businesses often think it’s difficult to ensure a smooth industrial technology transfer to Paraguay,' Kung Kwo-Wei, a Latin American affairs expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. Despite Taiwan’s limited private sector investment in Paraguay, Kung said the United States and Taiwan are working together to help Paraguay expand its private sector. 'In 2021, Taiwan and the U.S. worked with Paraguay to bolster growth in its renewable energy and electric vehicle sector, and the three countries also jointly established several small business development centers,' he said. Despite the challenges, Su in Taiwan said Paraguay’s ruling Colorado Party is unlikely to make a major shift. 'Unless there is a regime change in Paraguay’s next election, there won’t be too many opportunities for China to influence the diplomatic ties between Taipei and Asunción,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paraguay-vows-to-uphold-taiwan-ties-amid-growing-chinese-influence-in-latin-america/7881481.html	2024-11-29T08:40:33-08:00

Russia’s war in Ukraine inspires exiled journalist to found media startup	PRAGUE — Lola Tagaeva has no problem acknowledging that she is not an easy boss. But when you’re running a startup news outlet from exile while your home country is at war, a steely demeanor can be an asset. 'I think it’s incredibly tough to work with me,' Tagaeva said with pride, when we met at a Prague cafe on a rainy October morning. Tagaeva asks her reporters 'to travel to the future,' she said, and to figure out what stories haven’t been told yet. 'We have to be two steps ahead,' she said. That outlook is what helped put the outlet she founded — Verstka — on the map in such a short period of time. Tagaeva founded the news website from exile shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The outlet now reaches millions of people each month and has grown into a major player in the independent Russian media landscape. Originally from the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, Tagaeva left Russia for Prague in 2019 — not because of safety concerns over her work, but because of her daughter. 'I never wanted to move, actually, but when I gave birth to her, I understood that I wanted her to grow up in a free place,' Tagaeva said. Tagaeva had worked at top Russian independent outlets, including Novaya Gazeta and TV Rain. But after years of hoping that her work would bring change to Russia, only to see the country become more authoritarian, she was burned out. 'Every day was news from [an] apocalypse,' Tagaeva said. Tagaeva’s break from journalism lasted about three years. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the journalist knew that many more stories would need to be told and that the Kremlin would embark on a harsher crackdown on independent media. 'I started to feel some kind of responsibility,' she said. So, she founded Verstka. Verstka is Russian for 'layout,' like the layout of a newspaper’s front page. The outlet started in April 2022 and now reaches millions of people each month, about 70% of whom are inside Russia, according to Tagaeva. Verstka’s success is at least partly a product of the time in which it was founded, when Russian journalists were figuring out how to reinvent themselves during war and as a media crackdown forced them into exile, according to Karol Luczka, who covers eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna. 'They [Verstka’s staff] were able to enter the mainstream of big, Russian independent media without being big and while being very new,' Luczka told VOA. Tagaeva points to Verstka’s commitment to distribution as a main driver behind the outlet’s early success. She had key staff on board even before the outlet was officially founded, Tagaeva said. 'We didn’t have money. We didn’t have staff. But I already had a director of marketing,' Tagaeva said. Like many Russian news outlets, the social media platform Telegram is Verstka’s primary hub. 'I don’t believe in media without good distribution, because it’s not a private blog,' Tagaeva said. 'If I’m not able to distribute what you wrote, we don’t need it.' Perhaps more important than distribution is Tagaeva’s commitment to covering underreported issues. Instead of daily news, Verstka focuses on deeply reported features and investigations — the kinds of stories that readers can’t easily get anywhere else. The outlet was one of the first to report on Russia abducting Ukrainian children. Kyiv estimates that 20,000 Ukrainian children have been taken since the invasion. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and children’s commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova on war crimes charges related to the practice. Moscow says that it has protected vulnerable children from the war zone and that it does not recognize the ICC. The opportunity to produce stories of that weight is what convinced journalist Anna Ryzhkova to work at Verstka. 'I have zero questions about the importance of the work we do,' Ryzhkova told VOA. The priority is stories that are 'impossible not to pay attention to,' she said. Ryzhkova reported for various outlets in Russia before leaving for Georgia shortly after the war began. She has worked at Verstka since it was founded and moved to Prague in 2023. Ryzhkova acknowledges that Tagaeva’s standards are high. But Ryzhkova said she knows that is why Verstka has succeeded in a generally difficult media landscape. 'It’s like an illness. At first, you might not feel really comfortable with the pace of work, but then you just become a part of it,' Ryzhkova said. 'What Lola demands from us is something that we actually demand from ourselves now.' Tagaeva believes that when outlets feel too comfortable, they don’t push themselves, saying, 'There is always space to develop yourself.' In just a couple years, her outlet has expanded from three to about 50 employees — some of whom are still reporting anonymously from inside Russia. But as the third anniversary of the invasion approaches, Tagaeva is concerned that the repressive environment in Russia will hamper the next generation of journalists. 'This, I’m afraid, will be the most dangerous issue for us,' Tagaeva said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moscow has imposed harsh laws and punishments on journalists who don’t follow the Kremlin’s narrative. For journalists still in the country, 'you have to shut up, or you have to go to prison,' Tagaeva said. Although Tagaeva didn’t leave her home because of her work, it’s the main reason that she can’t return anytime soon. She and Verstka have been labeled foreign agents by the Russian government. Tagaeva expects Verstka to eventually be labeled an undesirable organization, like many other independent Russian news outlets. That designation would ban Verstka’s operations in Russia and open up Verstka staffers and sources to fines, criminal charges and jail time. But she remains committed to reporting. And her experience running an outlet has reframed for Tagaeva what it means to have impact. 'We’re not changing the world, but we’re helping people to see the reality,' she said. 'And I think it’s enough for us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-war-in-ukraine-inspires-exiled-journalist-to-found-media-startup/7881408.html	2024-11-29T07:49:49-08:00	
Syria insurgents breach second largest city of Aleppo, fighters and war monitor say	BEIRUT — Insurgents breached Syria’s second-largest city Aleppo after blowing up two car bombs on Friday and were clashing with government forces on the city's western edge, according to a Syria war monitor and fighters. It was the first time the city has been attacked by opposition forces since 2016, when they were ousted from Aleppo's eastern neighborhoods following a grueling military campaign in which Syrian government forces were backed by Russia, Iran and its allied groups. Witnesses in Aleppo city said residents have been fleeing neighborhoods on the western edge of the city because of missiles and exchanges of fire. The government did not comment on insurgents breaching city limits. Syria's Armed Forces said in a statement Friday it has been clashing with insurgents in the countryside around Aleppo and Idlib, destroying several of their drones and heavy weapons. It vowed to repel the attack and accused the insurgents of spreading false information about their advances. Thousands of insurgents have been advancing toward Aleppo city since a shock offensive they launched on Wednesday, seizing several towns and villages along the way. The offensive came as Iran-linked groups, who had backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battle at home. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said the insurgents blew up two car bombs at the city’s western edge on Friday. An insurgent commander issued a recorded message posted on social media calling on the city's residents to cooperate with the advancing forces. Turkey state-run Anadolu Agency reported that the opposition insurgents entered Aleppo city center Friday. It said the insurgents 'broke through the defense lines of the regime forces along the Hamdaniyya, New Aleppo, and Zahra axis on the outskirts of the city.' It added the insurgents now control approximately 70 locations in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Syria’s state media reported earlier Friday that projectiles from insurgents landed in the student accommodations at Aleppo's university in the city center, killing four people, including two students. Public transportation to the city had also been diverted from the main highway linking Aleppo to the capital Damascus to avoid clashes, the report said. Fighters also advanced on the town of Saraqab, in northwestern Idlib province, a strategic area that would secure supply lines to Aleppo. This week's advances were one of the largest by opposition factions, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and come after weeks of low simmering violence. It is most intense fighting in northwestern Syria since 2020, when government forces seized areas previously controlled by opposition fighters. Syria’s Armed Forces said the insurgents are violating a 2019 agreement that de-escalated fighting in the area, which has been the last remaining opposition stronghold for years. The war monitor Observatory said dozens of fighters from both sides have been killed in the battles that started Wednesday. The insurgents have seized control of more than 50 villages in their advance, which seem to have caught the government forces unprepared. Hezbollah, the lead group in an Iran-linked alliance that has backed Syria's government, has been locked in a war with Israel that escalated since September. A cease-fire was announced Wednesday, the day the Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days. 'Hezbollah was the main force in the government’s control of the city,' said Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Observatory. The insurgents reported earlier Friday that fighters had wrested control of the Scientific Research Center neighborhood, about 4 kilometers from the western outskirts of Aleppo city. Government-linked media denied the insurgents have seized it. The Associated Press was not able to immediately verify the claims. Insurgents posted videos online showing they were using drones in their advance, a new weapon they had not had previously in the earlier stages of their confrontation with government forces. It was not clear to what extent the drones were used on the battleground. Turkey’s Anadolu Agency, reporting from Idlib, said insurgents attacked a military airbase southeast of Aleppo city with drones early Friday, destroying a helicopter. It said the opposition groups seized heavy weapons, depots and military vehicles belonging to the government forces during their advance. Aid groups said the fighting has displaced thousands of families and forced some services to be suspended. The opposition fighters said their offensive will allow the return of thousands of displaced people who were forced to flee government bombardment in recent weeks. The 2016 battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters since the 2011 protests against Bashar Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war. Russia and Iran and its allied groups had helped Syrian government forces reclaim control of all of Aleppo that year, after a grueling military campaign and a siege that lasted for weeks. Turkey has been a main backer of an array of opposition forces and its troops have established military presence in parts of northwestern Syria. Separately and largely in the east of Syria, the United States has supported Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State militants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-insurgents-breach-second-largest-city-of-aleppo-fighters-and-war-monitor-say-/7881390.html	2024-11-29T07:07:39-08:00	
Ireland votes as incumbents hope to cling to power	DUBLIN — Ireland is voting Friday in a parliamentary election that will decide the next government — and will show whether Ireland bucks the global trend of incumbents being ousted by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures. Ireland’s 3.8 million voters are selecting 174 lawmakers to sit in the Dail, the lower house of parliament. Here’s a look at the parties, the issues and the likely outcome. Who’s running? The outgoing government was led by the two parties that have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar center-right policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland’s 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat, they formed a coalition, agreeing to share Cabinet posts and take turns as taoiseach, or prime minister. Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin served as premier for the first half of the term and was replaced by Fine Gael’s Leo Varadkar in December 2022. Varadkar unexpectedly stepped down in March, passing the job to current Taoiseach Simon Harris. Opposition party Sinn Fein achieved a stunning breakthrough in the 2020 election, topping the popular vote, but was shut out of government because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refused to work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic ties with militant group the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Under Ireland’s system of proportional representation, each of the 43 constituencies elects multiple lawmakers, with voters ranking their preferences. That makes it relatively easy for smaller parties and independent candidates with a strong local following to gain seats. This election includes a large crop of independent candidates, ranging from local campaigners to far-right activists and reputed crime boss Gerry 'the Monk' Hutch. What are the main issues? As in many other countries, the cost of living — especially housing — has dominated the campaign. Ireland has an acute housing shortage, the legacy of failing to build enough new homes during the country’s 'Celtic Tiger' boom years and the economic slump that followed the 2008 global financial crisis. 'There was not building during the crisis, and when the crisis receded, offices and hotels were built first,' said John-Mark McCafferty, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Threshold. The result is soaring house prices, rising rents and growing homelessness. After a decade of economic growth, McCafferty said 'Ireland has resources' — not least $13.6 billion in back taxes the European Union has ordered Apple to pay it — 'but it is trying to address big historic infrastructural deficits.' Tangled up with the housing issue is immigration, a fairly recent challenge to a country long defined by emigration. Recent arrivals include more than 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by war and thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa. This country of 5.4 million has struggled to house all the asylum-seekers, leading to tent camps and makeshift accommodation centers that have attracted tension and protests. A stabbing attack on children outside a Dublin school a year ago, in which an Algerian man has been charged, sparked the worst rioting Ireland had seen in decades. Unlike many European countries, Ireland does not have a significant far-right party, but far-right voices on social media seek to drum up hostility to migrants, and anti-immigrant independent candidates are hoping for election in several districts. The issue appears to be hitting support for Sinn Fein, as working-class supporters bristled at its pro-immigration policies. What’s the likely outcome? Opinion polls suggest voter support is split into five roughly even chunks — for Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein, several smaller parties and an assortment of independents. Fine Gael has run a gaffe-prone campaign, Fianna Fail has remained steady in the polls and Sinn Fein says it has momentum but is unlikely to win power unless the other parties drop their opposition to working with it. Analysts say the most likely outcome is another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition, possibly with a smaller party or a clutch of independents as kingmakers. 'It’s just a question of which minor group is going to be the group that supports the government this time,' said Eoin O’Malley, a political scientist at Dublin City University. 'Coalition-forming is about putting a hue on what is essentially the same middle-of-the-road government every time.' When will results be known? Polls opened at 7 a.m. Friday and close at 10 p.m., when an exit poll will give the first hints about the result. Counting ballots begins Saturday morning. Full results could take several days, and forming a government days or weeks after that. Prime Minister Harris, who cast his vote in Delgany, south of Dublin, said Irish voters and politicians have 'got a long few days ahead of us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ireland-votes-as-incumbents-hope-to-cling-to-power/7881381.html	2024-11-29T06:59:45-08:00	
3 dead, 90,000 displaced as Malaysia prepares for worst floods in decade	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — Malaysia is preparing for its worst floods in a decade after heavier-than-expected monsoon rains caused severe flooding that killed three people and displaced more than 90,000. The National Disaster Command Center online portal said Friday that 94,778 people from more than 28,000 families across nine states were evacuated to 527 temporary shelters. The northeastern state of Kelantan, bordering Thailand, was the worst affected, with 63,761 people evacuated from their homes, followed by neighboring Terengganu with 22,511. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Friday that all Cabinet ministers were barred from going on vacation. He said they have been instructed to help in flood-prone areas. 'All ministers have been told to go to the ground. Yes, leave has been frozen for them,' Anwar was quoted as saying by national Bernama news agency. His deputy, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who heads the disaster response, said Thursday that floods this year were expected to be worse than 2014, when more than 250,000 people were displaced and 21 killed. He was cited by local media as saying that the weather forecast indicated heavy rainfall next month would likely affect more states. Zahid was quoted by the New Straits Times newspaper as saying that government agencies were prepared to tackle the disaster. Nearly 83,000 personnel and thousands of rescue boats, four-wheel vehicles and life jackets as well as 31 helicopters are ready, he said. The government has also identified 8,481 temporary evacuation centers nationwide that can accommodate over two million people, he said. 'Given the severity of the situation, all parties have been mobilized to ensure the safety and welfare of flood victims,' he was quoted as saying by the national Bernama news agency. Floods are common in parts of Malaysia during the annual monsoon season, which starts in November and could last until March. The Meteorological Department has said the country can expect between five and seven episodes of heavy rainfall during that period.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-90-000-displaced-as-malaysia-prepares-for-worst-floods-in-decade/7881358.html	2024-11-29T06:45:30-08:00	
Family returns to Lebanon to find a crater where their 50-year-old home once stood	BAALBEK, Lebanon — In eastern Lebanon's city of Baalbek, the Jawhari family gathered around a gaping crater where their home once stood, tears streaming as they tried to make sense of the destruction. 'It is heart-breaking. A heartache that there is no way we will ever recover from,' said Lina Jawhari, her voice breaking as she hugged relatives who came to support the family. 'Our world turned upside down in a second.' The home, which was a gathering place for generations, was reduced to rubble by an Israeli airstrike on November 1, leaving behind shattered memories and twisted fragments of a once-vibrant life. The family, like thousands of Lebanese, were returning to check on their properties after the U.S.-mediated cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect early Wednesday. Intense Israeli airstrikes over the past two months leveled entire neighborhoods in eastern and southern Lebanon, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut, which are predominantly Shiite areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a strong base of support. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced. The airstrikes have left a massive trail of destruction across the country. A photo of the Jawhari family's home — taken on a phone by Louay Mustafa, Lina’s nephew — is a visual reminder of what had been. As the family sifted through the rubble, each fragment recovered called them to gather around it. A worn letter sparked a collective cheer, while a photo of their late father triggered sobs. Reda Jawhari had built the house for his family and was a craftsman who left behind a legacy of metalwork. The sisters cried and hoped to find a piece of the mosque-church structure built by their father. Minutes later, they lifted a mangled piece of metal from the debris. They clung to it, determined to preserve a piece of his legacy. 'Different generations were raised with love ... Our life was music, dance, dabke [traditional dance]. This is what the house is made up of. And suddenly, they destroyed our world. Our world turned upside down in a second. It is inconceivable. It is inconceivable,' Lina said. Despite their determination, the pain of losing their home and the memories tied to it remains raw. Rouba Jawhari, one of four sisters, had one regret. 'We are sad that we did not take my mom and dad’s photos with us. If only we took the photos,' she said, clutching an ID card and a bag of photos and letters recovered from the rubble. 'It didn’t cross our mind. We thought it’s two weeks and we will be back.' The airstrike that obliterated the Jawhari home came without warning, striking at 1:30 p.m. on what was otherwise an ordinary Friday. Their neighbor, Ali Wehbe, also lost his home. He had stepped out for food a few minutes before the missile hit and rushed back to find his brother searching for him under the rubble. 'Every brick holds a memory,' he said, gesturing to what remained of his library. 'Under every book you would find a story.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/family-returns-to-lebanon-to-find-a-crater-where-their-50-year-old-home-once-stood-/7881347.html	2024-11-29T06:44:05-08:00	
Iran to enrich uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges, UN says	Iran will begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges at its two main nuclear facilities at Fordo and Natanz, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Friday, further raising tensions over Tehran's program as it enriches at near weapons-grade levels. The notice from the International Atomic Energy Agency mentioned Iran enriching uranium with new centrifuges to only 5% purity, far lower than the 60% it currently does — likely signaling that it still wants to negotiate with the West and the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. However, it remains unclear how Trump will approach Iran once he enters office, particularly as Iran continues to threaten to attack Israel amid Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and just after a ceasefire started with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the IAEA's report. Tehran had threatened to rapidly advance its program after the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemned Iran at a meeting in November for failing to cooperate fully with the agency. In a statement, the IAEA outlined the plans Iran informed it of, which include feeding uranium into multiple cascades of its advanced IR-2M, IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges. Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. Each of these advanced classes of centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran’s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country’s atomic program. The IAEA did not elaborate on how many machines would be in each cascade, but Iran has put around 160 centrifuges into a single cascade in the past. It's unclear if Iran has begun feeding the uranium yet into the centrifuges. Tehran so far has been vague about its plans. But starting the enrichment at 5% gives Tehran leverage at negotiations with the West and another way to dial up the pressure if they don't like what they hear. Weapons-grade levels of enrichment are around 90%. Since the collapse of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers following the United States’ unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, it has pursued nuclear enrichment just below weapons-grade levels. U.S. intelligence agencies and others assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program. Iran, as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has pledged to allow the IAEA to visit its atomic sites to ensure its program is peaceful. Tehran also had agreed to additional oversight from the IAEA as part of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw sanctions lifted in exchange for drastically limiting its program. However, for years Iran has curtailed inspectors’ access to sites while also not fully answering questions about other sites where nuclear material has been found in the past after the deal's collapse. Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, had signaled in recent months a willingness to negotiate with the West. But Iran also has launched two large-scale missile attacks on Israel amid the war. Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian diplomat, said in a post on a social media platform that he met with EU diplomat Enrique Mora and criticized Europe as being 'self-centered' while having 'irresponsible behavior.' 'With regard to the nuclear issue of Iran, Europe has failed to be a serious player due to lack of self-confidence and responsibility,' Gharibabadi wrote. For his part, Mora described having a 'frank discussion' with Gharibabadi and another Iranian diplomat. Those talks included 'Iran’s military support to Russia that has to stop, the nuclear issue that needs a diplomatic solution, regional tensions (important to avoid further escalation from all sides) and human rights,' he wrote on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-to-enrich-uranium-with-thousands-of-advanced-centrifuges-un-says/7881339.html	2024-11-29T06:37:15-08:00	
Russian defense minister visits North Korea for talks with military and political leaders	SEOUL, South Korea — Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in North Korea on Friday for talks with North Korean military and political leaders as the countries deepen their cooperation over Russia’s war in Ukraine. In announcing the visit, Russia’s Defense Ministry didn’t say whom Belousov would meet or the purpose of the talks. North Korean state media didn’t immediately confirm the visit. Belousov, a former economist, replaced Sergei Shoigu as defense minister in May after Russian President Vladimir Putin started a fifth term in power. Photos released by the Defense Ministry showed Belousov walking alongside North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol on a red carpet at Pyongyang airport. North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read, 'Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.' Belousov noted after his arrival that military cooperation between the countries is expanding. He applauded a strategic partnership agreement signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un following their June meeting in Pyongyang, which he said is aimed at reducing tensions by maintaining a 'balance of power' in the region and lowering the risk of war, including with nuclear weapons. The June meeting demonstrated the 'highest level of mutual trust' between the leaders, Belousov said, and 'also the mutual desire of our countries to further expand mutually beneficial cooperation in a complex international environment.' North Korean Defense Minister No also praised the expanding cooperation between the countries’ militaries and reiterated North Korea’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, describing it as a 'just struggle to protect the country’s sovereign rights and security interests.' The visit comes days after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol met with a Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in the South Korean capital, Seoul, and called for the two countries to formulate countermeasures in response to North Korea’s dispatch of thousands of troops to Russia to help its fight against Ukraine. Kim in recent months has prioritized relations with Russia as he tries to break out of isolation and strengthen his international footing, embracing the idea of a 'new Cold War.' The United States and its allies have said North Korea has sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia in recent weeks and that some of those troops were engaging in combat. North Korea has also been accused of supplying artillery systems, missiles and other military equipment to Russia that may help Putin further extend an almost three-year war. There are also concerns in Seoul that North Korea, in exchange for its troops and arms supplies, could receive Russian technology transfers that could improve its nuclear weapons and missile programs. 'The Russian defense minister doesn’t visit North Korea just to celebrate bilateral ties,' said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. 'This visit indicates Putin and Kim’s military cooperation in violation of international law is about to increase further.' Yoon’s national security adviser, Shin Wonsik, said in a TV interview last week that Seoul believes that Russia has provided air defense missile systems to North Korea in exchange for sending its troops. Shin said Russia also appears to have given economic assistance to North Korea and various military technologies, including those needed for the North’s efforts to build a reliable space-based surveillance system, which Kim has stressed is crucial for enhancing the threat of nuclear-capable missiles targeting South Korea. Shin didn’t say whether Russia has already transferred sensitive nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technologies to North Korea. Yoon’s office hasn’t said whether the two governments discussed the possibility of South Korea supplying weapons to Ukraine in his talks with Umerov. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and provided humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv. But it has avoided directly supplying arms, citing a longstanding policy of not giving lethal weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. Yoon has said his government will take phased countermeasures, linking the level of its response to the degree of Russian-North Korean cooperation. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Belousov will meet with Kim, the North Korean leader. Last year, Kim hosted a Russian delegation led by then-Defense Minister Shoigu and gave him a personal tour of a North Korean arms exhibition, in what outside critics likened to a sales pitch. That event came weeks before Kim traveled to Russia for talks with Putin which sped up military cooperation between the countries. During another meeting in Pyongyang in June this year, Kim and Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. The Russian report about Belousov’s visit came as South Korea scrambled fighter jets to repel six Russian and five Chinese warplanes that temporarily entered the country’s air defense identification zone around its eastern and southern seas, according to the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. It said the Russian and Chinese planes did not breach South Korea’s territorial airspace. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it held telephone calls with Chinese and Russian defense attaches based in Seoul to protest the flights and urge the countries to prevent recurrences.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-defense-minister-visits-north-korea-for-talks-with-military-and-political-leaders-/7881323.html	2024-11-29T06:28:17-08:00	
Some Zimbabwean farmers turn to maggots to survive drought and thrive	NYANGAMBE, ZIMBABWE — At first, the suggestion to try farming maggots spooked Mari Choumumba and other farmers in Nyangambe, a region in southeastern Zimbabwe where drought wiped out the staple crop of corn. After multiple cholera outbreaks in the southern African nation resulting from extreme weather and poor sanitation, flies were largely seen as something to exterminate, not breed. 'We were alarmed,' Choumumba said, recalling a community meeting where experts from the government and the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, broached the idea. People had flocked to the gathering in hope of news about food aid. But many stepped back when told it was about training on farming maggots for animal feed and garden manure. 'People were like, ‘What? These are flies. Flies bring cholera,’' Choumumba said. A year later, the 54-year-old walks with a smile to a smelly cement pit covered by wire mesh where she feeds rotting waste to maggots — her new meal ticket. After harvesting the insects about once a month, Choumumba turns them into protein-rich feed for her free-range chickens that she eats and sells. Up to 80% of chicken production costs were gobbled up by feed for rural farmers before they took up maggot farming. Many couldn’t afford the $35 charged by stores for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag of poultry feed, said Francis Makura, a specialist with a USAID program aimed at broadening revenue streams for farmers affected by climate change. But maggot farming reduces production costs by about 40%, he said. Black soldier fly The maggots are offspring of the black soldier fly, which originates in tropical South America. Unlike the house fly, it is not known to spread disease. Their life cycle lasts just weeks, and they lay between 500 and 900 eggs. The larvae devour decaying organic items — from rotting fruit and vegetables to kitchen scraps and animal manure — and turn them into a rich protein source for livestock. 'It is even better than the crude protein we get from soya,' said Robert Musundire, a professor specializing in agricultural science and entomology at Chinhoyi University of Technology in Zimbabwe, which breeds the insects and helps farmers with breeding skills. Donors and governments have pushed for more black soldier fly maggot farming in Africa because of its low labor and production costs and huge benefits to agriculture, the continent’s mainstay that is under pressure from climate change and Russia’s war in Ukraine. In Uganda, the maggots helped plug a fertilizer crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. In Nigeria and Kenya, they are becoming a commercial success. In Zimbabwe The Zimbabwean government and partners piloted it among farmers struggling with securing soya meal for their animals. A World Bank-led project later used it as a recovery effort for communities affected by a devastating 2019 cyclone. Now it is becoming a lifesaver for some communities in the country of 15 million people where repeated droughts make it difficult to grow corn. It's not clear how many people across the country are involved in maggot-farming projects. At first, 'a mere 5%' of farmers that Musundire, the professor, approached agreed to venture into maggot farming. Now that’s up to 'about 50%,' he said, after people understood the protein benefits and the lack of disease transmission. The 'yuck factor' was an issue. But necessity triumphed, he said. With the drought decimating crops and big livestock such as cattle — a traditional symbol of wealth and status and a source of labor — small livestock such as chickens are helping communities recover more quickly. 'They can fairly raise a decent livelihood out of the resources they have within a short period of time,' Musundire said. Reduces waste, too It also helps the environment. Zimbabwe produces about 1.6 million tons of waste annually, 90% of which can be recycled or composted, according to the country’s Environmental Management Agency. Experts say feeding it to maggots can help reduce greenhouse emissions in a country where garbage collection is erratic. At a plot near the university, Musundire and his students run a maggot breeding center in the city of 100,000 people. The project collects over 35 metric tons a month in food waste from the university’s canteens as well as vegetable markets, supermarkets, abattoirs, food processing companies and beer brewers. 'Food waste is living, it respires and it contributes to the generation of greenhouse gases,' Musundire said. According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, food loss — which occurs in the stages before reaching the consumer — and food waste after sale account for 8% to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, or about five times that of the aviation sector. The university project converts about 20 to 30 metric tons of the waste into livestock protein or garden manure in about two weeks. Choumambo said people often sneer as she goes around her own community collecting banana peels and other waste that people toss out at the market and bus station. 'I tell them we have good use for it, it is food for our maggots,' she said. She still has to contend with 'ignorant' people who accuse maggot farmers of 'breeding cholera.' But she cares little about that as her farm begins to thrive. ‘Sweet smell of food’ From bare survival, it is becoming a profitable venture. She can harvest up to 15 kilograms (about 33 pounds) of maggots in 21 days, turning out 375 kilograms (826.7 pounds) of chicken feed after mixing it with drought-tolerant crops such as millets, cowpeas and sunflower and a bit of salt. Choumambo sells some of the feed to fellow villagers at a fraction of the cost charged by stores for traditional animal feed. She also sells eggs and free-range chickens, a delicacy in Zimbabwe, to restaurants. She's one of 14 women in her village taking up the project. 'I never imagined keeping and surviving on maggots,' she said, taking turns with a neighbor to mix rotting vegetables, corn meal and other waste in a tank using a shovel. 'Many people would puke at the sight and the stench. But this is the sweet smell of food for the maggots, and for us, the farmers.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/some-zimbabwean-farmers-turn-to-maggots-to-survive-drought-and-thrive/7881318.html	2024-11-29T06:23:30-08:00	
Ukrainian energy workers carry out repairs despite Russia's pounding of country's power grid	On a bright winter day, workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant repair its heavily damaged equipment as drops of water from melted snow leak through gaping holes in its battered roof. Several weeks earlier, the facility was targeted by a Russian air attack that left scorch marks, shrapnel scars on the walls, and missile fragments scattered across the production floor. 'This is our life now. Workers at a thermal power plant that’s supposed to produce electricity are walking on frozen floors and using firewood to keep warm,' Oleksandr, 52, head of the Production Management Department, told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition that only his first name be used, citing security concerns. Repeated Russian strikes on infrastructure have seriously impacted Ukraine's energy sector often resulting in rolling blackouts across the country. On Thursday, Moscow launched another large-scale air attack. Ukrainian authorities said nearly 200 drones and missiles targeted infrastructure, disrupting power supply to more than a million people. The scale of the ongoing work to fix the sector is huge. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, the G7 and other allied countries have allocated more than $4 billion in energy assistance to Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in September. Oleksandr, who works at the power plant operated by Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, says since the station was first attacked in November 2022, it has been unable to return to full capacity due to continuous strikes that have left critical equipment in ruins. The exact location of the plant visited by the AP, details on the damage and even workers’ last names cannot be disclosed for fear this information could help Russia coordinate future attacks. DTEK operated around 20% of Ukraine’s electricity production before the full-scale invasion, but this figure dropped to 12% since the war broke out. The company says its facilities have been attacked by Russia almost 200 times since 2022. They also say nearly 90% of the company’s infrastructure was destroyed or suffered damage and that was before Russia launched its large-scale attack on November 17. Oleksandr says he expects repairs at the station to continue through the winter into next year, and potentially far beyond. Repair efforts at the plant are further complicated by the fact that some critical equipment was manufactured in the Soviet Union and finding parts is now difficult. To mitigate this, some former Soviet countries who are now Ukraine’s allies have helped supply equipment. 'Potentially, Western countries could also help us with equipment, but their power grids have different characteristics,' Oleksandr said. Only half of DTEK’s generating capacities have been restored since the first attacks on its plants in November 2022 until the latest large-scale strike. Earlier this week, the European Commission and the U.S. government announced a donation of $112 million in equipment and construction materials to help DTEK prepare for the winter. With the war in its third year, staff at DTEK’s plant have adapted to the grim reality of their day-to-day existence. They know the protocols by heart. Not everyone can take shelter during an air alert. A minimal crew must remain in the control room to oversee operations, putting themselves at risk of a direct strike. 'You have to sit and wait while monitoring the trajectories of whatever was fired, but the power units keep working so we cannot just leave, we stay in the control room,' said Dmytro, 41, a power unit operator at the plant. Despite the challenges, Dmytro and his colleagues press on, driven by a mission to keep the lights on in their town and region over the winter months. 'Who’ll do it, if not us? I also have family waiting for me at home, but if we all leave and the equipment breaks down, the responsibility will be on our shoulders, the entire city will lose electricity and heating,' he said. 'Some are risking [their lives] at the frontline, while we here have our own energy front.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-energy-workers-carry-out-repairs-despite-russia-s-pounding-of-country-s-power-grid-/7881304.html	2024-11-29T06:13:46-08:00	
Landslide triggered by rain in Indonesia's Sumatra island kills 9 people in tourist bus	SIBOLANGIT, Indonesia — Rescuers recovered two more bodies from a tourist bus hit by a landslide triggered by torrential rains on Indonesia’s Sumatra island, bringing the death toll from the incident to nine, officials said. At least 20 people have died in other landslides and floods in the region this week. Rescuers recovered the bodies from the bus, which was covered by trees, mud and rocks from the landslide on the road from Medan city to Berastagi in North Sumatra province, officials said late Thursday. The road is the main route from the capital, Medan, to other districts in the region. The bus was among vehicles that had been cut off by previous landslides along the road since Wednesday morning. More than 10 people were also injured and were taken to a hospital in Medan city. Muji Ediyanto of the North Sumatra Regional Police said in a video message distributed by Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency on Thursday that some vehicles and their passengers remained trapped between landslides along the road. 'It will take at least two days to evacuate them from the landslides. Several vehicles are still trapped by debris from the landslides. There also are fallen trees at several points and the vehicles have not been able to get out of those locations,' Ediyanto said. Earlier this week, 20 people died from flash floods and landslides at four locations in the mountains of North Sumatra province, including in Karo regency, which is less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the most-recent landslides. Seasonal rains from around October through to March frequently cause flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/landslide-triggered-by-rain-in-indonesia-s-sumatra-island-kills-9-people-in-tourist-bus-/7881273.html	2024-11-29T05:47:08-08:00	
Over a year after Wagner Group leader’s death, Russian mercenaries aren’t going away	When Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in an August 2023 plane crash, many analysts said his death could mark the end of the Wagner Group, the private military company he co-founded that provided thousands of Russian mercenaries for Moscow’s initiatives and other interests abroad. But more than a year later, the picture of Russian mercenary activities has only grown more complicated, researchers say. Before Prigozhin’s death, Wagner’s mercenaries had fought in conflicts around the world –– from Ukraine to the Middle East and Africa –– and helped Russia to spread its influence far beyond its borders. Along the way, Wagner faced allegations of murdering African civilians and committing war crimes. Then, in June 2023, Prigozhin launched an unexpected insurrection against Russian authorities over their handling of the war in Ukraine. His mercenaries captured the city of Rostov-on-Don and marched on toward Moscow. Prigozhin stood down only after the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, mediated a deal. After such brazen insubordination, many were unsurprised when Prigozhin died in a plane crash less than two months later. But predictions that the Wagner Group’s activities would die with him have proven to be untrue. Wagner Group fighters are still active in the Central African Republic and Mali. In other countries like Niger, it has been replaced by Africa Corps, a successor organization subordinate to Russia’s defense ministry. In other cases, different Russian militarized structures have picked up the Wagner name and symbols. What is clear to analysts is that Russian mercenaries are not going away. If anything, the future of Russian private military companies will be 'more sustainable and less spectacular' according to Jack Margolin, an independent researcher who recently published a book on the Wagner Group. Since Prigozhin’s death, Russia has 'really effectively created infrastructure and incentive structures in order to draw in former [Wagner] fighters and build this system of semi-formal forces,' he told VOA. Ties with the Russian state The Wagner Group’s activities around the world have always been intertwined with Russian foreign policy, but the exact nature of that connection is a subject of debate among experts. Margolin notes that Wagner co-founder Dmitry Utkin –– who also died in the August 2023 plane crash –– served in the special forces of Russia’s foreign intelligence agency, commonly called the GRU. Around 2014, he and Prigozhin founded the Wagner Group, which was initially small. That same year, Wagner took part in the illegal Russian annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. Later, the mercenaries were dispatched to the pseudo-state Russia propped up in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk. During this period, there is ample evidence that Wagner actively cooperated with the Russian defense ministry –– in part because Ukraine intercepted Wagner conversations with Russian officers. But when Wagner operations moved beyond Ukraine, the picture grew more complicated. Experts differ on how to interpret it. Maria Kucherenko leads Russian studies at the Ukraine-based Come Back Alive Initiatives Center. She believes that Wagner was created by Russian military intelligence and remains under its control. For this reason, she views the post-Prigozhin changes in the mercenary corps as largely superficial. 'Only the surnames of the GRU generals in charge have changed,' she said. Other analysts paint a more complex picture of Wagner’s ties with the Russian state. Margolin sees a greater degree of freedom in Wagner’s past activities. 'They acted in the GRU’s interest. They coordinated with the GRU. All of Wagner's operations abroad were supported by logistics that were owned by the Ministry of Defense,' he said. 'But at the same time, they were still able to determine in this local context exactly what they wanted to do.' John Lechner, a researcher who will publish a book on Wagner in March, believes the mercenary corps’ relationship with the Russian state heavily depended on the country where it was operating. In Ukraine and Syria, where the mercenaries backed the government of Bashar al-Assad, Wagner actively collaborated with the Russia’s defense ministry. But in sub-Saharan Africa, where the Russian state had a very limited presence, Wagner was able to decide what Russia’s national interests were, Lecher said in an interview. Wagner wasn’t 'just a shadowy arm of the Kremlin pursuing the Kremlin’s interests; they were creating them,' he said. What next? Since Prighzoin’s death, Wagner has undergone significant changes –– although analysts disagree about how fundamental they are. Russian journalist Ilya Barabanov, who coauthored a Russian-language history of Wagner, believes that the old private military company essentially no longer exists. 'Over the last year and a half, we’ve seen Prigozhin’s empire being broken apart,' he told VOA. 'Some [parts] are going to the Ministry of Defense. Some are going to the Russian National Guard. Some are going to Chechnya’s Akhmat special forces.' The original Wagner, meanwhile, continues to operate only in the Central African Republic, Mali, and Belarus. Despite these changes, the dissolution of Wagner is going more slowly than expected because the Kremlin is too busy waging war in Ukraine, Barabanov added. Margolin emphasizes that Russia’s successor mercenary structures won’t function the same way Wagner did. The Wagner Group stood out for its risk appetite and relative independence from the Russian government. In the Central African Republic, it was Wagner that decided to transition from a strategy of defending the capital of Bangui and the country’s political elite to a more aggressive battle with insurgents, he notes. Wagner also decided with whom it would do business. In contrast, Africa Corps and other successor companies are much more risk-averse and more actively coordinate their activities with Russian military intelligence, Margolin said. Lechner notes that efforts to replace Wagner have been more successful in some places than others. Starting in 2019, Wagner mercenaries fought in Libya on the side of rebel general Khalifa Haftar. But in October 2020, he signed a ceasefire with the United Nations-backed Libyan government. Because active fighting had stopped, Russia had little trouble replacing Wagner there with Africa Corps, Lechner said. In Mali, Wagner mercenaries are engaged in pitched battles with Tuareg separatists and Islamist fighters in the country’s north. In late July, dozens of Russian fighters were killed in an ambush near the town of Tinzaouaten. Lechner suggests that in the future there will be multiple 'mini-Prigozhins' in charge of Russian military companies, but not one individual with 'all of the political clout and business interests that Prigozhin had come to represent.' Both Margolin and Lechner agree that, while Wagner is no longer officially fighting in Ukraine, its influence on that conflict has been significant. Journalists have often pointed out Wagner’s usage of so-called 'meat storms,' when the company was willing to sacrifice waves of men to wear down Ukrainian forces. The tactic was particularly noticeable during the 2022-23 battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which Russia eventually razed and captured. But Wagner also gained military experience in the Middle East and Africa that the official Russian military is now applying in Ukraine: for example, devolving command authority to lower echelons and small unit tactics, Margolin said. 'Wagner has in many ways achieved the thing that Prigozhin said was necessary during the siege of Bakhmut, which was that the Russian armed forces needed to become more like Wagner to be more effective,' he told VOA. Lechner refers to it as the 'Wagnerization of the Russian military.' Resisting Russian mercenaries abroad Regardless of exactly what structures succeed Wagner, Russian mercenary activities will likely continue to worry Western governments. Experts say it will be difficult to push back against their influence abroad. Ukrainian researcher Kucherenko believes that the U.S., European countries, Ukraine, and other partners must join forces to counteract Russian mercenaries. But she suggests they must look higher in the command structure. 'We need to evaluate them as representatives of the GRU itself,' she said. She suggests directing particular attention to Yunus-bek Yevkurov, Russia’s deputy defense minister, and Major General Andrei Averyanov, the reported former commander of a secretive military intelligence unit that has conducted assassinations abroad. Both men now are reputed to play key roles in Africa Corps. Margolin suggests that, among other efforts, the U.S. should focus on export controls to limit the mercenaries’ access to military technologies, especially drone technologies, which played a key role in Wagner’s activities in Ukraine. He also suggests that Western governments should be cautious about propping up African regimes with poor human rights records and entrenched corruption, despite any fears that Russia will rush in if they do not. In fact, engaging with such governments feeds popular anger against the West, which in turn provides 'fertile ground for organizations like Wagner to take root,' Margolin said. Lechner notes that Wagner expanded its presence in Africa as Western powers exited the continent. For example, France withdrew its forces from the Central African Republic in 2016 amid a civil war in the country. Wagner stepped in to provide security for the country’s leadership. 'I don't think there is any interest for the United States to put troops on the ground in Africa to be perfectly honest,' Lechner said. Short of that, he said, 'I'm not exactly sure what [Western powers] can offer.' Russian mercenaries have few similar competitors in the region. Though China is active in Africa, its activities are mainly focused on large economic investments. Even Wagner’s business activities have mostly not placed it in conflict with China. Russian journalist Barabanov suggests there is one more factor that will play a key role in determining the future of Russian mercenaries: Russia’s war against Ukraine. If that conflict ends, then 'the Russian government will have a huge human resource of veterans who fought in this war,' he said, 'and they can probably be used in other, far-off conflicts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-a-year-after-wagner-group-leader-s-death-russian-mercenaries-aren-t-going-away/7881045.html	2024-11-29T02:56:46-08:00	
Israeli tanks retreat from central Gaza camp; medics say 30 killed	CAIRO — Israeli military strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians overnight in the Gaza Strip, most of them in the Nuseirat camp at the center of the enclave, medics said on Friday after some tanks pulled back from an area they had raided. Medics said they had recovered 19 bodies of Palestinians killed in the northern areas of Nuseirat, one of the enclave's eight long-standing refugee camps. Some tanks remained active in the western area of the camp and the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said teams were unable to respond to distress calls from residents trapped inside their houses. The rest were killed in the northern and southern areas of the Gaza Strip, medics added. There was no fresh statement by the Israeli military on Friday, but on Thursday it said its forces were continuing to 'strike terror targets as part of the operational activity in the Gaza Strip.' Meanwhile, the Israeli authorities released around 30 Palestinians whom it had detained during the ongoing offensive in Gaza in the past months. The released people arrived at a hospital in southern Gaza for medical checkups, medics said. Freed Palestinians, detained during the war, have complained of ill treatment and torture in Israeli detention after they were released. Israel denies torture. Months of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza have yielded scant progress, and negotiations are now on hold. A ceasefire in the parallel conflict between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, took effect before dawn on Wednesday, bringing a halt to hostilities that had escalated sharply in recent months and had overshadowed the Gaza conflict. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 44,200 people and displaced nearly all the enclave's population at least once, Gaza officials say. Vast swathes of the territory are in ruins. The Hamas-led militants who attacked southern Israeli communities 13 months ago, triggering the war, killed some 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages, Israel has said. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-tanks-retreat-from-central-gaza-camp-medics-say-30-killed/7881136.html	2024-11-29T02:55:57-08:00	
China court jails journalist for 7 years on spy charges, family says	BEIJING/HONG KONG — A Beijing court sentenced veteran Chinese state media journalist Dong Yuyu on Friday to seven years in prison for espionage, his family said in a statement, calling the verdict a grave injustice. Police in the Chinese capital detained the 62-year-old former Guangming Daily editor and journalist in February 2022 while he was lunching with a Japanese diplomat, the U.S. National Press Club said in a statement. He was later charged with espionage. 'Sentencing Yuyu to seven years in prison on no evidence declares to the world the bankruptcy of the justice system in China,' Dong's family said in a statement provided to Reuters. 'Today's verdict is a grave injustice not only to Yuyu and his family but also to every freethinking Chinese journalist and every ordinary Chinese committed to friendly engagement with the world.' The family added that in the court judgment, Japanese diplomats whom Dong met were 'specifically named as agents of an 'espionage organization,' which is the Japanese embassy in Beijing.' Dong's conviction implied every Chinese citizen would be 'expected to know that the Chinese government may consider those embassies to be 'espionage organizations',' it said, causing a chilling effect. Police guarded the court on Friday, with seven police cars parked nearby, and journalists were asked to leave the area. A U.S. diplomat said they had been barred from attending the hearing. Dong has been detained in a Beijing prison since a closed-court hearing in July 2023, the press club said in September. 'Chinese authorities must reverse this unjust verdict, and protect the right of journalists to work freely and safely in China,' said Beh Lih Yi, Asia program manager at the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'Dong Yuyu should be reunited with his family immediately.' Dong regularly had in-person exchanges with diplomats from various embassies and journalists. The Japanese diplomat he met, one of two he had regularly met in the past, was also detained for several hours, spurring a complaint from Japan's foreign ministry. At the time, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the diplomat was engaged in activities 'inconsistent with their capacity' in China. The diplomat was later released. A Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 2007, Dong was a visiting scholar and visiting professor at Keio University and Hokkaido University in Japan, his family said in a statement in April 2023. He joined the Guangming Daily, affiliated to the ruling Communist Party, in 1987, after graduating from Peking University law school, and was the deputy editor of its commentary section. He wrote opinion articles in Chinese media and liberal academic journals on topics from legal reforms to social issues and co-edited a book promoting the rule of law in China. His articles advocated moderate reforms while avoiding direct criticism of President Xi Jinping. His family had initially kept news of his detention private in the hope that charges could be reduced or dropped, but were told in March 2023 that he would stand trial, they said in their statement. Non-government bodies (NGOs) advocating press freedom have called for his release, with more than 700 journalists, academics and NGO workers signing an online petition for him to be freed. 'Dong Yuyu is a talented reporter and author whose work has long been respected by colleagues,' said Ann Marie Lipinski, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard. 'We stand with many in hoping for his release and return to his family.' In February, a Beijing court handed a suspended death sentence to Australian writer and pro-democracy blogger, Yang Hengjun, on espionage charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-court-jails-journalist-for-7-years-on-spy-charges-family-says/7881082.html	2024-11-28T23:03:30-08:00	
Putin threatens Kyiv with new hypersonic cruise missile	Russian President Vladimir Putin Thursday threatened to strike 'decision-making centers in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, with Russia’s new Oreshnik hypersonic cruise missiles, after pounding Ukrainian energy infrastructure and cutting off power to more than one million people across the country. 'We do not rule out the use of Oreshnik against the military, military-industrial or decision-making centers, including in Kyiv,' Putin told a news conference in the Kasakh capital, Astana. He said he launched Thursday’s drone and missile attack against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with U.S. medium-range ATACMS missiles. The attack marked Russia’s second big attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this month. Officials said it was the 11th major strike on Ukraine’s energy system since March. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Moscow of a 'despicable escalation,' saying it had used cruise missiles with cluster munitions. The attack marks Russia’s second big attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this month. Officials said it was the 11th major strike on Ukraine’s energy system since March. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow launched the attack in response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with U.S. medium-range ATACMS missiles. Putin also said Russia’s future targets could include 'decision-making centers' in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. Ukraine called on the international community to respond to Putin’s threats to target government centers in Kyiv. 'We expect those countries that have urged everyone to avert the expansion of the war to react to the statements voiced by Putin today,' Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said. In addition to the more than 1 million people who lost power in the aftermath of the strikes, millions more had their existing schedule of rolling power cuts escalated. The Ukrainian air force said Russia used 91 missiles and 97 drones in the assault. The air force said 12 of those hit their targets, the majority of which were energy and fuel facilities. All missiles or drones aimed at Kyiv were brought down, officials said. 'The enemy is using a large number of missiles and drones. Their massive use in certain areas often exceeds the number of means of [air defense] cover,' the air force said in a statement. In the Lviv region, 523,000 subscribers lost electricity, regional head Maksym Kozytsky said on social media. The region, in the western part of the country, borders Poland. Directly north of the Lviv region, 215,000 customers lost power in the region of Volyn, and 280,000 lost power in the neighboring Rivne region, their governors said. 'Energy infrastructure is once again targeted by the enemy’s massive strike,' Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote on Facebook. Ukrenergo, the national electrical grid operator, introduced emergency power cuts amid the attack, Galushchenko said. Officials told Reuters that several nuclear power units were disconnected from the network during the attacks. Private power company DTEK said the power cuts impacted Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions. Some regional officials said water service was also affected by the airstrikes. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andrii Yermak, said in a Telegram post that Russia had stockpiled missiles to strike Ukrainian infrastructure and wage war against civilians during the cold season, The Associated Press reported. The three-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is looming, and Russian ground forces are advancing at their fastest pace in two years. On Thursday, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry urged its partners to accelerate the delivery of military aid, saying that was more important than drafting more men. 'We are now in the situation when we need more equipment to arm all the people that have already been mobilized, and we think the first priority is to send quicker, faster military aid,' Tykhyi, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, told reporters in Kyiv. The statement comes one day after a senior U.S. official said Wednesday that Ukraine should consider lowering the age of military service for its soldiers from 25 years old to 18 in order to replace those lost on the battlefield. On Thursday, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak said Ukraine is ready to host a second global summit aimed at ending Russia’s invasion in the 'nearest future,' according to local media. Kyiv hosted its first 'peace summit' in June in Switzerland. Russia was not invited. Speaking in Kazakhstan on Thursday, Putin said there were no preconditions to start talks with Ukraine on a possible peace deal, but that terms he set out in June for the deal remained the same. In June, Putin said Russia would end the war only if Kyiv agreed to drop its NATO ambitions and hand over four entire Ukrainian provinces claimed by Moscow. Kyiv rejected those demands as amounting to surrender. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-threatens-kyiv-with-new-hypersonic-cruise-missile-/7881061.html	2024-11-28T21:33:27-08:00	
What Black Friday's history tells us about holiday shopping in 2024	NEW YORK — The holiday shopping season is about to reach full speed with Black Friday, which kicks off the post-Thanksgiving retail rush this week. The annual sales event no longer creates the midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem of recent decades, in large part due to the ease of online shopping and habits forged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hoping to entice equivocating consumers, retailers already have spent weeks bombarding customers with ads and early offers. Still, whether visiting stores or clicking on countless emails promising huge savings, tens of millions of U.S. shoppers are expected to spend money on Black Friday itself this year. Industry forecasts estimate that 183.4 million people will shop in U.S. stores and online between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation and consumer research firm Prosper Insights & Analytics. Of that number, 131.7 million are expected to shop on Black Friday. At the same time, earlier and earlier Black Friday-like promotions, as well as the growing strength of other shopping events (hello, Cyber Monday), continue to change the holiday spending landscape. Here's what you need to know about Black Friday's history and where things stand in 2024. When is Black Friday in 2024? Black Friday falls on the Friday after Thanksgiving each year, which is November 29 this year. How old is Black Friday? Where does its name come from? The term 'Black Friday' is several generations old, but it wasn't always associated with the holiday retail frenzy that we know today. The gold market crash of September 1869, for example, was notably dubbed Black Friday. The phrase's use in relation to shopping the day after Thanksgiving, however, is most often traced to Philadelphia in the mid-20th century — when police and other city workers had to deal with large crowds that congregated before the annual Army-Navy football game and to take advantage of seasonal sales. 'That’s why the bus drivers and cab drivers call today 'Black Friday.' They think in terms of headaches it gives them,' a Gimbels department store sales manager told The Associated Press in 1975 while watching a police officer try to control jaywalkers the day after Thanksgiving. Earlier references date back to the 1950s and 1960s. Jie Zhang, a professor of marketing at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, points to a 1951 mention of 'Black Friday' in a New York-based trade publication — which noted that many workers simply called in sick the day after Thanksgiving in hopes of having a long holiday weekend. Starting in the 1980s, national retailers began claiming that Black Friday represented when they went from operating in the red to in the black thanks to holiday demand. But since many retail companies now operate in the black at various times of the year, this interpretation should be taken with a grain of salt, experts say. How has Black Friday evolved? In recent decades, Black Friday became infamous for floods of people in jam-packed stores. Endless lines of shoppers camped out at midnight in hopes of scoring deep discounts. But online shopping has made it possible to make most, if not all, holiday purchases without ever stepping foot inside a store. And while foot traffic at malls and other shopping areas has bounced back since the start of the pandemic, e-commerce isn't going away. November sales at brick-and-mortar stores peaked more than 20 years ago. In 2003, for example, e-commerce accounted for 1.7% of total retail sales in the fourth quarter, according to Commerce Department data. Unsurprisingly, online sales make up a much bigger slice of the pie today. For last year's holiday season, e-commerce accounted for about 17.1% of all nonadjusted retail sales in the fourth quarter, Commerce Department data show. That's up from 12.7% seen at the end of 2019. Beyond the rise of online shopping, some big-ticket items that used to get shoppers in the door on the Black Friday — like a new TV — are significantly cheaper than they were decades ago, notes Jay Zagorsky, a clinical associate professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business. 'There is less need to stand in line at midnight when the items typically associated with doorbuster sales are now much cheaper,' Zagorsky told The Associated Press via email. He pointed to Bureau of Labor Statistics data that show the average price for a TV has fallen 75% since 2014. While plenty of people will do most of their Black Friday shopping online, projections from the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights indicated that most Black Friday shoppers (65%) still planned to shop in stores this year. Black Friday ‘month’ and the rise of Cyber Monday It's no secret that Black Friday sales don't last just 24 hours anymore. Emails promising holiday deals now start arriving before Halloween. 'Black Friday is no longer the start of the holiday shopping season. It has become the crescendo of the holiday shopping season' during what now feels like 'Black Friday month,' Zhang said. Some retailers have updated their official marketing to refer to 'Black Friday week.' Retailers trying to get a head start on the competition and to manage shipping logistics helps explain the rush, Zhang said. Offering early holiday deals spreads out purchases, giving shippers more breathing room to complete orders. Zhang therefore doesn't expect the five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year to cause significant strain because retailers would have taken them into account. Linking pre-Thanksgiving sales with Black Friday is also a marketing technique since it's a name consumers recognize and associate with big, limited-time bargains, Zhang said. Multiple post-Thanksgiving sales events keep shoppers enticed after Black Friday, including Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday, which the National Retail Federation's online arm designated in 2005. U.S. consumers spent a record $12.4 billion on Cyber Monday in 2023, and $15.7 million per minute during the day's peak sales hour, according to Adobe Analytics. On Black Friday, they spent $9.8 billion online, Adobe Analytics said. Enough people still enjoy shopping in person after Thanksgiving that the activity is unlikely to become extinct, Boston University's Zagorsky said. While Black Friday's significance 'is being slightly diminished' over time, the shopping event is still 'a way to connect with others,' he said. 'This social aspect is important and will not disappear, ensuring that Black Friday is still an important day for retailers.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-black-friday-s-history-tells-us-about-holiday-shopping-in-2024/7878886.html	2024-11-28T19:52:51-08:00	
Chad ends defense cooperation agreement with France	N'DJAMENA, chad — Chad's government said Thursday that it had ended its defense cooperation pact with France, a move that could see French troops leave the Central African country. In a statement, Chad's foreign ministry said the country, a key Western ally in the fight against Islamic militants in the region, wanted to fully assert its sovereignty after more than six decades of independence. It said the decision to end the defense cooperation agreement revised in 2019 would enable it to redefine its strategic partnerships. Chad has cooperated closely with Western nations' military forces in the past, but it has moved closer to Russia in recent years. The decision is another nail in the coffin of France's historic and colonial role in West and Central Africa after being forced to pull its troops out of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso following military coups. The military juntas have since turned to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel region - a band of countries stretching from Africa's northwest to northeast coasts - and has been fostering closer ties with Chad's President Mahamat Deby. 'In accordance with the terms of the accord, Chad will respect the modalities of the termination, including the necessary deadlines, and will collaborate with French authorities to ensure a harmonious transition,' the statement said. The French foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment. France's foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, on Thursday visited Chad's border with Sudan. There were no indications that Paris had been given advance notice of the decision, although a French envoy to President Emmanuel Macron this week handed in a report with proposals on how France could reduce its military presence in Chad, Gabon and Ivory Coast, where it has deployed thousands of troops for decades. France has around 1,000 troops as well as warplanes stationed in Chad. In a further blow to France, Senegal's President Bassirou Diomaye Faye said in an interview with French state TV on Thursday that it was inappropriate for French troops to maintain a presence in his country. He stopped short of saying if or when French troops would be asked to leave, but he said Paris would be the first to know. Around 350 French troops are based in Senegal. The statement by Chad's foreign ministry said the decision to end the nation's defense partnership with France should in no way undermine the friendly relations between the two countries. Earlier this year, Chad ordered a small contingent of U.S. special operations to leave the country. In September, the U.S. said it was in talks for them to return. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on whether it has a presence in Chad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-ends-defense-cooperation-agreement-with-france/7881027.html	2024-11-28T18:54:00-08:00	
Canada sues Google, alleges anticompetitive practices in online ads	toronto — Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday that it was suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and that it wanted the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty. The Competition Bureau said such action was necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company unlawfully tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position. The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about noncompliance with the Competition Act. The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges. This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues. 'Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors and distorting the competitive process,' Matthew Boswell, commissioner of competition, said in a statement. Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector. Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint 'ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.' The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation. U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade. The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-sues-google-alleges-anticompetitive-practices-in-online-ads/7881017.html	2024-11-28T18:11:35-08:00

Liberia's warlord-turned-senator Prince Johnson dies at 72	MONROVIA, LIBERIA — Prince Johnson, the Liberian former warlord and senator whose brutal tactics shocked the world, has died at the age of 72, authorities said Thursday. Johnson, who infamously videotaped himself drinking Budweiser as his men cut off the ears of the nation's former president, remained active in politics after the civil war ended and was elected senator in 2006. He died on Thursday at a local hospital in Paynesville, a suburb of Monrovia, said Siafa Jallah, deputy director of press relations at the Liberian senate. Liberia's civil wars, marked by mass killings, torture and sexual violence, killed an estimated 250,000 people between 1989 and 2003. Johnson was named one of the 'most notorious perpetrators' by the country's post-war truth and reconciliation committee, and was accused of killing, extortion, massacre, torture and rape among other charges. Neither Johnson nor the other seven people that the committee listed as leaders of warring factions were ever tried in Liberia. But a handful were convicted overseas, including Charles Taylor, a former president, who is serving a 50-year-sentence in the United Kingdom. Mohammed Jabbateh, a rebel commander who witnesses said killed civilians and ordered his soldiers to rape young girls, was sentenced to 30 years in the U.S. Earlier this year, President Joseph Boakai signed an executive order to create a long-awaited war crimes court to deliver justice to the civil wars' victims, but the court hasn't begun operating. Adama Dempster, a Liberian human rights advocate, expressed regret that Johnson was unable to testify before the proposed tribunal before he died. 'It's sad and has a deep meaning for an accountability process,' he said. In 1990, the then-38-year-old Johnson led a rebel faction that invaded Monrovia, captured former President Samuel Doe and tortured him in front of a rolling camera. Johnson is seen kicking back in a chair, his feet up on a table and a bottle of beer in one hand. He taunts the former ruler as his men strip the president to his underwear then cut off his ears, as blood streams down his temple. The president later died, and according to one witness' testimony in front of the nation's truth and reconciliation commission, Johnson later showed off Doe's head on a platter. After the end of the war, Johnson became a born-again Christian and ordained preacher, before being elected senator representing Nimba County. The country banned the sale of Doe's notorious torture tape that had once been widely available at streetside stalls.	https://www.voanews.com/a/liberia-s-warlord-turned-senator-prince-johnson-dies-at-72/7881010.html	2024-11-28T17:42:49-08:00

Democratic lawmakers from Connecticut report Thanksgiving bomb threats	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — At least five Democratic members of Congress from Connecticut were targeted by bomb threats on their homes Thursday, the lawmakers or their offices said. Senator Chris Murphy and Representatives Jim Himes, Joe Courtney, John Larson and Jahana Hayes all reported being the subject of such threats. Police who responded said they found no evidence of explosives on the lawmakers' properties. There was no immediate word whether Representative Rosa DeLauro, the fifth Democratic House member from the state, and Connecticut's other Democratic senator received threats. The bomb threats against Democrats came a day after a number of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks and appointees reported that they had received such threats, as well as 'swatting attacks,' in which perpetrators initiate an emergency law enforcement response against a victim under false pretenses. Murphy's office said his Hartford home was the target of a bomb threat, 'which appears to be part of a coordinated effort involving multiple members of Congress and public figures.' Hartford Police and U.S. Capitol Police determined there was no threat. Hayes said the Wolcott Police Department informed her Thursday morning that it had received 'a threatening email stating a pipe bomb had been placed in the mailbox at my home.' State police, U.S. Capitol Police, and the House sergeant at arms were notified, Wolcott and state police responded, 'and no bomb or explosive materials were discovered.' Courtney's Vernon home received a bomb threat while his wife and children were there, his office said. Himes said he was told of the threat against his home during a Thanksgiving celebration with his family. The U.S. Capitol Police, and Greenwich and Stamford police departments responded. Hines extended his family's 'utmost gratitude to our local law enforcement officers for their immediate action to ensure our safety.' Echoing other lawmakers who were threatened, he added: 'There is no place for political violence in this country, and I hope that we may all continue through the holiday season with peace and civility.' Larson said Thursday that East Hartford Police responded to a bomb threat against his home. The threats follow an election season marked by violence. In July, a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing his ear and killing one of his supporters. The Secret Service later thwarted a subsequent assassination attempt at Trump's West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course when an agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through a perimeter fence while Trump was golfing. Among those who received threats Wednesday were New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Trump's pick to serve as the next ambassador to the United Nations; Matt Gaetz, Trump's initial pick to serve as attorney general; Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, whom Trump chose to lead the Department of Labor, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin, who has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democratic-lawmakers-from-connecticut-report-thanksgiving-bomb-threats/7881000.html	2024-11-28T17:25:48-08:00

Venezuelan bill codifies economic sanctions as crimes against humanity	CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuelan lawmakers on Thursday approved a bill that codifies economic sanctions, like those imposed by the United States, as crimes against humanity and allows the prosecution of anyone who expresses support for the measures. The bill, approved by the unicameral National Assembly, implicitly targets leading opposition leaders, many of whom have supported economic sanctions as a means to pressure the government into negotiations. The measure bans supporters of economic sanctions from running for office and allows authorities to prosecute them in absentia and seize their property. 'The unilateral coercive measures and other restrictive or punitive measures adopted against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela constitute a crime against humanity, within the framework of a systematic and widespread attack against the civilian population,' the bill, as read during Thursday's session, states. A conviction under the bill would carry a sentence of at least 25 years in prison. The approval comes one day after the White House announced it had imposed sanctions on 21 individuals it accused of undermining Venezuela's July presidential election. It also followed the decision by the U.S. House of Representatives last week to pass a bill that would block the federal government from contracting with any company doing business with the government of President Nicolas Maduro. The measure is the latest effort by Venezuela's ruling party to silence dissent after the July election, which Maduro and former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez both claim to have won. Vote counts not provided Venezuela's National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed on July 28. But unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. Meanwhile, the main opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation's electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the voting records showed Gonzalez won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. Anti-government protests erupted nationwide the day after the election, drawing repression from state security forces, which arrested more than 2,200 people, including political leaders, lawyers, poll workers, election volunteers and protesters, both minors and adults. Gonzalez left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of the vote tally sheets, while opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has been hiding for months at an undisclosed location. Machado last year won the presidential primary organized by the main opposition coalition. But Maduro's government kept her off the July 28 ballot via an administrative decision that concluded she could not run for office because she allegedly sought the broad economic sanctions the U.S. imposed last decade in an effort to topple Maduro. The sanctions crippled Venezuela's crucial oil sector. Machado's handpicked substitute was also barred from representing the Unitary Platform opposition coalition. That prompted the faction's leadership to choose Gonzalez as candidate. Last week, Venezuela's Attorney General's Office announced a new investigation against Machado. Her comments in favor of the U.S. House bill, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office, 'constitute the commission of crimes of treason against the country,' conspiracy with foreign countries and association. Machado rejected the accusations in a video she posted Thursday on social media. 'Let them accuse us of treason against the country the day we stand by with our arms crossed, when we believe that there is nothing more to fight for,' she said in a video showing images from this year's presidential campaign. 'In that moment, accuse us of betraying the country ... resigning ourselves would be a betrayal.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuelan-bill-codifies-economic-sanctions-as-crimes-against-humanity/7880978.html	2024-11-28T16:04:14-08:00	
Syria rebels, allies cut key highway as escalating fighting kills around 200	BEIRUT — Rebel fighters cut the Damascus to Aleppo highway on Thursday during an offensive that a monitor says killed around 200 people, including civilians hit by Russian air force strikes. A day earlier, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and allied factions launched a surprise attack on government-held areas of northern Aleppo province, triggering the fiercest fighting in years, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. HTS is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and Turkey. The toll in ongoing battles 'has risen to 182, including 102 fighters from HTS,' 19 from allied factions 'and 61 regime forces and allied groups,' the Observatory said. 'Russian airstrikes on the Aleppo countryside killed 19 civilians on Thursday,' said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the Observatory, adding that another civilian had been killed in Syrian army shelling a day earlier. Russia is a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and first intervened in Syria's civil war in 2015, turning the momentum of the conflict in favor of the president, whose forces once controlled only a fifth of the country. HTS and its allied factions, including groups backed by Turkey, 'cut off the Damascus-Aleppo international M5 highway ... in addition to controlling the junction between the M4 and M5 highways,' the Britain-based monitor said. It has a network of sources inside Syria. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 'more than 14,000 people – nearly half are children – have been displaced' by the violence. Syria has been gripped by civil war for more than a decade, although the intensity of the conflict had decreased in recent years. 'This operation aims to repel the sources of fire of the criminal enemy from the front lines,' Mohamed Bashir, who heads HTS's so-called salvation government, said during a press conference. Analyst Nick Heras of the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy said the rebels were 'trying to preempt the possibility of a Syrian military campaign in the region of Aleppo,' which Russian and Syrian government airstrikes against rebel areas have been preparing for. With some Turkey-backed factions joining the offensive, 'Ankara is sending a message to both Damascus and Moscow to back down from their military efforts in northwest Syria,' he said. In addition to Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been backed in the civil war by Iran and allied militant groups, including Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah. During more than two months of war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel intensified its strikes on Iran-backed groups in Syria, including Hezbollah. Rebel forces 'are in a better position to take and seize villages than Russian-backed Syrian government forces, while the Iranians are focused on Lebanon,' Heras said. The Syrian rebels and their allies launched their attack the day the Lebanon-Israel truce came into effect. HTS, led by al-Qaida's former Syria branch, controls swaths of the northwest Idlib area as well as small parts of neighboring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces. An AFP correspondent reported heavy, uninterrupted clashes east of the city of Idlib since Wednesday morning, including airstrikes. A military statement carried by state news agency SANA said that 'armed terrorist organizations grouped under so-called 'Nusra terrorist front' present in Aleppo and Idlib provinces launched a large, broad-fronted attack' Wednesday morning. It said the attack with 'medium and heavy weapons targeted safe villages and towns and our military sites in those areas.' The army 'in cooperation with friendly forces' confronted the attack 'which is still continuing,' inflicting 'heavy losses' on the armed groups, the military statement said, without reporting army losses. Syria's conflict broke out after Assad crushed anti-government protests in 2011. It spiraled into a complex conflict that has drawn in foreign armies and rebels. It has killed more than 500,000 people, displaced millions and battered the country's infrastructure and industry. The Idlib region is subject to a ceasefire — repeatedly violated but which had largely been holding — brokered by Turkey and Russia after a Syrian government offensive in March 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-rebels-allies-cut-key-highway-as-escalating-fighting-kills-around-200-/7880717.html	2024-11-28T15:02:57-08:00	
Botswana joins Belgium as center for diamond certification	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswana has been added as a second center, in addition to Belgium, to verify the origin of rough diamonds meant for export to the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries, the nation’s presidency announced Thursday. African producers had complained that making Belgium the sole verification center led to disruptions in the global diamond supply chain, as the G7 moved to stop the flow of gems mined in Russia. A statement by the office of the president said Botswana was granted permission to set up a verification center following 'intensive' discussions with the G7 Diamond Technical Team. The announcement comes as President Duma Boko and Minister of Minerals Bogolo Kenewendo returned Thursday from a diamond conference in Brussels. Kenewendo told state television it is logical to grant Botswana, the world’s second-largest producer of diamonds, the right to certify rough stones. She said that Botswana has a track record in verification and certification, together with other countries under the Kimberley Process. The Kimberley Process is a trade regime that certifies rough diamond exports entering the global market, but it has been criticized for failing to do enough to keep out diamonds from conflict zones. Diamond-producing countries such as Angola and Namibia should be recognized verifiers because they have prepared through the Kimberley Process, Kenewendo said. To sanction Russian diamonds, the G7, at the start of the year, proposed that all stones destined for export to their member countries be routed through Antwerp, Belgium, to verify their origin. African producers, led by Botswana, protested, saying the move caused disruptions to the global supply chain due to delays and added costs. Belgian-based diamond industry researcher Hans Merket said the addition of Botswana as a verification center will allow more flexibility. 'Botswana appears to be something of a test case with the G7 Diamond Technical Team already explicitly referencing Namibia and Angola as potential future certification nodes,' Merket said. 'By diversifying the certification points, this approach could establish a more balanced and inclusive framework for the G7 certification scheme aligning more closely with the global dynamics of the global supply chain,' he said. 'Moreover, it can also help pave the way for stricter controls and higher ethical standards in the diamond sector, particularly as the Kimberley Process certification scheme faces increasing criticism for its declining credibility and leniency,' Merket said. Jaff Bamenjo, coordinator of the Kimberley Process Civil Society Coalition, said more African diamond producers should be added as verification centers because the addition of only Botswana will not resolve supply chain disruptions. 'African diamond producing countries are suffering from a problem they did not create,' Bamenjo said. Botswana’s export certification center is expected to be operational early next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7880691.html	2024-11-28T14:30:53-08:00	
Namibia extends voting again in close elections	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Namibia extended voting for a second time Thursday with the opposition crying foul after logistical failures prevented many people from casting their ballots in the closely fought election. With the ruling party facing its strongest challenge yet, opposition parties called for a halt to the vote counting and said they had lost confidence in the process. The polls are a key test for the liberation-era South West Africa People's Organization party that has governed the mineral-rich country since independence 34 years ago. But SWAPO is being challenged by a younger generation of voters frustrated by high unemployment and enduring inequalities. About 1.5 million people in the sparsely populated desert nation were registered to vote in Wednesday's presidential and legislative elections. Many were still in line when polls were scheduled to close at 9 p.m. Wednesday, some saying they were in line for 12 hours. The Electoral Commission of Namibia kept some polling stations open overnight into Thursday and allowed others to begin ballot counting. The disarray led to angry complaints from opposition parties, which suggested there may have been an attempt to limit voting amid a strong showing for the parties challenging SWAPO's grip on power. The Electoral Commission said it had decided to keep 36 polling stations open on Friday and Saturday in response to the criticism and to accommodate anyone who had not been able to cast their ballot. It acknowledged a range of problems that held up voting, including a shortage of ballot papers because of higher-than-expected turnout and the overheating of tablets used to verify voters. In some cases, mobile voting teams left areas with voters still in the queues, it said. The main opposition party, Independent Patriots for Change, led the calls for a halt in the process. 'We have a reason to believe that the [Electoral Commission] is deliberately suppressing voters and deliberately trying to frustrate voters from casting their vote,' said IPC official Christine Aochamus. The smaller Namibia Economic Freedom Fighters opposition party said it wanted the vote to annulled. 'This election process was not free,' said representative Saddam Amushelelo. 'We are not going to accept the election results.' The IPC's leader, former dentist and lawyer Panduleni Itula, is perhaps the strongest challenger to SWAPO's candidate, Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who could become the first woman to lead the country. Analysts have said Nandi-Ndaitwah, 72, would be forced into a second round if she does not win more than half of the votes. The long queues were 'a signal that people really want a change,' said Ndumba Kamwanyah, lecturer in the Department of Human Sciences at the University of Namibia. 'For me, it seems it's not good news for the incumbent party,' he told AFP. Some voters had given up after standing in line for hours in the sun and before voting was first extended on Wednesday night, said Maria Nambahu, who waited five hours to cast her ballot. 'It should have been better organized,' the 25-year-old said. 'That makes it unfair.' Edison Bernardo, a 25-year-old financial assistant, said there should be a rerun. 'People did not vote; many left the line,' he told AFP. 'If this is the actual election, there will definitely be riots.' Namibia is a major uranium and diamond exporter, but not many of its nearly 3 million people have benefited from that wealth in terms of improved infrastructure and job opportunities, analysts say. Around 42% of Namibia's registered voters are younger than 35, the election authority says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-extends-voting-again-in-close-elections/7880677.html	2024-11-28T13:51:16-08:00	
One of two damaged Baltic Sea cables back online, operator says	stockholm — One of two Baltic subsea cables that were damaged earlier this month in a suspected sabotage is back online, a spokesman for operator company Arelion said. The cable connecting Sweden and Lithuania was repaired as of Thursday and traffic had resumed at full capacity, spokesman Martin Sjogren said. Two subsea cables, the other linking Finland and Germany, were damaged in less than 24 hours on November 17-18, prompting German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to say he assumed it was sabotage. Undersea cables transmit nearly all the world's internet data traffic and are considered critical infrastructure because they are the communication backbone between countries. Investigators have zeroed in on Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3, and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the country sent a formal request to China seeking cooperation to help clarify what happened when the undersea cables were damaged in the Baltic Sea. 'We are cooperating with Swedish police in their investigation of our damaged cable,' Sjogren said. 'It’s very difficult to secure the entire subsea infrastructure but the international cooperation between authorities, military and companies is working very well,' he said. Arelion, once part of telecom company Telia, owns 75,000 kilometers of fiber network. Finland's Cinia, which owns the other cable, has also started repair work and estimated completion by the end of this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-of-two-damaged-baltic-sea-cables-back-online-operator-says-/7880673.html	2024-11-28T13:37:43-08:00	
Drone sightings over U.S. bases prompt British troop deployments	British and American authorities are investigating why several drones were flying over four U.S. air bases in England in recent days. As Henry Ridgwell reports, Britain has deployed dozens of troops around the bases amid concerns such drones could be used to disrupt operations or carry out acts of deception and sabotage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drone-sightings-over-u-s-bases-prompt-british-troop-deployments/7880649.html	2024-11-28T13:17:56-08:00	
In wake of G20, Gulf states boost ties to Brazil, Latin America	Middle East analysts are welcoming a series of agreements concluded during the recent summit in Brazil of the 20 biggest economies, saying they open new avenues for Gulf Cooperation Council states to strengthen economic relations with emerging markets across Latin America. Among other developments, Crown Prince Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates signed a memorandum of agreement with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. It is designed to establish a joint mechanism 'aimed at promoting UAE investments in strategic sectors in Brazil,' according to the Abu Dhabi news site Gulf News. A second memorandum of agreement between the foreign ministries of the two countries called for unspecified cooperation in Africa, Gulf News said. Saudi Arabia, for its part, concluded a memorandum of agreement establishing a Saudi-Brazilian Coordination Council that is intended to foster cooperation across sectors that include economic, diplomatic and strategic, according to the Saudi Press Agency. The agreements build on well-established ties between the Gulf Cooperation Council states and Brazil, a major agricultural exporter whose efforts to address global food insecurity align with the GCC’s need to secure vital agricultural imports, including meat, cereals and coffee. The Gulf countries, for their part, are well positioned to provide Brazil with phosphate, aluminum and oil. Brazil is already the GCC’s largest trading partner in Latin America, followed by Mexico and Argentina. In 2022, more than 70% of Brazil’s exports to Arab countries consisted of agricultural products such as meat and grains. Zubair Iqbal, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute and former International Monetary Fund official, told VOA that Brazil offers the GCC states promising opportunities for trade and investment. But he noted that tangible progress toward enhanced GCC-Latin American cooperation remains largely reliant on bilateral agreements rather than multination initiatives, limiting their impact. 'While there have been general exhortations for furthering trade relations, specific responses will be a function of bilateral agreements,' he said. 'Prospects for more trade and increased investment remain strong, especially with Brazil. However, it will depend upon national interests and alternative options.' According to the latest available data for 2022, GCC countries, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, have increasingly expanded their investment footprint in Latin America, totaling $4 billion between 2016 and 2021. The UAE’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, has been a key player, with investments exceeding $5 billion in Brazil since the early 2010s. Notable projects include an oil refinery, a toll road and collaborations with Brazil’s largest biofuel producer. Mubadala has plans to invest an additional $1 billion annually in Brazil. UAE-based JFR Investments, owned by an Angolan businessman, has meanwhile signed significant mining agreements since 2022 with companies in Brazil and Peru. And Dubai-based DP World manages port infrastructure across Latin America. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is also deepening its ties in Latin America. In June 2024, PIF hosted a conference in Rio de Janeiro, where it announced $15 billion in planned projects for Brazil. In August 2023, Saudi Investment Minister Khalid Al-Falih toured seven Latin American nations to explore opportunities in sectors such as mining, food processing, agriculture, transport, health care, entertainment, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Prior Saudi investments in the region include the acquisition by Saudi Aramco of Chilean fuel retailer Esmax and a $500 million investment by the Saudi Fund for Development in an Argentine gas pipeline. Kevin Funk, a political economist specializing in Latin America, told VOA that Brazilian companies are meanwhile showing greater interest in investing in the Gulf as the region diversifies its economy away from dependence on oil. There is now an array of large and small Brazilian businesses operating in the Gulf countries, and in numerous sectors, including food, clothing and cosmetics, Funk said. Among them is Sao Paulo-based JBS, the world's largest meat processor, which has established a significant presence in the Gulf. 'Yet the fundamentals of the interregional commercial relationship remain largely constant, with Brazil and certain other Latin American countries mostly exporting primary products such as agricultural goods and minerals to the region, while mainly importing fossil fuels and fertilizers,' he said. Brazil's reliance on Gulf fertilizers has grown, partly due to supply chain disruptions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, domestic challenges in Latin America — such as slow economic growth, political instability and inequality — have limited the region's ability to prioritize interregional ties, Funk said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-wake-of-g20-gulf-states-boost-ties-to-brazil-latin-america/7880570.html	2024-11-28T12:03:00-08:00	
Protests erupt in Georgia after government halts EU application until 2028	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Georgia's ruling party said on Thursday that the country would suspend talks on European Union accession until 2028, while also refusing budgetary grants from Brussels, effectively halting its application to join the bloc, a long-standing national goal. In response, thousands of pro-EU protesters blocked streets in the capital, while the country's figurehead president accused the government of declaring war on its own people with the move. The Georgian Dream governing bloc accused the EU of 'a cascade of insults,' saying in a statement it was using the prospect of accession talks to blackmail the country and to 'organize a revolution in the country.' As a result, it said, 'We have decided not to put the issue of opening negotiations with the European Union on the agenda until the end of 2028. Also, we refuse any budgetary grant from the European Union until the end of 2028.' The South Caucasus country of 3.7 million has the aim of EU accession written into its constitution and has traditionally been among the most pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states. Georgia's relations with Brussels have deteriorated sharply in recent months amid EU allegations of authoritarianism and pro-Russian tendencies. The EU had already said that Georgia's application is frozen. Georgian Dream says that it is not pro-Russian and that it is committed to democracy and integration with the West. It says it wants to join the EU eventually but has repeatedly engaged in diplomatic feuds with Brussels in recent years while deepening ties with neighboring Russia. There was no immediate formal comment from the EU on Georgian Dream's statement. But an EU official said the impact of Thursday's move was huge, adding that the government was doing what the EU had feared and had hoped it would not. Opinion polls show that around 80% of Georgians support EU membership, and the bloc's flag flies alongside the national flag outside virtually all government buildings in the country. Georgia's pro-Western opposition reacted to Georgian Dream's announcement with fury, while several thousand protesters massed outside parliament and the ruling party's headquarters, blocking roads. Local media reported that protests erupted in several provincial cities. Giorgi Vashadze, a prominent opposition leader, wrote on Facebook: 'the self-proclaimed, illegitimate government has already legally signed the betrayal of Georgia and the Georgian people.' President Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-EU critic of Georgian Dream whose powers are mostly ceremonial, said the ruling party had 'declared not peace, but war against its own people, its past and future.' Zourabichvili's term ends in December, and Georgian Dream has nominated a former lawmaker with hard-line anti-Western views to replace her. The opposition says that an October election, in which official results gave the Georgian Dream bloc almost 54% of the vote, was fraudulent and have refused to take their seats. Western countries have called for a probe into alleged violations. Georgian Dream and the country's election commission say the election was free and fair. Earlier on Thursday, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze told journalists that EU membership might harm Georgia's economy, as it would require Tbilisi to cancel visa-free agreements and trade deals with other countries. The EU gave Georgia candidate status in December 2023 but has said that a raft of laws passed by Georgian Dream since, including curbs on 'foreign agents' and LGBTQ rights, are authoritarian, Russian-inspired and obstacles to EU membership. Foreign and domestic critics of Georgian Dream say the party, which is seen as dominated by its billionaire founder, ex-Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, is steering Georgia back toward Moscow, from which it gained independence in 1991. Russia and Georgia have had no formal diplomatic relations since a five-day war in 2008 but have had a limited rapprochement recently, with Moscow lifting a ban on flights to Georgia and scrapping a stringent visa regime for Georgians working in Russia. Opinion polls show most Georgians dislike Russia, which continues to back two breakaway Georgian regions and defeated Tbilisi in the 2008 war. Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking on Thursday on a visit to Kazakhstan, praised the 'courage and character' he said Georgian authorities had shown in passing the law on foreign agents, which domestic critics have likened to Russian legislation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-erupt-in-georgia-after-government-halts-eu-application-until-2028/7880594.html	2024-11-28T11:55:30-08:00	
Amnesty International says Nigerian police killed 24 in crackdown on August protests	Abuja, Nigeria — Human rights group Amnesty International on Thursday said its investigation into Nigerian authorities' crackdown on anti-government protests in August showed state officials killed at least 24 protesters and detained more than 1,200 others. Amnesty's findings come amid growing concerns of a shrinking civic space in Nigeria. A 34-page document report released by Amnesty International Thursday was based on eyewitness testimony and interviews with medical workers and families and friends of the victims. Amnesty said Nigerian police used excessive force on demonstrators who had gathered to protest the soaring cost of living. It said police killed at least 24 people, including two children. The casualties were recorded across Borno, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Jigawa and Niger states. According to the report, police fired live rounds at close range targeting the victims' heads and torsos, while some other victims were suffocated by the indiscriminate use of tear gas. Isa Sanusi, Amnesty's Nigerian country director, believes the actual death toll could be much higher. 'Even today as we're launching this report in Kano, many families were coming out to tell us that their children are missing and many are believed to have been killed or be in secret detention. Therefore, the whole issue is far broader than what we have talked about in that report. This just goes to show that Nigerian authorities are not ready to accept the fact that the people have the right to peaceful protest,' he said. The August protests, which organizers called 'Ten Days of Rage,' were in response to the soaring cost of living many believed was caused in part by President Bola Tinubu’s reforms, including the removal of fuel subsidies. Nigerian police authorities have not responded to Amnesty's allegations, but have previously denied using live bullets to quell the demonstrations. A national police spokesman did not take VOA's calls for comment. Nigeria has a long history of police brutality despite repeated promises to be more accountable. During the protests in August, heads of security agencies held an emergency meeting and the chief of Defense Staff, General Christopher Musa, addressed journalists. 'None of us here is happy to hear any Nigerian is injured for whatever reason. It's our duty the protect Nigerians. We're going to remain focused, committed, we're going to respect human rights, the rights of everyone who's lawfully performing his task or duty. But we will not relent in pursuing those that have continued to encourage unconstitutional takeover of government or subversion or those ones that are into vandalism or destruction of lives and property,' he said. Amnesty's report comes amid growing concern by human rights groups that Nigerian authorities are trying to stifle political dissent. Sanusi said authorities are not serious about stopping the use of excessive force. 'The lack of accountability, the denial of the killings by the police and other government officials are just signs of the fact that impunity is still reigning in Nigeria and that has to stop. It happened during End SARS protests. We have consulted them to ask for their comment and they didn't say anything. What we want them to do is to hold those responsible of those killings to account,' he said. In October 2020, police brutality sparked massive protests against the Special Anti- Robbery Squad or SARS unit of the police. The protests ended in a deadly shooting at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amnesty-international-says-nigerian-police-killed-24-in-crackdown-on-august-protests/7880554.html	2024-11-28T11:20:57-08:00	
Drone sightings over US bases prompt British troop deployments	LONDON — British and American authorities are investigating after several drones were spotted in recent days flying over four U.S. military bases in England. Britain has deployed dozens of troops around the bases amid concerns the overflights could be acts of deception or sabotage by an adversary such as Russia. In a statement issued Wednesday, U.S. Air Forces in Europe said that 'small unmanned aerial systems continue to be spotted in the vicinity of and over Royal Air Force Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, RAF Feltwell and RAF Fairford since Nov. 20.' It said the number of drones sighted has fluctuated and has ranged in size and configurations. 'To date, installation leaders have determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents, facilities or assets. The air force is taking all appropriate measures to safeguard the aforementioned installations and their residents,' the statement said. RAF Lakenheath in the east of England is home to the U.S. Air Force 48th Fighter Wing, a cornerstone of its combat capability in Europe and home to several F-35 stealth fighter jets, among other aircraft. Four American B-52 strategic bombers are currently based at RAF Fairford in the west of the country. The Pentagon said this week it is actively monitoring the situation. 'The bottom line is it's something that we're going to take seriously. We're continuing to look into it. But as of right now, [it] has not had any significant mission impact,' Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters Tuesday, adding that small drones have become 'relatively common now across the landscape.' Britain has deployed about 60 soldiers around the U.S. bases. British Defense Minister Maria Eagle said they are using 'multilayered force protection measures.' 'We will be making sure that anybody that we manage to catch for engaging in this behavior is shown the full force of the law,' Eagle told lawmakers Wednesday. The nature of the sightings suggests the drones are not being operated by hobbyists, said David Dunn, a professor of international politics at Britain’s University of Birmingham, who has written extensively on the dangers posed by drones. 'It's particularly alarming in this context that actually talked about there [being] several different sizes of drones. It does seem to be a coordinated and planned activity. The most obvious thing is that these are disruptive practices and that they actually force the airfield to operate in a different way, to suspend air operations,' Dunn told VOA. The drones can also be used for other purposes. 'They can gather intelligence on how many planes are operating, where they're based, what the movements are. And, actually, they can also do that for individuals,' Dunn said. Drones have been sighted above the U.S. base at RAF Feltwell, which primarily serves as living quarters for U.S. military personnel — a 'particularly sinister' development, according to Dunn. 'Because in an age where you have highly sophisticated fifth-generation aircraft that operate stealthily and invisibly in the electronic spectrum when they're flying — and are highly protected on the airbase in hardened aircraft shelters — the most vulnerable part of the overall system is actually the aircrew,' Dunn told VOA. 'And so, if you can identify where they live by following them home onto their married quarters, you can identify where you can actually break the weakest part of that chain,' he said. The Times of London newspaper reported that authorities have not ruled out Russia as the culprit. Dunn said there’s evidence of Moscow seeking to step up hybrid attacks, meaning a nonmilitary form of warfare that can still be destructive. 'Whether that be the disruption of undersea cables or of incendiary parcels being sent to the city I live in, Birmingham — there was an incendiary parcel found in Birmingham airport. There’s another [example] of a warehouse being burned down, which stored material going to Ukraine. These things are typically, it seems, done at third party, whereby the Russian state, it seems, has employed criminals in the U,K.,' Dunn said. The Russian Embassy in London had not responded to VOA requests for comment by the time of publication. Moscow has previously denied any involvement in hybrid attacks on the West.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drone-sightings-over-us-bases-prompt-british-troop-deployments/7880539.html	2024-11-28T11:17:27-08:00	
Three Americans arrive in Texas following prisoner swap with China	Three American citizens jailed for years in China arrived in the United States late Wednesday as part of a prisoner swap between Washington and Beijing. The swap, which the White House announced earlier Wednesday, marked a rare diplomatic agreement between the United States and China as U.S. President Joe Biden’s tenure comes to a close. Beijing announced Thursday that the United States has returned four people to China, including at least three Chinese citizens whom Beijing said were held for 'political purposes.' The fourth was an individual sought by Beijing for crimes who had been living in the United States. The Chinese government did not identify the four people. The three Americans released in the swap — Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung — landed Wednesday night at a military base in San Antonio, Texas. Biden told reporters Thursday morning that he has spoken to all of them. 'I’m really happy they are home,' he said. All three Americans had been designated as wrongfully detained. Swidan was facing a death sentence on drug charges, and Li and Leung were jailed on espionage charges. In a separate but connected move, the State Department Wednesday lowered its travel warning to China to 'level two' from 'level three,' now advising American citizens to 'exercise increased caution' when traveling to China. Previously, the State Department advised Americans to 'reconsider travel' to China, partially due to the risk of wrongful detention of Americans. The prisoner swap comes two months after China released David Lin, a Christian pastor from California who had spent nearly 20 years jailed in China after being convicted of contract fraud. And in August, the United States engaged in a separate historic prisoner swap. That one, between the United States and Russia, included the release of American journalists Alsu Kurmasheva and Evan Gershkovich, as well as ex-U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and U.S. permanent resident and Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza. Some information in this report came from the Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/three-americans-arrive-in-texas-following-prisoner-swap-with-china-/7880557.html	2024-11-28T11:13:35-08:00	
Pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai tells court overthrowing CCP 'impossible'	washington — Jailed pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai dismissed as 'impossible' the idea that the Chinese government could be overthrown, during testimony in his much-condemned Hong Kong national security trial on Thursday, as foreign governments continue to call for his immediate release. 'To think about overthrowing the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], I think it’s out of the dimension of any discussion. It’s impossible,' Lai said. 'Do you think sanctions [and] blockade would overthrow the CCP? It’s more than ridiculous,' Lai told the court. The 77-year-old British national made the statements during what was his sixth day of testimony in a high-profile national security trial that rights groups and foreign governments have rejected as politically motivated. Lai stands accused of collusion with foreign forces and sedition under a Beijing-imposed national security law. He rejects the charges but, if convicted, faces life in prison. The founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper has been held in solitary confinement since late 2020. Lai’s national security trial — which is taking place before three government-appointed judges, rather than a jury — began nearly one year ago and was initially estimated to last about 80 days. During his testimony, Lai has maintained that he never lobbied for international sanctions on Hong Kong. But he said international support would be the 'salvation' of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and could protect the city 'from the encroachment of China on our freedom.' Describing his thinking at the time, Lai told the court that the 2019 pro-democracy movement could have garnered the international community’s support by conducting demonstrations 'peacefully and rationally.' 'If we conduct our demonstration on a moral high ground and people sympathize with us, I think this is the greatest lobbying we can have,' Lai said in his testimony. A chorus of rights groups and foreign governments, including the United States, have repeatedly called for Lai’s immediate release. On Thursday, the European Parliament passed an urgent resolution calling for the publisher’s release. The measure, which passed by an overwhelming majority, marks the first time that the newly reconstituted European Parliament has considered Lai’s case and the situation in Hong Kong. EU Commissioner Helena Dalli said Lai’s trial 'is emblematic of the erosion of democracy and freedom in Hong Kong.' Lai’s international legal team welcomed the resolution. Caoilfhionn Gallagher, the head of the international legal team, said in a statement that Hong Kong’s treatment of Lai 'flies in the face' of European values. 'He shouldn’t spend a second more in prison,' Gallagher told VOA last week. 'This is a trial which should never have happened in the first place, under a law which should not exist.' The European resolution also called for the release of Chung Pui-kuen, one of two editors-in-chief at the new-defunct Stand News sentenced for sedition in a case widely viewed as politically motivated. Hong Kong’s Security Bureau did not immediately reply to a VOA email requesting comment for this story. But in a more than 700-word statement to VOA last week, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said it was 'inappropriate' to comment on the case because legal proceedings are ongoing. The spokesperson said that Hong Kong 'rejected any fact-twisting remarks and baseless smears against the legal system and safeguarding of rights and freedom in Hong Kong.' Hong Kong authorities have previously denied that Lai’s trial is unfair. Lai began his testimony on November 20, just one day after 45 pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong were sentenced to as much as 10 years in prison under a national security law. In testimony last week, Lai said he had advocated for 'peaceful resistance' against rising Chinese repression in Hong Kong through his commentaries published in Apple Daily. He noted that he tried to 'reduce violence' during the city’s pro-democracy protests in 2019. Lai also was questioned about the establishment of Apple Daily’s English online edition in May 2020, shortly before the national security law came into effect. Lai said a 'sense of crisis' drove him to believe that the new edition would help Hong Kong by encouraging foreign lawmakers to 'take notice of our situation' and 'voice out their concerns' to Beijing. Apple Daily closed in 2021 after authorities jailed its staff, raided its office, and froze its assets worth millions of dollars. Earlier this week, Lai rebutted the testimony of prosecution witness Cheung Kim-hung, the former CEO of Apple Daily’s parent company Next Digital. Lai said he never discussed sanctions with Cheung and accused Cheung of falsifying testimony. Also this week, Lai testified that he did not give editorial directions during 'lunch box meetings.' Earlier in November, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention determined that Lai is unlawfully and arbitrarily detained in Hong Kong and has called for his immediate release. A one-time billionaire, Lai could have fled Hong Kong, but he instead chose to stay and stand up for freedom in Hong Kong, according to his son Sebastien. 'His actions speak louder than words. And he has done all these brave and incredible things in defense of freedom for the people of Hong Kong, and they’re criminalizing him for it,' Sebastien Lai told VOA last week. Jimmy Lai’s international legal team has expressed concern about the conditions in which the publisher is being held, including prolonged solitary confinement and no access to specialized medical care for diabetes. Even as Jimmy Lai’s physical health has declined, 'his spirit is holding strong. His mind is holding strong,' Sebastien Lai told VOA last week. Jimmy Lai’s international legal team expects the trial to continue into 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pro-democracy-publisher-jimmy-lai-tells-court-overthrowing-ccp-impossible-/7880495.html	2024-11-28T10:38:29-08:00

Landslide triggered by rain in Indonesia kills at least 7 people	SIBOLANGIT, INDONESIA — A landslide triggered by torrential rains in Indonesia’s Sumatra island killed at least seven people, officials said on Thursday, adding to the death toll from landslides in the region this week. Rescuers recovered the bodies of the victims, including a driver and passengers, from a tourist bus that was covered by trees, mud and rocks on the road from the capital, Medan, to Berastagi in Indonesia’s North Sumatra province. The route is the main access from Medan to other districts. The bus was among vehicles that had been cut off by landslides on the road since Wednesday morning. More than 10 people were also injured and have been evacuated to the hospital in Medan. Muji Ediyanto, traffic director of the North Sumatra Regional Police, said in a video message distributed by Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency on Thursday said that some vehicles remain trapped between the landslide locations along that road. 'It will take at least two days to evacuate them from the landslide. Several vehicles are still trapped by piles [from the] landslides. There are also fallen trees at several points ... and the vehicles have not been able to get out of the locations,' Ediyanto said. Earlier this week, 20 people died after flash floods and landslides at four locations in the mountainsides of North Sumatra province, including in Karo regency, which is located less than 20 kilometers from the most-recent landslide location. Seasonal rains from around October through to March frequently cause flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/landslide-triggered-by-rain-in-indonesia-kills-at-least-7-people/7880285.html	2024-11-28T08:06:26-08:00

Pakistan charges journalist with terrorism for reporting on protest	ISLAMABAD — Pakistani police Wednesday arrested and charged a prominent journalist investigating claims of casualties during a government crackdown on opposition protesters in the capital, Islamabad, earlier this week, drawing strong condemnation from media freedom advocates. Relatives and colleagues said Matiullah Jan was picked up outside a hospital in the capital just before midnight along with colleague Saqib Bashir while they were collecting data about 'the dead bodies.' Bashir told reporters Thursday that he was freed and dropped off on a street three hours later. Jan, who hosts a political talk show on television and runs his own YouTube channel with nearly 400,000 subscribers, is a known critic of Pakistan’s military for its alleged meddling in governance matters. Asif Ali, the police officer complainant in the case, told VOA that the journalist detainee was charged with terrorism, assaulting law enforcement personnel and possessing narcotics. While in police custody Thursday, Jan vehemently denied the charges against him. 'This is all fake, funny and fabricated. I don’t even smoke a cigarette,' he said, adding that his efforts to collect details about the protesters’ deaths led to his arrest. 'We are not afraid and will continue to pursue our work,' he said. Bashir told VOA that they were in the process of 'collecting data on the casualties' when men wearing black uniforms blindfolded and forcibly pushed them into a vehicle in the parking area of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad. Media advocacy groups and human rights activists denounced the police action and expressed 'grave alarm' over the incident. The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan demanded Jan's immediate and unconditional release. 'This authoritarian tactic to silence journalists must cease,' the commission said. The Committee to Protect Journalists noted that Jan’s arrest followed his coverage of a protest march by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf political party. 'We call for a swift and impartial investigation into the incident and accountability for all perpetrators,' the CPJ said on X. 'Complete impunity persists for Jan's previous abduction in 2020,' the global watchdog wrote, referring to a brief abduction of the journalist four years ago, reportedly by Pakistani intelligence operatives. Pakistan’s intelligence agencies never responded to the allegation. Hours before he was arrested Wednesday, Jan said on his television program that security forces had used firearms to disperse opposition protesters, causing several fatalities and bullet injuries to dozens more. He cited data from hospital sources and accused the government of hiding the truth by pressuring hospital staff not to reveal any details to the media. Jan also questioned government claims that several law enforcement personnel had died after being run over by a vehicle in the protesters' convoy on Monday when thousands of supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan stormed Islamabad to stage a sit-in demonstration to demand his release. The journalist aired an interview on his YouTube channel with a witness, who was also a relative of one of the deceased men. The witness said the vehicle belonged to paramilitary forces who were retreating from the protest site after running out of tear gas shells when they crashed into a crowd of security personnel and demonstrators. Social media video supported the account. On Tuesday night, authorities cut off power before unleashing a sweeping crackdown on several PTI supporters, with multiple foreign media outlets, journalists and residents in nearby neighborhoods reporting heavy tear gas shelling and intense gunfire by paramilitary forces directed at the rally. The government announced early Wednesday that the security action had dispersed protesters and reopened roads linking Islamabad with the rest of the country after a four-day lockdown. The PTI has said that as many as 40 people died, accusing security forces of opening fire directly at the rally. However, the opposition party has provided information about only eight victims so far, indicating that they are still gathering details about others. Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarrar and capital police officials maintained that security forces employed tear gas and rubber bullets in response to the protests, dismissing allegations that live ammunition was used. Furthermore, they denied claims that the crackdown resulted in civilian casualties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-charges-journalist-with-terrorism-for-reporting-on-protest/7880155.html	2024-11-28T06:34:29-08:00

Taiwan president sets to leave for Pacific tour amid growing Chinese pressure	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan President Lai Ching-te will kick off on Saturday a week-long overseas trip to visit the island’s three diplomatic allies in the Pacific region, marking his first diplomatic tour since taking office in May. The visit will include stops in the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Palau, as well as stopovers in U.S. territories such as Hawaii and Guam. It comes as China continues to expand its influence in the Pacific region. Analysts say the trip can help consolidate Taiwan’s diplomatic ties with the three Pacific Island countries. 'The Pacific Islands region has been the site of intense geopolitical competition in recent years and we have seen three of Taiwan’s original diplomatic partners [in the region, including Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and Nauru,] switching recognition to China since 2019,' said Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands program at Lowy Institute in Australia. He said as China continues to use 'a range of coercive tactics and incentives' to pressure Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies in the Pacific to switch recognition to Beijing, Lai’s trip will play an important role in delivering Taiwan’s commitments to these three countries. 'As the number of countries recognizing Taiwan becomes fewer, each diplomatic partner becomes more important for Taiwan,' Sora told VOA in a video interview. Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr., who was re-elected earlier this month, said the Chinese government had tried to use tourism to incentivize him to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. 'The Chinese ambassador to Cambodia once called me to say that China had more tourists than Taiwan so I should denounce Taiwan and go with China because that would get me millions of tourists and the Chinese would also build new hotels that Palau needs,' Whipps Jr. told VOA during an interview in Palau last month. China views Taiwan as an inalienable part of its territory that must one day be reunited with mainland China. Beijing also opposes any form of official interaction between Taiwan and other countries. In response to Lai’s upcoming trip, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said if Lai attempts to use the trip to provoke China it 'will lead nowhere.' 'We urge relevant countries to see clearly the trend of history at an early date, and make the right decision that truly serves their fundamental and long-term interests,' Lin Jian said during a regular press conference on November 22. Reuters news agency reported on Wednesday that China may launch a new round of military drills near Taiwan as a response to Lai’s Pacific tour, citing unnamed Taiwanese and regional security officials. In response to the report, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung on Thursday urged China not to 'overreact' to Lai’s trip to the Pacific. On the same day, Taiwan’s military held an early morning air defense drill to test its response and engagement procedures. Focus on maritime security and public health Lai will be accompanied by key cabinet members overseeing maritime affairs and public health during the trip. Experts say since maritime surveillance, maritime domain awareness, and public health are all critical issues for Pacific Island nations, the makeup of Lai’s delegation suggests Taiwan has identified these issues as areas where Taiwan can contribute. 'Maritime domain security is such an important topic for Palau and Marshall Islands, as Palau’s president Surangel Whipps Jr. talked about incursions into Palau’s territorial waters by Chinese research vessels on several occasions, and it seems that Taiwan thinks it can play a role [in that space,]' said Henryk Szadziewski, an expert on Pacific affairs at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In addition to maritime security and health, Szadziewski says climate financing and economic livelihoods are also areas in which Taiwan can support its Pacific allies. 'The Marshall Islands and Tuvalu are significantly under threat from the climate crisis and I think Taiwan can help with the climate financing that the region sorely needs,' he told VOA by phone. Palau and Marshall Islands both receive significant economic support from the U.S. under the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA. Australia is also assisting Tuvalu in climate adaptation through the Falepili Union treaty, which would allow Tuvalu citizens to live in Australia under a special visa. Under COFA, the U.S. provides economic aid worth billions of dollars, while Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia give the U.S. exclusive military access to their land, water, and airspace, as well as the right to deny China access to their ports and territorial waters. Since Palau and the Marshall Islands are both part of the Second Island Chain, which plays a key role in connecting the U.S. forces in Hawaii and Guam, analysts say ensuring these countries have strong defense and security relationships with Washington and Taiwan is strategically important to the U.S. Sora in Australia said since these agreements make Washington and Canberra the main development partners for Taiwan’s three Pacific allies, it creates 'a permissive environment' that allows Taiwan to contribute to larger development projects in those countries. 'Taiwan can provide targeted, effective, and useful assistance but it’s not relied upon as the main development partner. It’s very important that the larger countries are also involved in those countries,' he told VOA. However, other experts say Taiwan should still avoid purely counting on support from the U.S. and Australia to maintain ties with Pacific allies. 'The willingness for the U.S. and Australia to burden share in these Pacific countries certainly benefits Taiwan now, but Taiwan needs to develop a strategy if both governments opt to focus their attention elsewhere,' Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University, told VOA in a written response. Since China has redirected large amounts of aid to the Pacific since 2022, making it the second largest donor in the region, analysts say Beijing will keep looking for opportunities to influence Taiwan’s Pacific allies. 'China will be looking for opportunities to persuade these countries to adopt a relationship with Beijing in preference to one with Taiwan, and they will use a combination of carrots and sticks to achieve this goal,' Tess Newton Cain, an adjunct associate professor at Griffith Asia Institute in Australia, told VOA in a video interview. To cope with China’s ongoing attempt to drive a wedge between Taiwan and its Pacific allies, Sora said Taipei should 'consistently be present in terms of its activities on the ground and in terms of servicing the political relationship.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-president-sets-to-leave-for-pacific-tour-amid-growing-chinese-pressure/7880070.html	2024-11-28T05:50:25-08:00	
Senior Chinese military official Miao Hua under investigation, defense ministry says	BEIJING — China said on Thursday a top-ranking military official had been suspended and was under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline,' and denied reports Defense Minister Dong Jun was being investigated for corruption. The suspended officer, Admiral Miao Hua, served on the ruling Central Military Commission, China's highest-level military command body, and was stationed in the coastal province of Fujian when President Xi Jinping worked there as a local official, according to his official biography. Miao, 69, who began his career in the army, has been the military's leading political officer given his role on the six-person commission, which is headed by Xi. A defense ministry spokesperson, Wu Qian, who briefed reporters at a monthly press conference in Beijing, provided no further details. China's military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge since last year, with at least nine People's Liberation Army generals and a handful of defense industry executives removed from the national legislative body. Wu said media reports that Dong had been sidelined by an investigation were 'sheer fabrication' spread by rumor-mongers with evil motivations. The Financial Times reported this week that Dong was being investigated as part of the wide-ranging anti-corruption investigation, citing current and former U.S. officials. Two U.S. officials told Reuters they believed Dong was being investigated for corruption. Another urged caution about that conclusion. Dong had declined last week to meet U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a meeting of defense ministers in Laos, citing U.S. actions over Taiwan, a move the Pentagon chief said on Wednesday was unfortunate. Asked about the decision not to meet Austin, Wu cited Dong by name as saying the United States had been 'seriously undermining regional peace and stability.' Dong was appointed defense minister in December 2023, replacing Li Shangfu, who was removed after seven months. Li and his predecessor, Wei Fenghe, were expelled from the Communist Party in June for 'serious violations of discipline,' a euphemism for corruption. Many of those ousted earlier were from the Rocket Force - an elite arm of the PLA that oversees its most advanced conventional and nuclear missiles. Analysts said at the time that exposing deep-set graft could take time and potentially slow Xi's long-running military modernisation plans. Diplomats and analysts are watching closely for any signs the campaign could hamper ongoing military operations, commands and the PLA's diplomacy. China security scholar James Char said on Thursday that Miao was a Xi 'acolyte.' 'Clearly, Xi Jinping's trust in yet another of his uniformed subordinates has been misplaced,' said Char, of Singapore's S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies. 'If Miao Hua is eventually found guilty, the CMC Chairman himself probably failed to size up the extent of corruption among China's military elites.' The latest Pentagon report on China's military, issued in October 2023, said Miao 'may have ties' to Xi from his time in Fujian.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senior-chinese-military-official-miao-hua-under-investigation-defense-ministry-says/7880046.html	2024-11-28T05:00:14-08:00	
At least 13 dead after landslides bury 40 homes in villages in eastern Uganda	Nairobi — At least 13 people have died in eastern Uganda after landslides buried 40 homes in six villages, relief officials said Thursday. The Uganda Red Cross Society said 13 bodies have been recovered and the rescue effort is continuing. Local media reported that authorities expect the death toll could rise to 30. The landslides happened after heavy rains on Wednesday night in the mountainous district of Bulambuli, where landslides are common. The district is about 280 kilometers east of the capital, Kampala. A journalist in the area told The Associated Press that local officials said an excavator would be brought to assist in the rescue efforts, but the roads were covered in mud and the rain was still falling. The affected area is about 20 hectares, with homesteads and farmlands spread downhill. Photos and videos of people digging through mud in search of victims were shared on social media platforms. Some of the houses were completely covered by mud while others had merely a roof showing above mud. The Daily Monitor newspaper reported that most of the bodies recovered so far were those of children. The prime minister’s office issued a disaster alert on Wednesday stating that heavy rains across the country had cut off major roads. Two rescue boats capsized on Wednesday during a rescue mission on River Nile where Pakwach bridge was submerged.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-13-dead-after-landslides-bury-40-homes-in-villages-in-eastern-uganda-/7880034.html	2024-11-28T04:41:10-08:00	
Israel steps up bombing of central Gaza, strikes kill 17 people	Cairo — Israeli military strikes killed at least 17 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, medics said, as forces stepped up their bombardment of central areas and tanks pushed deeper into the north and south of the enclave. The escalation came a day after Israel and Iranian-backed Hezbollah started to observe a ceasefire in Lebanon, ending more than a year of hostilities and raising hopes among Palestinians in Gaza for a similar deal with Hamas, which rules the enclave. Six people were killed in two separate air strikes on a house and near the hospital of Kamal Adwan in Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, while four others were killed when an Israeli strike hit a motorcycle in Khan Younis in the south. In Nuseirat, one of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli planes carried out several air strikes, destroying a multi-story building and hitting roads outside mosques. At least seven were killed in those strikes, health officials said. Medics said at least two people, a woman and a child, were killed in tank shelling that hit western areas of Nuseirat, while an air strike killed five others in a house nearby. In Rafah, near the border with Egypt, tanks pushed deeper into the northwest area of the city, residents said. There has been no Israeli comment on the latest fighting. Israel's 13-month campaign in Gaza, with the avowed intent of eradicating Hamas militants, has killed nearly 44,200 people and displaced nearly all the enclave's population at least once, Gaza officials say. Vast swathes of the territory are in ruins. The war was launched in response to an attack by Hamas-led fighters who killed around 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has said. Ceasefire hopes in Gaza Months of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire have yielded scant progress, and negotiations are now on hold. Mediator Qatar has suspended its efforts until the sides are prepared to make concessions. A ceasefire in the parallel conflict between Israel and Hamas' Lebanese ally Hezbollah took effect before dawn on Wednesday, bringing a halt to hostilities that had escalated sharply in recent months and overshadowed the conflict in Gaza. Announcing the Lebanon accord on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said he would now renew his push for an elusive agreement in Gaza, urging Israel and Hamas to seize the moment. The Lebanon truce has made the sense of desperation and abandonment even more acute among Gaza's 2.3 million people. 'I hope a ceasefire will happen like it did in Lebanon... I just want to take my children to see my land, my house, to see what they did to us, I want to live in safety,' said Amal Abu Hmeid, a displaced woman in Gaza. 'God willing we will have a truce,' she said, sitting in the courtyard of a school sheltering displaced families in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. The courtyard was filled with dirt and water from where people did their laundry. Clothes were airing outside classrooms as children played nearby. '[Life] was beautiful [before the war]... Now there is nothing beautiful, it's all gone. Our houses are gone, our brothers are gone, and no one is left. Now we hardly get... one meal a day. We can’t even get bread,' Abu Hmeid told Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-steps-up-bombing-of-central-gaza-strikes-kill-17-people/7880000.html	2024-11-28T04:06:04-08:00	
Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off a century after its first trip through Manhattan	New York — A century after the first Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the annual holiday tradition kicks off Thursday in New York City with new Spider-Man and Minnie Mouse balloons, zoo and pasta-themed floats, performances from Jennifer Hudson and Idina Menzel, and more. This year’s star-studded lineup is a far cry from the parade’s initial incarnation, which featured floats showing scenes from Mother Goose, Red Riding Hood and the Wolf, Miss Muffet and the Spider, and other fairy tales. Some things remain the same, though. As in 1924, there will be plenty of marching bands and lots of clowns, followed by the grand finale of Santa Claus riding through Manhattan and ushering in the holiday season. This year's parade features 17 giant, helium-filled character balloons, 22 floats, 15 novelty and heritage inflatables, 11 marching bands, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups, award-winning singers and actors, and the WNBA champion New York Liberty. One new float will spotlight the Rao’s food brand, featuring a knight and a dragon in battle made with actual pasta elements. Another will celebrate the Bronx Zoo’s 125th anniversary with representations of a tiger, a giraffe, a zebra and a gorilla. 'The work that we do, the opportunity to impact millions of people and bring a bit of joy for a couple of hours on Thanksgiving morning, is what motivates us every day,' said Will Coss, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade executive producer. The parade begins at 8:30 a.m. on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and ends 4 kilometers away around noon at Macy’s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, which serves as a stage and backdrop for performances. It'll happen rain or shine — the parade has only been canceled three times, from 1942 to 1944 during World War II — but organizers will be monitoring wind speeds throughout the festivities to make sure it's safe for the big balloons to fly. So far, the forecast calls for rain with temperatures in the upper-40s and winds around 16 kph, well within the acceptable range for letting Snoopy, Bluey and their friends soar. New York City law prohibits Macy’s from flying the full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed 37 kph or wind gusts are over 56 kph. The parade airs on NBC with hosts Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker and streams on the network's Peacock service. Carlos Adyan and Andrea Meza will host a Spanish simulcast on Telemundo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macy-s-thanksgiving-day-parade-kicks-off-a-century-after-its-first-trip-through-manhattan-/7879977.html	2024-11-28T03:27:35-08:00	
Israel says ceasefire with Hezbollah violated, fires on south Lebanon	BEIRUT — Israeli tank fire hit six areas in southern Lebanon on Thursday and the Israeli military said its ceasefire with Hezbollah was breached after what it called suspects, some in vehicles, arrived at several areas in the southern zone. A ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah took effect Wednesday under a deal brokered by the U.S. and France, intended to allow people in both countries to start returning to homes in border areas shattered by 14 months of fighting. The Israeli military had urged residents of towns along the border strip not to return yet for their own safety. On Thursday morning, Israeli tank fire hit six areas within that border strip, state media and Lebanese security sources said. The rounds struck Markaba, Wazzani and Kfarchouba, Khiyam, Taybe and the agricultural plains around Marjayoun, all of which lie within 2 kilometers of the Blue Line demarcating the border between Lebanon and Israel. One of the security sources said two people were wounded in Markaba. Lebanese families displaced from their homes near the southern border have tried to return to check on their properties. But Israeli troops remain stationed within Lebanese territory in towns along the border and Reuters reporters heard surveillance drones flying over parts of southern Lebanon. There was no immediate comment on the tank rounds from Hezbollah or Israel, who had been fighting for over a year in parallel with the Gaza war. The agreement, a rare diplomatic feat in a region racked by conflict, ended the deadliest confrontation between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group in years. But Israel is still fighting its other arch foe, the Palestinian militant group Hamas, in the Gaza Strip. Hamas in and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Under the ceasefire terms, Israeli forces can take up to 60 days to withdraw from southern Lebanon but neither side can launch offensive operations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had instructed the military not to allow residents back to villages near the border. Lebanon's speaker of parliament Nabih Berri, the top interlocutor for Lebanon in negotiating the deal, had said on Wednesday that residents could return home. Hezbollah has said its fighters 'remain fully equipped to deal with the aspirations and assaults of the Israeli enemy.' Its forces will monitor Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon 'with their hands on the trigger.' The group has been weakened by casualties and the killing of its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and other commanders by Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-ceasefire-with-hezbollah-violated-fires-on-south-lebanon/7879959.html	2024-11-28T02:44:34-08:00	
Palestinian president names interim successor if he has to leave post	RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has named a temporary successor who would take over from him should he die or leave his post, addressing concerns of a possible power vacuum following his departure. In a statement released late on Wednesday, Abbas said the chairman of the Palestinian National Council should serve as interim president for no more than 90 days, during which presidential elections should be held. The current chairman of the Palestinians' top decision-making body is Rawhi Fattouh, 75, who also served briefly as a stop-gap leader following the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004. Abbas, 89, has been Palestinian president since 2005 and has had regular health problems in recent years, prompting repeated speculation on who might replace him when he finally stands aside. He does not have a deputy and a source told Reuters earlier this month that Saudi Arabia had pressed him to appoint one. Wednesday's announcement clears up uncertainty over what should happen when he dies, but Fattouh was not named as his deputy, meaning there was still no visibility on who might replace Abbas in the long term. Israel's Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter, a member of the inner security cabinet, told a group of foreign reporters this week that the Israeli army would take over the West Bank if someone from the militant group Hamas tried to become president. Abbas was elected to a four-year term in 2005, but no presidential ballot has been held since and he is now deeply unpopular, with a September opinion poll showing 89% of Palestinians in the West Bank wanted him to resign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-president-names-interim-successor-if-he-has-to-leave-post/7879956.html	2024-11-28T02:36:45-08:00	
China-Cambodia effort nets 240 Chinese suspects in anti-fraud campaign	BEIJING — China repatriated 240 arrested Chinese gambling and fraud suspects from Cambodia on Thursday, with some 500 more expected to be escorted back, Chinese state media said, as Beijing stepped up a years-long effort to combat Chinese organized crime in Southeast Asia. The arrested group constituted the second batch China has chartered planes to repatriate from Cambodia after a first round in April when more than 680 were escorted back, China's national television broadcaster CCTV reported. As part of efforts to stem cross-border online gambling and fraud carried out through telecom networks, China periodically has partnered with neighbors such as Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines to nab Chinese suspects and have them brought back to China. The latest deportation follows a week after China and Myanmar dismantled large telecom fraud centers in northern Myanmar, with over 53,000 Chinese nationals arrested since a campaign to combat such fraud began last year. In September, China and Cambodia strengthened their cooperation against gambling and fraud, signing agreements to enhance law enforcement collaboration and fight Chinese organized crime in the Southeast Asian country. In 2019, Cambodia banned online gambling, targeting particularly Chinese-run operations that had sprung up in the southern coastal city of Sihanoukville. 'The public security authorities will continue to deepen law enforcement cooperation with relevant countries and regions, carry out focused crackdowns, resolutely dismantle gambling and fraud dens involving Chinese nationals, and firmly curb the high incidence of such crimes,' CCTV said. China has repatriated thousands of suspects under its covert global 'Operation Fox Hunt' operation launched a decade ago to fight corruption and economic crimes and has since recovered billions of dollars in assets, CCTV said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-cambodia-effort-nets-240-chinese-suspects-in-anti-fraud-campaign/7879952.html	2024-11-28T02:27:00-08:00	
Russian strikes pound energy infrastructure	Russian drones and missiles pounded Ukrainian energy infrastructure Thursday, cutting off power to more than 1 million people across the country, Ukrainian authorities said. 'As of now, 523,000 subscribers in the Lviv region are without electricity,' regional head Maksym Kozytsky said on social media. The region, in the western part of the country, borders Poland. Directly north of the Lviv region, 215,000 customers lost power in the region of Volyn, and in the neighboring Rivne region, governor Oleksandr Koval said 280,000 consumers were without power. 'Energy infrastructure is once again targeted by the enemy's massive strike,' Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote on Facebook. Ukrenergo, the national electrical grid operator, introduced emergency power cuts amid the attack, Galushchenko said. Officials told Reuters that several nuclear power units were disconnected from the network during the attacks. Private power company DTEK said the power cuts impacted Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions. Some regional officials said water service also was affected by the airstrikes. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andrii Yermak, said in a Telegram post that Russia had stockpiled missiles to strike Ukrainian infrastructure and wage war against civilians during the cold season, The Associated Press reported. Information from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters was used in the report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-strikes-pound-energy-infrastructure/7879948.html	2024-11-28T02:08:12-08:00	
Analysts say Vietnamese decree deepens control over social media	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — A Vietnamese decree taking effect at end of December that increases requirements on social media platforms in the country to share user information is a continuation of Hanoi’s yearslong effort to control online activity, analysts and activists have told VOA. Decree 147, on the management, provision and use of internet services and information in cyberspace, promulgated earlier this month, will go into effect December 25. Along with adding regulations concerning online gaming, the decree says social media platforms operating in Vietnam must store user data locally, give user information to the government on demand, and take down what authorities consider illegal content within 24 hours. Users also will be required to use their phone number or ID before posting on sites including Facebook, the country's most popular social media platform, with more than 86 million users. Tran Anh Quan, a Vietnamese social activist living in exile, who asked that his location not be revealed, told VOA on November 22 that the new decree will make posting online more dangerous for those who wish to speak out. He said he believes the decree is aimed at dissidents who often post under pseudonyms. 'This decree is clearly aimed directly at Vietnamese social activists, democracy fighters and dissidents,' he wrote in Vietnamese over Telegram. 'Dissidents in Vietnam often use fake accounts, or do not verify their social media accounts, to avoid being fined by the police. But this decree requires users to verify their identities on social media. And those who express dissent will certainly be considered to have violated regulations for ‘bad’ or ‘anti-state’ content,' Quan wrote. A government official says the new decree will empower authorities to more efficiently oversee social media platforms in the country. Nguyen Tien Nam of the Communication Ministry's Cyber Security Department told state-run Vietnam Television that 'account identification helps authorities identify the real identity behind the account, providing good support for the investigation and handling of violations.' Phil Robertson, director of the nonprofit organization Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates, told VOA by email the same day that the decree will have a 'strong chilling effect on internet freedom.' 'Decree 147 will be an unmitigated disaster for freedom of expression and privacy rights for Vietnamese who use social media, especially when talking about anything that is remotely critical of the government,' he wrote. 'People will realize the government can use its surveillance capacity to immediately track what anyone says,' he added. Online policing Duy Hoang, executive director of the banned pro-democracy political party Viet Tan, told VOA that although the decree imposes new restrictions, Vietnamese authorities have been unveiling similar policies since social media took off in the country in the 2010s. 'It feels like déjà vu because ever since social media took off in Vietnam, the authorities have been trying to find ways to control it, to censor it, to expose users, and especially to limit social media,' he said by phone November 21. Along with putting its first cybersecurity law into effect in 2019, the government created Force 47 in 2017. Force 47 is a military cyber unit which is believed to have 10,000 members whose job is to push a pro-government agenda online and harass users who share views criticizing authorities or policies. Zachary Abuza, Southeast Asia expert and professor at the National War College in Washington, told VOA by phone November 22, that pro-government accounts using fake names will likely escape scrutiny under the new decree. 'It wants to end this cloak of anonymity,' Abuza said of the decree. 'But we also know that the government is going to abuse it, because a lot of those government accounts are trolls, so you know this is going to be applied unevenly.' Do Nguyen Mai Khoi, a Vietnamese singer and activist who has been living in the United States since leaving Vietnam for fear of arrest, told VOA that the new decree will enhance authorities’ ability to censor and jail dissidents. 'This decree only tightens freedom of speech in cyberspace and makes it easier for the government to control the internet, as they have been doing and continue to do,' she wrote over Signal on November 22. There are currently 180 jailed activists in Vietnam according to The 88 Project, a U.S.-based nonprofit advocating for human rights in Vietnam. A 2021 Amnesty International report said a growing proportion of prisoners of conscience in Vietnam are imprisoned because of online posts. According to the NGO, 41% of jailed dissidents were behind bars because of 'peaceful online speech.' 'Many people have been fined and imprisoned just because of their social media posts,' Mai Khoi said. Social platforms 'I'm sure that Meta, Google, and other social media will jump to obey any government orders for content takedowns, and in fact, they have been doing so for quite some time,' Robertson wrote. 'The days of internet company claims that they will resist unfair Vietnamese official demands are long over.' In a November 12 report, the international law firm Baker & McKenzie wrote that Decree 147 will significantly impact online platforms available in Vietnam. 'Given the complexity of this decree and to better prepare for the upcoming changes, companies are strongly encouraged to conduct risk and compliance gap assessments and legal analysis of the decree,' the report stated. Mai Khoi called on social media sites to adhere to their stated goals. 'I wanted to tell the social media companies that they should keep their promises to protect freedom of speech online, they shouldn’t follow the government’s requirements to violate privacy rights and human rights,' she wrote. Abuza, however, said that with such a large user base, social media companies have little incentive to push back against Vietnam's cyber laws. 'I just don't see Facebook, which sees Vietnam as such a lucrative market, being able to resist,' Abuza said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-say-vietnamese-decree-deepens-control-over-social-media/7879931.html	2024-11-28T01:36:10-08:00	
Wrongfully detained Americans return from China	Three U.S. citizens imprisoned by China were on their way home late Wednesday, U.S. officials said, culminating years of U.S. diplomatic efforts to free Americans Washington says were wrongfully detained by Beijing. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he spoke to Kai Li, Mark Swidan and John Leung 'as they traveled home to the United States just in time for Thanksgiving.' 'I told them how glad I was that they were in good health and that they’ll soon be reunited with their loved ones,' Blinken posted on X, formerly Twitter. The White House announced the release of the Americans on Wednesday. 'We are pleased to announce the release of Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and John Leung from detention in the People’s Republic of China,' a National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement. The development is a diplomatic win for President Joe Biden, who will be leaving office in January. With the men’s release, 'all of the wrongfully detained Americans' in China have been returned, the spokesperson added. Biden and his aides have raised the issue of the three Americans with Beijing repeatedly, according to U.S. officials. In his last in-person meeting on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru earlier this month, Biden also spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping to press for their return. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Thursday three Chinese nationals 'wrongfully imprisoned' by the United States had been returned to China. Mark Swidan had been held since 2012 and received the death sentence in 2019. He maintained his innocence. John Leung was sentenced last year to life in prison. A U.S. citizen who also holds permanent residency in Hong Kong, he was detained on April 15, 2021, by the local bureau of China’s counterintelligence agency in the southeastern city of Suzhou, according to The Associated Press. Kai Li, a naturalized U.S. citizen who owned an export business and worked in New York, was arrested after flying into Shanghai in September 2016. He was placed under surveillance, interrogated without a lawyer and accused of providing state secrets to the FBI. In 2018, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage, a charge that he has denied. The release comes just two months after China freed a Christian pastor from California, David Lin, who had been held since 2006. He was convicted of contract fraud. Revised travel warning On Wednesday, the State Department lowered its travel warning for China to 'reflect a shift to Level 2,' according to the department’s website. The current advisory warns travelers, 'Exercise increased caution when traveling to Mainland China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans.' The alert had previously been at Level 3, telling Americans they should 'reconsider travel' to China in part because of the 'risk of wrongful detention' of Americans.

India's parliament suspended temporarily after row over allegations against Adani group	NEW DELHI — Both houses of Indian parliament were suspended temporarily on Thursday within minutes of opening as opposition lawmakers disrupted proceedings for the third day this week seeking a discussion on allegations against the Adani Group. U.S. authorities have accused Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani and managing director of Adani Green, Vneet S. Jaain, of being part of a scheme to pay bribes of $265 million to secure Indian solar power supply contracts, and misleading U.S. investors during fund raises there. 'We want a discussion on this in parliament. It is going to be the third day that we are demanding a reply from the prime minister' on the Adani issue, Manickam Tagore, a lawmaker from the main opposition Congress party, which has been leading the protests against the business group, told news agency ANI. Many of India's opposition parties accuse Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of favoring Adani and blocking investigations against him in India, accusations both have denied. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who has been a vocal critic of Adani, said Gautam Adani, 62, should be arrested. While the government has not made any comment on the indictment, Modi's BJP has said it had no reason to defend Adani, adding that the party was not against industrialists and considered them partners in nation-building efforts. 'Let him defend himself,' BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said on Tuesday, adding that the law would take its course.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-parliament-suspended-temporarily-after-row-over-allegations-against-adani-group/7879890.html	2024-11-27T23:43:59-08:00	
Taiwan holds air defense drill ahead of president's Pacific trip	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan's military held an early morning air defense drill on Thursday to test its response and engagement procedures, ahead of a trip by President Lai Ching-te at the end of the week to the Pacific that will include U.S. stopovers. China is likely to launch military drills in the coming days near Taiwan, using Lai's upcoming trip to the Pacific and scheduled U.S. transit as a pretext, according to assessments by Taiwan and regional security officials. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and says Lai is a 'separatist.' Lai says only Taiwan's people can decide their future and has repeatedly offered talks with Beijing that have been rebuffed. Taiwan's air force command said in a statement that made no mention of Lai's overseas trip that for a two-hour period starting from 5 a.m. (2100 GMT Wednesday) aircraft, ships and missile systems were involved in an 'overall air defense battle plan exercise.' The drill was to 'strengthen the overall effectiveness of air defense operations and to test the response and engagement procedures of the air defense forces,' it added. 'In the face of changes in the enemy situation, we will continue to enhance defense resilience through various practical training to anticipate potential threats and challenges and ensure air defense security,' the command said. The defense ministry told Reuters separately that it was a regular drill carried out quarterly. Reuters correspondents in the northern Taipei suburbs reported seeing and hearing fighter jets in the skies as dawn broke. China has carried out two rounds of major war games around Taiwan so far this year, and on a daily basis flies aircraft and sends ships into the skies and waters around Taiwan. Taiwan has also complained of Chinese balloons flying near the island in what the government says is a pattern of harassment by Beijing. On Thursday, the ministry said the previous day it had spotted two Chinese balloons flying out at sea to the north of Taiwan, at distances of 111 kilometers and 163 kilometers from the port city of Keelung. Lai will leave on Saturday. A formal announcement of his U.S. stopovers could come as soon as Friday, according to sources. Late Wednesday, the presidential office said that if China were to use Lai's trip as an excuse to launch military exercises, 'it would be a blatant provocation of the status quo of peace and stability in the region.' The same day, China's government said such transit stops were 'essentially provocative acts that violate the one-China principle.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-holds-air-defense-drill-ahead-of-president-s-pacific-trip/7879882.html	2024-11-27T23:16:46-08:00	
In the Philippines, some progress for media rights, but risks remain	BANGKOK — Once the country with the worst record for securing justice in journalist killings, the Philippines is improving, say some experts. But more work is needed to protect reporters. When he assumed the presidency in 2022, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. pledged to 'support and protect the rights of the media.' In October 2022, he said, 'The nation counts on media in improving access to information and increasing awareness on issues that affect our country and the world.' In the past year, media analysts have seen some improvement. The suspected mastermind in a journalist killing from more than a decade ago was arrested; a court reversed an order forcing the media website Rappler to close; and earlier this month, Marcos appointed former journalist Joe Torres Jr. as head of the Presidential Task Force on Media Security. But outside the capital, community and radio journalists are at risk of threat or attack, experts say. Beh Lih Yi, head coordinator of the Asia program at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, said the media group was encouraged by some 'positive developments' but believes the Marcos government could do more. 'Although the president has repeatedly vowed support for a free press, he has not backed up this change in tone with concrete action and reforms to create a more liberal and safe media climate,' she told VOA via email. 'Journalists in the Philippines still routinely face harassment, legal threats, arbitrary detention and even murder in retaliation for their work,' she said. The Philippines Presidential Office has not responded to VOA’s email requesting comment. Carlos Conde, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch and a former journalist, sees some signs of optimism under Marcos. One of the biggest changes from conditions under his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, is that the Marcos administration is 'not confrontational at all in its public pronouncements about media and journalists,' Conde told VOA. 'That's kind of a major relief, and that's where the optimism comes from. And so, in that sense, it has improved,' he said. Under Duterte’s presidency from 2016 to 2022, he vilified journalists who were critical of his policies. Media were labeled fake news, and watchdogs documented dozens of incidents of attacks and threats against the press. At least 18 journalists were killed during his six-year presidency, according to CPJ data. Another issue for the country’s journalists is so-called 'red-tagging,' in which media and activists are accused — without evidence — by political figures, state security and others of being terrorists or communists. Those targeted are often people critical of government or political party policies. And being red tagged makes them a more prominent target for threats, harassment and violence, experts say. A report by Amnesty in October found the practice still happening under the new administration. Amnesty said the tactic has been used to target human rights activists, students and student journalists. Marcos has denied the government is involved in red tagging and said the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict — an agency alleged to be involved in the red-tagging operations — will not be closed. But Conde hopes red tagging will stop under Torres. He will head the Presidential Task Force on Media Security, a government agency set up to protect media workers and promote press freedom. When he was a journalist, Torres wrote for outlets including The Manila Times and spoke with Conde on a YouTube podcast earlier this month about red tagging. '[Torres] made a promise that the office will no longer be red-tagging journalists or accusing them of having communist links and things like that. So, that is definitely something,' Conde told VOA. Some progress too has been made in the cases of journalists killed for their work. In September, former Palawan Governor Joel T. Reyes surrendered to authorities over the killing of environmental journalist Gerry Ortega, who was shot and killed in 2011. At the time, he was investigating apparent corruption involving Reyes, according to media watchdog Reporters Without Borders. Reyes is the suspected mastermind. The trial, scheduled to start in November, has been welcomed by media groups. 'The Philippines persistently fares poorly in CPJ's Global Impunity Index, an annual ranking which lists countries where killers of journalists go free,' CPJ’s Beh said via email. The Philippines ranks ninth in the impunity index. With Ortega, said Beh, 'his family is still waiting for full justice more than 13 years later.' While some improvements are seen in the capital, Jonathan de Santos, chair of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, said that for radio and community journalists, the risks are high. 'There is a perception that the press freedom situation has improved, and maybe it has in Metro Manila, but journalists in the regions, especially those from community and alternative media, are still under threat,' he told VOA. 'Apart from the safety and security aspects, radio journalists have also historically not been paid well, which is an added risk for them. Radio is also where a lot of hard-hitting commentary is done, which puts radio journalists at risk of retaliation,' he added. In October, radio journalist Maria Vilma Rodriguez was shot and killed near her home in Zamboanga City on Mindanao island. Police say the suspect was a relative of Rodriguez who had a land dispute with the 56-year-old. The Philippines ranks 134 out of 180 countries on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-the-philippines-some-progress-for-media-rights-but-risks-remain/7879874.html	2024-11-27T22:59:59-08:00	
Thousands left queuing to vote in Namibia after scheduled polls close	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Logistical issues on Wednesday left thousands of Namibians waiting in queues to vote in pivotal presidential and legislative elections, some for up to 12 hours, with polling stations staying open hours later than planned. The vote could usher in the desert nation's first woman leader even as her party, the ruling South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) faces the strongest challenge yet to its 34-year grip on power. Some voters told AFP they queued all day, blaming technical problems that included issues with voter identification tablets and insufficient ballot papers. 'It's absolutely disappointing,' said Reagan Cooper, a 43-year-old farmer among the hundred or so voters outside the town hall polling station in the capital, Windhoek. 'The voters have turned out, but the electoral commission has failed us,' Cooper told AFP. In the face of criticism from all the political parties, including SWAPO, the Electoral Commission of Namibia extended voting hours for 'no specified time,' according to Windhoek region ECN head Rakondjerua Kavari. Voting was halted for an hour at the Windhoek town hall site due to a lack of ballots, with applause welcoming the delivery of more waking sleepy, seated voters around 11:30 p.m. The last voter there cast his ballot more than four hours after the scheduled closing time -- 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) -- and vote counting then began almost immediately. According to Namibia's electoral law, those in queues before polls are scheduled to close should be allowed to vote. Petrus Shaama, chief officer of the ECN, said it was obligated to ensure voters could cast a ballot. But the main opposition party, the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), blamed the ECN for the long lines and cried foul play. 'We have reason to believe that the ECN is deliberately suppressing voters and deliberately trying to frustrate voters from casting their vote,' said Christine Aochamus of the IPC. Armed with folding chairs and umbrellas to cope with the slow-moving lines and blazing sun, many Namibians spent half the day waiting to vote. At one polling station inside the University of Science and Technology in Windhoek, hundreds of people were still in line at 9:00 pm despite some having arrived at 6 a.m., an hour before polls opened. Polling site managers told AFP that problems with tablets used to check voters' identities using fingerprints included untimely updates, overheating and dead batteries. Unemployment SWAPO's candidate and current vice president, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, was one of the first to vote and called on Namibians 'to come out in their numbers.' An estimated 1.5 million people in the sparsely populated nation were registered to vote. SWAPO has governed since leading mineral-rich Namibia to independence from South Africa in 1990 but complaints about unemployment and enduring inequalities could force Nandi-Ndaitwah into an unprecedented second round. IPC leader Panduleni Itula, a former dentist and lawyer, said Wednesday he was optimistic he could 'unseat the revolutionary movement.' Itula, 67, took 29% of votes in the 2019 elections, losing to SWAPO leader Hage Geingob with 56%. It was a remarkable performance considering Geingob, who died in February, had won almost 87% five years before that. Namibia is a major uranium and diamond exporter but not many of its nearly 3 million people have benefitted from that wealth. 'There's a lot of mining activity that goes on in the country, but it doesn't really translate into improved infrastructure, job opportunities,' said independent political analyst Marisa Lourenco, based in Johannesburg. 'That's where a lot of the frustration is coming from, (especially) the youth,' she said. Unemployment among 15- to 34-year-olds is estimated at 46%, according to the latest figures from 2018, almost triple the national average. First-time voter and environmental health student Sophia Varela, 24, told AFP she was 'hoping for change' and 'jobs for the youth.' Second round For the first time in Namibia's recent history, analysts say a second voting round is a somewhat realistic option. That would take place within 60 days of the announcement of the first round of results due by Saturday. 'The outcome will be tight,' said self-employed Hendry Amupanda, 32, who queued since 9 p.m. the night before to cast his ballot. 'I want the country to get better and people to get jobs,' said Amupanda, wearing slippers and equipped with a chair, blanket and snacks. Marvyn Pescha, a self-employed consultant, said his father was part of SWAPO's liberation struggle and he was not going to abandon the party. 'But I want SWAPO to be challenged for better policies. Some opportunistic leaders have tarnished the reputation of the party, they misuse it for self-enrichment,' the 50-year-old said. While lauded for leading Namibia to independence, SWAPO is nervous about its standing after other liberation-era movements in the region have lost favor with young voters. In the past six months, South Africa's African National Congress lost its parliamentary majority and the Botswana Democratic Party was ousted after almost six decades in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-left-queuing-to-vote-in-namibia-after-scheduled-polls-close/7879872.html	2024-11-27T22:32:47-08:00	
Biggest November snowstorm in 52 years hits Seoul, grounds flights	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The biggest November snowstorm to hit South Korea's capital in more than a half century blanketed the capital Wednesday, grounding hundreds of flights, disrupting commuter traffic and leaving at least two dead. South Korea's weather agency said 20 to 26 centimeters of snow fell in northern areas of Seoul and nearby areas. The agency said it was the heaviest snowstorm Seoul has experienced in November in 52 years. A storm on November 28, 1972, dumped 12 centimeters. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said one person died and four others were injured in a five-vehicle accident in the eastern town of Hongcheon. In the town of Yangju, a tent-type garage collapsed and killed a person who was removing snow, according to South Korea's Ministry of the Interior and Safety. The snow caused temporary power outages at about 230 homes in the city of Gwangju, near Seoul, according to the Gyeonggi provincial government. The storm blanketed much of the country, with the central, eastern and southwestern regions recording about 10 to 28 centimeters of cover. At least 317 flights were canceled or delayed at airports nationwide, while authorities ordered around 90 ferries to remain at port. They also shut down hundreds of hiking trails. Icy road conditions slowed down the morning commute in Seoul and led to massive crowds at subways, causing delays. Emergency workers across the country responded to fallen trees, road signs and other safety risks. Officials at the Safety Ministry said they couldn't confirm any school closures as of Wednesday afternoon. Visitors dressed in traditional hanbok garb were busy taking photographs at Seoul's snow-covered medieval palaces while snowmen popped up in playgrounds and schoolyards across the country. The weather agency said snow will continue in most parts of the country until noon Thursday. President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed the safety and transport ministries to mobilize all available relevant personnel and equipment to prevent traffic and other accidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biggest-november-snowstorm-in-52-years-hits-seoul-grounds-flights/7879866.html	2024-11-27T22:18:51-08:00	
Iran to hold nuclear talks with 3 European powers	Tehran, Iran — Iran is set to meet on Friday with France, Germany and the United Kingdom for talks on its nuclear program after the three governments joined with the United States to have Tehran censured by the U.N. atomic watchdog. Last week's chiding prompted a defiant response from Tehran, but its officials have since signaled willingness to engage with other parties ahead of the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose last administration pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against the Islamic republic. Iranian diplomat Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who serves as the political deputy to Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, is scheduled to represent Iran in the talks on Friday. He will meet beforehand with Enrique Mora, deputy secretary general of the EU's foreign affairs arm, according to the IRNA state news agency. Last week, the 35-nation board of governors of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted a resolution condemning Iran for its lack of cooperation on nuclear issues. The resolution was brought by France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, and was actively opposed by Tehran. In response, Iran announced the launch of 'new advanced centrifuges' designed to increase its stockpile of enriched uranium. Tehran's willingness to sit down with the three European countries so soon after the censure comes just weeks before Trump is set to return to the White House in January. During his first term, Trump focused on imposing heavy sanctions on Iran following the United States' unilateral withdrawal from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal three years after it was established. That agreement between Tehran and major powers aimed to give Iran relief from crippling Western sanctions in exchange for limiting its nuclear program to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. In retaliation for the U.S. withdrawal, Tehran has reduced its compliance with the deal, raising its uranium enrichment levels to 60% -- close to the 90% required for a nuclear bomb. Tehran has consistently denied any intentions of pursuing nuclear weapons. For Tehran, the goal of the talks on Friday is to avoid a 'double disaster' scenario, in which it would face renewed pressures from both Trump and European nations, according to political analyst Mostafa Shirmohammadi. He noted that Iran's support among European nations had been eroded by allegations it offered military assistance for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied these accusations and hopes to mend relations with Europe, while also maintaining a firm stance. 'Legal obligations' The IAEA's censure resolution urged Iran to 'fulfil its legal obligations' under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) ratified in 1970, which requires member states to declare and maintain their nuclear materials under IAEA supervision. In response, Foreign Minister Araghchi, who was instrumental in the nuclear negotiations in 2015, said Iran was commissioning 'several thousand advanced centrifuges.' The head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Mohammad Eslami, said Wednesday that they had begun inserting gas into the centrifuges. Centrifuges work by rapidly spinning uranium gas to increase the proportion of the fissile isotope U-235. Iran insists on its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but according to the IAEA, it is the only non-nuclear-weapon state enriching uranium to 60%. Under the 2015 accord -- which will expire in October 2025 -- Iran's enrichment was capped at 3.67%. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final authority in Iran's decision-making, has issued a religious decree, or fatwa, prohibiting the use of atomic weapons. Iran's nuclear program dates back to the late 1950s when the United States, then an ally, signed a civil cooperation agreement with Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-to-hold-nuclear-talks-with-3-european-powers/7879864.html	2024-11-27T22:03:32-08:00	
Former US diplomat discusses Trump’s Africa policy and more	WASHINGTON — As President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term as president of the United States, questions arise about what this means for U.S.-Africa relations. In this interview with VOA English to Africa’s Paul Ndiho, Tibor Nagy, the former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, shares insights into the administration's past approach. Nagy shares his perspective on U.S. competition with China and Russia, trade policies, including the extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, commonly known as AGOA, which provides eligible sub-Saharan African countries with duty-free access to U.S. markets and the ongoing crises in the Sahel and other regions on the continent. This interview, which aired on VOA’s Africa 54 TV program on November 27, from VOA headquarters in Washington, D.C., has been edited for clarity and brevity. Paul Ndiho: As the former top diplomat for African affairs, what should we expect when it comes to President-elect Donald Trump’s second term for Africa? Tibor Nagy: I’m very optimistic. I don’t think people should worry about the slogan 'America First' because that doesn’t mean 'America only.' There are many areas where interests between the U.S. and Africa intersect. China, we very much see as a long-term existential threat, and so I think we’ll be a little bit more honest in saying that part of our Africa relations is about China. Then there’s the very important issue of critical minerals. Why should China monopolize all the critical minerals in Africa when it would do much better if Western, i.e., American companies were also involved? So, I think Africans should be optimistic — I think they’ll have a lot more deals and a lot fewer lectures. VOA: Many argue that China and Russia have an edge over the U.S. in Africa. What can the incoming Trump administration do better to compete with those two countries? Nagy: I think you would agree that what Africans want more than anything else, especially young Africans, and everyone knows that there are millions and millions and millions of young Africans, are jobs. Frankly, yes, China has done an awful lot of infrastructure projects, but how many jobs did the African young people get out of that? I think the truth is that American and Western types of investments, do lead to the kind of jobs that young Africans are looking for. And I think that will be a successful foreign policy. And I think that that will be the true kind of win-win for both sides. VOA: President-elect Trump is proposing a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the United States, obviously with AGOA, Africans are supposed to bring goods to the United States free of tariffs. What should we expect? Nagy: What we should expect is to see what happens, aside from during campaigns, a lot of things are said, and then what the actual policy is might be a little bit different. I mean, AGOA is a law passed by Congress and I’m sure that the United States of America will comply with that law. And as you also well know that law will be going out soon and everybody’s kind of looking forward and wondering what kind of a new AGOA there will be. VOA: How about the issue of the Sahel? There is a crisis in the Sahel. There are wars in Sudan, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. How can the incoming Trump administration do better on this front? Nagy: The 'three Cs' — crises, conflicts, and coups — have been really horrible. Again, here, U.S. engagement needs to be different. Lecturing, for example, the military government in Niger, I think had a lot to do with us being kicked out of some very valuable air bases that where we had agreements with and the whole issue of coups, I think it’s important for the United States to look at coups individually. When a coup happens and we say it’s a coup, then we have to cut certain ties and engagements. What we do is we call some coups, coups, and other coups, not coups, as it happened, for example, in Gabon, we didn’t call it a coup. We just need to be a little bit more honest and say we really need to be much more flexible in how we engage with those governments because often the military government really needs engagement more to kind of help them see the way forward, especially those that are very popular with the people when they happen. VOA: What would you do differently if you got your old job back? Nagy: I’m not looking to get my old job back because being Assistant Secretary once — is enough. I would look differently to be a little bit less hypocritical, to drop the megaphone, to engage with African governments where they are, not where we want them to be, and to see the world as it is and especially put so much more energy into Sudan, Ethiopia, Sahel, those kinds of conflicts. This Q&A originated in VOA’s English to Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-diplomat-discusses-trump-s-africa-policy-and-more/7879852.html	2024-11-27T20:37:06-08:00	
Zimbabwe court frees opposition leader, followers after suspending their sentences	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — A Zimbabwe court late Wednesday sentenced the interim leader of the country's main opposition party to two years in jail - then suspended his sentence and the sentences of 34 of his supporters. Magistrate Collet Ncube sentenced Citizens Coalition for Change leader Jameson Timba and supporter Jaison Kautsa to two years imprisonment, while the other 33 opposition party members got lesser sentences for participating in an unlawful gathering on June 16. All were set to be released from prison. They were among the first of about 160 opposition figures and activists to be rounded up before a July summit of the 16-nation Southern African Development Community in Harare. The charges were gathering with the intent to promote violence, breaches of peace or bigotry. A statement from the National Prosecuting Authority confirmed the sentences and went on to say they were 'wholly suspended for five years on condition that the accused do not commit an offense involving unlawful gathering with intent to promote public violence for which they will be sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine.' Takunda Jacob from Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights – which has been representing group members – told reporters waiting outside the court that one of his clients from the group would remain in custody while she is treated for wounds suffered during the arrest. He said it will be determined next month if the woman, who has a broken leg, is fit to stand trial. Jacob said she could be in custody until December 14. He said he was not pleased about the judgment. 'We await further instructions from clients, if they wish that we appeal against the judgment, we'll proudly do so because we are not with judgment,' Jacob said. That view is shared by Daniel Molokele, a human rights lawyer and an opposition legislator, who is urging that democratic space and tolerance be provided for the opposition. 'It is indeed a very sad day, because what we have are people who are expressing their political rights, and they get criminalized,' Molokele said. 'I pray and hope that they will appeal, against the sentence, against the conviction. As things stand, we have criminalized the political space, we have criminalized the democratic space, there is no freedom in Zimbabwe.' Student activist Makomborero Haruzivishe said the conviction of former senator Timba shows a lack of democracy in Zimbabwe. 'It's a conviction on Zimbabwe’s collective political conscience, it's a conviction of Zimbabwe’s justice system. Senator Timba was arrested for offering young people his private residence, home, a place to come and commemorate the Day of the African Child,' Haruzivishe said. 'The Day of the African Child came about when the apartheid, colonial regime in South Africa, massacred multitudes of young people, school-going children, African youths, South African youths.' Zimbabwe’s information minister Jenfan Muswere could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. Initially police arrested about 100 opposition activists at Timba’s home in June while commemorating the Day of the African Child, and some were released for reasons that remain unclear. President Emmerson Mnangagwa's ZANU-PF party has been in power since independence in 1980 and is frequently accused of suppressing any dissent. Since coming to power in 2017, however, Mnangagwa has consistently said that he respects human rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-court-frees-opposition-leader-followers-after-suspending-their-sentences/7879827.html	2024-11-27T20:30:21-08:00	
HIV activist to use Charlize Theron's Instagram for a day	Geneva, Switzerland — A young South African activist living with HIV will take over Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron's Instagram account on World AIDS Day, the United Nations said Thursday. Ibanomonde Ngema, a 21-year-old activist, will be given the reins to the South African-born actress's global account @charlizeafrica, with some 7.6 million followers, on December 1, UNAIDS said in a statement. The takeover by Ngema, who was born with HIV and has dedicated her advocacy work to dispelling myths and reducing stigma around HIV, will aim to bring awareness to the first-hand experiences of young people living with HIV, it said. Theron, a so-called UN Messenger of Peace who has long advocated for tackling the systemic inequalities that drive HIV infections among young women and girls, insisted in the statement that 'ending AIDS is within reach.' But, she warned, 'only if we completely dismantle harmful patterns of stigma and discrimination through laws, policies, and practices that protect people living with HIV.' Theron won a best actress Oscar for her lead role in the 2004 film 'Monster' and has more recently starred in pictures such as 'Mad Max: Fury Road.' 'I have always loved watching Charlize Theron on the big screen and have long been inspired by her using her influence to help people around the world, especially in our home country of South Africa,' Ngema said in the statement. The announcement came after UNAIDS this week released a new report that showed how rights violations exacerbate the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV. Last year, women and girls accounted for 62% of all new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa, UNAIDS said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hiv-activist-to-use-charlize-theron-s-instagram-for-a-day/7879835.html	2024-11-27T18:58:52-08:00	
Trump seeks to have civil fraud ruling quashed	NEW YORK — Donald Trump has sought to have a civil judgment against him for fraud and a $464 million penalty set aside 'for the greater good of the country' as he prepares to return to power. Trump's lawyers filed a letter Tuesday with New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought the proceeding against the president-elect for manipulating his assets when applying for loans and insurances. Judge Arthur Engoron ruled against Trump in February, going on to order the mogul-turned-politician pay $464 million, including interest, while his sons Eric and Don Jr. were told to hand over more than $4 million each. Trump subsequently sought to challenge the civil ruling as well as the scale and terms of the penalty, which has continued to accrue interest while he appeals. 'We write to request that you completely dismiss the above-referenced case against President Donald J. Trump, his family, and his businesses, and stipulate to vacate the Judgment and dismiss all claims with prejudice,' said the letter from attorney John Sauer, Trump's nominee for solicitor general. 'In the aftermath of his historic election victory, President Trump has called for our Nation's partisan strife to end, and for the contending factions to join forces for the greater good of the country. 'This call for unity extends to the legal onslaught against him.' In the letter, reported by U.S. media, Sauer pointed to recent moves to end or suspend proceedings in several of the criminal cases that Trump had faced. 'This case warrants the same treatment. As detailed in our appellate briefing, this action exceeds the New York Attorney General's authority under Executive Law ... the dismissal of the case would restore (her) power to its more legitimate scope,' the letter said. Sauer suggested that if James does not dismiss the case outright, he might seek to argue that the case is unconstitutional, as it interferes with Trump's role as president. Sauer did not respond to an AFP request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-seeks-to-have-civil-fraud-ruling-quashed/7879830.html	2024-11-27T18:55:39-08:00	
New missile plan by US-Japan eyes Chinese invasion of Taiwan	WASHINGTON — A U.S. plan to deploy sophisticated missiles on a Japanese island chain close to Taiwan is prompting angry responses from both China and its close ally Russia. The United States is drawing up a joint military plan with Japan to deploy High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and other weapons to Japan’s Nansei islands, according to a Sunday report by Kyodo News, which cited unnamed sources. The plan is expected to be completed by December. The island chain stretches from Japan’s main islands to within 200 kilometers of Taiwan and includes Okinawa,which has a major U.S. military presence. The U.S. could use the missiles to defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion of the self-ruled island, which Beijing claims as a renegade province. The plan, the first joint operation by the U.S. and Japan to prepare for a war between Taiwan and China, will involve sending a U.S. Marine Corps regiment that possesses HIMARS and setting up temporary bases on the Nansai islands to station them, said Kyodo. The Japan Self-Defense Forces would be expected to provide logistic support, including fuel and ammunition. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson criticized the reported plan at a press conference on Monday, saying, 'China opposes relevant countries using the Taiwan question as an excuse to strengthen military deployment in the region, heighten tensions and confrontation, and disturb regional peace and stability.' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova responded with a stronger statement, warning that her country would respond to the deployment with 'necessary and proportionate steps' to strengthen its defense capabilities, according to the Russian news agency Tass on Wednesday. 'We have repeatedly warned the Japanese side that if, as a result of such cooperation, U.S. medium-range missiles emerge on its territory, this will pose a real threat to the security of our country,' Zakharova said. Tass also quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov urging Washington to reconsider the deployment of missiles to the Asia-Pacific. He warned that Moscow will not rule out stationing shorter- and intermediate-range missiles in Asia in response to the U.S. deployment. Earlier in November, Russian President Vladimir Putin said China is Russia’s ally and 'Taiwan is part of China,' and that China conducting wargames near the island is 'a completely reasonable policy' while Taipei is escalating tensions. While Russia and China have no formal military treaty, Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have spoken of having a 'no limits' partnership, and the United States accuses China of supporting Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine. U.S. Secretary Antony Blinken said at a press conference held at the G7 meeting in Italy on Tuesday that China’s support for Russia’s defense industry is 'allowing Russia to continue the aggression against Ukraine.' US-Japan missile plan Despite Moscow’s alarming rhetoric, analysts say the deployment of HIMARS to the region is primarily aimed at protecting Taiwan from Chinese warships. 'The most important purpose of HIMARS' would be 'an anti-ship capability' and to 'protect the island and base itself,' said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said last week at a forum held by the Brookings Institution that China this past summer conducted its largest rehearsal to date for an invasion of Taiwan involving 152 vessels. He cautioned that the U.S. 'must be ready.' The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy possesses the world’s largest naval force with over 370 ships and submarines while the U.S. has about 290 vessels. Eye on Chinese invasion Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at the RAND Corp., said HIMARS on the Nansei islands 'could help sink amphibious landing ships as well as destroyers and other PLA Navy ships that might approach the island from the north' and also 'target concentrations of PLA troops on beaches near Taipei.' Heath continued, 'The fielding of these weapons systems shows that the U.S. and its allies are learning lessons from the Ukraine theater, where HIMARS have been effectively deployed against Russia.' The U.S. is also planning to deploy the Multi-Domain Task Force’s (MDTS) long-range firing units to the Philippines, said Kyodo news on Sunday. The MDTS uses HIMARS as long-range firing units. 'The deployment of HIMARS to Nansei islands and long-range firing units to the Philippines will impose greater costs on China,' said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, an associate professor at Tokyo International University Institute for International Strategy and a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Indo-Pacific Security Initiative. 'Both locations are vital to deter China’s aggressive moves in not only the Taiwan Strait and East China Seas, but also Beijing’s ambitions in the Pacific. Still, one can expect China to do more to outdo such measures by enhancing their military readiness and conducting more assertive activities in the coming years,' he said. Taiwan and the Philippines, as well as Japan and Indonesia, make up what China calls the first island chain potentially blocking its military access to the Pacific. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin concluded a nine-day trip to the Indo-Pacific on Monday after a series of meetings with the defense heads of countries in the region, including Japan, the Philippines, Australia and South Korea. At the meetings, Japan agreed to increase its participation in annual trilateral amphibious training with the U.S. and Australia. The Philippines agreed to share military intelligence by signing a General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-missile-plan-by-us-japan-eyes-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-/7879818.html	2024-11-27T18:07:39-08:00	
Mexico, Canada warn Trump against raising tariffs	MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday that Mexico would retaliate if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump followed through with his proposed 25% across-the-board tariff, a move her government warned could kill 400,000 U.S. jobs and drive up prices for U.S. consumers. 'If there are U.S. tariffs, Mexico would also raise tariffs,' Sheinbaum said during a news conference, in her clearest statement yet that the country was preparing possible retaliatory trade measures against its top trade partner. Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard, speaking alongside Sheinbaum, called for more regional cooperation and integration instead of a war of retaliatory import taxes. 'It's a shot in the foot,' Ebrard said of Trump's proposed tariffs, which appear to violate the USMCA trade deal between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. Ebrard warned the tariffs would lead to massive U.S. job losses, lower growth, and hit U.S. companies producing in Mexico by effectively doubling the taxes they paid. 'The impact on companies is huge,' he said. The proposed tariffs would hit the automotive sector's top cross-border exporters especially hard, Ebrard added, namely Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Mexico's automotive industry is the country's most important manufacturing sector, exporting predominantly to the United States. It represents nearly 25% of all North American vehicle production. Analysts at Barclays said they estimate the proposed tariffs 'could wipe out effectively all profits' from the Detroit Three automakers. Gas prices Canada is also looking at a coordinated response with the federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces agreeing to work in a united way against a threat by Trump, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said Wednesday. One area affected by the proposed tariffs is Canada’s oil sector. Even as record oil output has made the U.S. the world's largest producer in recent years, more than a fifth of the oil processed by U.S. refiners is imported from Canada. In the landlocked U.S. Midwest, where refineries process 70% of the more than 4 million barrels per day of Canadian crude imports, consumers could see pump prices jump by 30 cents per gallon or more, or about 10%, based on current prices, GasBuddy analyst Patrick De Haan said. Migration and the border Sheinbaum and Trump spoke by phone later on Wednesday, the Mexican president said on social media platform X, adding the two discussed 'strengthening collaboration on security issues' and that the conversation was 'excellent.' In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Sheinbaum 'agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.' He described the conversation as 'very productive.' Sheinbaum's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Trump has previously said the tariffs would remain in effect until the flow of drugs -- particularly fentanyl -- and migrants into the U.S. was controlled. Sheinbaum added migrant caravans are no longer arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border 'because they are attended to' in Mexico. A caravan of several thousand migrants had been heading through southern Mexico but numbers have dwindled in recent days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-canada-warn-trump-against-raising-tariffs/7879812.html	2024-11-27T18:01:17-08:00	
Moldova says end of Russian gas for Transdniestria 'very realistic' scenario	CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — The termination of Russian gas supplies to Moldova's breakaway region of Transdniestria after January 1, 2025, is a 'very realistic' scenario, Energy Minister Victor Parlicov said on Wednesday after talks with Russia's Gazprom. Parliсov spoke with the head of Gazprom on Monday to discuss alternate routes to supply Transdniestria if transit through Ukraine stops. The current gas-transit agreement between Ukraine and Russia ends on December 31 and Ukraine has said it will not extend it. The unrecognized, Russian-backed Transdniestria region depends heavily on Russian natural gas supplied via Ukraine. Parliсov told a press conference in Chisinau that Gazprom was ready to supply gas to Transdniestria via the current route, but that it was up to Moldova and Ukraine to agree on transit. 'From discussions with my Ukrainian colleagues, I understand that if there is a decision to continue transit, it may be taken at the last moment,' Parlicov said. Moldova receives about 2 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia through Ukraine and since 2022, Transdniestria and Chisinau have agreed that all Russian gas received by Moldova will go to the breakaway region. Transdniestria has a large power plant fueled by Russian gas and Chisinau, in turn, buys electricity from the region at a relatively low fixed price. Parlicov, speaking later on Moldovan TV8 television, said he felt during his talks in St. Petersburg that Russia was less forthright in its commitment to supporting Transdniestria, which it has backed since the collapse of Soviet rule in the 1990s. 'This is already not a taboo subject like it was before,' he said. As an example, he said, Transdniestria's steel mill, a key exporter, had been left virtually unable to operate after a Russian attack on a power substation in southern Ukraine. He acknowledged that if gas supplies were cut to Transdniestria, the region would need financial help to survive and avoid a humanitarian catastrophe. Possible alternative Moldova has said that if Ukraine ends the transit of Russian gas, an alternative for Transdniestria could be gas supplied by the TurkStream pipeline to Turkey and then through Bulgaria and Romania. However, Parlicov told the briefing that Gazprom in the talks had linked continued deliveries via alternate routes to its demands that Moldova pay a debt on past supplies, which according to Russian calculations stands at $709 million. Moldova has said its debt is $8.6 million. 'We believe that it's incorrect to link the debt problems with supplies (to Transdniestria),' Parliсov said. He said that supplies via both Ukraine and alternative routes could stop on January 1 and then Chisinau would need international support to pay for gas from other sources. Gazprom has not commented on the meeting with Moldova's minister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldova-says-end-of-russian-gas-for-transdniestria-very-realistic-scenario/7879803.html	2024-11-27T17:58:43-08:00
